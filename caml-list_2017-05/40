Subject: [Caml-list] TFPIE - Trends in Functional Programming in Education
 2017 - Deadline extended to 17 May

After a number of requests, we have extended the deadline for TFPIE 2017 to=
 17 May. Please consider submitting if you=E2=80=99re interested in hearing=
 about how to get the functional message shared more widely.

A particular topic of this year's TFPIE will be MOOCs and other online lear=
ning and, as well as a session on this, we're delighted to announce that He=
ather Miller of EFPL and Northeastern University will be giving a keynote o=
n this topic. Heather works on and around the Scala programming language an=
d is Executive Director of the Scala Center. We'll also have Yann Regis-Gia=
nas and Benjamin Canou from the OCaml MOOC team, Jeremy Singer (Haskell), a=
nd Simon Thompson (Erlang).



TFPIE 2017 - DEADLINE EXTENDED TO 17 MAY

Trends in Functional Programming in Education, 2017

https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TFPIE2017/


The sixth workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Education, 2017, =
which is to be held on the Canterbury campus of the University of Kent on T=
hursday, 22 June, following the 2017 TFP meeting on 19=E2=80=9321 June. TFP=
IE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012), Prov=
o Utah, USA (2013), Soesterberg, The Netherlands (2014), and Sophia-Antipol=
is, France (2015), College Park, USA (2016).

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that=
 use, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education.=
 TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and wor=
k-in-progress on the use of functional programming in education are discuss=
ed. The one-day workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having =
a review process for publication after the workshop. The program chair of T=
FPIE 2017 will screen submissions to ensure that all presentations are with=
in scope and are of interest to participants. After the workshop, presenter=
s will be invited to submit revised versions of their articles for publicat=
ion in the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (=
EPTCS).=20

Final call for papers

TFPIE 2017 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom=
, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of =
functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science=
. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - FP and beginning CS students
 - FP and Computational Thinking
 - FP and Artificial Intelligence
 - FP in Robotics
 - FP and Music=20
 - Advanced FP for undergraduates
 - FP in graduate education
 - Engaging students in research using FP
 - FP in Programming Languages
 - FP in the high school curriculum
 - FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
 - FP and Philosophy
 - The pedagogy of teaching FP
 - FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.
 - Best Lectures =E2=80=93 more details below

In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What=
=E2=80=99s your best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a f=
un way to present FP concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesti=
ng presentation of a difficult topic? In either case, please consider shari=
ng it. Best lecture topics will be selected for presentation based on a sho=
rt abstract describing the lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees.

Submission

Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages)=
 or a draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted =
presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on =
the workshop's website.=20=20

Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the following link: =
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtfpie2017

After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version=
 of) their article for review. The PC will select the best articles for pub=
lication in the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Scie=
nce (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will=
 not be formally reviewed by the PC.
