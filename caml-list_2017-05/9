Subject: Re: [Caml-list] menhir should reference source file and not
 generated source file

That's a good question, which I don't think anyone has asked before.

Looking into this issue, it turns out that if "menhir" is used, then the
generated .ml file does contain appropriate line number information (such
as # 4 "sample.mly"), whereas if "menhir --infer" is used, then this
information is omitted. The difference is observable if Assertion_failure
is raised. This is definitely a bug, which I will look into.
Thanks for reporting this!
