Dear caml-list,

This is a  gentle reminder that the presentation submission deadline for
the OCaml workshop 2017 on May 31st, in two weeks. (For the details, the
original announcement at the end of this email.) Writing a talk proposal is
not very difficult (you can do it in 20-30 minutes), no need to wait for
the last minute!

  https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/

If you have any question about the workshop, feel free to send me an email.

If you know someone whose work would be of interest to the OCaml community,
please encourage them to propose a presentation. The workshop is a unique
(yearly) even to meet other people of the OCaml community whose work may
have been supporting your own, or building on top of it.

The programme of the ICFP conference is now available. For a sneak peek,
some of the preprints are already available ( https://github.com/gasche/
icfp2017-papers ). Besides the ICFP conference, many co-located events may
also be of interest to the caml-community. See the list of events on the
ICFP webpage (ML-family languages, Haskell, Scheme, Erlang, type-directed
programming, effectful programming, high-performance computinng, art and
music).
  http://icfp17.sigplan.org/home

For the more theory-oriented among us, the co-located FSCD conference also
have many nice events (linear logic, unification, security,
higher-dimensional rewriting, homotopy type theory, string diagrams, proof
theory, confluence, logical frameworks, program rewriting):
  http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/fscd2017/

Finally, if you are a student (or are a teacher with students), you should
consider sending application(s) to the Programming Language Mentoring
Workshop ( http://icfp17.sigplan.org/track/PLMW-ICFP-2017 ), who can fund
conference attendance to university student ( the main target is
undergraduate and young graduate, corresponding to the bachelor/master
cycles in Europe ). ACM also has various forms of financial support
available, in particular for students that give a presentation; see
http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/.

Cheers

us on the OCaml<br>programming language and its community. We aim to solici=
t talks<br>on all aspects related to improving the use or development of<br=
>the language and its programming environment, including, for<br>example (b=
ut not limited to):<br><br>- compiler developments, new backends, runtime a=
nd architectures<br><br>- practical type system improvements, such as (but =
not<br>=C2=A0 limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,<=
br>=C2=A0 or dependent types<br><br>- new library or application releases, =
and their design<br>=C2=A0 rationales<br><br>- tools and infrastructure ser=
vices, and their enhancements<br><br>- prominent industrial or experimental=
 uses of OCaml, or<br>=C2=A0 deployments in unusual situations.<br><br>Pres=
entations<br>-------------<br><br>It will be an informal meeting with no fo=
rmal proceedings. The<br>presentation material will be available online fro=
m the workshop<br>homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made ava=
ilable<br>at a later time.<br><br>The main presentation format is a worksho=
p talk, traditionally<br>around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, b=
ut we also<br>have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to<b=
r>present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The<br>program =
committee will decide which presentations should be<br>delivered as posters=
 or talks.<br><br>Submission<br>----------<br><br>To submit a presentation,=
