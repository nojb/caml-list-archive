>> Scope
>> -----
>>
>> Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml
>> programming language and its community. We aim to solicit talks
>> on all aspects related to improving the use or development of
>> the language and its programming environment, including, for
>> example (but not limited to):
>>
>> - compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures
>>
>> - practical type system improvements, such as (but not
>>   limited to) GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming,
>>   or dependent types
>>
>> - new library or application releases, and their design
>>   rationales
>>
>> - tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements
>>
>> - prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or
>>   deployments in unusual situations.
>>
>> Presentations
>> -------------
>>
>> It will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
>> presentation material will be available online from the workshop
>> homepage. The presentations may be recorded, and made available
>> at a later time.
>>
>> The main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally
>> around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also
>> have a poster session during the workshop -- this allows to
>> present more diverse work, and gives time for discussion. The
>> program committee will decide which presentations should be
>> delivered as posters or talks.
>>
>> Submission
>> ----------
>>
>> To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
>> talk (about 2 pages long) at
>>
>>   https://icfp-ocaml17.hotcrp.com/
>>
>> providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
>> presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
>> methods that are proposed.
>>
>> LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
>> format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
>> also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
>> format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
>> submitted PDF or the text version.
>>
>> Important dates
>> ---------------
>>
>> Wednesday 31st May (any time zone)  Abstract submission deadline
>> Wednesday 28th June                 Author notification
>> Friday 8th September 2017           OCaml Workshop
>>
>> ML family workshop and post-proceedings
>> ---------------------------------------
>>
>> The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with

>Presentations and discussions will focus on the OCaml<br>programming langu=
age and its community. We aim to solicit talks<br>on all aspects related to=
 improving the use or development of<br>the language and its programming en=
vironment, including, for<br>example (but not limited to):<br><br>- compile=
r developments, new backends, runtime and architectures<br><br>- practical =
type system improvements, such as (but not<br>=C2=A0 limited to) GADTs, fir=
st-class modules, generic programming,<br>=C2=A0 or dependent types<br><br>=
- new library or application releases, and their design<br>=C2=A0 rationale=

 will be an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The<br>presentatio=
n material will be available online from the workshop<br>homepage. The pres=
entations may be recorded, and made available<br>at a later time.<br><br>Th=
e main presentation format is a workshop talk, traditionally<br>around 20 m=
inutes in length, plus question time, but we also<br>have a poster session =
during the workshop -- this allows to<br>present more diverse work, and giv=

focuses on more research-oriented work that is less specific to<br>a langua=

 and we have occasionally transferred<br>presentations from one to the othe=
