I'm aware of this package.  However, it is not exactly what
I want.  It provides information to help emacs/vi let you
browse your source code.  What I want is a marked-up
version of my source code, so that I can browse it in, for
instance, a WWW browser.  I do not believe this is possible
with mletags alone.

My end goal is to combine hypertext source code with
hypertext text documentation (latex source compiled with
latex2html) into a single, browsable hypertext document.
