Subject: a few questions for the CAML community
Sender: weis
Status: O



1) would it be really hard to port CSL to Windows NT?  I can't imagine, but
   any hints to what problems one could expect would be very helpful.
2) would it be really hard to have an application that incorporated both
   SmallTalk and CSL code?  I would think so, because there would be two
   garbage collectors in the same memory.  If I'm right about this, I
   would just put the two parts in separate processes talking though some
   form of IPC.  Again, any input would be appreciated.
