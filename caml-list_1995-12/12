I have already ported CSL to Windows NT (almost works under Win95 as 
well).  It requires VC++ and MASM but most of the issues are already resolved.

I will be giving my changes back to Xavier for integration into the 
mainline distribution.

| 1) would it be really hard to port CSL to Windows NT?  I can't imagine, but
|    any hints to what problems one could expect would be very helpful.
| 2) would it be really hard to have an application that incorporated both
|    SmallTalk and CSL code?  I would think so, because there would be two
|    garbage collectors in the same memory.  If I'm right about this, I
|    would just put the two parts in separate processes talking though some
|    form of IPC.  Again, any input would be appreciated.
