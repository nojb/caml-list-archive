Hi,
  I am interested in automatically generating
from normal ML source code hypertext ML code
that has links from references to type/value
binding occurences.  Does anyone know of an
existing package that does this?  It seems
that this should be easy build such a
compiler by hacking an existing ML compiler.

thanks, Mark
