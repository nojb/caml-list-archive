Some users have already ported CSL to Windows NT, though I don't think
they have released their port. (I think they are on this mailing list,
so I'll let them comment further.) 

CSL is getting stable enough that we can consider non-Unix ports. The
major problems are practical (how to share files, avoid rewriting all
Makefiles, etc), not technical.
