Subject: Re: [Caml-list] What are people using when writing distributed
 applications in OCaml?

At Issuu, we started with an ZMQ / Piqi based messaging (RPC and 
broadcast). However we are leaning more and more to using AMQP for 
messaging and RPC where throughput and latency is not as critical
(we still handle 50.000 messages/sec through AMQP though).

Amqp handles RPC style messages nicely, and handles client disconnects 
and retransmissions in a useful way.

Having a central message broker also decouples the services even more as 
the micro-services only need to agree on which Amqp to use and does not 
need to know the name of each other.
