Subject: [Caml-list] What are people using when writing distributed
 applications in OCaml?

Hello,

If you know about some distributed application that went into production
and that can happily withstand the fire of production and real world 
loads, I would be happy to here about which library the system was using.

I have heard about MPI and zmq for example, which both have
ocaml bindings. However, I also know that there are several RPC
implementations out there (one in ocamlnet, one in mirage, one in core), 
but I am not sure about which one is the most mature and production-tested.

Thanks a lot,
Francois.
