Subject: [Caml-list] CICM Call for Papers


                              Call for Papers

                Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
                                 CICM 2015

                              13-17 July 2015
                            Washington DC, USA


Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the
generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical
information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build
computer based systems for computer algebra, automated deduction, and
mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these
systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies
offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer
Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions
to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.

CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating
related conferences and workshops to advance work in these
subjects. Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (UK 2008),
Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),
Bremen (Germany 2012), Bath (UK 2013), and Coimbra (Portugal 2014).

This is a (short version of the) call for papers for CICM 2015, which
will be held in Washington, D.C., 13-17 July 2015.

The full version of the CFP is available from the conference web page at
http://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php

**********************************************************************
The principal tracks of the conference will be:
**********************************************************************

* Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)
  Chair: Jacques Carette
* DML (Digital Mathematical Libraries)
  Chair: Volker Sorge
* MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)
  Chair: Cezary Kaliszyk
* Systems and Data
  Chair: Florian Rabe

Publicity chair is Serge Autexier. The local arrangements will be
coordinated by the Local Arrangements Chairs, Bruce R. Miller
(National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) and Abdou
Youssef (The George Washington University, Washington, D.C.), and the
overall programme will be organized by the General Programme Chair,
Manfred Kerber (U. Birmingham, UK).

As in previous years, it is anticipated that there will be a number
co-located workshops, including one to mentor doctoral students giving
presentations. We also solicit for project descriptions and
work-in-progress papers.
