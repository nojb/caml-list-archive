First Call for Papers

############################################################

LCTES 2015
ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED Conference on
Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory for Embedded Systems

############################################################

LCTES provides a link between the programming languages and embedded
systems engineering communities. Researchers and developers in these
areas are addressing many similar problems, but with different
backgrounds and approaches. LCTES is intended to expose researchers
and developers from either area to relevant work and interesting
problems in the other area and provide a forum where they can
interact.

## Important Dates

Submission deadline: Feb. 15
Notifications by: Apr. 1
Camera-ready deadline: Apr. 11

LCTES 2015 will be held on June 18 and 19 as part of the FCRC 2015
(Federated Computing Research Conference 2015) in Portland, Oregon,
USA. This will be the sixteenth conference in the LCTES series.

Embedded system design faces many challenges both with respect to
functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements, many of which
are conflicting. They are found in areas such as design and developer
productivity, verification, validation, maintainability, and meeting
performance goals and resource constraints. Novel design-time and
run-time approaches are needed to meet the demand of emerging
applications and to exploit new hardware paradigms, and in particular
to scale up to multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed
systems built from multicores.

LCTES 2015 solicits papers presenting original work on programming
languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in
overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques
are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by
experimenting with real-world systems and applications.

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics in
embedded systems:

- Programming language challenges, including:
- Domain-specific languages
- Features to exploit multicore, reconfigurable, and other emerging
architectures
- Features for distributed, adaptive, and real-time control embedded systems
- Language capabilities for specification, composition, and construction of
embedded systems
- Language features and techniques to enhance reliability, verifiability,
and security
- Virtual machines, concurrency, inter-processor synchronization, and
memory management
- Compiler challenges, including:
- Interaction between embedded architectures, operating systems, and
compiler
- Interpreters, binary translation, just-in-time compilation, and split
compilation
- Support for enhanced programmer productivity
- Support for enhanced debugging, profiling, and exception/interrupt
handling
- Optimization for low power/energy, code and data size, and best-effort
and real-time performance
- Parameterized and structural compiler design space exploration and
auto-tuning
- Tools for analysis, specification, design, and implementation, including:
- Hardware, system software, application software, and their interfaces
- Distributed real-time control, media players, and reconfigurable
architectures
- System integration and testing
- Performance estimation, monitoring, and tuning
- Run-time system support for embedded systems
- Design space exploration tools
- Support for system security and system-level reliability
- Approaches for cross-layer system optimization
- Theory and foundations of embedded systems, including:
- Predictability of resource behaviour: energy, space, time
- Validation and verification, in particular of concurrent and distributed
systems
- Formal foundations of model-based design as basis for code generation,
analysis, and verification
- Mathematical foundations for embedded systems
- Models of computations for embedded applications
- Novel embedded architectures, including:
- Design and implementation of novel architectures
- Workload analysis and performance evaluation
- Architecture support for new language features, virtualization, compiler
techniques, debugging tools
- Empirical studies and their reproduction, and confirmation

## Note to Authors

A few of the best submissions to LCTES 2015 are planned to be invited
for submission, with some revisions, to a special issue of the ACM
Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS).

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made
available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks
prior to the first day of your conference.
