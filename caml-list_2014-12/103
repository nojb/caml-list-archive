CRV 2015
The 2nd International Competition on Runtime Verification,=20
held with RV 2015, September 22 =96 25, 2015 Vienna, Austria


CRV-2015 is the 2nd International Competition on Runtime Verification and i=
s part of the 15th International=20
Conference on Runtime Verification. The event will be held in September 201=
5, in Vienna, Austria. CRV-2015 will=20
draw attention to the invaluable effort of software developers and research=
ers who contribute in this field by=20
providing the community with new or updated tools, libraries and frameworks=
 for the instrumentation and runtime
verification of software.

Runtime Verification is a verification technique for the analysis of softwa=
re at execution-time based on extracting
information from a running system and checking if the observed behaviors sa=
tisfy or violate the properties of interest.
During the last decade, many important tools and techniques have been devel=
oped and successfully employed. However,=20
there is a pressing need to compare such tools and techniques, since we cur=
rently lack a common benchmark suite as well
as scientific evaluation methods to validate and test new prototype runtime=
 verification tools.=20

The main aims of CRV-2015 are to:

	=95 Stimulate the development of new efficient and practical runtime verif=
ication tools and the maintenance=20
          and improvement of the already developed ones.
	=95 Produce a benchmark suite for runtime verification tools, by sharing c=
ase studies and programs that=20
          researchers and developers can use in the future to test and to v=
alidate their prototypes.
	=95 Discuss the metrics employed for comparing the tools.
	=95 Provide a comparison of the tools on different benchmarks and evaluate=
 them using different criteria.
	=95 Enhance the visibility of presented tools among the different communit=
ies (verification, software=20
          engineering, cloud computing and security) involved in software m=
onitoring.

Please direct any enquiries to the competition co-organizers (crv15.chairs@=
imag.fr)

	=95 Yli=E8s Falcone (Universit=E9 Joseph Fourier, France).
	=95 Dejan Nickovic (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Austria).
	=95 Giles Reger (University of Manchester, UK).
	=95 Daniel Thoma (University of Luebeck, Germany).

CRV-2015 Jury

The CSRV Jury will include a representative for each participating team and=
 the competition chairs. The Jury will be consulted at each stage of the co=
mpetition to ensure that the rules set by the competition chairs are fair a=
nd reasonable.

Call for Participation

The main goal of CRV 2015 is to compare tools for runtime verification. We =
invite and encourage the participation with benchmarks and tools for the co=
mpetition.The competition will consist of three main tracks based on the in=
put language used:

	=95 Track on monitoring Java programs (online monitoring).
	=95 Track on monitoring C programs (online monitoring).
	=95 Track on monitoring of traces (offline monitoring).

The competition will follow three phases:

	=95 Benchmarks/Specification collection phase - the participants are invit=
ed to submit their benchmarks=20
          (C or Java programs and/or traces). The organizers will collect t=
hem in a common repository=20
          (publicly available). The participants will then train their tool=
s using the shared benchmarks.
	=95 Monitor collection phase - the participants are invited to submit thei=
r monitors. The participants with=20
          the tools/monitors that meet the qualification requirements will =
be qualified for the evaluation phase.
	=95 Evaluation phase - the qualified tools will be evaluated on the submit=
ted benchmarks and they will be=20
          ranked using different criteria (i.e., memory utilization, CPU ut=
ilization, ...). The final results=20
          will be presented at the RV 2015 conference.

The detailed description of each phase will be available on the RV 2015 web=
site at http://rv2015.conf.tuwien.ac.at.
