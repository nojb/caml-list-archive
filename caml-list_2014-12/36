I don't know how this exception escaped (it is supposed to be caught by the
compiler) but it looks like you have some old .cmi files lying around that
were compiled by your previous version of OCaml. You should remove them,
and also the .cmo, .cmx, etc. and recompile everything (including any
third-party libraries that you might have installed).
