Subject: [Caml-list] CFP: TFPIE 2015

      Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE 2015)
                          Call for papers
             https://wiki.science.ru.nl/tfpie/TFPIE2015

The 4th International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Educa=
tion,
TFPIE 2015, will be held on June 2, 2015 in Sophia-Antipolis in France. It =
is
co-located with the Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP 2015)
which takes place from June 3 - 5.

*** Goal ***

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that=
 use,
or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE=
 aims
to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progres=
s on
the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day
workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process=
 for
publication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2015 will screen
submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of
interest to participants. Potential presenters are invited to submit an ext=
ended
abstract (4-6 pages) or a draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The
authors of accepted presentations will have their preprints and their slides
made available on the workshop's website/wiki. Visitors to the TFPIE 2015
website/wiki will be able to add comments. This includes presenters who may
respond to comments and questions as well as provide pointers to improvemen=
ts
and follow-up work. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submi=
t (a
revised version of) their article for review. The PC will select the best
articles for publication in the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretic=
al
Computer Science (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and extended
abstracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC. TFPIE workshops have
previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012), Provo Utah, USA (2013)=
, and
Soesterberg, The Netherlands (2014).=20

- Tools supporting learning FP=20
- FP in graduate education=20
- Engaging students in research using FP=20
- FP in Programming Languages=20
- FP in the high school curriculum=20
- FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics=20
- FP and Philosophy=20

*** Best Lectures ***

In addition to papers, we request =93best lecture=94 presentations. What is=
 your
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to presen=
t FP
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture t=
opics
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees.

*** Submission ***

Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the following link:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtfpie2015
It is expected at at least one author for each submitted paper will attend =
the
workshop.
