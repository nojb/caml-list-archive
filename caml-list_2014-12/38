Subject: [Caml-list] First call for papers LOPSTR 2015 -- 25th International
 Symposium on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation -- Siena,
 Italy

                 25th International Symposium on
        Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                          LOPSTR 2015

            http://alpha.diism.unisi.it/lopstr15/
         University of Siena, Siena, IT, July 13-15, 2015


DEADLINES
Abstract submission:                     April 6,  2015
Paper/Extended abstract submission:      April 13, 2015

============================================================


The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 25th International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2015) will be held at the University of Siena,
Siena, Italy; previous symposia were held in Canterbury, Madrid,
Leuven, Odense, Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice, London,
Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester, Leuven,
Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester.
LOPSTR 2015 will be co-located with PPDP 2015 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Both full
papers and extended abstracts describing applications in these areas
are especially welcome. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

     * synthesis
     * transformation
     * specialization
     * composition
     * optimization
     * inversion
     * specification
     * analysis and verification
     * testing and certification
     * program and model manipulation
     * transformational techniques in SE
     * applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application papers that describe experience with
industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).


Important Dates

  Abstract submission:                            April 6, 2015
  Paper/Extended abstract submission:             April 13, 2015
  Notification:                                   May 25, 2015
  Camera-ready (for electronic pre-proceedings):  June 15, 2015
  Symposium:                                      July 13-15, 2015


Submission Guidelines

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in 
English)
in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style.
Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors
and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to
four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting 
appropriate
reviewers for the paper. Page numbers should appear on the manuscript to
help the reviewers in writing their report. Submissions cannot exceed 15
pages including references but excluding well-marked appendices not 
intended
for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and 
thus
papers should be intelligible without them.
Papers should be submitted via the Easychair submission website for 
LOPSTR
2015, which you can access through the website of LOPSTR 2015.


Proceedings

The formal post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer in 
the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (to be confirmed).
Full papers can be directly accepted for publication in the formal 
proceedings,
or accepted only for presentation at the symposium and inclusion in 
informal
proceedings. After the symposium, all authors of extended abstracts and 
full
papers accepted only for presentation will be invited to revise and/or 
extend
their submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the 
symposium.
Then, after another round of reviewing, these revised papers may also be
published in the formal proceedings.


Special journal issue

After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to  
a special
issue of a primary computer science journal. The submissions to the 
special issue
must be substantial extensions of the proceedings versions and will  
undergo  the
usual journal reviewing process.
