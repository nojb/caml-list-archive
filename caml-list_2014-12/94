*** Call for Workshop Proposals ***

The 20th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC 2015)

6-9 July 2015, Golden Bay Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

http://ieee-iscc.org/2015


Continuing the well-established tradition of this series of symposia, IEEE =
ISCC
2015 will be an international technical forum of experts from industry and
academia to exchange ideas and present the results of ongoing research work
in state-of-the-art of computers and communications as listed in its call f=
or
papers (the web site is on http://www.ieee-iscc.org/2015).

ISSC 201515 Workshops Committee invites proposals for half or full day
workshops affiliated with the conference. Example topics would be 5G,
Internet of Things, Software-Defined Networking, Big Data, Cloud Computing,
M2M communications or Smart Grid. The purpose of these workshops is to
provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly
more sharply focused way than at the conference itself. All papers included=
 in
the ISCC 2015 workshops will be included in the conference proceedings
published by IEEE. We expect that all selected workshops to adhere to the
common paper submission and reviewing schedule as outlined in the ISCC
2015 Call for Papers.

Each workshop proposal must include the following:

=B7 The name of the workshop
=B7 The names, addresses, and short bios of the organizers
=B7 A brief description (up to one page long) of the technical issues that =
the
Workshop's focus will be on, and the reasons why the workshop is of interest
at this time
=B7 The names of potential Program Committee members
=B7 The planned format of the Workshop, including a strategy to facilitate =
lively
discussions and involvement of the attendees
=B7 If a keynote speech is included in the planned format of the workshop, =
the
name(s) of the potential keynote speaker(s)
=B7 If applicable, a description of past versions of the workshop, including
dates, organizers, number of submitted and accepted papers, and number
of attendees
=B7 If the workshop is going to be organized for the first time, an estimat=
e of
the expected number of submissions and attendees
=B7 A tentative Call for Papers
=B7 A description of the plans for publicity and workshop Web site

Workshop proposals should be submitted, no later than Monday 12th
January 2015, by email (in PDF format) with the subject line "ISCC'15
Workshop Proposal" to all Workshop Co-Chairs Periklis Chatzimisios
(peris@it.teithe.gr), Andreas Kamilaris (kami@cs.ucy.ac.cy) and Massimo
Villari (mvillari@unime.it).
