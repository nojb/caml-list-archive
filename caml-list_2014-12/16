Subject: [Caml-list] CICM 2015: Call for Workshops

                     Call for Workshop Proposals
                                                                                 
     CICM 2015 - Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
                           July 13-17, 2015
       The George Washington University, Washington, D.C , USA
                 http://www.cicm-conference.org/2015

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater
opportunities arise  for intelligent mathematical  computation.  While
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we are  now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these
areas.  The Conference  on  Intelligent  Computer Mathematics  (CICM)
offer a venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.

CICM has been held annually as  a joint meeting since 2008, colocating
related conferences and  workshops to advance work  in these subjects.
Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend
(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen
(Germany 2012), Bath (U.K. 2013) and Coimbra (Portugal, 2014).

This is a  call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2015,
which will be held in Washington D.C. (USA), July 13-17 next year.

The principal tracks of the 2015 meeting will be

  Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)
  DML (Towards a Digital Mathematics Library)
  MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)
  Systems and Data

Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:

  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice
  Compact Computer Algebra
  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics
  Intelligent Proof Search
  Mathematical user Interfaces
  OpenMath
  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation
  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems
  SCIEnce
  The Notion of Proof

Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2015 are solicited.  Both
well-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.

Please provide the following information:
 
 + Workshop title.
 + Names and affiliations of organizers.
 + Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.
 + Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).
 + If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference 
   affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, 
   please indicate so.

CICM  will take  care  of copying  and  distributing informal  printed
proceedings for  workshops that  would like this  service, as  well as
permanently archived open access online proceedings with CEUR-WS.org.

All proposals should be sent via email to

             cicm-organizers@cs.bham.ac.uk

for consideration by the CICM 2015 organizers:

 Local Organization Chairs:    Bruce Miller    (NIST)
