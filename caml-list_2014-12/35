Yes, I'll try and recreate it for you.

No, the backtrace in gdb is useless. All it says is:
#0  0x0000000000843033  in caml_c_call ()
#1  0x0000000000000000  in ?? ()

The sending of data over a zmq socket and the conversion of that data<br>

that it is most certainly the line that converts to protobuf.<br>

In any case, I did a test, and in my first function when to_pb gets<br>
called the first time and succeeds, I added an additional call to it...<br>
which also succeeded. But then in a subsequent unit test, the one that<br>
has been failing, still segfaults.<br>

If I turn off the tests prior to the segfaulting test, to_pb works in<br>

I would not expect so.<br>

If you create a failing unittest that I could try?<br>

Also, does the segfault contain a usable back trace (using gdb)? That might=
