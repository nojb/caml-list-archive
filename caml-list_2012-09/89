Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OUD slides

Hi Phillipe,

I've linked all of the videos, abstracts and slides that are available at t=
he OUD website, at:

http://oud.ocaml.org/

As speakers send me their slides, I will update the web page (this is possi=
bly slightly challenging from some talks such as David Scott's, which was d=
elivered as a self-hosted webserver using Mirage).

I've also got various scribe reports from attendees that I will collate int=
o a summary blog post next week, and mail out to the list.
