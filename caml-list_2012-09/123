Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] release Javalib 2.2.2 and Sawja 1.4

Dear Ocaml users,

We have the pleasure to announce a new release of Javalib and Sawja
(the Static Analysis Workshop for JAva).

Javalib and Sawja are libraries written in OCaml. Javalib parses Java
.class files into OCaml data structures. Sawja is relying on the
Javalib library, and providing a high level representation of Java
bytecode programs. Whereas Javalib is dedicated to isolated classes,
Sawja handles bytecode programs with their class hierarchy and control
flow algorithms. Sawja also provides some stackless intermediate
representations of code and static analysis tools that makes analyses
easier.

The main new feature of this release is the ability to use formulae.
It is a way to add information at the source code level which can then
be used in an analysis. It is useful, for example, to guarantee
assertions that cannot be found by the analyser or even to manage
structures/functions which are implicitly present in the code environment.

More information, examples, and a series of tutorials are available at
http://sawja.inria.fr. The Sawja devteam is looking forward to your
questions and feedback on the library.

Best regards,

The Celtique team
INRIA Rennes
