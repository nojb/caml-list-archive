Subject: [Caml-list] LATA 2013: 2nd call for papers

7th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE AND AUTOMATA THEORY AND APPLICATIO=
NS

LATA 2013

Bilbao, Spain

April 2-5, 2013

AIMS:

LATA is a yearly conference in theoretical computer science and its applica=
tions. Following the tradition of the International Schools in Formal Langu=
ages and Applications developed at Rovira i Virgili University in Tarragona=
 since 2002, LATA 2013 will reserve significant room for young scholars at =
the beginning of their career. It will aim at attracting contributions from=
 both classical theory fields and application areas (bioinformatics, system=
s biology, language technology, artificial intelligence, etc.).

VENUE:

LATA 2013 will take place in Bilbao, at the Basque Country in Northern Spai=
n. The venue will be the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM).

A special issue of a major journal will be later published containing peer=
=E2=80=90reviewed extended versions of some of the papers contributed to th=
e conference. Submissions to it will be by invitation.

REGISTRATION:

The period for registration is open from August 6, 2012 to April 2, 2013. T=
he registration form can be found at the website of the conference:

ovided on site.

Remarks:

- Bank transfers should not involve any expense for the conference.
- People claiming early registration will be requested to prove that the ba=
nk transfer order was carried out by the deadline.
- PhD students will need to provide evidence of their status on site.

People registering on site must pay in cash. For the sake of local organiza=
tion, however, it is much recommended to do it earlier.
