Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Call for collaboration on the future of camlp4

Hi Hongboz,

Thanks for the slides, it's good. Indeed it makes sense now to focus on
extending Camlp4, however as usually there are some gotchas, the process
of extending syntax with Camlp4 is a bit not well known.  Camlp5 has an
excellent documentation, and great support for some of the things. Yet,
Camlp4 is more modular, and is just easier to write application on top
of Camlp4.

On OUD we had open ended discussions, and many people share (like me)
the same impression - -ppx that exist on trunk is powerful and that's
the way to implement most of the meta programming facilities (deriving
the code from type definitions, or using quotations to embed DSLs in
OCaml), but I believe that the direct syntax extensions (opening the
OCaml syntax) certainly has some benefits. How to do this in a clean way
myself - I don't know. I posted just some time ago what would be a macro
system of my dreams:

https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2012-05/msg00184.html

If the current Camlp4 could be used to do this, it would be great but
that's need to be somewhat kept up to date with all up-coming compiler
meta programming facilities.

I will have a closer look at the Fan project today.

Thanks,
