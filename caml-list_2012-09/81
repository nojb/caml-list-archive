            5th NASA Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) 2013

                      NASA Ames Research Center
                       Moffett Field, CA, USA
                           May 14-16, 2013
               http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/events/nfm-2013/
==================================================================

Theme of the Conference:

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum for theoreticians and
practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with the goals
of identifying challenges and providing solutions to achieving
assurance in mission- and safety-critical systems. Within NASA, for
example, such systems include autonomous robots, separation assurance
algorithms for aircraft, Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen),
and autonomous rendezvous and docking for spacecraft. Moreover,
emerging paradigms such as code generation and safety cases are
bringing with them new challenges and opportunities. The focus of the
symposium will be on formal techniques, their theory, current
capabilities, and limitations, as well as their application to
aerospace, robotics, and other safety-critical systems.

We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring
together formal methods and techniques from other domains such as
probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics,
and quantum computing among others.  Topics of Interest

Topics of Interest:

     * Formal verification, including theorem proving, model checking,
       and static analysis
     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods, including
       but not restricted to abstraction and symbolic methods,
       compositional techniques, as well as parallel and distributed
       techniques
     * Use of formal methods in automated software engineering and
       testing Model-based development
     * Formal program synthesis
     * Runtime monitoring and verification
     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance
     * Formal analysis of cyber-physical systems, including hybrid and
       embedded systems
     * Formal methods in systems engineering, modeling, requirements
       and specifications
     * Applications of formal methods to aerospace systems
     * Use of formal methods in safety cases
     * Use of formal methods in human-machine interaction analysis
     * Formal methods for multi-core, GPU-based implementations
     * Application of formal methods to emerging technologies, e.g.,
       mobile applications, autonomous systems, web-based application

Important Dates
Dec 7, 2012 	       Paper Submission Deadline
Jan 28 - Feb 1, 2013   Rebuttal phase
Feb 15, 2013 	       Acceptance Notification
March 15, 2013 	       Camera-Ready Version Submission
May 13 - 16, 2013      NFM Symposium
Submission

There are two categories of submissions:

     * Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete
       results (15 pages).

     * Short papers describing tools, experience reports, or
       descriptions of work in progress with preliminary results (6
       pages)

All papers should be in English and describe original work that has
not been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be
fully reviewed by members of the program committee. Papers must use
Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style and be put
in PDF format, as the papers will appear as a volume in Lecture Notes
of Computer Science. Submissions are now open through easychair.
