Well, IMHO, using a general purpose programming language with some 
combinators is *way more better* than a DSL, I used ocamlbuild to build 
a quite complex project: which includes bootstrapping, different 
preprocessing flags, nested directories, packing modules(byte code, 
native coce), (I even dynamically caculated the preprocess flags).

The problem with ocamlbuild is its implementation, not the idea, the 
idea is pretty good.
