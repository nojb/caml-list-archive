I completely understand that: indentation is something that requires
human intelligence (and good indentation is an art rather than
science).

For the same reasons I do not indent a whole buffer at once, usually..

FYI some open source projects have as part of their build process a
call to GNU indent, super annoying when indentation is not as you
describe..

That being said, if there is a part of tuareg mode that you need to
modify to accommodate your needs (the change of a variable name, as
you mention), hacking on the elisp might be preferable.  And yes, I
understand emacs lisp is this somewhat scary and involved language,
more for reasons related to emacs (as an API) rather than anything
having to do with lisp.. :-/
