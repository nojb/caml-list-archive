Yes, it's damn useful not only for bootstrapping, but also for 
developing to locate type errors. But there's something wrong with 
Camlp4's printer, it has *4* printers in total, writing a printer for an 
Ast which has no backend is totally useless. In my branch of camlp4, *I 
removed all those 4 printers and using tools/pprintast.ml* in ocaml's 
compiler source tree(with some my own bug fixes), and it works very well.
Btw, are you in ICFP? we could have a talk about Camlp4 :-)
