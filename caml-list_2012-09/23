Subject: [Caml-list] APLAS 2012: Call for Posters and Demos

(Apologies for multiple copies.)

                       10th Asian Symposium on
                  Programming Languages and Systems
                             (APLAS 2012)
                      Call for Poster and Demos

APLAS 2012 will include a poster and demo session during the
conference. The poster session aims to give students and professionals
an opportunity to present technical materials to the research
community, and to get responses from other researchers in the field.

This year, accepted posters will be presented in the main hall so that
presenters have much opportunity of discussion during breaks. Standing
by the poster on each break is not mandatory, though.

* Scope

Poster and demo contributions are sought in all areas of programming
languages and systems, including the following topics:

- semantics, logics, foundational theory;
- design of languages and foundational calculi;
- type systems;
- compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
- program derivation and transformation;
- program analysis, verification, model-checking, software security;
- concurrency, constraints, domain-specific languages;
- tools for programming, verification, implementation.

* Format of Posters

A space of A1 paper size (594 mm wide and 841 mm high) will be
provided for each presentation. AC Power outlet of 100V will be also
provided during the poster & demo session. If you need more space and
facilities, contact the poster chair (aplas2012-poster AT
fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp).

* Submission

Each presenter should e-mail a 1-2 page abstract in PDF to the poster
chair (Kohei Suenaga: aplas2012-poster AT fos.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp) by
October 5th 2012. The abstract should include the title, author(s),
affiliation(s) and summary of the work. The program of the poster
session will be announced by October 29th, 2012. We hope to
accommodate every poster, but may restrict presentations (based on
relevance and interest to the community) due to space constraints.

* Important Dates

Submission deadline: October 5th, 2012
Notification: October 29th, 2012

* Contact

Poster chair: Kohei Suenaga
