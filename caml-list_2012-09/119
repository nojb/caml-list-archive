Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Build OCaml on linux

Did someone mentioned ocamlbrew in order to perform installation
automatically?

https://github.com/hcarty/ocamlbrew

It also installs a few useful stuffs (oasis, odb, etc.).
This is what I use in our lab to install OCaml in user's home
in case they have a non Debian-like Linux distro.

Regards,
F.
