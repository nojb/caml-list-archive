Well, I don't want to stop you fixing ocamlbuild. My point is rather=20=20
that users sometimes don't recognize the point of complexity when=20=20
ocamlbuild is no longer the right utility, and I just want to point out=20=

that there is an alternative tool.

Come on, this is not a fair critique. Have you ever started a fresh=20=20
omake project? It's really short:

.DEFAULT: $(OCamlProgram put_here_the_name_of_your_program, module1=20=20
module2 ...)

You can have pattern rules in omake, and I think they are a full=20=20
replacement for tags.

Right, being part of the distribution is the advantage of ocamlbuild.

I'd recomment it already when the alternative is to write ocamlbuild=20=20
plugins (which are the biggest error of ocamlbuild - ocaml is just not=20=
=20
the right language to modify the behavior of builds).

ocamlbuild certainly has some nice ideas, but I'd overall say that it=20=20
jumps too short. It's ok for student projects, and I guess this is the=20=
=20
main justification for having it in the distribution. It's easier than=20=
=20
traditional Makefiles. What's missing is that you cannot easily modify=20=
=20
existing behavior, and to my mind, plugins do not use the right=20=20
abstractions. A one-liner in omake's DSL (which is actually a nice=20=20
dynamically-typed functional language) turns into a lengthy phrase.

Well, there are also things I don't like in omake (e.g. environments=20=20
are powerful but also difficult to debug). But so far it is the clear=20=20
winner for me, mostly because it has a good DSL which is more adequate=20=
=20
than
