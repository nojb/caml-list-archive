Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 4.00.0 for iOS Simulator is released

Greetings OCamlers,

I just released a version of OCaml 4.00.0 that creates apps that run in
the iOS Simulator.  I call it OCamlXSim for short.

You can download a binary release, or get instructions for bulding from
sources:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iossim.html

After you've gotten your app working in the simulator, you can compile
it for iOS and release it in the iOS App Store:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html

I also have a page of OCaml-on-iOS resources:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/

It's quite a bit easier to make OCaml work for the iOS Simulator than
for iOS because the i386 code generator works with no changes.  The main
trick is convincing ocamlopt to be a cross compiler.

If you're interested in trying OCaml on iOS, starting with the simulator
is great because you don't need a device, and you don't need to register
as an iOS developer with Apple.

My next project will be to work on an armv6 version of the OCaml-to-iOS
compiler (which I call OCamlXARM).

I'm very happy to hear from anybody interested in this project
(or any similar ones).

Jeffrey
