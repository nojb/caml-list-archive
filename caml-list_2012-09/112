Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Build OCaml on linux

=46rom the INSTALL notes
(http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/notes/INSTALL) ...

4- If your platform is supported by the native-code compiler (as
reported during the autoconfiguration), you can now build the
native-code compiler. From the top directory, do:

        make opt
or:
        make opt > log.opt 2>&1     # in sh
        make opt >& log.opt         # in csh

Is that the sort of thing for which you're looking?
