*************************************************************************

The 24th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA 2013) is organized as part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting,=
=20
Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2013), together with the 11th International=
=20
Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2013), and severa=
l=20
workshops. RDP 2013 will be held at the Eindhoven University of Technology
in the Netherlands.

*** TOPICS OF INTEREST ***

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects of=
=20
rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

*** PUBLICATION ***

The proceedings of RTA 2013 will be published by LIPIcs (Leibniz=20
International Proceedings in Informatics). LIPIcs is open access, meaning=
=20
that publications will be available online and free of charge, and authors=
=20
keep the copyright for their papers. LIPIcs publications are indexed in DBL=
P.=20
For more information about LIPIcs please consult:
  <http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics>

*** SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ***

Submissions must be
- original and not submitted for publication elsewhere,
- written in English,
- a research paper, or a problem set, or a system description,
- in pdf prepared with pdflatex using the LIPIcs stylefile:
  <http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors.tgz>,
- at most 10 pages for system description,
  at most 15 pages for the other two types of submissions
- submitted electronically through the EasyChair system at:
  <https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drta2013>.

The page limit and the deadline for submission are strict.

Additional material for instance proof details, may be given in an appendix=
=20
which is not subject to the page limit. However, submissions must be=20
self-contained within the respective page limit; reading the appendix shoul=
d=20
not be necessary to assess the merits of a submission.
