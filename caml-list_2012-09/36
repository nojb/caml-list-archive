Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Re: working %.pp.ml target with ocamfind/ocamlbuild

Gerd,

I agree omake is a high quality tool for non trivial builds, however
it does not solve the same problems as ocamlbuild. The point of
dicsussion is to improve ocamlbuild not to switch to the external
tool.
I will lament, because I used both and ocamlbuild have some clear
advantages over omake (and some clear disadvantages too):

- it's dead easy to build a single file, without constructing
horrendous command line or adding an unneeded target
- it's declarative, you don't want to construct tons of special
variables and concatate them
- it's part of our distribution - no additional dependencies, so if
it's there, there is some reason, and if something it's not working
properly we have to fix it

Overall ocamlbuild is based on some nice ideas, whatever people would
say. Not that I say that OMake is no good - in fact it's a very robust
and excellent build system, and I recommend anyone who's got already
bootstraping phases, lot of meta programming with unsual tools,
portability problems etc..

Both however suffer from almost similar problem - OMake is a bit
underused for the quality you get, where ocamlbuild is just underrated
for the ideas it has.
