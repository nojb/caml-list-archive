	   ESOP 2013: The European Symposium on Programming

		  http://www.ccs.neu.edu/esop2013/

		       Affiliated with ETAPS'13
	      Rome, Italy, 16-24 March 2013

DESCRIPTION AND TOPICS
   ESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the
   specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming
   languages and systems. ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of
   programming language research including, but not limited to, the
   following areas:

       * Programming paradigms and styles: functional programming,
	object-oriented programming, aspect-oriented programming, logic
	programming, constraint programming, extensible programming
	languages, domain-specific languages, synchronous and real-time
	programming languages;

       * Methods and tools to write and specify programs and languages:
	programming techniques, logical foundations, denotational
	semantics, operational semantics, meta programming, module systems,
	language-based security;

       * Methods and tools for reasoning about programs: type systems,
	abstract interpretation, program verification, testing;

       * Methods and tools for implementation: program transformations,
	rewriting systems, partial evaluation, experimental evaluations,
	virtual machines, intermediate languages, run-time environments;

       * Concurrency and distribution: process algebras, concurrency theory,
	parallel programming, service-oriented computing, distributed and
	mobile languages.

   Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly 
welcome.
