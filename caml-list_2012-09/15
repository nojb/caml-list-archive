=========================================================

                                Birds of a Feather sessions (BOFs)

     Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop (CUFP 2012)

                                        http://cufp.org/bofs-2012
                                  Copenhagen, Denmark, September 13 - 15

=========================================================

CUFP 2012 will again include Birds of a Feather sessions as in previous
years. BoFs provide a place for our community to gather informally and
reach consensus on matters of importance. Any CUFP attendee can propose a
BoF session, and grab one of the spare rooms in the evening slots below.
Attendance in the evening is open to all.

BoF sessions facilitate ad-hoc discussions and provide a place to gather
and start off the chat, before moving on during the evening to a local
restaurant or pub. There is no deadline for proposing a session---you can
even request a room on the day---but we encourage you to do so at the
earliest possible time to help us with planning and to publicize your
proposed discussion. Attendees are also free to show up even if you have
not confirmed, but again earlier confirmation will help us with planning.

Please see http://cufp.org/bofs-2012 for details on how to propose a BoF
session or confirm attendance at one of them.

General information on CUFP 2012 can be found at
http://cufp.org/conference/2012. The conference is co-located with ICFP.
You can register for CUFP at the main ICFP website
http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2012.
