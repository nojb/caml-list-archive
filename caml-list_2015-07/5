=======================================================================
                  SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 24/31 August 2015

Aim: Logics and techniques for automated reasoning have often been
developed with formal analysis and formal verification in mind. To
show applicability, toy examples or tiny case studies are typically
presented in research papers. Since the theory needs to be developed
first, this approach is reasonable.
  However, to show that a developed approach actually scales to real
systems, large case studies are essential. The development of formal
models of real systems usually requires a perfect understanding of
informal descriptions of the system-sometimes found in RFCs or other
standard documents-which are usually just written in English. Based on
the type of system, an adequate specification formalism needs to be
chosen, and the informal specification translated into it. Abstraction
from unimportant details then yields an accurate, formal model of the
real system.
  The process of developing a detailed and accurate model usually takes
a large amount of time, often months or years; without even starting a
formal analysis. When publishing the results on a formal analysis in a
scientific paper, details of the model have to be skipped due to lack
of space, and often the lessons learnt from modelling are not
discussed since they are not the main focus of the paper.
  The workshop aims at discussing exactly these unmentioned lessons.
Examples are:

  * Which formalism is chosen, and why?
  * Which abstractions have to be made and why?
  * How are important characteristics of the system modelled?
  * Were there any complications while modelling the system?
  * Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?

The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. In particular, we
invite papers that present full Models of Real Systems, which may lay
the basis for future formal analysis. The workshop will bring together
researchers from different communities that all aim at verifying real
systems and are developing formal models for such systems. Areas where
large models often occur are within networks, (trustworthy) systems
and software verification (from byte code up to programming- and
specification languages). An aim of the workshop is to present
different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them.

Submission
----------
Submissions must be unpublished and not be submitted for publication elsewhere.
Contributions are limited to 8 pages EPTCS style (http://style.eptcs.org)
(not counting the appendix), but shorter extended abstracts are welcome.
Appendices (of arbitrary length) can be used to present all details of
a formalised model; the appendices will be part of the proceedings.
Submissions must be in English and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair (TBC).

All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three referees based
on their novelty, relevance and technical merit. The proceedings will be 
published as part of the open access series Electronic Proceedings 
in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).

             First International Workshop on Focusing
                              WoF'15

                   Suva, Fiji, 23 November 2015
                      Affiliated with LPAR-20

=======================================================================
               SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 4/11 September 2015

Focusing is a proof search strategy that alternates two phases: an inversion
phase where invertible sequent rules are applied exhaustively and a chaining
phase where it selects a formula and decomposes it maximally using
non-invertible rules.  Focusing is one of the most exciting recent
developments in computational logic: it is complete for many logics of
interest and provides a foundation for their use as programming languages and
rewriting calculi.

This workshop has the purposes of bringing together researchers who work on or
with focusing, to foster discussion and to report on recent advances.  Topics
of interest include:

- Focusing in forward, backward and hybrid logic programming languages
- Focusing in theorem proving
- Focusing for substructural logics
- Focused term calculi
- Implementation techniques
- Parallelism and concurrency
- Focusing in security
- Pearls of focusing

Submission
----------
In addition to regular papers, we also solicit "work in progress" reports, in
a broad sense.  Those do not need to report fully polished research results,
but should be interesting for the community at large.  Submitted papers should
be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS style guidelines. The length is
restricted to 12 pages for regular papers and6 pages for "Work in Progress"
papers.  Submission is via EasyChair (link on the WoF'15 web page).

Proceedings
-----------
Accepted regular papers will be included in the proceedings of WoF'15, which
will be published in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer
Science series (EPTCS).
