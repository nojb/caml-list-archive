*** Fifth Call for Papers ***

8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud
Computing (UCC 2015)

December 07-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/ucc2015

*** EXTENDED DEADLINE: 17 July, 2015 ***


CONTEXT AND SCOPE

Cloud Computing delivers computational resources on-demand as services
that are commoditized and delivered analogous to traditional utilities such=
 as
electricity, gas, water and telephony. Cloud service offerings for compute,
storage and communication resources as well as for hosted software and data
are growing at a tremendous rate, and it is essential to understand how to
effectively transform these services into Utilities that provide value to b=
oth
users and providers. There is also increasing interest from commercial
providers to offer business and revenue models around the services they
offer. Understanding how these models could be used to provide utility for
users, intermediary brokers (aggregators) and providers is also an area of
active research. UCC is the premier IEEE/ACM conference covering all areas
related to Cloud Computing as a Utility and provides an international forum
for leading researchers and practitioners in this important and growing fie=
ld.
UCC 2015, to be held in Cyprus, will happen as Cloud providers worldwide
add new services and increase Cloud utility at an accelerated pace, and Clo=
ud
service users explore new usage modes.

This will be the 8th UCC in a successful conference series. Previous events
were held in Shanghai, China (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010
& UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden,
Germany (UCC2013), and London, UK (UCC 2014).


CALL FOR PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished research manuscripts that
demonstrate current research in all areas of Cloud and Utility computing
including design and analysis of distributed and centralized Cloud systems,
data centre design and engineering, economic and market models for cloud
systems, revenue and business models and their applications in scientific,
engineering, and commercial deployment.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

=B7 Big Data and Analytics

=B7 Principles and theoretical foundations of Utility Computing, including
   pricing and service models

=B7 Policy languages and Programming models

=B7 Utility driven model and mechanisms for Cloud federations

=B7 Autonomic techniques for Clouds and Cloud applications

=B7 Utility-driven platforms for Clouds

=B7 Architectural models to achieve Utility in Clouds

=B7 Designs and deployment models for Clouds: private, public, hybrid,
   federated, aggregated

=B7 Cloud Computing middleware, stacks, tools, delivery networks and
   services at all layers (XaaS)

=B7 Virtualization technologies and other enablers

=B7 Economic models and scenarios of use

=B7 Scalability and resource management: brokering, scheduling, capacity
   planning, parallelism and elasticity, as well as marketplaces

=B7 Cloud management: autonomic, adaptive, self-*, SLAs, performance
   models and monitoring

=B7 Applications: games, social networks, scientific computing (e-science)
   and business

=B7 Mobile and energy-efficient use of Clouds

=B7 Beyond technology: Cloud business and legal implications, such as
   security, privacy, trust and jurisdiction, especially in Utility contexts

One or more best paper awards will be given for outstanding contributed
papers. Further details as well as submission guidelines are available at t=
he
conference website and below.


MANUSCRIPT GUIDELINES

Submitted  manuscripts  should  be  structured  as  technical  papers  and
may  not  exceed  ten  (10)  single-spaced double-column pages using
10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including
figures, tables, and references.

Electronic submissions must be in the form of a readable PDF file.
Manuscripts must be received by July 17, 2015 (extended!). All
manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee and evaluated on
originality, relevance of the problem to the conference theme, technical
strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, and organization and clari=
ty
of presentation of the paper.

Please use the following Easy Chair link to update your submission:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ducc2015 .

Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not
currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not
following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further acti=
on
may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the head=
s of
the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference. Submissions
received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately
structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the Program
Chairs at the email addressed below for further information or clarificatio=
n.
Notification of review decisions will be mailed by August 21, 2015. Camera
-ready papers are due by September 21, 2015. Published proceedings will
be available at the conference.

At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in
order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. There is NO student
rate for the author who is responsible for registration for his/her publish=
ed
paper. If you have more than one accepted paper, you have to register for
each one individually. There is no discount if you have two or more papers
accepted. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a
requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the
conference will not be included in IEEE  Xplore.


SPECIAL ISSUES

Selected papers from the conference will be invited to submit an extended
version to the IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing. Papers will be selected
based on their reviewers' scores and appropriateness to the journal's theme.
All extended versions will undergo reviews and must represent original
unpublished research work. Further details will be made available at the
conference webpage.


IMPORTANT DATES

=B7 Paper submissions due: 17 July, 2015 (extended!)
=B7 Notification of acceptance: 21 August, 2015
=B7 Camera ready papers due:  21 September, 2015
