FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS -- DCM 2015

11th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models

October 28, 2015, Cali, Colombia
http://dcm-workshop.org.uk/2015/

A satellite event of ICTAC 2015 - http://www.ictac2015.co

DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF EXTENDED ABSTRACTS (5 pages):
AUGUST 17, 2015

Several new models of computation have emerged in the last few years, and
many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed
with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems
users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational
model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a
new family of programming languages, and new paradigms of software
development.

DCM 2015 is the eleventh in a series of international workshops focusing
on new computational models. The aim of this workshop is to bring together
researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new
features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their
interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in
progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in
this area.

DCM 2015 will be a one-day satellite event of ICTAC 2015, the Twelfth
International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing.

=3D=3D TOPICS OF INTEREST
Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their
properties, and their applications to the development of programming
languages and systems:

- functional calculi: lambda-calculus, rho-calculus, term and graph
rewriting;
- quantum computation, including implementations and formal methods in
quantum protocols;
- probabilistic computation and verification in modeling situations;
- chemical, biological and bio-inspired computation, including spatial
models, self-assembly, growth models;
- models of concurrency, including the treatment of mobility, trust, and
security;
- infinitary models of computation;
- information-theoretic ideas in computing.

=3D=3D IMPORTANT DATES
- Submission Deadline for Extended Abstracts: August 17 (extended)
- Notification: 13 September
- Pre-proceedings version due: 5 October
- Workshop: 28 October
- Submission Deadline for EPTCS Proceedings: 7 December

=3D=3D INVITED SPEAKERS
Mauricio Ayala Rinc=C3=B3n, Universidade de Brasilia (Brazil).
Gilles Dowek, INRIA (France).

=3D=3D SUBMISSIONS
Submit your paper in PDF format via the conference EasyChair submission
page:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ddcm2015

Submissions should be an abstract of at most 5 pages, written in English.
Simultaneous submission to journals, conferences or other workshops is not
permitted. Please use the EPTCS macro package and follow the instructions
of EPTCS, following the EPTCS style:
http://style.eptcs.org/

A submission may contain an appendix, but reading the appendix should not
be necessary to assess its merits. After the workshop authors are invited
to submit a full paper of their presentation. Accepted contributions will
appear in an issue of EPTCS.
