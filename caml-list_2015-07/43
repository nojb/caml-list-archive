****************************************************************************
************
4th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NATURAL COMPUTING

TPNC 2015

Mieres, Spain

December 15-17, 2015

Organized by:

European Centre for Soft Computing

Research Group on Mathematical Linguistics (GRLMC)
Rovira i Virgili University

http://grammars.grlmc.com/TPNC2015/
****************************************************************************
************

AIMS:

TPNC is a conference series intending to cover the wide spectrum of
computational principles, models and techniques inspired by information
processing in nature. TPNC 2015 will reserve significant room for young
scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put
on methodology. The conference aims at attracting contributions to
nature-inspired models of computation, synthesizing nature by means of
computation, nature-inspired materials, and information processing in
nature.

VENUE:

TPNC 2015 will take place in Mieres, in the north of Spain. The city is the
heart of the coal mining industry in the country, today declining. The venue
will be the European Centre for Soft Computing:

http://www.softcomputing.es/

SCOPE:

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Theoretical contributions to:

amorphous computing
bacterial foraging
cellular automata
chaos and dynamical systems based computing
evolutionary computing
membrane computing
neural computing
optical computing
swarm intelligence

artificial chemistry
artificial immune systems
artificial life
complex adaptive systems
self-organizing systems

computing with DNA
nanocomputing
physarum computing
quantum computing and quantum information
reaction-diffusion computing

computing with words
developmental systems
fractal geometry
gene assembly in unicellular organisms
granular computation
intelligent systems
rough/fuzzy computing in nature
synthetic biology

- Applications of natural computing to:

algorithms
bioinformatics
control
cryptography
design
economics
graphics
hardware
human-computer interaction
knowledge discovery
learning
logistics
medicine
natural language processing
optimization
pattern recognition
planning and scheduling
programming
robotics
telecommunications
web intelligence

A flexible "theory to/from practice" approach would be the perfect focus for
the expected contributions.
