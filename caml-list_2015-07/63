It's good to know that I appear not to have missed anything obvious for doi=
ng it "out of the box"! Altering /etc/profile (or whatever) was an option I=
 considered, but if you don't prepend /usr/bin to PATH then one quickly run=
s into problems with the "alternate" versions of find and sort in %windir%\=
system32 clogging up other parts of build scripts! At which point it's all =
messy installation-specific changes (which I realise is fine for what you'r=
e doing).

Given that this conflict is only over link.exe - all the other tools in the=
 Microsoft toolchain are sensibly, or at least moderately uniquely, named -=
 would a patch to the compiler (and to flexlink) which searches the various=
 directories in PATH in order and identifies the first link.exe which is ac=
tually a Microsoft Linker be welcomed (i.e. merged) - an ML-equivalent to [=
1], but only used if the linker has been specified given as "link" (i.e. wi=
th no directory)? I'm happy to patch it, but only if it would be wanted. I =
don't see a case for doing it for other commands, but with a conflict in so=
mething in coreutils it seems OK to make an exception, at least to me?
