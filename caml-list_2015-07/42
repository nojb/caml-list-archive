*** New Call for Tutorial Proposals ***

8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud
Computing (UCC 2015)

December 07-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/ucc2015/?page_id=3D935

*** Final Extended Deadline: August 7th, 2015 ***


CONTEXT AND SCOPE

Cloud Computing delivers computational resources on-demand as services
that are commoditized and delivered analogous to traditional utilities such=
 as
electricity, gas, water and telephony. Cloud service offerings for compute,
storage and communication resources as well as for hosted software and data
are growing at a tremendous rate, and it is essential to understand how to
effectively transform these services into Utilities that provide value to b=
oth
users and providers. There is also increasing interest from commercial
providers to offer business and revenue models around the services they
offer. Understanding how these models could be used to provide utility for
users, intermediary brokers (aggregators) and providers is also an area of
active research. UCC is the premier IEEE/ACM conference covering all areas
related to Cloud Computing as a Utility and provides an international forum
for leading researchers and practitioners in this important and growing fie=
ld.
UCC 2015, to be held in Cyprus, will happen as Cloud providers worldwide
add new services and increase Cloud utility at an accelerated pace, and Clo=
ud
service users explore new usage modes.

This will be the 8th UCC in a successful conference series. Previous events
were held in Shanghai, China (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010
& UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden,
Germany (UCC2013), and London, UK (UCC 2014).
