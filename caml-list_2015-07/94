Is OCaml soon to be configured on Windows using the standard configure scri=
pt (I know there's been some work on it?)? I have dealt with it similarly a=
t configure-time in OPAM. I agree that using an absolute path to the link e=
xecutable would in general be better. That said, what do you think of Alain=
's suggestion to offload the entire problem to FlexDLL?

I realise how to solve it!! My point was trying to simplify the myriad inst=
ructions for compiling and using a Windows port of OCaml. "symlink to" also=
 needs many more instructions if it's going to work!
