Yuck. IMO it would be better to add a configure-time option to give the abs=
olute path to the link executable.

In the meantime, what you can do is:

- create an empty directory (for example, /usr/local/bin/ms-tools)
- put a copy of (or a symlink to) Microsoft's link.exe into it
- add it in front of your path
