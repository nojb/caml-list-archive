Subject: [Caml-list] looking for "real world" sqlite3 examples

Hi all,

I need to integrate an sqlite database in an app of mine, and I'm
trying to find existing code I can look at to get some idea of how to
go about it. I tried mirage/orm, but ran into some problems (I
reported the issue, and the author said the code hadn't been
maintained for a while), so I'm falling back on the idea of using
sqlite3 directly.

Things I am interested in:

1. database schema, versioning and migrations - will i need to do
those independently via sql/shell scripts, or is there some good way
to integrate them into my ocaml code?

2. type conversions - in the absence of an orm, do i have to write my
own by hand per resultset. or is there some intermediate-level library
that i haven't found that would automate some of it?

3. is there a maintained library for generating sql queries in a typed manner?

But mostly, I want to look at someone else's code and get an idea of
how this is done in ocaml; pretty much all my database code to date
has been written in dynamically typed languages and relied on code
generation.

martin
