Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] stog 0.15.0 and friends

Hello,

I'm glad to announce the release 0.15.0 of Stog, a static website
compiler: https://zoggy.github.io/stog/index.html .

Changes are available from the release page:
  https://zoggy.github.io/stog/posts/release-0.15.0.html

One of the news is the introduction of the stog-tmpl tool, to generate
website skeletons. It was used for example to create website of
Ocf [http://zoggy.github.io/ocf/].

The stog package should be available soon in opam.

Two plugins are also released and numbered 0.15.0:
- stog-rdf [https://zoggy.github.io/stog/plugins/rdf.html]
    to specify RDF triples within documents, to produce a RDF graph for
    the whole generated site. It also permits executing Sparql queries
    to include data in the generated pages.

- stog-writing [https://zoggy.github.io/stog/plugins/writing.html]
    add new rewrite rules to use footnotes and bibliographies in
    your documents.

They will also be available in opam.

Regards,

Maxence
