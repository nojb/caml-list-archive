You should look into SqlExpr:

  https://github.com/mfp/ocaml-sqlexpr/

I used it recently for a very small project, and it seemed to work
great, even if it doesn't ensure compile-time type safety like PGOCaml.

What I would really like would be a database interface that would work
with both PostgreSQL and SQLite. Apparently ODBC bindings for OCaml
exists, so it would work, but I haven't really tried it out yet.. In
particular I would miss SqlExpr :).

I just write the queries in this small case. It doesn't really allow
dynamically composing new queries out from old ones. For that there is
macaque:

  https://github.com/ocsigen/macaque

I haven't tried it for a long time, apparently it has matured quite
a bit.
