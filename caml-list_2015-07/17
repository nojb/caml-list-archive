The accepted papers as
http://www.cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php?event=&menu=talks

In addition we solicit for posters which will not be peer reviewed, but we
will just do a screen review for relevance to the conference. A poster
presentation will consist of a 5 minute teaser talk and the presentation of
the poster on Tuesday morning (together with the other presentations in the
Systems/Data/Projects track).

You can submit a brief abstract on a poster by 22 June 2015 via EasyChair:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2015
