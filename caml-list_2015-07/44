AI4FM 2015
The 6th International Workshop on the use of AI in Formal Methods

http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/

*1st September 2015 in Edinburgh, Scotland.*
In association with AVoCS 2015 (https://sites.google.com/site/avocs15)



Important dates
----------

*Submission deadline: 1st August 2015*
Notification of acceptance: 10th August 2015
Final version due: 21st August 2015
Workshop: 1st September 2015



Overview
----------

The 6th International Workshop on the use of AI in Formal Methods (AI4FM
2015) will be held on the 1st of September, 2015 in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The AI4FM workshops bring together researchers from formal methods,
automated reasoning and AI; aiming to address the issue of how AI can be
used to support the formal software development process, including
requirement analysis, modelling and proof. The workshops include a mix of
industrial and academic participants and we anticipate attracting a
similarly diverse audience in AI4FM 2015.


We invite 3-page short contributions (extended abstracts) presenting work
in the areas of automated reasoning, formal methods and artificial
intelligence. The authors can submit work in progress, tools under
development, and PhD projects to facilitate and benefit from the active
dialog between the groups involved in these research areas.


Invited speaker:

J Strother Moore (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/, University of Texas at
Austin, US) will be giving an invited talk at AI4FM 2015.



Topics of interest
----------

The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions do not need
to be original. Extended versions of submissions may have been published
previously, or submitted concurrently with or after AI4FM 2015 to another
workshop, conference or a journal. Presentations of work in progress, tools
under development, and PhD projects are also encouraged.

The scope of the workshop covers the research in automated reasoning,
formal methods and artificial intelligence. Particular topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

 - The use of AI and automated reasoning to support and guide the formal
modelling process.
 - The use of AI and automated reasoning in the requirement capture process.
 - The use of AI to reuse formal models, programs and proofs.
 - The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving.
 - The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving.
 - The development of search heuristics.
 - The use of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma discovery
and concept invention.
 - The use of AI for counter-example generation.
 - The use of constraint solvers in formal methods.
 - The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from
requirements to the end product (including software and hardware).
 - The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in this
framework.
 - Ontologies in the formal engineering process.
 - Novel ideas on how to use AI (e.g. machine learning, pattern
recognition) in proof automation.
 - Use of cloud elasticity for: scalability on large scale developments,
proof/lemma exploration.
 - Techniques for bridging the development to maintenance gap.



Submission
----------

Submission is by email to:

ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org

Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended
abstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made into a
technical report prior to the workshop.

Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the organisers
based on relevance to the workshop.



Student grants
----------

Thanks to sponsorships from Altran, FME, and SICSA we can offer financial
support for a limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form
of a registration fee waiver (full or partial, registration covers the
AI4FM workshop in addition to AVoCS). As this is limited, we ask the
students that would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a
short application.

The details on how to apply are available on the AVoCS website:
https://sites.google.com/site/avocs15/student-grants
