Release 1.13 of Caml Special Light is now available. Main novelties:

* Pattern-matching compilation revised to factor out accesses inside
matched structures.

* Callbacks and signals now supported in cslopt.
Signals are only detected at allocation points, though.
Added callback functions with 2 and 3 arguments.

* In patterns, "C _" allowed even if the constructor C has several arguments.

* && and || allowed as alternate syntax for & and or.

* More explicit error messages when a native-code program aborts due
to array or string bound violations.

* cslopt for the Intel: code generation for floating-point
operations entirely redone for the third time (a pox on whomever at
Intel decided to organize the floating-point registers as a stack).

* cslopt for the Sparc: don't use Sparc V8 smul and sdiv instructions,
emulation on V7 processors is abysmal.

The complete sources as well as diffs from release 1.12
are available by anonymous FTP at the usual place
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light.
