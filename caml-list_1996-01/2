I've seen several references to caml-light projects which are supposed to be
found in the /contribs/ subdirectory of the distribution.  In the PC
distribution, there doesn't seem to be any such subdirectory: does this mean
that the applications won't run under that implementation of the language,
or do I have to get the files from some place else (and if so, where?)

Regards,
