Ah, if you're into literate programming in Caml, you might find
Norman Ramsey's NoWeb package interesting
(http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/nr/noweb/).
It is claimed to have indexing capabilites for several languages
including Standard ML (should be easy to adapt to Caml) and generates
both LaTeX and HTML.

I haven't used it myself, but have heard positive comments about
it. If you find it useful for Caml source, let us know.
