Most of the contributed packages for Caml Light are Unix-specific,
including the debugger, the Tk interface, the graphical browser,
and of course the "libunix" library itself.

Some libraries (libnum, libstr) and tools (mletags, search_isos) could
probably be made to run under MSDOS with little effort. It's just that
I haven't found the time to do this. Besides, there's not much demand.
(Most serious users of Caml Light on a PC seems to run Linux.)

The sources for the contribs are available in the Unix distribution of
Caml Light, in case someone wishes to do the port.
