I didn't try with 3.07, only started working with OCaml recently.

Although this is a very rough attempt on locating the problem, this
might have something to do with it:

on file win32caml/ocaml.c around the line 1319 here is what i found:

...
case WM_TIMERTICK:
                /** Modified by Chris Watford 21 Sept 2003 **/
                        hwndChild = (HWND) GetWindowLong(hwnd, DWL_USER);

                        if (ReadToLineBuffer())
                        {
                                int errMsg = 0;
                                char *p, *l = lineBuffer;

                                // Ok we read something. Display the
trimmed version
                                while(((*l) == ' ') || ((*l) == '\t')
|| ((*l) == '\n') || ((*l) == '\r') || ((*l) == '*'))
                                        l++;
...

I have no idea why it trims empty spaces and the *'s. There may be a
good reason for this to happen.. but i did get very confused when this
happened to me the first time.

Tiago
