[..]

However the problem you are refering to is not the problem that
Radu is refering to.

Radu needs to make changes to the makefile, and even if ocamake,
or some other makefile generator, gets the order right, his
changes are clobbered when he reruns it.

This is a problem for most generators. Some provide a template,
but that is a weak solution.

In addition, Radu mentions patching nuweb to allow for the fact
Ocaml can't accept #line spelled as such. The reason it doesn't
is that # is the symbol used in object # method syntax, and so
that usage is ambiguous. # digits is not.

You could try interscript. It already knows Ocaml.
The makefile clobbering problem also just goes away,
since you can use any Python script you like from
within your literate programmed documents to generate
anything you want. The main problem is that it's a bit slow,
compared to some other LP tools (it's written in Python).
