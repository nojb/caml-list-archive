For the functions float_of_string and read_float the OCaml manual is
very vague: "Convert the given string to a float".

In fact, this sentence is wrong. For example, the number 0.1 does not
have a floating point representation, only approximations to it.

So what is the exact specification of these functions? Which number is
taken if the given string does not have a floating point representation?
The nearest one? The nearest one up to 2ulps? Is the current rounding
mode taken into account?
