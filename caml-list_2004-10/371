Sure, you should use subpackages for lablTk, Graphics, Dbm, ie any
library that brings an external library as a dependency. Otherwise you
have annoying situations where you have to install all x11 packages to
be able to install your ocaml package (because of Graphics). 

There's nothing special to do for OCaml, just isolate the graphics* files
and the dll in a separate package.
