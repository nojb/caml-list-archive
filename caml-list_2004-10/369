Hello, all--

I recently decided to try a new Linux distribution--Arch--and
quickly became an enthusiastic convert. Now, I've noticed that there is
no OCaml package for Arch Linux, and I would like to provide one. I'd
like to hear the community's opinion on a couple of questions:

1) Which OCaml distribution should be the basis for the Linux package:
   the basic distribution from INRIA, or GODI? Why do you think so?

2) What about LablTk? Should it be included, excluded? Should I break it
   into a separate package, as is often done with Python/Tkinter? Is
   that even possible with OCaml?

3) Is there anything in the OCaml license that creates problems for a
   Linux distribution package?

4) Any other "gotchas" I should be aware of?

Thanks in advance for your comments.
