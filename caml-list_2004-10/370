I think you just convencied me to use Haskell and its type classes.
Seriously, I wonder if a purely functional language might not be better
for my purposes.

Yes, what to the makers of ocaml say? I am afraid there is no way to
avoid dependence on toplevel code, since the pretty printer must know
something about the representation of types and values.

But that's not my worry anymore. I am off to haskell, Bye bye.
