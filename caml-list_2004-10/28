It is my pleasure to announce a new release of WhizzyTeX.=20

WhizzyTeX is an Emacs minor mode for incrementally viewing LaTeX documents
that you are editing. It works under Unix with gv and xdvi viewers, but the
Active-DVI viewer (see http://pauillac.inria.fr/activedvi/) will provide
much better visual effects and will offer more functionalities.

Version 1.2.0 is now available.=20

The source code, documentation, and information are available at

        http://pauillac.inria.fr/whizzytex/

Bug reports to whizzytex-bugs@pauillac.inria.fr


This release is compatible (and required) with the freshly released version
1.6.0 of Active DVI.  Conversely, version 1.6.0 of Active-DVI is required
for this release to benefit from some of the new WhizzyTeX features.  This
release also contains several bug fixes and improvements since version 1.1.
Significant and user-visible changes are:

 - Better support for debugging.=20

 - Duplex views: both the slice and the full document can now be viewed in
   the same Active DVI window. Switching between views can be done
   explicitly by typing 'w' or implicitly when clicking on cross-references
   that are outside of the current slice.

 - Support for whizzy-edition, which is especially usefull to seize
   scaling factors or dimensions by mouse.

For more details see the web site.

Enjoy,=20

        Didier R=E9my=20


PS:

To keep informed of upgrades, check the WhizzyTeX WEB page occasionally, or
just watch the content of the file http://pauillac.inria.fr/whizzytex/VERSI=
ON.

----------------
WhizzyTeX does not uses Ocaml, but it calls Active-DVI, which uses Ocaml :-)

                                      Ocaml inside

                                          \/
