I've developed a literate programming tool for Ocaml, ocamlweb. See
http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ocamlweb/ 

You'll find many examples of ocamlweb output on this page:
http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/software.en.html (looking at the .ps links)

Though ocamlweb  was inspired  by Knuth's WEB  it only  implements the
pretty-printing  and  indexing   features,  not  the  weaving  feature
(i.e. the ability to present pieces  of code in an arbitrary order). I
consider ocaml to be structured enough.  ocamlweb is assuming comments
to be written  in LaTeX (unless declared as  true comments that should
be ignored).

I wrote this  tool to get nice listings of  my code, following Knuth's
principle that a  program should be something as  beautiful as a book,
readable by a human (and not only a machine).
