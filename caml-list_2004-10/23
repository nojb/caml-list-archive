I've identified two places I've used HOF's, for really rather different reasons.
1) Modularity. This is probably obvious, but the hardest one to do,
and probably the more useful location. I rarely use more than
second-order functions for htis, and it is very often a refactoring.
"Oh look, in this parser we are evaluating, unwrapping ints, and
error-checking in eight places, the only difference is the function we
apply to the integers afterwards. Time for an HOF."

2) Abstraction. These are places I could have hard-coded the functions
I ended up passing in, but didn't so that the algorithm was very
obvious in the code. This allows someone to look at that one chunk of
code and go "alright, so that's the algorithm. How the specifics work
I don't know, but the general overview is independent of the rest of
the code". This may just be me, and is certainly NOT the usual use of
HOFs.
