I'm wrong, LGPL specifically allows change of licence to GPL.
Sorry.

Read this, taken from the OSI hosted copy of GPL:

"b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License."

In addition, the binary is GPL no matter how you package things,
and then:

"c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
appropriate copyright notice ...." [meaning, GPL]
