I think this is straight-forward. After all, GODI just installs files,
and the files can be repackaged with the package manager of the Linux
distribution.

Of course, the user must not call the GODI build system manually after
that (i.e. godi_console must no longer be used). When the Linux package
manager is responsible for managing the packages, it must be avoided
that it interfers with the GODI build system in an uncontrolled way,
because GODI would replace files, and the Linux package manager is not
informed. (And doing so is really hard, I think this is the difficulty
Jacques Garrigue means.) 

But in general, stacking of package managers should work as long as
there is a clear hierarchy, and one manager calls the other as
subordinate tool (and no user takes the freedom to call the subordinate
manager directly, breaking the hierarchy).

This is true from a developer's point of view. But if you wanted to
create applications for end-users it would be really nice if O'Caml is
integrated into the native packaging system of the distribution.

On the other hand, there are users who need not ocamlbrowser, because
they install O'Caml only because their favourite application happens to
be written in O'Caml.
