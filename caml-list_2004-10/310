I'm creating a library/tool centered around a camlp4
extension. In doing so I need to access the parser
labels simple_patt and class_declaration from the
camlp4 distro file pa_o.ml. Is there a way to do this?

Failing this I've resorted to copying these and other
parts on which these parts depend of the above file
into a separate smaller module which exports these
labels. This seems slightly clumsy since it includes
all the code under labels:
class_fun_binding, class_type_parameters,
class_fun_def, class_structure, class_self_patt,
mod_ident, ident, patt_semi_list, lbl_patt_list,
lbl_patt, patt_label_ident, type_parameter,
labeled_patt.

It works well. It however brings up the license issue.
I'd rather not rewrite this code, which is licensed
under the LGPL, but I'd like to include it in my
distribution. And I'd like to put my own code in this
distro under a BSD-style license. Can I do this by
just copying the above code into a separate file
(pa_class.ml) while retaining the license comment with
a change comment? Or do I have to distribute
separatly? Any advise on how to do this? If I get a
reply which solves my problems, the first release
while come right after=)

Thanks,
Martin
