This is really a problem (I also ran into it), but I don't see how it
can be solved in a way that is both simple to use and maintainable
(unless GODI is the subordinate package manager, as explained in the
other mail). The point is that the GODI project does not have enough
people to collect and maintain the information which Fink/Whatever
packages must be installed for all supported OS. (The implementation of
such a feature is no problem.)
