What I did in my soon-to-be-released automatic prover, following
advice from Pierre Weis, was to hash-cons all the terms used by the
program.  Now I only need to use pointer equality: if the pointers
are not the same then I know the terms are not the same.  The speedup
was a factor of 100 because my program does lots of comparisons and
hashing of terms.
