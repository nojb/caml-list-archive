Not necessarily. You certainly don't mean to say that the C FFI is a 
necessary compromise to be removed one day? We already have a very 
strong core language, which is fully type safe. Extensions to this core 
language, library-wise, can be achieved by linking to C code or, 
depending on the application, to Obj-aware Ocaml libraries.

Apart from such extensions, which most of the core libraries build upon, 
no code should directly call C code or Obj code directly. This is the 
contract between the Caml and its riders.
