Okay.  It's a pay-now-pay-later-or-pay-INRIA sort of game.  <smile/>

Yes, it would be nice to have tail-recursion-modulo-cons.  It's not 
killing me to have to wait for it though-- a lazy list does the job 
nicely for me.  However, you can count me as one of the people who 
would like to see this and GCaml be the main features of OCaml 3.09.
