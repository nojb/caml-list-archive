This doesn't bother me, but it would be nice if the compilers had an
option allowing you to associate differently-named interface and
implementation files. Currently, if you have an interface 'foo.mli',
with several possible implementations, you have to resort to kludges
like creating subdirectories a/, b/, and c/, each with a different
version of 'foo.ml', one of which gets copied into the main directory at
build time. It should be possible to have foo_a.ml, foo_b.ml, and
foo_c.ml, and arbitrarily select one as the implementation of Foo.
