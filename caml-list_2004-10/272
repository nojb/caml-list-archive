Yes, you're right, but I'm quite busy at the moment.  There is
ocamldoc documentation in the tarball itself, and for an online
reference you should look at:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/Date-Calc/Calc.pod#DESCRIPTION

The API is pretty much identical, except that I have omitted Steffen's
time functions which really don't belong in this library.

For reference, business weeks are defined in ISO 8601, and you can
find a synopsis here:
