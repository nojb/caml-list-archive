Really??  You're kidding.  That's kind of cool but kind of strange --
why does it only optimize for composite types?

I would say not -- the whole point of using such a type would be that
it only has one constructor so adding another would not be likely.

That's a perfectly fine approach, but I prefer the single-constructor
union approach because there are no new concepts, just optimizations.
