Thank you for your interest to wxCaml.

Before making it as an open source project,
I think more revision is necessary because it's only starting point of ocaml
binding to wxWindows.

The state of the wxCaml is that there are lots of binding to wxWindow
functions (widgets).
"wc *.idl" shows that it has about 5700 lines (including some commented
lines),
and "wc wxcaml.ml" shows it has about 9000 lines.
It means that it has many interfaces to wxWindow functions, almost to all
basic widgets.
You can find which widgets has binding or not by checking the "wxcaml.ml"
file.

As you know, lablgtk team makes very good modules and classes
for ocaml binding of another widget library.
I think the wxCaml project should follow the same direction as lablgtk

Before following wxhaskell method,
I tested "SWIG"  but it didn't give me good impression.
I remember it produced dull interfaces.

Right now, I don't have enough time to proceed with wxCaml project,
so I welcome anyone who wants to continue this project.
