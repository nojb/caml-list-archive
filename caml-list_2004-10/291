This discussion has nothing to do with printf and similar function.
Please do not derail the thread and stay on topic, which is
pretty-printing in ocaml toplevel.

Assuming the original question was "why pretty-printing" (as opposed to
"why printf", which is irrelevant to this discussion), the answer I hope
is clear: because a good interactive toplevel is useful for many
purposes. I have two kinds of motivation: teaching ocaml and enriching
ocaml toplevel with graphics and the like, so that it looks and feels
more like Mathematica. (Looks are important!)

Best regards,

Andrej
