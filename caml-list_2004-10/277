I'm curious why people want to use these kinds of routines.
What does printf style mini-language printing have to offer compared to
just using plain old Ocaml functions?

I almost never use this kind of printer, and even systematically
removed it from a program I was working on once. I would have guessed
printf style printing is nice for debugging or perhaps logs,
but not much more. Ocaml itself seems a stronger and better
language to me.

Similarly I never use iostreams in C++ .. and there we have
overloading, which is even more convenient for remembering
the names of the formatting routines.

Still, I use printf() itself in C.

What makes such printers better than just using ordinary routines?

Well, how would you port code using such a printer to
an ocamlopt program?
