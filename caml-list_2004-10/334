Ok let me explain why I trim these.

What happens when some luser forgets to terminate a comment, a string,
etc, the damn redirected shell process puts out either ' *' at the
front of a line, or just extra spaces. The actual variables etc aren't
being trimmed, just the output.

I'll try and work around having to trim those with some more
intelligent checks for user input failures.

Thanks for pointing out that bug! Keep them coming!
