Hi all,

in the process of building a multithreaded and up-to-date binding to the 
fuse (filesystem in userspace) library, I just noticed that unix.stat 
and friends are blocking operations (in the sense that they block other 
threads). Binding their unix counterparts using a [blocking] tag in 
camlidl would be easy, but could this perhaps be fixed in the standard 
library?

Thanks

Vincenzo
