Hi,

thanks for looking into it :)

i see now why they were being trimmed, since the command line being
used is not interactive and gets the input buffer as a whole it will
output prompt characters for each line given on the "prompt".

As i see it, the ocaml toplevel could have a new option to turn the
prompt generation *off* so it didn't generate the prompt at all,
another way (the dirty way) would be to count input lines and delete
on the output 2 characters per input line (generated prompt chars). I
don't how you are doing it now. But i think both options could work.
