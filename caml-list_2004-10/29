Hi, 

I am trying to call some outside exectuables in Ocaml
code. So I tried Unix.system and Unix.exec. However I
found that the program cannot execute correctly if it
is called from Ocaml code, and at the same time it can
work smoothly if I run it directly from a console.
This program is a very simple console program, with
two files as its input. When I look into the code and
put some debugging code to print internal information
out, I found that when I start the program from Ocaml
code, the last several lines of the input file are
ignored.  I added several extrae line at the end of
the file and tried again. The lines I added are still
ignored. The file is a simple text file, the final
line looks like this: 'CONF: 721 == 45 119 124'. It is
rather simple, right? I found that when I tried to
start the program inside Ocaml, the program will
ignore the last line. It is rather wierd and
frustrating. Any suggestions and insights are welcome.


Thanks.

Andy
