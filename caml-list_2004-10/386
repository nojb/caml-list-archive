Generic IO from ExtLib are dealing with this problem, and have a printf
functionnality.
They also have useful functions such as  write_i16 / write_ui32 .... (in low
and big endian) when dealing with C binary files.

printf "%d %f %s %c"  33 1.234 "hello" 'x'

Maybe because printf allows you to specify precision for int/floats as well
as newlines ?
