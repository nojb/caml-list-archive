Announcement:
============

Micmatch is a syntax extension of OCaml that allows an easy manipulation
of regular expressions.

Several features have been recently added, and now make it a functional
and handy tool for writing OCaml scripts as well as larger programs.

Micmatch was already providing these features:
  - a Caml-friendly syntax for defining and reusing regexps
    (ocamllex style with more features)
  - no runtime errors due to incorrect regexps
  - a dedicated toplevel
  - a support for regular expressions in the pattern matching constructs
    of OCaml (match ... with ...)

Now it also provides this:
  - a set of macros using a "functional style" (SEARCH, REPLACE,
    COLLECT, SPLIT, ...)
  - a small but useful library for common operations over textual data
  - the possibility of self-executable scripts on Unix systems
  - lazy quantifiers
  - possessive/atomic groups
  - a reference manual

Micmatch programs normally use the PCRE-OCaml library, but can also
use the Str library (with limited features).

Enjoy this tool,

Martin.
