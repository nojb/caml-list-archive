Something that would be useful is to have a set of godi* packages in the 
system's native package management system that would ensure that the 
required packages godi needs to build are available.  It could then 
probably call godi_build and let godi handle the rest.

I spent a large amount of time with Fink determining which packages godi 
needs to build.  For example, to build camlimages and ensure that all 
image formats are enabled, required a good amount of time and a large 
number of packages.

Also, these godi* packages could set up a set of symbolic links from a 
godi managed directory back to the system's /usr/bin, say using stow.
