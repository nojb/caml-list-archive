iirc (haible had the history on one of his websites, it probably is 
still there, but i don't remember the URL) you could chose whether to 
include readline when you built clisp (from sources).  so he was 
distributing something that, based on build options was linked with a 
gpled library.  it had nothing to do with dynamic linking
