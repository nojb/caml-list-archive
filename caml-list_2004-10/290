Of course. As can any attempt for law, legislation, or authority
to try to make distinctions between things that no sane programmer
would distinguish.

It's like trying to teach people the difference between a 
compiler, translator and interpreter. In the end the good teacher
knows it's only a vague distinction to help thinking, and the
good student soon learns the teacher was telling a white lie.
They're just all programs.

So too, trying to distinguish 'source code' from 'binary'
and even say specifically what 'linking' means is all 
plainly power politics with no technical merit.

Mathematically, it's all just coding.
