The OCaml Network Application Environment (NAE) is a collection of 
Objective Caml libraries to support the development of concurrent, 
single-threaded Internet application servers.  Its "core foundation" 
library (Cf) is currently the only package released in the project (the 
others are in the planning and development phases, and are only 
available by anonymous CVS).

See the SF.Net project page for more details and download links.

	<http://sf.net/projects/ocnae/>

The cf-0.4 package is a BETA candidate.  The latest release of Cf 
contains only two small changes from the previous release:

	+ Fix Makefile for architectures that do not support native compilers.
	+ Fix serious bug in the [Cf_gadget] scheduler that caused some wires 
to be
	  prematurely collected without delivering events to their receivers.

Here is an excerpt from the README:

===== OCaml NAE Core Foundation (cf) library =====

This directory contains the OCaml NAE Core Foundation library, which is 
a
collection of miscellaneous extensions to the Objective Caml standard
library.

Highlighted features include:

- Functional streams and stream processors (extended).
- Functional bootstrapped skew-binomial heap.
- Functional red-black binary tree (associative array).
- Functional sets based on red-black binary tree.
- Functional real-time catenable deque.
- Functional LL(x) parsing using state-exception monad.
- Functional lazy deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
- Functional lexical analyzer (using lazy DFA and monadic parser).
- Functional substring list manipulation (message buffer chains).
- Gregorian calendar date manipulation.
- Standard time manipulation.
- System time in Temps Atomique Internationale (TAI).
- Unicode transcoding.
- Extended socket interface (supports IPv6 and UDP w/multicast).
- Universal resource identifier (URI) manipulation.
- I/O event multiplexing (with Unix.select).

Note: see the ISSUES file for a list of open problems in this release.

===== Required Components =====

This library requires the following external components:

- Objective Caml (v3.07+2 or newer)
- Findlib (tested with v0.8.1 and v1.0.4)

Principle development was on Mac OS X 10.3.  The final version of this
library also compiled successfully and passed all self-tests without 
warnings
on Suse Linux 9.0 for x86-32.  Other platforms with POSIX-like 
environments
should require only a minimal porting effort.

One major open issue: the extended socket interface is broken under 
WIN32.
(The author invites help porting the library to other environments.)
