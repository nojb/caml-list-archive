| As I said in an earlier post, you can do
|=20
|   let (=3D?) x y =3D (Pervasives.compare x y =3D 0)
|=20
| and use =3D? instead of =3D in places where you need the "early stop"
| behaviour.

OK. I wanted to be sure this was a recommended solution, not just
something that happens to work at the moment.

In fact, the key function is an alpha-conversion test on
name-carrying lambda-terms. Since it's almost always expected to
succeed with full equality after a shallow comparison, I now do an
equality test first to get the early-out behaviour. I can just
change it to put an "=3D=3D" into the main recursion when it hasn't
gone through any lambdas.
