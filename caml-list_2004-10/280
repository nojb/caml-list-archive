And, you don't even have to make this exception to use a LGPL library with
a GPL program.  You can also include libraries using many other licenses as
well.  The FSF has a fairly exhaustive list of licenses that are both
compatible and incompatible with the GPL.  Their site seems to be down
right now, so I can't grab a URL, but it isn't that difficult to find from
<http://www.fsf.org/>

Usually the reason another license is incompatible with the GPL is because
it contains something more restrictive than the GPL.
