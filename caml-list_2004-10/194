I'm pleased to announce release 1.0 of OCaml-Win32, an OCaml library
providing direct access to the Win32 API.  Compared to the previous release
(0.02), this version adds support for many of the common dialog boxes and
common controls, improved mechanisms for processing notification messages,
and numerous small improvements and bug fixes.  I expect that future
upgrades will not change the architecture or introduce many
incompatibilities, so I am taking the liberty of calling this release 1.0,
the first "stable" release.  However, large parts of the library have not
been tested yet.

The library is made available under the LGPL license, at the following URL:

http://www.speakeasy.org/~hchomsky/ocaml-win32.html

I have also created a SourceForge project, ocaml-win32, which can allow
volunteers to help expand the library in the future.  Please notify me if
you are interested in becoming a developer for this project.

Enjoy.
