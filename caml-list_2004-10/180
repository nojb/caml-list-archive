The OMake team is proud to announce a new release of the OMake Build 
System - OMake 0.9.3.

OMake is a build system, similar to GNU make, but with many additional
features:

    o Support for large projects spanning several directories or
      directory hierarchies.

    o Comes with a default configuration file providing support for
      OCaml, C and LaTeX projects, or a mixture thereof.
      Often, a configuration file is as simple as a single line

         OCamlProgram(prog, foo bar baz)

      which states that the program "prog" is built from the files
      foo.ml, bar.ml, and baz.ml.

    o Fast, reliable, automated dependency analysis using MD5 digests.

    o Portability: omake provides a uniform interface on Win32 and
      on Unix systems including Linux and Mac OS X.

    o Builtin functions that provide the most common features of programs
      like grep, sed, and awk.  These are especially useful on Win32.

    o Full native support for rules that build several things at once
      (such as ocamlopt building .cmx and .o).

    o Active filesystem monitoring, where the build automatically
      restarts whenever you modify a source file.  This can be very
      useful during the edit/compile cycle.

    o A companion command interpreter, osh, that can be used
      interactively.

The home site for OMake is http://omake.metaprl.org/

The changes in 0.9.3 include:

    - OMake now supports ocamlfind in its default configuration file
     (thanks to Bardur Arantsson for the initial patch).

    - OMake should now also work with OCaml 3.07 (in addition to 3.08).

    - A large number of bug fixes, including:
       - OMake should now compile correctly under Cygwin (thanks to
         Peter Jolly who provided the patch),
       - "double-colon" rules (that allow specifying multiple rules for
         the same target) should now work correctly,
       - kqueue-based file system monitoring (Mac OS X, FreeBSD) should
         now work correctly
       - array definitions should now work better.

    - Added a work around for the command line length limitation of
      lib.exe on Windows

    - Filesystem monitoring functionality now provides a choice whether 

      to continue monitoring once the project is built successfully.

OMake 0.9.3 is still an alpha release.  While we have made an effort to 
ensure that it is bug-free, it is possible some functions may not behave 
as you would expect.  Please report any comments and/or bugs to the 
mailing list omake@metaprl.org and/or at http://metaprl.org/bugzilla
