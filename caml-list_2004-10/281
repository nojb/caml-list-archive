I was going to make the same answer...

However, when releasing libraries for ocaml, it may be useful to
remember that while ocaml's runtime and libraries are
LGPL(+exception),  the compiler, and as a result the toplevel, is QPL,
and that the QPL happens to be incompatible with the GPL.
In practice, this means that you cannot distribute a toplevel
including a GPL library.

On the other hand, there should be no problem loading manually a
GPL library in the toplevel, or building such a toplevel privately.
(At least I believe so, but questions of dynamic loading are the
muddiest part of the GPL and the QPL.)
