I just performed the minimal update you suggest.

The original plan was to do that once the redesign of the
caml.inria.fr / caml.org site is complete.  However, the author of the
new site defended his PhD and left earlier than expected, leaving us
with a 90%-completed site that no one wants to finish :-(

Of course, we could repoint ocaml.org now to the current caml.inria.fr
site, but that might be a step backwards in terms of modern look.

As usual, the main issues are not technical, i.e. who is going to
write what, etc.
