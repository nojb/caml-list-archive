MATLAB, SAS and S-plus were the target of OCAMAWEB (for signal processing  
and probability/statistics algorithms prototyping, in which it is very  
valuable to include mathematical proofs into code), so I at the time I  
developed ocamaweb, I did not think that it could be usefull for the  
languages you cite.
Now that a lot of people use ocamaweb outside of MIRIAD, I will have to  
extend it to any language...

Anyway, from my point of view, there is a lot of tools to comment code a  
proper way (doxygen, ocamldoc, etc), and a lot of programming tasks do not  
need "real" litterate programming (in java for instance, a "linear"  
documentation tool like javadoc is mainly efficient).
The point is that when you develop code that implement some mathematical  
results you obtain and when you want to share that code (and the  
mathematics that support it) with other people (that's our case inside  
MIRIAD), you need to be able to "reconfigure" your code to produce a  
documentation including mathematical glyphs (using LaTeX is a good option)  
: that's what ocamaweb allow to obtain. And a lot of people implement such  
mathematical "adjustments" of existing results in signal processing and  
statistics / probability ; those people mainly use MATLAB, S-plus (or R)  
and SAS.

So ocamaweb primary goal is definitely not to comment sh, perl or awk  
(even if now that it is on my computer, I use it with those languages) ;  
it's to produce restructured documentation including mathematical proofs.
