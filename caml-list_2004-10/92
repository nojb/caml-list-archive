| What I did in my soon-to-be-released automatic prover, following
| advice from Pierre Weis, was to hash-cons all the terms used by the
| program.  Now I only need to use pointer equality: if the pointers
| are not the same then I know the terms are not the same.  The speedup
| was a factor of 100 because my program does lots of comparisons and
| hashing of terms.

Yes, it might well be worth looking at that again. I tried it once
in CAML Light and the results were disappointing. But one reason was
that something like weak pointers either didn't exist or I didn't
know about them, so my hash tables rendered some ephemeral stuff=20
non-collectible.

I'll look forward to the release of your prover!

John.
