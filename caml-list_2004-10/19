I am learning OCaml now. The last two-three days I've written a small
prototype; then I have reviewed it and one of the observations was
that it contains no second-order function.

Possible reasons:
1. higher order functions are hard (intellectually unmanageable)
2. HOFs are not needed in practice above a certain order 
3. failure to recognize places where a HOF is needed (beyond the
standard examples in tutorial).

Number 3 was what prompted me to ask the question: a few examples
always help. Unfortunately I didn't yet had time to read the cited
articles :(.
