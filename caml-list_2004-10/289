Felix version 1.0.16 is now released under BSD style FFAU licence.
You can obtain it from

http://felix.sf.net/download

or from Gerd's Godi archive. Ocaml 3.0.8.1 or CVS version plus
Python and some kind of C++ compiler are required. It should
build on any Unix like platform including OSX and Cygwin.
[I need help to get a native Win32 version to build]

Felix is an Algol like language aimed at the C++ market,
but uses an ML style type system. The compiler is written
in Ocaml, and generates ISO C++. There is a heavy emphasis
on retaining C/C++ compatibility at both object and source
levels. It supports compile time parametric polymorphism,
overloading, recursive types, variants, first class
function closures, lexical scoping, garbage collection,
and type deduction for variables and function returns 
(but no inference of arguments). It also provides
standard support for heavy microthreading (cooperative
multi-tasking with O(1) context switching), and features
a non-side effecting functional subsystem separated
from procedural code with support from the type system.

This release contains a freestanding FISh 1.6 implementation,
which I may integrate more closely later. FISh 1 is a
polyadic array procesing language capable of 
outperforming C by up to 2:1 (with a C backend :).

Also new is support for STL built into the standard
distribution.

Optimisation is still flaky, however Felix is outperforming
Ocaml bytecode interpreter in the Alioth shootout.
