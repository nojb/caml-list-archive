I'd be very interested to hear the design decisions involved in such a 
project, and about the design of the current approach.

Also, I think tutorial pretty printers could be very helpful for people (like 
me!) learning how to do this.

Polymorphic pretty printers for types in the core library (Set, Map, Hashtbl) 
could be a handy add-on too. As a computer science teaching tool, perhaps 
these could be productively supplemented with graphical printers to print the 
internal representations as they evolve?

Cheers,
Jon.
