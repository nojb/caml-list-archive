Hi,

i was playing with ocaml (learning!) and bumped with something that i
think it might be a bug... since i didn't find anything explaining
this behaviour:

Objective Caml version 3.08.0

# print_string "**e";;
e- : unit = ()
# print_char '*';;
- : unit = ()
#

it seems that the '*' char is ignored at the beginning of the lines on
the windows gui, the same does -not- happen on the command line
version.

Is this a known problem? Sorry if this was reported already or if it a
known issue.

Tiago
