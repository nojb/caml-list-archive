What???  I know your distaste for the GPL, but there is no incompatibility
between the Ocaml standard libraries and a GPL'd program.  The Ocaml
libraries are LGPL with a special exception that lets you build executibles
using them, unrestricted.

The GPL is not an infectious agent.  It may be incompatible with some
libraries, but it doesn't contaminate other code, other than encouraging
people to put their own code under the GPL.

Or are you referring to some other "standard libraries"?

BTW, Christoph, the GPL seems to fit well with your stated goals.
