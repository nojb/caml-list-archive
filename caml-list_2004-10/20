I highly recommend keeping at it and joining the beginners list (if
you haven't already).  Making and using higher-order (as in 2nd or
3rd, at least) functions is one of those things that you start doing
after you've been using a functional language for a while.  It does
dramatically simplify your life when you start doing it, but it's not
immediately obvious how you'll use it.

Really, this is why people should try to gain experience with a
variety of languages: it greatly expands the variety of techniques
that you think of when trying to solve a problem.  The experience will
impact how you program in every language, whether or not it has those
tools.

In any case, good luck!
