I recently went through the objective caml sources, and printf uses a
module named obj that isn't described in the reference manual.
So I took a look at obj.mli, but it didn't help me much...
So I'm wondering what the functions in this module can be doing... All I

understood is that it provides access to the internal structures of
objects. But I'd like to know how to use the functions.
Can anyone help?
