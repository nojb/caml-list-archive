Consider that C is roughly a subset of C++. Since OCaml is technically
superior in every way to C, the OCaml implementors are then not very smart 
since certain libraries (bignums, regexps, ...) are coded in C, not pure 
OCaml, even though they could easily be written in pure OCaml. Since we
know the OCaml implementors are very smart, we have reduced the
hypothesis of unqualified OCaml superiority to an absurdity :-).

Use the right tool for the job. I probably wouldn't write hardware
simulation models in OCaml. I probably wouldn't write the program to 
do clock tree insertion or scan insertion (essentially build a parse tree 
of structural Verilog and then abuse it) in anything else. Well, maybe 
SML or Icon would not be horrible...
