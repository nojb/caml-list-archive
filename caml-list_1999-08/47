   ICFP    International Conference on Functional Programming 
   PPDP    Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming


Two-day workshops: 

   HOOTS   Higher-Order Operational Techniques in Semantics 
   IDL     Implementation of Declarative Languages 


One-day workshops: 

   COCL     Component-based Software Development in Computational Logic 
   DPS      Declarative Programming with Sets 
   FDPE     Functional and Declarative Programming in Education 
   HASKELL  workshop 
   LFM      Logical Frameworks and Meta-languages 
   OOSDS    Object-oriented Specification Techniques for
            Distributed Systems and Behaviours
