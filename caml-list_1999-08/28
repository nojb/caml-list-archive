I'd like to add some of my reflections to the discussion:

>* Ocaml is an academic langage

Functional languages are in use in the industry. I have working
experience with Erlang which is a functional language used in real time=

telecom software. This particular language (as far as I know anyway)
is being developed from scratch by and for the industry. See
www.erlang.org for information if interested.

>* Ocaml is a slow implementation

I think Ensemble could be a good example of rather advanced software
developed in Ocaml that achieves very good performance compared to
C/C++ equivalents.

/Jens
