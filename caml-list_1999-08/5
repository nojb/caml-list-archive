	Perhaps worse, I found that explicitly closing
a file does not always work. I do not understand why,
but this is surely a bug. This occured in the bytecode
interpreter, and went away in with the native code
compiler. [A program that wrote a file could not read it
after closing the output file and reopening it input]
