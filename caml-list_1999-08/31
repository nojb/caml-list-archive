I was wondering the same a while ago. Xavier Leroy told me the problem is
that the debugger uses processes and sockets extensively in a way that are
incompatible with the Windows implementation of sockets.

I tried to compile the debugger under windows, which works. Unfortunately,
the code tries to do a select on a number of handles (sockets and file
descriptors) and then the windows/unix interface fails, since Windows
apparently has no select implementation to wait on file handles and sockets.

It looks like what we need is a wrapper for file handles that makes them
appear as sockets.

There may be other issues too, but that's as far as I investigated.

Is some work being done on a debugger for the Mac/Windows OCaml versions ?

Thanks,
