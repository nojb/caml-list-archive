Interface OCaml to the C code (C++ is harder if you use exception)
if that makes sense (but maybe it doesn't).

Can be refuted. ocamlopt is not that bad, and brings more
advantages (e.g. symbolic-manipulation requires decent and safe memory
allocation, safe typing and all that).

Simple test: throw the OCaml distribution at a C++ engineer, ask the guy
to write a semi-simple program in it. Chances are the engineer will be able
to do that in one afternoon (including installing the compiler). 
This is based on a true story (tech due diligence on us by people we're working
with, I can't disclose the name).

> * Ocaml might not last long (but ESPRIT projects don't last neither)

True, but the compiler is stable. How often do you need to update the compiler 
?

> ESPRIT projects are supposed to be preindustrial and OCaml is only academic

How many ESPRIT projects actually produce code that is being used ?
