Yes, that's the basic idea.  Most Fortran compilers (except perhaps
some Fortran 9x stuff) have a pretty straightforward interface with C,
so it's not as bad as it sounds.

Several of your colleagues at CEA have significant experience on
interfacing Fortran libraries with Caml code.  You can look on the
archives of the Caml mailing list
(http://caml.inria.fr/bin/msearch/caml-list) for previous discussions
on this topic.

All the best,
