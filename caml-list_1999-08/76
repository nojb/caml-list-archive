The Unison project at Penn is developing a portable file synchronizer -- 
a user-level tool for maintaining consistency between replicated
filesystems (e.g. on laptops and fileservers).

This summer, we have been working on a complete redesign and
reimplementation of the system (in OCaml, of course).  The new
implementation is now in daily use by the developers and friends, and
we'd like to have a few more "hacker" users to help us shake out the
last bugs before making a broader release.

If you're interested in giving it a try, please send me mail and I'll
tell you where to grab the distribution and documentation.  What I'll
ask in return is a short message describing your experience with
installing and using the tool.

Unison runs on Windows and many flavors of Unix.  The current
distribution requires GNU make and an up-to-date (version 2.01 or
2.02) Objective Caml compiler.  We are also working on a binary
distribution; if you'd like to be notified when this becomes
available, let me know.
