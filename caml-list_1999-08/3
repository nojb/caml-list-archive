Hello,

in case you have encountered strange behaviour with the just released
OCaml-PCRE library on 64-bit architectures - this problem is now fixed
and the changed sources can be downloaded again...

Reason:

  OCaml always takes the "bigger" possibility for integers on 64-bit
  architectures (long int), but the C-library PCRE always returns 32-bit
  integers (int) for pattern offsets. Thus, the integer array of offsets
  had to be converted from 32-bit to 64-bit ones...

Sorry for possible inconveniences...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
