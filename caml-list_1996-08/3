Hi!

If Xavier did process the files, there should be a version of O'Caml for
DOS in the usercontrib directory on inria. The DOS-version is a full port
of the O'Caml for Win32 to the DOS-Environment - it includes all utilities
and most of the libraries (not included are the unix and the thread
library). It uses Watcom-C, the Microsoft Assembler and some
not-so-much-known DOS-Extender (sorry, the Watcom-Extender DOS4GW is not
usable). The bytecode-parts should be usable bye everyone, as long as you
don't need -custom - if you need that, you need the DOS-extender (it's the
Causeway-DOS-Extender). Should run in any DOS-box or DOS-compatible
environment (even DPMI or other memory managers should be ok).

Sorry that it's a bit "heavy" on needed tools, I am currently working on
it. The problem is that the Watcom-compiler isn't as good as is often said
- many bugs in the supporting utilities (especially the assembler, the
linker and the extender).

There should be a ocamlbin.exe with all binaries (selfextracting archive)
and ocamlsrc.exe, which includes all needed sources and batches to rebuild
the system.

There is a README.DOS with more information on the port. Comments on the
port are welcome.

bye, Georg
