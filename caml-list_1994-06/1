The new version of the Bigloo optimizing Caml compiler is now
available by anonymous ftp from ftp.inria.fr (192.93.2.54), directory
lang/caml-light, file  bcl1.6c.0.2.unix.tar.gz.

This new version fixes some bugs, and implements new optimisations.

As a side-effect of the Bigloo ML/Scheme interface facility, the
call/cc primitive is now available in Caml source files (see the
contrib/libcallcc/README file for more information).

Bigloo is bootstrapped and fully compliant with the Caml Light 0.6
compiler and the Caml Light libraries (including camlyacc, camllex).
It can be considered as an alternative to the regular camlc compiler.
In particular, it has successfully compiled many complex Caml Light
programs, including camlc and the Coq system (the ``calculus of
constructions'', a proof assistant).

Bigloo is running on the following unix platforms:
- SPARC (1, 2, 10) under Bsd and Solaris 2.xx
- SONY-NEWS (mips r3000)
- IRIS indigo (mips r3000)
- SUN 3/60
- DEC Station 3100 (mips r3000)
- HP-PA (730)
- PC-linux (i486)

To install and use Bigloo, you need an ANSI C compiler.
