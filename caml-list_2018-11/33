I find it odd that simplifying the life of the developer is the highest
priority.  Doesn't one want to simplify the life of the user?  Ideally the
user who has never touched OCaml before in his life?

As a simple example, the web page for installing OCaml says that the
recommended way to install ocaml is to install opam.  There is a link to a
page explaining how to install opam.  How should anyone even have
confidence that they will end up with OCaml after following those
instructions?  Even step 1 of the installation process leads the user to
confusion.
