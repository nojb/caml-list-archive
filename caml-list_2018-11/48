The question is what to do after installing opam.  Even if there is
nothing to do after installing opam, it would be helpful to say that.  If
there is something to do after installing opam to get the ocaml compiler
for example, as opposed to just the runtime system, it would be helpful to
say that too.  The documentation should be designed from the point of view
of the person who has never used ocaml or opam, never wants to use them
again, and has no contact with the ocaml community. Otherwise, people who
want to try some ocaml software, but are not actually forced to use it,
will just give up.
