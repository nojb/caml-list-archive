Dear Julia, dear all,

Thanks for the helpful reminder that the opam and ocaml documentation
needs a refresh.  We=E2=80=99ve just gone through a fairly major release cy=
cle with
opam2 and dune1, and it=E2=80=99s to be expected that there are some incons=
istencies.

To clear up one misconception on this thread =E2=80=94 opam is *not* the on=
ly
recommended mechanism to get the OCaml compiler.  We go to some
trouble to ensure that OCaml is packaged up natively on the OS package
managers where possible, and there is a list on the ocaml.org installation
page with popular distributions.

The problems begin when the user needs a particular version of OCaml,
which is a common requirement for teaching.  The system package=20
managers typically lag in their versions (again, listed on the ocaml.org
installation page).  At this point, opam is indeed the simplest tool to boo=
tstrap
the precise version of the compiler and packages that you require, but
at the expense of requiring an OCaml-specific tool.

Now, I recognise the need for improving the installation instructions,
and particularly so with step-by-step guides to getting things installed.
However, I would implore those with complaints to register the inaccuracies
on the opam issue tracker [1], so that we can at least learn about them
and fix them just as we do with any software bug.

[1] https://github.com/ocaml/opam/issues

It=E2=80=99s particularly frustrating to see these threads erupt with pent =
up
(and valid) annoyances from users that we could have addressed if someone
had reported it. Even better, please do send in PRs with some suggested
text for the website, and take some load off our overworked maintainers :-)

For whoever said that my Ubuntu opam2 PPA is hard to Google,=20
the process of creating it was roughly:

- spend a few hours fighting with the Debian packaging scripts
- get x86_64/i386/arm32/arm64/ppc64le all working in Launchpad
- post on https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/opam-2-0-experimental-ppas/2446 to ge=
t no feedback whatsoever
- eventually just push it live after one user gets back with feedback
- wait for complaints to show up that its hard to find

Without feedback, it=E2=80=99s very difficult to know what to prioritise, a=
nd
Ubuntu is just one of many, many Linux distributions that we have to
worry about.

This is indeed the result of progress on the tooling side.  There=E2=80=99s=
 been
a lot of work in the last few years on deprecating older tools (camlp4,
ocamlbuild) and moving towards modern alternatives such as dune
for build and opam2 for publishing.

Things are settling down now: dune is emerging as a well-maintained
and portable alternative to the myriad of build systems that have been
proposed in the past.  The bootstrapping problems you mention should
also have become a *lot* easier with opam2, since the solver is linked
into the binary and no external aspcud is needed.  If you do still run
into any problems with fakeroots and such, please report them on the
dune or opam issue tracker and we=E2=80=99ll take a look.

Behind the scenes, there are other benefits from a consistent build
system: cross compilation and Windows support are greatly improved
now.

Our goal (with my dune and opam developer hat on) is to provide sufficient
metadata within a dune description of a project to automatically generate
opam *and* upstreamable OS packages (from templates).  This will
look something like =E2=80=9Cdune @package=E2=80=9D and really reduce the b=
urden on
developers and OS maintainers.  I=E2=80=99d like, for example, the native O=
penBSD
packages to be able to be replaced by a mechanically generated version.

See this issue for more: https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/1498

I completely agree with this sentiment.  I=E2=80=99m personally motivated to
make sure ocaml/opam meet these standards, as we are moving to
teaching using OCaml in the Cambridge University Computer Lab
from next year, so I=E2=80=99ll definitely be proposing some changes myself=
 :-)

I=E2=80=99d love to hear from other teachers about the sort of environments=
 you
have to work in =E2=80=94 we=E2=80=99ve been considering shifting to a comb=
ination of
browser-based IDEs (for homogeneity across student laptops) and
other systems.

Finally, this thread might seem like it is full of complaints, but the tool=
ing
is steadily improving and leaving behind silent and satisfied users.
Dune in particular has made as big a difference to our community as
opam did when it was first released five years ago.  At ICFP this year,
the OCaml Workshop was full of industrial users who were thankful for
Dune improving their day-to-day development, as well as the ecosystem
of new tools such as ocamlformat, merlin, odoc and so on, and the Coq
project is moving to adopt it now as well!  I=E2=80=99m not suggesting we r=
est on
our laurels, but as the year end holiday approaches, I would be delighted
if users to email their favourite tool developer a note of encouragement to
continue to work on it.  And then file an issue to get the docs fixed :-)

regards,
Anil=

class=3D""></div>Dear Julia, dear all,</div><div><br class=3D""></div><div>=
Thanks for the helpful reminder that the opam and ocaml documentation</div>=
<div>needs a refresh. &nbsp;We=E2=80=99ve just gone through a fairly major =
release cycle with</div><div>opam2 and dune1, and it=E2=80=99s to be expect=
ed that there are some inconsistencies.</div><div><br class=3D""></div><div=
>To clear up one misconception on this thread =E2=80=94 opam is *not* the o=
nly</div><div>recommended mechanism to get the OCaml compiler. &nbsp;We go =
to some</div><div>trouble to ensure that OCaml is packaged up natively on t=
he OS package</div><div>managers where possible, and there is a list on the=
 <a href=3D"http://ocaml.org" class=3D"">ocaml.org</a> installation</div><d=
iv>page with popular distributions.</div><div><br class=3D""></div><div>The=
 problems begin when the user needs a particular version of OCaml,</div><di=
v>which is a common requirement for teaching. &nbsp;The system package&nbsp=
;</div><div>managers typically lag in their versions (again, listed on the =
<a href=3D"http://ocaml.org" class=3D"">ocaml.org</a></div><div>installatio=
n page). &nbsp;At this point, opam is indeed the simplest tool to bootstrap=
</div><div>the precise version of the compiler and packages that you requir=
e, but</div><div>at the expense of requiring an OCaml-specific tool.</div><=
div><br class=3D""></div><div>Now, I recognise the need for improving the i=
nstallation instructions,</div><div>and particularly so with step-by-step g=
uides to getting things installed.</div><div>However, I would implore those=
 with complaints to register the inaccuracies</div><div>on the opam issue t=
racker [1], so that we can at least learn about them</div><div>and fix them=
 just as we do with any software bug.</div><div><br class=3D""></div><div>[=
