elopers, and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency, and pr=
omote its applications.

    Marta Kwiatkowska - University of Oxford (UK)
    Kim G. Larsen - Aalborg University (Denmark)
    Joel Ouaknine - Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (Germany)
    Jaco van de Pol - Aarhus University (Denmark)

Co-located conference

    17th International Conference on Formal Modelling and Analysis of Timed=
 Systems (FORMATS 2019)

Co-located workshops

    Combined 26th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency a=
nd 16th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2019)
    8th IFIP WG 1.8 Workshop on Trends in Concurrency Theory (TRENDS 2019)
    4th International workshop on TIming Performance engineering for Safety=
 critical systems (TIPS 2019)

IMPORTANT DATES

All dates are AoE.

Abstract submission:
April 15, 2019

Paper submission:
April 22, 2019

Notification:
June 14, 2019

Camera ready copy:
July 3, 2019

Conference:
August 27-30, 2019


TOPICS

Submissions are solicited in semantics, logics, verification and analysis o=
f concurrent systems. The principal topics include (but are not limited to):

    Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, domain-theoretic=
 models, game-theoretic models, process algebras, graph transformation syst=
ems, Petri nets, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative systems, probabil=
istic systems, real-time systems, biology-inspired systems, and synchronous=
 systems;
    Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, probabilistic and stochast=
ic logics, temporal logics, and resource logics;
    Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such as abs=
tract interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race detection, p=
re-order and equivalence checking, run-time verification, state-space explo=
ration, static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, type systems,=
 and security analysis;
    Distributed algorithms and data structures: design, analysis, complexit=
y, correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability, consistency, se=
lf-organization, self-stabilization, protocols;
    Theoretical foundations of architectures, execution environments, and s=
oftware development for concurrent systems such as geo-replicated systems, =
communication networks, multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, shared=
 and transactional memory, resource management and awareness, compilers and=
 tools for concurrent programming, programming models such as component-bas=
ed, object- and service-oriented.


PAPER SUBMISSION

CONCUR 2019 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or =
experience related to the topics mentioned below. All papers must be origin=
al, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.

Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. The paper may be supplem=
ented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the discret=
ion of the program committee.

The CONCUR 2019 proceedings will be published by LIPIcs.

Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files via EasyChair.

Papers must not exceed 14 pages (excluding references and clearly marked ap=
pendices) using the LIPIcs style.
