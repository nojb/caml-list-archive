Yes, but the copyright holder does not get to dictate the interpretation.

Absolutely - and hence why it's sensible to ask!

Yes, I agree - sorry, I made my point unclearly. The point I was making is =
that if Inria were to say "no, we don't accept that as satisfying the licen=
ce" then that is just their opinion. You can still do it, you just know tha=
t you're likely to end up in court testing the licence if you do. The arbit=
er in a difference of opinion on interpretation is the legal system, not th=
e copyright holder.
