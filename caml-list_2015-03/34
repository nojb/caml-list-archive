Subject: Re: [Caml-list] pycaml

Are we talking about http://sourceforge.net/projects/pycaml/ ?

I'm surprised the project actually works at all. The last version is 
from 2004, and iirc, it was already not working 4 years ago.

I'm pretty sure you can adopt it. The work to update it may be 
significant. As far as I (and opam) knows, there are no other choices 
currently.
I think Jeremy Yallop had plans for pytypes, similar to 
https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes but for python.
