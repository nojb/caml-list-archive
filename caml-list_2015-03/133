[we apologize for multiple receptions]

====================================================================
                            ICFEM 2015
   The 17th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods

                        Call for workshops

                      http://icfem2015.lri.fr/

The ICFEM 2015 conferences invites workshops as satellite events.
Such satellite events must be related to the ICFEM conference, and may

considered):

* Abstraction and refinement
* Formal specification and modeling
* Program analysis
* Software verification
* Software model checking
* Formal approaches to software testing
* Formal methods for self-adaptive systems, for object and component
systems, concurrent and real-time systems, for cloud computing and
cyber-physical systems, for software safety, security, reliability and
dependability
* Tool development, integration and experiments involving verified systems
* Formal methods used in certifying products under international standards
* Formal model-based development and code generation
* Computer security
* Aeronautics
* Train control systems

The ICFEM 2015 workshops will be held immediately after the conference,
i.e., on Friday 6th of November, 2O15.
(If needed, two-day workshops can take place on Saturday 7th as well.)


SUBMISSION

Workshop organizers are invited to submit proposals by e-mail to

* any other useful information (invited speakers, etc.)

Workshop organizers will be responsible for:
* scientific organization: selection of the invited speakers and regular
speakers
* publication of the proceedings (if any)
