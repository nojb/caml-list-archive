APLAS 2015, Call for Papers
13th Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
Pohang, Korea, November 30 - December 2, 2015
< http://pl.postech.ac.kr/aplas2015/>
*********************************************************************

*IMPORTANT DATES*
Submission deadline: June 5, 2015
Author notification: August 17, 2015
Conference: November 30 - December 2, 2015

*INVITED SPEAKERS*
Peter O'Hearn, Facebook
Sukyoung Ryu, KAIST
Eran Yahav, Technion
Hongseok Yang, University of Oxford

*ABOUT*
APLAS aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of
ideas in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia,
but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming
language community.

APLAS is sponsored by the  Asian Association for Foundation of
Software (AAFS), founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with
many researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were
successfully held in Singapore ('14), Melbourne ('13), Kyoto ('12),
Kenting ('11),  Shanghai ('10),  Seoul ('09),  Bangalore ('08),
Singapore ('07),  Sydney ('06),  Tsukuba ('05),  Taipei ('04)  and
Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops. Proceedings of the past
symposiums were published in Springer's LNCS.

*TOPICS*
The symposium is devoted to foundational and practical issues in
programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on topics
such as
* semantics, logics, foundational theory
* design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi
* domain-specific languages
* compilers, interpreters, abstract machines
* program derivation, synthesis and transformation
* program analysis, verification, model-checking
* logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming
* software security
* concurrency and parallelism
* tools and environments for programming and implementation
Topics are not limited to those discussed in previous symposiums.
Papers identifying future directions of programming and those
addressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms
are especially welcome. Demonstration of systems and tools in the
scope of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool presentations
category. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are
welcome to consult with program chair prior to submission.

*SUBMISSION*
We solicit submissions in two categories:
a) Regular research papers
 - describing original scientific research results, including tool
   development and case studies. Regular research papers should not
   exceed 18 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including
   bibliography and figures. They should clearly identify what has
   been accomplished and why it is significant. Submissions will be
   judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness,
   originality, and clarity. In case of lack of space, proofs,
   experimental results, or any information supporting the technical
   results of the paper could be provided as an appendix or a link to
   a web page, but reviewers are not obliged to read them.
b) System and tool presentations
 - describing systems or tools that support theory, program
   construction, reasoning, or program execution in the scope of
   APLAS. System and Tool presentations are expected to be centered
   around a demonstration. The paper and the demonstration should
   identify the novelties of the tools and use motivating examples.
   System and Tool papers should not exceed 8 pages in the Springer
   LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. Submissions will
   be judged based on both the papers and the described systems or
   tools. It is highly desirable that the tools are available on the
   web.
Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English.
The proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer's
LNCS series. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.
