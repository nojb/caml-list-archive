Subject: [Caml-list] PhD position, Data Semantics/Semantic Web, Wright State
 University

Data Semantics Laboratory
directed by Pascal Hitzler and Michelle Cheatham
Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Wright State University
Dayton, Ohio, USA

The Data Semantics (DaSe) Lab at the Department of Computer Science at 
Wright State University seeks one or more PhD students to pursue 
research in applied or foundational aspects of Data Semantics, Semantic 
Web, Ontologies, Linked Data, Semantic Information Integration, 
Cybersecurity, Geo- or Earth Sciences. Funding includes a monthly 
stipend plus tuition costs.

The DaSe Lab (directed by Michelle Cheatham and Pascal Hitzler, see 
http://www.michellecheatham.com/ and http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/ for 
more information) is an internationally prominent research group with 
focus on foundations and applications of Semantic Web technologies. Lab 
members primarily contribute to ongoing research projects, but 
occasionally also get involved in teaching and administrative tasks. The 
new students will likely focus on research topics related to 
ontology-based Data Science applications.

Applicants need strong programming skills, including familiarity with a 
wide variety of data structures and comfort in integrating existing 
libraries into their programs. Additionally, applicants should have 
excellent communication skills and excel in team work. Intellectual 
curiosity, a wide range of interests, and the ability and stamina to 
pursue challenging long-term goals is required. It is preferable, but 
not required, that applicants had previous exposure to lab research topics.

Applicants should send their application to 
daselab-jobs@googlegroups.com. It shall consist of a single pdf file 
containing a detailed curriculum vitae including grades, plus a cover 
letter in the email body which includes

* GPA of all degrees completed or under progress, with explanations how 
to convert the grading system, if degree is from outside the U.S.

* GRE score (both verbal and quantitative) or date when GRE score will 
be available

* Scores of most recent English language tests if non-native English 
speaker.

Applications which do not comply with these requirements may be ignored. 
Successful applicants must satisfy the formal requirements for pursuing 
a PhD degree in Computer Science at Wright State University, see 
http://cse.wright.edu/academic-program/phd-computer-science-and-engineering.

Processing of applications will begin immediately and commence until 
positions are filled. We expect to make first decisions in April 2015.

Please send applications and inquiries to
daselab-jobs@googlegroups.com.

Best Regards,

Pascal Hitzler
