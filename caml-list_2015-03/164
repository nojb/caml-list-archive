Subject: [Caml-list] Mentoring workshop @ ICFP

CALL for Applications for Student Travel Support

SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop @ ICFP
Vancouver, BC (co-located with ICFP 2015)
Sunday, August 30th, 2015

http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/

We are pleased to invite students interested in functional programming rese=
arch to the programming languages mentoring workshop at ICFP. The goal of t=
his workshop is to introduce senior undergraduate and early graduate studen=
ts to research topics in functional programming as well as provide career m=
entoring advice to help them get through graduate school, land a great job,=
 and succeed. We have recruited leaders from the functional programming com=
munity to provide overviews of current research topics, and give
students valuable advice about how to thrive in graduate school, search for=
 a job, and cultivate habits and skills that will help them in research car=
eers.

This workshop is part of the activities surrounding ICFP, the International=
 Conference on Functional Programming, and takes place the day before the m=
ain conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the ICFP conference mor=
e accessible to newcomers and we hope that participants will stay through t=
he entire conference.

Through the generous donation of our sponsors, we are able to provide trave=
l scholarships to fund student participation. These travel scholarships wil=
l cover reasonable travel expenses (airfare, hotel and registration fees) f=
or attendance at both the workshop and the ICFP
conference. Anyone may apply for a travel scholarship, but first priority w=
ill be given to women and underrepresented minority applicants from the Uni=
ted States and Canada.

The workshop is open to all. Students with alternative sources of funding f=
or their travel and registration fees are welcome. In particular, many stud=
ent attendance programs provide full or partial travel funding for students=
 to attend ICFP 2015, including the ACM Student Research Competition. More =
information about student attendance programs at ICFP is available: http://=
icfpconference.org/icfp2015/student-attendance.html=20=20

APPLICATION for TRAVEL SUPPORT:
The travel funding application is available here: http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg=
/icfp-plmw/
The deadline for full consideration of funding is April 24th, 2015. Selecte=
d participants will be notified starting June 5th.

ORGANIZERS:
Ron Garcia, University of British Columbia
Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania
with Kathleen Fisher, Tufts University (and General Chair, ICFP 2015)
