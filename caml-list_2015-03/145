*** Last Call for Workshop Papers ***

The 20th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC 2015)

6-9 July 2015, Golden Bay Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

http://ieee-iscc.org/2015

*** Final Submission Deadline: March 30th, 2015 (firm) ***


ISCC 2015, in its 20th  anniversary, will provide an insight into the unique
world stemming from the interaction between the fields of computers and
communications. ISCC 2015 will provide an international technical forum for
experts from industry and academia to exchange ideas and present results of
ongoing research in most state-of-the-art areas of computer and
communications. This year, special focus will be on the challenging issues
and opportunities related to the computing, sensing and communication in
the era of the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Big Data.

The ISSC 2015 workshops cover topics such as 5G, Internet of Things,
Software-Defined Networking, Big Data, Cloud Computing, M2M
communications or Smart Grid. The purpose of these workshops is to
provide a platform for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and possibly
more sharply focused way than at the conference itself. All papers included
in the ISCC 2015 workshops, will be submitted for inclusion in the
conference proceedings published by IEEE.

ISCC 2015 will feature the following workshops:

=B7 Management of Cloud and Smart city systems (MoCS 2015)

=B7 Performance Evaluation of Communications in Distributed Systems
and Web based Service Architectures (PEDISWESA 2015)

=B7 Smart City and Ubiquitous Computing Applications (SCUCA 2015)

=B7 Distributed Mobile Systems & Services (DMSS 2015)

=B7 A 5G Wireless Odyssey: 2020 (5G)

=B7 Security and Forensics in Communication Systems (SFCS 2015)

More information about each workshop and submission guidelines
can be found at each workshop's web site, accessible from the conference
web site.
