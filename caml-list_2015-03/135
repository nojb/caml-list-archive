Well, I gave this a shot, and got more errors. I'm going to list what I
did, and then copy the errors, and then I'm out for the day.

git clone https://github.com/alavrik/piqi.git
cd piqi/piqilib
make && make ocaml
ocamlfind ocamlc -ccopt "-fPIC -DPIC -shared -DNATIVE_CODE  -o
piqi_c_impl.so " piqi_c_impl.c
ocamlfind ocamlc -a -custom             -dllib piqilib_stubs    -o

cp piqi_c_impl.so piqilib_stubs.so
utop -require mylib

(mylib being the bap package that was compiled with oasis where a
BuildDepends: piqilib specified a need).

-----------
Cannot load required shared library dllpiqilib_stubs.
Reason: ./dllpiqilib_stubs.so: ./dllpiqilib_stubs.so: only ET_DYN and
ET_EXEC can be loaded.

Error: Reference to undefined global `Piqi_convert'
