Subject: [Caml-list] Horn Clauses for Verification and Synthesis - Call for
 Papers

Call for Papers

Horn Clauses for Verification and Synthesis (HCVS)

July 19, 2015 - San Francisco, USA

Submission deadlines:

- paper submission: May 22, 2015
- paper notification: June 19, 2015

Most Program Verification and Synthesis problems of interest can be
modeled directly using Horn clauses and many recent advances in the
CLP and CAV communities have centered around efficiently solving
problems presented as Horn clauses.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in the two
communities of Constraint/Logic Programming (e.g., ICLP and CP) and
Program Verification community (e.g., CAV, TACAS, and VMCAI) on the
topic of Horn clause based analysis, verification and synthesis.

Horn clauses for verification and synthesis have been advocated by
these two communities in different times and from different
perspectives and this workshop is organized to stimulate interaction
and a fruitful exchange and integration of experiences.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the use of Horn
clauses, constraints, and related formalisms in the following areas:

- Analysis and verification of programs in various programming
  paradigms (e.g., imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic,
  higher-order, concurrent)
- Program synthesis
- Program testing
- Program transformation
- Constraint solving
- Type systems
- Case studies and tools
- Challenging problems

We solicit regular papers describing theory and implementation of
Horn-clause based analysis and tool descriptions. We also solicit
extended abstracts describing work-in-progress and presentations
covering previously published results that are of interest to the
workshop.

Invited speakers:

- Ranjit Jhala, University of California at San Diego
- Joxan Jaffar, National University of Singapore

them will be present at the workshop.  Papers must be submitted
