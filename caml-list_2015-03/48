Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ocaml compiler license

David, you are right: one cannot "change" the terms of a licence used
on a piece of code after releasing this piece of code under this licence.
But we are talking about "interpretation" of these terms, which is quite
a different story.

If you look at FSF/OSI/<whatever other external entity including me> to know
whether a git branch is fine as an implementation of "separate", you only get an
opinion... maybe a well respected opinion, but just an opinion that may become
the subject of debate later on. And avoiding debate is a desirable thing.

If Inria says publicly (e.g. on this mailing list): "for us it's fine to see
OCaml derivatives developed and published as separate git branches", then you
get the work owner's explicit statement that this practice is acceptable for the
only entity entitled to enforce the licence.  And that's the end of the story:
simple, clear, undebatable, no hassle.

Cheers

Once you've released something covered by a licence, the terms are only clear as exactly what you've put in the licence. You don't get to say on later enquiry, "oh, I didn't think of that - no, you should interpret it this way". That's what courts (i.e. legal tests) are for and why licences should be written by lawyers. And at that point it *is* useful to look at OSI and FSF opinion, because what a court will take great interest in is legal precedent or, in its absence, what everyone else using those terms thinks.
