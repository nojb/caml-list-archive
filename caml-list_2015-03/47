Only as a legal aside, that is a *sensible* thing to do, but it is *not* ho=
w copyright works. Once you've released something covered by a licence, the=
 terms are only clear as exactly what you've put in the licence. You don't =
get to say on later enquiry, "oh, I didn't think of that - no, you should i=
nterpret it this way". That's what courts (i.e. legal tests) are for and wh=
y licences should be written by lawyers. And at that point it *is* useful t=
o look at OSI and FSF opinion, because what a court will take great interes=
t in is legal precedent or, in its absence, what everyone else using those =
terms thinks.
