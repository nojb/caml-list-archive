SUBMISSION DEADLINE FOR INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:  APRIL 24, 2015

CALL FOR INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS

There is a remarkable difference in conference style between computer 
science and mathematics conferences. Mathematics conferences allow 
for informal presentations that are prepared very shortly before the 
conference and inform the participants about current research and 
work in progress. The format of computer science conferences with 
pre-conference proceedings is not able to accommodate this form of 
scientific communication.

Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, also this year's 
CiE conference endeavours to get the best of both worlds. In addition 
to the formal presentations based on our LNCS proceedings volume, we 
invite researchers to present informal presentations. For this, please 
send us a brief description of your talk (between one paragraph and 
one page) by:

APRIL 24, 2015

Please submit your abstract electronically, via EasyChair 
<https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=cie2015>, 
selecting the category "Informal Presentation".

You will be notified whether your talk has been accepted for informal 
presentation usually within a week or two after your submission.

If you intend to apply for the ASL Student Travel Award, you might 
need us to confirm that your are going to give a presentation at 
CiE 2015 (applications of students who are presenting get higher 
priority). Therefore, we would like to ask you to submit your informal 
presentations by March 25 so that we can send you the notification 
before the ASL deadline of March 28.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES:

CiE 2015 has received funding from the ASL (Association for Symbolic 
Logic) and EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer 
Science) that allows students who are members of ASL or EATCS and 
want to attend CiE 2015 to apply for travel funds or a reduction of 
the early registration fee.

Preference will be given to presenters of accepted papers.

Applications for ASL travel grants have to be addressed directly to 
ASL, with a strict deadline of March 28, 2015.

Applications for EATCS travel grants have to be sent to 
cie2015@fmi.unibuc.ro 
prior to the early registration deadline.
