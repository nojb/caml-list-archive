Subject: [Caml-list] ocamlnet and missing SRP functions in gnutls

Hi,

when trying to use gnutls for TLS-secured
connections with ocamlnet, I encounter a
problem with SRP functions.

When linking with package nettls-gnutls of
ocamlnet, I get the following linking errors
(excerpt here, full log at the end).

/local/ferre/.opam/system/lib/nettls-gnutls/libnettls-gnutls.a(nettls_gnutls_bindings_stubs.o): 
In function `abs_gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t_finalize':
/home/ferre/.opam/system/build/ocamlnet.4.0.2/src/nettls-gnutls/nettls_gnutls_bindings_stubs.c:1841: 
undefined reference to `gnutls_srp_free_client_credentials'
[...]

All undefined functions start with 'gnutls_srp_'. After
some web search, I found that those functions are excluded
in some Linux distributions (mine is a Fedora) because of
patent issues.

Are those functions really necessary for TLS connections ?
If not, is there a patch of the package 'nettls-gnutls' that
avoids them ? If yes, is there a workaround ? Has anybody else
encounter the same problem.

My global objective is to provide a secure authentication
for a Web application.

Thanks,
---
