Subject: [Caml-list] Verification Mentoring Workshop Student Scholarships

Verification Mentoring Workshop 2015: 
CALL for Applications for Student Travel Scholarships 
-----------------------------------------------------

We are organizing a new one-day workshop called the Verification Mentoring 
Workshop (VMW). It is co-located with the International Conference on Computer 
Aided Verification (CAV), to be held in San Francisco, July 18-24, 2015. CAV 
is a premier conference in the area of verification, dedicated to the 
advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis 
methods for hardware and software systems.

The goal of VMW is to attract early-stage graduate students to pursue research 
careers in the area of computer-aided verification and formal methods.  Invited 
talks at the workshop will cover a broad overview of research topics in the 
area (so students can follow sessions of interest at CAV), the range of career 
options and perspectives (academia, industry, research labs, etc.), and job 
search advice (especially from young researchers). Participation of women and 
under-represented minorities is especially encouraged. 

We will provide travel scholarships to student participants, where the 
scholarships will cover registration for the VMW workshop and CAV conference, 
accommodations, plus travel expenses. The workshop website 
(http://i-cav.org/2015/workshop-mentorship/) is now accepting applications for 
student travel scholarships. 

Important Dates:
----------------
Deadline for submission of applications: April 20, 2015
Notification of travel scholarships awarded: May 1, 2015
VMW Workshop: July 19, 2015
CAV Conference: July 20 - 24, 2015

VMW 2015 is partially supported by the NSF (National Science Foundation, USA).
