Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Utop Difficulties with C callbacks

I have to run, but think the problem is that piqilib is not building a
shared library for its C stubs: if you want to be able to load a
library with C stubs in the toplevel, the stubs must be packed into a
shared library. You normally do this with ocamlmklib and pass a -dllib
option when building the .cma. oasis does all that automatically.

This other option is to build the bytecode executable with -custom,
which will link the C libraries, the ocamlrun executable and the
bytecode into a single native executable.

So simply adding -custom when building a custom utop should work. But
the proper fix is to update piqilib to build a .so for its C stubs.
