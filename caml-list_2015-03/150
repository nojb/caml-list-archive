 LOLA 2015: Syntax and Semantics of Low Level Languages

 Sunday, 5 July 2015, Kyoto, Japan
 A satellite workshop of ICALP/LICS
 http://lola15.tcs.ifi.lmu.de
______________________________________________________________________


/Important Dates/

Abstract submission: Monday, 20 April 2015
Author notification: Friday, 1 May 2015
LOLA 2015 workshop: Sunday, 5 July 2015

/Invited Speakers/

Katsuhiro Ueno, Tohoku University, Japan
Other invited speakers to be announced.

/Workshop Description/

It has been understood since the late 1960s that tools and structures
arising in mathematical logic and proof theory can usefully be applied
to the design of high level programming languages, and to the
development of reasoning principles for such languages. Yet low level
languages, such as machine code, and the compilation of high level
languages into a low level ones have traditionally been seen as having
little or no essential connection to logic.

However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been that low
level languages are also governed by logical principles. From this key
observation has emerged an active and fascinating new research area at
the frontier of logic and computer science. The practically-motivated
design of logics reflecting the structure of low level languages (such
as heaps, registers and code pointers) and low level properties of
programs (such as resource usage) goes hand in hand with some of the
most advanced contemporary research in semantics and proof theory,
including classical realizability and forcing, double orthogonality,
parametricity, linear logic, game semantics, uniformity, categorical
semantics, explicit substitutions, abstract machines, implicit
complexity and resource bounded programming.

The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS 2015, will bring together
researchers interested in many aspects of the relationship between
logic and low level languages and programs. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

- Typed assembly languages
- Certified assembly programming
- Certified and certifying compilation
- Relaxed memory models
- Proof-carrying code
- Program optimization
- Modal logic and realizability in machine code
- Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code
- Parametricity, modules and existential types
- General references, Kripke models and recursive types
- Continuations and concurrency
- Implicit complexity, sublinear programming and Turing machines
- Closures and explicit substitutions
- Linear logic and separation logic
- Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis
- Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects


/Submission Information/

LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of useful
interaction amongst the participants, welcoming proposals for talks on
work in progress, overviews of larger programmes, position
presentations and short tutorials as well as more traditional research
talks describing new results.

The program committee will select the workshop presentations from
submitted talk proposals, which may take the form either of a
*two page abstract* or of a longer (published or unpublished) paper
describing completed work.

Abstracts can be submitted using EasyChair at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlola2015
