Subject: [Caml-list] [TFPIE 2015] 2nd call for papers

      Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE 2015)
                        2nd Call for papers
             https://wiki.science.ru.nl/tfpie/TFPIE2015

The 4th International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in 
Education,
TFPIE 2015, will be held on June 2, 2015 in Sophia-Antipolis in France. 
It is
co-located with the Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP 2015)
which takes place from June 3 - 5.

*** Goal ***

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals 
that use,
or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education. 
TFPIE aims
to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and 
work-in-progress on
the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day
workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review 
process for
publication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2015 will screen
submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of
interest to participants. Potential presenters are invited to submit an 
extended
abstract (4-6 pages) or a draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The
authors of accepted presentations will have their preprints and their slides
made available on the workshop's website/wiki. Visitors to the TFPIE 2015
website/wiki will be able to add comments. This includes presenters who may
respond to comments and questions as well as provide pointers to 
improvements
and follow-up work. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to 
submit (a
revised version of) their article for review. The PC will select the best
articles for publication in the journal Electronic Proceedings in 
Theoretical
Computer Science (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and extended
abstracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC. TFPIE workshops have
previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012), Provo Utah, USA 
(2013), and
Soesterberg, The Netherlands (2014).

*** Program Committee ***

Peter Achten, Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Edwin Brady, University of St Andrews, UK
Johan Jeuring, Utrecht University and Open University, The Netherlands 
(Chair)
Shriram Krishnamurthi, Brown University, US
Rita Loogen, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany
Marco Morazan, Seton Hall University, US
Norman Ramsey, Tufts University, US

*** Submission Guidelines ***

TFPIE 2015 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom,
tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of
functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- FP and beginning CS students
- FP and Computational Thinking
- FP and Artificial Intelligence
- FP in Robotics
- FP and Music
- Advanced FP for undergraduates
- Tools supporting learning FP
- FP in graduate education
- Engaging students in research using FP
- FP in Programming Languages
- FP in the high school curriculum
- FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
- FP and Philosophy

*** Best Lectures ***

In addition to papers, we request “best lecture” presentations. What is your
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to 
present FP
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best 
lecture topics
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees.

*** Submission ***

Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the following link:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2015
It is expected at at least one author for each submitted paper will 
attend the
workshop.
