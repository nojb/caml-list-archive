Subject: [Caml-list] 2 Ph.D positions available (in Formal Methods for
 Security Analysis / Concurrent Systems), U. of Oslo

2 Ph.D positions in computer science available at the Department of
Informatics, University of Oslo.


Topics:
        1) Formal analysis techniques for concurrent programs

        2) Formal methods for security analysis


o  Qualifications 

   The appplicant is required to hold a Master's degree or equivalent in
   computer science and should have good analytical and programming
   skills. The ideal candidate has background in (some of) the following
   areas of formal methods and analysis: software verification, validation,
   and testing, static analysis, semantics, concurrency theory (especially
   for position 1), computer security and its analysis (especially for
   position 2), including knowledge of tools in that field.

   Besides technical skills, we are looking for a curious, ambitious
   candidate who is highly motivated to do research and contribute to the
   work done at our group. Good communication skills in both oral and
   written English are expected.

o Research groups:

  The 2 Ph.D positions is embedded in the group Precise Modeling and
  Analysis of Dependable Systems (PMA) at the Department of Informatics,
  University of Oslo resp. is a part of the Conserns Strategic Research
  Initiative on Concurrent Security and Robustness for Networked Systems:

  	       - http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/pma
	       
  	       - http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/conserns



o For more detailed information about how to apply, formal application
  requirements, terms of employment etc., cf. the 2 webpages:


    -  http://uio.easycruit.com/vacancy/1352893/64290?iso=no
  
    -  http://uio.easycruit.com/vacancy/1352821/64290?iso=no

o Contact:

   - Martin Steffen      (msteffen@ifi.uio.no)
   - Einar Broch Johnsen (einarj@ifi.uio.no)
   - Audun Josang        (audun.josang@mn.uio.no)


o  More details on the intended area of resarch of the two positions:

  1) Analysis techniques for concurrent systems:

      The candidate is expected to work on program analysis and modelling
      techniques to ensure robust and predictable program execution, such
      as e.g., extended type systems, monitoring and run-time verification
      and combinations of static an dynamic techniques. Properties we are
      interested in are mostly non-functional such as resource-consumption
      (time, memory and similar) and also security-aspects. Target
      application domains are concurrent programs intended to run on
      variable platforms (such as on different cloud providers or in
      different multi-core architectures) and the analysis methods being
      develop are intended to make informed and ideally automated decisions
      on how to deploy, (re-)configure, or parallelize applications.
 
   2) Security analysis 

      The Ph.D topic is in formal methods and tools for analyzing
      security properties in concurrent and distributed programs.
 
      The goal of this PhD scholarship is to address the problem of how IT
      systems during runtime can assess, detect, react and adapt to current
      security threats, vulnerabilities and attacks in order to achieve a
      certain level of security threat immunity. Elements to be considered
      as part of this PhD project is the development of models for dynamic
      risk, the design of redundant security architectures, and the
      application of formal methods for security design verification.
