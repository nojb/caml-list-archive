GNU is a bit biaised here and the "license-list" page is short and
(mostly) to the point: it covers a large number of licenses and doesn't
use many words for each to keep the length sane.

It's not the first time this question has been raised so maybe it would
be worth adding a sentence about that.
(that said I'm under the impression that you can't change the wording of
the QPL by copyright but I can't check that since the trolltech website
seems down and I don't have time to search for a copy of the license
elsewhere).
