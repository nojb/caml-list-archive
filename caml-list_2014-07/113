CALL FOR PAPERS

FM 2015 is the twentieth in a series of symposia organized by Formal 
 Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is to stimulate 
 the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development. 
 The symposia have been notably successful in bringing together innovators 
 and practitioners in precise mathematical methods for software and systems 
 development, industrial users, as well as researchers. The FM symposia 
 welcome original papers on research and industrial experience, 
 proposals for workshops and tutorials, entries for the exhibition of 
 software tools and projects, and reports on ongoing doctoral work. 

SCOPE AND TOPICS 

FM 2015 will have the goal of highlighting the development and application 
 of formal methods. This includes uses of formal methods in a variety 
 of disciplines such as medicine, biology, human cognitive modeling, 
 human automation interactions and aeronautics, among others. FM 2015 
 particularly welcomes papers on techniques, tools and experiences 
 in interdisciplinary frameworks, as well as on experience with practical 
 applications of formal methods in industrial and research settings, 
 empirical and experimental validation of tools and methods as well as 
 construction and evolution of formal methods tools. The broad topics 
 of interest for FM 2015 include but are not limited to: 

Interdisciplinary formal methods: techniques, tools and 
 experiences demonstrating formal methods in interdisciplinary 
 frameworks. 

Formal methods in practice: industrial applications of formal
 methods, experience with introducing formal methods in industry,
 tool usage reports, experiments with challenge problems. 
 Authors are encouraged to explain how the use of formal methods has
 overcome problems, lead to improvements in design or provided 
 new insights.

Tools for formal methods: advances in automated verification and
 model-checking, integration of tools, environments for formal
 methods, experimental validation of tools. Authors are encouraged
 to demonstrate empirically that the new tool or environment
 advances the state of the art.

Role of formal methods in software and systems engineering:
 development processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for
 formal methods, method integration. Authors are encouraged 
 to evaluate process innovations with respect to qualitative or 
 quantitative improvements. Empirical studies and evaluations 
 are also solicited.

Theoretical foundations: all aspects of theory related to
 specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic
 analysis. Authors are encouraged to explain how their results
 contribute to the solution of practical problems with methods or
 tools.

PAPER SUBMISSION

Papers will be evaluated by at least three members of the Programme
 Committee. They should be in Springer LNCS format and describe, in
 English, original work that has not been published or submitted
 elsewhere.

Authors of papers reporting experimental work are strongly encouraged 
 to make their experimental results available for use by reviewers. 
 Similarly, case study papers should describe significant case studies 
 and the complete development should be made available at the time of 
 review. In other words, the usual criteria for novelty, reproducibility, 
 correctness and the ability for others to build upon the described work
 apply.

Tool papers should explain enhancements made compared to previously 
 published work. A tool paper need not present the theory behind the 
 tool but can focus more on its features, and how it is used, evaluation,
 with screen shots and examples. Authors of tool papers should make 
 their tool available for use by reviewers. 


Papers should be submitted through the FM 2015 EasyChair web site: 

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2015. 
 
We solicit two categories of papers: 

Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format, 
 not counting references.

Short papers, including tool papers, should not exceed 6 pages, 
 not counting references. Besides tool papers, short papers 
 are encouraged for any subject that can be described within 
 the page limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an 
 extensive experimental evaluation. Short papers will be accompanied 
 by short presentations.

For regular and tool papers, an appendix can provide additional 
 material such as details on proofs or experiments. The appendix 
 is not guaranteed to be read or taken into account by the reviewers 
 and it should not contain information necessary to the understanding 
 and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers will be accepted 
 or rejected in the category in which they were submitted, there 
 will be no "demotions" from a regular to a short paper.


BEST PAPER AWARD
 
FM 2015 will as a new feature have a best paper award. 
 A best paper will be selected among accepted papers, 
 and the award will be presented at the conference.

PUBLICATION

Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings, to
appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
