While it may not help you, ocamls GC only kicks off during an allocation so
you can at least construct an important section of code to not have a GC
occur in it.  But I don't think that would help for your situation.

Is your concern more general or do you have a specific situation?  Ime it
takes quite a but of work to cause a noticeable GC pause in ocaml.
