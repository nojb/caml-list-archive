INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL ON BIG DATA

BigDat 2015

Tarragona, Spain

*****************************************************

--- 2nd registration deadline: July 23, 2014 ---

*****************************************************

AIM:

BigDat 2015 is a research training event for graduates and postgraduates in=
 the first steps of their academic career. It aims at updating them about t=
he most recent developments in the fast developing area of big data, which =
covers a large spectrum of current exciting research, development and innov=
ation with an extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific disco=
veries, medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowne=
d academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with t=
he audience.

All big data subareas will be displayed, namely: foundations, infrastructur=
e, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications. M=
ain challenges of analytics, management and storage of big data will be ide=
ntified through 4 keynote lectures and 24 six-hour courses, which will tack=
le the most lively and promising topics. The organizers believe outstanding=
 speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students. Interacti=
on will be a main component of the event.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduate and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal pre-r=
equisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will be differ=
ences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may be required f=
or some of them.

BigDat 2015 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep the=
mselves updated on recent developments and future trends. They will surely =
find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers, industry lea=
ders and innovators.

REGIME:

In addition to keynotes, 3 courses will run in parallel during the whole ev=
ent. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be wi=
lling to attend as well as to move from one to another.

VENUE:

BigDat 2015 will take place in Tarragona, located 90 kms. to the south of B=
arcelona. The venue will be:
