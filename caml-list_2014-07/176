this is premature gc optimization.

there was a time when i would have had real data, but there were FFI
bugs (as far as i could tell) with ocaml and one of the labltk or
whatever opengl libraries and it wasn't ever something resolved so i
gave up and moved on to other ecosystems.

so were i to get back into ocaml it would be with some trepidation
since i've been fairly burned a bit before with it. of course, mostly
all systems will burn me one way or another. with haxe + hxcpp on
android, the gc seems to be what is killing me, at least on the
low-end devices which i assume have smaller cpu caches. something.

so i've been looking at other things again. ocaml has a lot going for
it on paper, i've always been a fan of it, i try to attend local ocaml
meetups, etc. so i'm not a complete hater. but i really do not want
there to be any gc pauses or as few as possible so it is fun to learn
if i have any way to influence that, and how hard that can be to
achieve. e.g. with haxe+hxpp on android i think i'd have to really
dive into the sources and get the android nkd profiling working etc.
etc. etc. which feels like way too much work.
