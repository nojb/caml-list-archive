Subject: [Caml-list] Book reviewers wanted (again)

Hi,

I have prepared another little book about OCaml, a collection of sixteen 
little algorithms, methods, and diversions, together with Questions and 
Answers. Not quite as beginner-ish as "OCaml from the Very Beginning" 
but not, I hope, too intimidating at all.

I've included the provisional table of contents below.

Please drop me a note by email if you can spare a little time to review 
a draft, which should be ready soon. Free copies for people who provide 
substantive comments, like last time, of course.

1 Unravelling "Fold"
2 Being Lazy
3 Named Tuples with Records
4 Generalized Input/Output
5 Streams of bits
6 Compressing Data
7 Labelled and Optional Arguments
8 Formatted Printing
9 Searching For Things
10 Finding Permutations
11 Making Sets
12 Playing Games
GENERATING PDF DOCUMENTS - AN EXTENDED EXAMPLE
13 Representing Documents
14 Writing Documents
15 Pretty Pictures
16 Adding Text

I'll also be forwarding a copy to caml at inria.fr like last time, so if 
you're on that list, there is no need to contact me separately.

With Thanks,

--
