To be more precise, the Mirage/Xen/ARM backend requires hardware
virtualization in order to provide the bootloader and device libraries.
The majority of other libraries should just work once these are
supplied.

There's an effort underway to complete a FreeBSD kernel module backend,
which would output a kthread-based module.  This would run on the rPi,
since you could strip down the FreeBSD kernel to pretty much just
have the bootloader, virtual memory manager, and the required devices
drivers.

Or indeed, just use this as a base as well!  The reason we selected
kFreeBSD is to make bootstrap of the device drivers easier, and 
gradually rewrite them.
