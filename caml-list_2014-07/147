ACM SIGPLAN 2015 WORKSHOP ON PARTIAL EVALUATION AND PROGRAM MANIPULATION
Tue-Wed, January 13-14, 2015, Mumbai, India, co-located with POPL'15

http://conf.researchr.org/home/pepm2015

Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN

SCOPE

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims at bringing together
researchers and practitioners working in the areas of program
manipulation, partial evaluation, and program generation.  PEPM
focuses on techniques, theory, tools, and applications of analysis
and manipulation of programs.

The 2015 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation and continue last years'
successful effort to expand the scope of PEPM significantly beyond the
traditionally covered areas of partial evaluation and specialization
and include practical applications of program transformations such as
refactoring tools, and practical implementation techniques such as
rule-based transformation systems.  In addition, the scope of PEPM
covers manipulation and transformations of program and system
representations such as structural and semantic models that occur in
the context of model-driven development.  In order to reach out to
practitioners, a separate category of tool demonstration papers will
be solicited.

Topics of interest for PEPM'15 include, but are not limited to:

* Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
   partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active
   libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution,
   refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

* Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
   manipulation  such as: abstract interpretation, termination
   checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems,
   automated testing and test case generation.

* Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
   metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
   languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming,
   staged computation, and model-driven program generation and
   transformation.

* Application of the above techniques including case studies of
   program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
   projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust
   tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
   benchmarking.  Examples of application domains include legacy
   program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations,
   visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing,
   middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and
   web-based applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will
continue the category of `short papers' for tool demonstrations and
for presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of
interesting academic, industrial and open-source applications that are
new or unfamiliar.

Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers
other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or
for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical
disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North
America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its web page
at: http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm.

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal
proceedings published by ACM Press.  Accepted papers will be included
in the ACM Digital Library.  Following the practice of recent PEPMs,
A special issue for Science of Computer Programming is planned with
recommended papers from PEPM'15.

PEPM has also established a Best Paper award.  The winner will be
announced at the workshop.

SUBMISSION CATEGORIES AND GUIDELINES

Regular Research Papers must not exceed 12 pages in ACM Proceedings
style (including appendix).  Tool demonstration papers and short papers
must not exceed 6 pages in ACM Proceedings style (including appendix).
At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the
workshop and present the work.  In the case of tool demonstration
papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.
Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing guidelines for both
research tool demonstration papers will be made available on the
PEPM'15 Web-site soon.  Papers should be submitted electronically via
the workshop web site.

Authors using LaTeX to prepare their submissions should use the new
improved SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls, 9pt template)
available at: http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author.

IMPORTANT DATES

     Abstract submission: Tue, September 9, 2014
     Paper submission: Fri, September 12, 2014 (*FIRM*)
     Author notification: Mon, October 13, 2014
     Workshop: Tue, January 13 and Wed, January 14, 2015

Note: The paper submission deadline is firm.  Because the VISA
application to India can take a long time, all the schedule is set
earlier than previous years.  The above schedule is tight: we have
absolutely no time to wait for late submissions and we will have no
deadline extension.  So, please plan ahead.
