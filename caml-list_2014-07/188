Yes, it's perfect. Just for completeness for archives: this changes very
slightly when multi-threading is required (and also remember that
graphics-related operations can only happen in the main thread on
most platforms but X11 (Wayland too?) and that even in that case, the
GDK lock must be taken before issuing them.
(more details are easily found on the internet)

Yes, right. There's
http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/README.html#_how_to_compile_and_link
which should be more visible but still not as well as it should.

I've been unable to keep up with my TODO list in the recent months but
I'll soon have 2 * 4 hours of plane so I'll try to use that to commit
improvements to the documentation and beginner material. Unfortunately,
until then I won't have time to make such changes.
