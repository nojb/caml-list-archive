Subject: [Caml-list] PhD position, Data Semantics/Semantic Web, Wright State
 University

Funded PhD Student Openings at DaSe Lab:
Data Semantics, Semantic Web, Ontologies, Geo- and Earth Science 
applications
http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/jobs.html

Data Semantics Laboratory, directed by Pascal Hitzler
Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Wright State University
Dayton, Ohio, USA

The Data Semantics (DaSe) Lab at the Department of Computer Science at 
Wright State University seeks two or more PhD students to pursue 
research in applied or foundational aspects of Data Semantics, Semantic 
Web, Ontologies, Geo- or Earth Sciences. Funding includes a monthly 
stipend plus tuition costs.

The DaSe Lab (directed by Pascal Hitzler, see 
http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/ for more information) is an 
internationally prominent research group with focus on foundations and 
applications of Semantic Web technologies. Lab members primarily 
contribute to ongoing research projects, but occasionally also get 
involved in teaching and administrative tasks. The new students will 
likely focus on research topics related to Data Science applications in 
the Earth Sciences.

Applicants should have excellent communication skills and excel in team 
work. Intellectual curiosity, a wide range of interests, and the ability 
and stamina to pursue challenging long-term goals is required. It is 
preferable, but not required, that applicants had previous exposure to 
lab research topics.

Applicants should send their application to
daselab-jobs@googlegroups.com. It shall consist of a single pdf file 
containing a detailed curriculum vitae including grades, plus a cover 
letter in the email body which includes

* GPA of all degrees completed or under progress, with explanations how 
to convert the grading system, if degree is from outside the U.S.

* GRE score (both verbal and quantitative) or date when GRE score will 
be available

* Scores of most recent English language tests if non-native English 
speaker.

Applications which do not comply with these requirements may be ignored. 
Successful applicants must satisfy the formal requirements for pursuing 
a PhD degree in Computer Science at Wright State University, see 
http://cse.wright.edu/phd-computer-science-and-engineering.

Processing of applications will begin immediately and commence until 
positions are filled. We expect to make first decisions in July 2014.

Please send applications and inquiries to daselab-jobs@googlegroups.com.

It will be posted at http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/jobs.html when 
positions are filled.

Best Regards,

Pascal Hitzler
