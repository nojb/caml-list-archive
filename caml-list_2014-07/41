PhD Position: Programming, Modelling and Verification of Concurrent Software

The Software Technologies Research Group at the University of Bamberg, loca=
ted in a world-heritage city in Northern Bavaria in Germany, conducts resea=
rch in the foundations and practice of software specification, verification=
 and analysis. The group currently has one full-time PhD position (E13 TV-L=
, German public sector pay scale) available in the context of a new researc=
h project that will develop novel formalisms and techniques for concurrent =
software systems.

About the topic

Todays ubiquitous multicore computing platforms have changed the landscape =
of programming languages and their APIs. These focus increasingly on shield=
ing the software engineer from low-level details of threads, concurrency an=
d parallelism via clever abstractions of the underlying platform. Such abst=
ractions are implemented in programming languages and libraries such as Gra=
nd Central Dispatch, node.js, OpenMP, Erlang and Go. As concurrent computat=
ion platforms arise everywhere, even in safety critical systems, writing so=
ftware that is correct and safe becomes the engineer's primary concern. How=
ever, proving concurrent systems to be a priori correct and safe requires a=
dditional research in the theory and practice of programming languages, com=
pilers, verification techniques, and analysis tools. We are looking for a r=
esearcher to strengthen our team in one or several of these areas.

Your background and experience

A strong background in Computer Science is required, such as evidenced by a=
n upper class Masters degree in Computer Science or a closely related disci=
pline. We target two not necessarily disjoint types of candidates: First, p=
ractitioners with a good knowledge of and experience with modern programmin=
g languages (e.g., C++/C#, Java, OCaml) and state-of-the-art concurrent and=
 asynchronous languages and APIs (e.g., Grand Central Dispatch, node.js, Op=
enMP, Erlang, Go); second, theoreticians with basic knowledge in formal met=
hods and theoretical computer science (e.g., formal semantics, automata the=
ory, graph transformation systems, model checking, and/or compiler construc=
tion).

Applicants are expected to be fluent in spoken and written English, some kn=
owledge of German is desirable to support the group's teaching in software =
engineering and programming languages (up to 5 contact hours per semester w=
eek).

Further information and how to apply

Please send your informative CV, copies of transcripts and awarded degrees,=
 and a cover letter outlining your research interests to info(at)swt-bamber=
g.de. You can address any questions to Prof. Gerald L=FCttgen or Dr. Alexan=
der Heu=DFner by using the same email address, and find out additional info=
