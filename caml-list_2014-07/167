Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Immutable strings

This isn't my idea, but it seems worth repeating: perhaps it would
make sense to have an unmovable byte-array type that had the same
memory representation as Bytes.t, with the extra guarantee that the
collector wouldn't move it.

You could imagine representing this as a private type:

module Immovable_bytes : sig
   type t = private Bytes.t
   val create : int -> t
end

with a special creation function for creating these immovable strings.
This would avoid some of the current need to write what is effectively
the same code twice, once for bigarrays and once for Bytes.t's.  In
particular, you could modify an Immovable_bytes by first up-casting it
to a Bytes.t.  But you could only actually create one by going through
the special creation function.

I'm not sure if the runtime details could be made to work out, but if
they could, I think it would be a bit nicer than the current world.
