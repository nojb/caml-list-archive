Yes, I thought, that this was a problem.
Looks very uncommon.

Yes, 2.0.18 on this old machine.
Updating? Hmhhh this old machine itself may be updated by a newer
one (faster hardware). ;-)

I once had used ocamlmktop, and I don' know if it was on my
new computer or on this old machine.
I think it was the old one, where it once worked, but
I think it was Ocaml 3.01, that worked.
Maybe in Ocaml 3.04 there were some changes...

Somewhere in the strace-output I found "ptrace".
I don't know a "ptrace" on linux-machines, but if
I remember correctly, there is a ptrace on Solaris-
machines.

Maybe it's only a problem of the  configure-script,
which thinks to use tools, not available on common
linux-distributions?

Well, maybe this is a good idea.
I may try it with a debian.

But I'm not shure if new linux-distributions will work
well on this old machine. It works. Not very fast,
but still good enough for a lot of tasks.
So, when updating the software means to have necessity
of buying new hardware this is not, what I want...
(not enough money this times, hope it will change soon).


But I may try the new debian. :)

Ciao,
