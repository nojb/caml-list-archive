No, it is acknowledged as an unfortunate limitation and an annoyance
to the programmer.  However, there are deep semantical and
type-theoretical reasons that make it hard to allow cross-module
recursion in ML.  This is actually a research area that is still
largely open.

Actually, it's the other way around: the order of .cmo's is relevant
because the ML module system supports only sequential / nonrecursive
definitions of modules, but not parallel / recursive module
definitions.
