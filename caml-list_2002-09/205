Yes.

Some versions of the Sun C compiler generate bad code for the ocaml
runtime at optimization -xO3 and higher; since -O alone means -xO2
this won't be a problem unless you change the default flags.



I will soon submit some minor code generation improvements for SPARC to
the ocaml maintainers; the SPARC support was written with old (early
1990s) SPARC hardware in mind and there are a few things that should be
done differently for UltraSPARC.



I also have patches to generate 64 bit code for UltraSPARC:

http://www.mit.edu/~jfc/ocaml-sparc64.tar.gz

However, because 64 bit code doubles memory use for all objects other
than strings and floats, you should use standard 32 bit mode unless
you want (1) fast floating point, (2) big objects or a big address
space, or (3) larger native integers.
