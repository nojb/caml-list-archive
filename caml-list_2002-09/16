Yes, findlib has a quickstart and a doc. It seems to be good,
but I haven't read it (I may do it later, if I provide own modules).
What I meant was the ocamlnet-lib; I browsed a littltbid through
the *.mli-files. Hmhh, well there are comments. I hope they are
suficcient for me to understand usage. Or if there is a tutorial,
I would read it.

Ciao,
