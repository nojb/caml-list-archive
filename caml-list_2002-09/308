I don't really know, but notice that the arm native code compiler builds
fine on debian/arm's autobuilder. You can follow the links found at :

http://buildd.debian.org/bymaint.php?maint=Sven%20Luther%20%3Cluther%40debian.org%3E%20

To get to the full build log of ocaml on arm, in order to compare it to
your build log, and see where the problem is.

Friendly,

Sven Luther
