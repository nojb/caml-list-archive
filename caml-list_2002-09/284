Hello<br><br>
I'm just about to get started with caml, but I encounter a few
problems.<br><br>
To do something simple, I took Stephan Houben's calc.ml (from
<font color=3D"#0000FF"><u>http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/stephan.html</u></font>)=
,
added a function to avoid division by zero, and tried to compile it to
native code using ocamlopt (on a windows 2000 machine). Here's what I
get:<br><br>
D:\ocaml&gt;ocamlopt calc.ml<br>
'ml' is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br>
operable program or batch file.<br>
Assembler error, input left in file
C:\DOCUME~1\............\Temp\camlasm8c5322.asm<br><br>
Did I miss something? Am I dumb? I've tried to read the documentation for
compiling (found in differen FAQs), but none of them seem to mention
special constraints for the windows platform. Any tips about what to
do?<br><br>
Second issue (not a problem!): when I try to run the ocamlbrowser, it
complains about not finding tk83.dll and tcl83.dll. Well, I seem to have
a version too new for this. My files are tk84.dll and tcl84.dll. I had to
make copies of them with the &quot;older&quot; names for ocamlbrowser to
work...<br><br>
Hope someone can help with the compile problem (and maybe tell me how to
compile with the regexp library too?).<br><br>
Regards,<br>
~HY<br>
