No need to feel sorry! I work in a place privileged enough that I can
let Windows rot in benign neglect... ;-)

In any case, the main issue of making PCRE work on Windows is the
C-library, for which you need a C-compiler and linker. The OCaml-part
should work out-of-the-box. It's therefore not so much a problem caused
by INRIA but by Microsoft not shipping standard development tools with
their operating systems.

Well, even with those difficulties put in our way by Microsoft, people
obviously manage to get around them.

Unfortunately, not everbody has as much choice as we have...
