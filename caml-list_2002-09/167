Sorry I had an 8Mb limit on my stack. I thought "ulimit" would show all
limits. Not.  Shame on me.

I have also checked the latest CVS sources ; it seems that there are no
more references to the stack limit in asmrun.

May I suggest fixing the documentation as follows :
In the native-code compilation section, specify which OCAMLRUNPARAM options
are used ; stress that there is no Ocaml-imposed stack limit, that the stack
limit can be checked (at least under Linux) using "ulimit -a" and be set using
"ulimit -s", and that a stack overflow throws a Stack_overflow exception.

Would it be a luxury if the native startup code complained if the
OCAMLRUNPARAM-specified stack limit exceeds the system stack limit ?
