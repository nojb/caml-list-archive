I am compiling an email list of potential clients who may be interested in
products which would be useful to the operators of care homes and others in
the health sector.
If you would like to be included in the list, please respond to this email
with 'include' in the subject line. Otherwise you will not be included on
future mailings.
To give some idea of the products on offer, one of my clients offers
equipment which can eliminate smells and improve air quality for  a very
reasonable intial cost, and very low running costs thereafter. Visit
www.cleanairsystems.net for more information.
