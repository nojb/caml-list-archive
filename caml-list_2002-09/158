I've asked the following question one year ago:

I got an answer from Pascal Brisset sending me a nice incomplete piece
of code doing this. After a small adaptation, I've been using it with
3.04.

When "updating" it to 3.06, i tried to integrate in mandrake's package
to ease my use of it:
- i've added it when all warnings are enabled (-w A)
- it's quite ugly, i've added the various things to make it compile on
3.06 without knowing what should be done. At least it somewhat works :)
- i've dropped a functionality from Pascal Brisset's tool: it only
checks local variables, not modules variables&functions. It was easier
for me and does the checks I need (since my .mli are mostly
auto-generated).
- the comments from Pascal Brisset still apply
  - it is uncomplete (it does not handle local modules ...)
  - warning are not issued for identifiers starting with an underscore.

So if it interests someone :)

The patch on ocaml 3.06:

The tool on ocaml 3.04:

(special thanks to Pascal Brisset of course)
