Subject: [Caml-list] Reading from a stream until '\000' - will this approach work?

After thinking a bit more about it...

(* Please read disclaimer comments first :)  *)

How about -

(*I'm not sure what the name of the method to read in just one 
character is... 'read_char' ??*)
(*I'm also not sure how to tack that character from the stream onto an 
ever growing string... '^' ?? *)
(*I still need to read about how to break out of a loop... 'break' ??*)

let rec myStreamReader inchan =
   let char = read_char inchan in
   if char = '\000' then
      let holderString = holderString ^ char
      and break
   else
      myStreamReader inchan
;;

Again - I hope I'm able to make sense...

Thanks for any feedback on the concept!
