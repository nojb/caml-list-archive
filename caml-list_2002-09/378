Well, Str has almost, what I need, actually I can write the match
function, but I hoped there is a function, which returns a boolean to
indicate, whether a string contains a regexp...
Well the str library is not so intuitive... perhaps I should download
pcre.

Wow, so I can even write my own syntax!
Has anybody an SML syntax description? Well, I must dive into a correct
syntax description.

I guess trouble. That's why I was looking for a RE solution...
