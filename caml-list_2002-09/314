This message is a bit strange: ocamlcomp.sh is only supposed to call
ocamlc.opt if you have built it after ocamlc. And logically you
shouldn't be able to use ocamlc.opt with a cross compiler.
Did you really follow the instructions in the message above?
Didn't you do "make world.opt" in place of "make world"? This would
attempt to compile the libraries with ocamlc.opt, as you seem to do,
and would of course fail (since ocamlc.opt is an ARM binary).
If this is the case, erase ocamlc and start again using "make world"
and then "make opt", and eventually "make opt.opt" if you need it.

Hope this helps,
