two list exist on the internet : the humps http://caml.inria.fr/humps/
and the  The Objective Caml Link Database :
http://www.npc.de/ocaml/linkdb/frames.html 

by the way there is a beginner list. You should ask such question
there (see at the end of any message on this list to know how to
subscribe to it). You should also try to search in the archives for
all question that may have already be answered
