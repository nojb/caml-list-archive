This is a Unix thing, not an OCAML thing.  The child will be defunct
to hold the exit status so it can be reported to the parent when the
parent waits for it, or until the parent exits.

One workaround is to wait for the child process when you expect it to exit.

Another workaround is to fork twice, so the original process is the
parent of a temporary process, and the temporary process is the parent
of the process you really wanted to create.  The temporary process
exits immediately and the original parent waits for it immediately.
This leaves no defunct processes.
