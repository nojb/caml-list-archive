Well, is it not for exactly this kind of problems that the -pack option
was implemented ? Would it not solve all this kind of problem if it
would be a standard that all libraries should be using the -pack option
for including their modules, thus having a Dynlink.Meta, Dynlink.Misc,
Dynlink.Config, ... (and also i guess findlib would then have a
Findlib.Meta or something such ?).

Sure this would cause a bit of backward compatibility, but nothing that
could not be solved by a simple open at the begining of the sources, and
it would also most probably help solving much of the 'namespace'
discution that happens here from time to time.

What do you all think about this, is this a valuable solution, or are
there profound reason for not going that way ?
