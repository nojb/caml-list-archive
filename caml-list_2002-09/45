Hello everybody,

I'm having severe problems with native threads. Not only I can't get them to
work with the Graphics module, I can't get them to work at all. I'm
using a fresh Debian 3.0r0. I've recompiled Ocaml 3.06 with
'-with-pthread' option.  Shouldn't the following code

$ cat toto.ml
open Thread

let _ =
  let code1 () =
	let x = ref 0 in
	while true do
	  incr x;
	  Printf.printf "alpha %d\n" !x;
	  flush stdout
	done
  in
  let thread1 = Thread.create code1 ()
  in
  while true do
	()
  done

compiled with

$ ocamlopt.opt -thread unix.cmxa threads.cmxa toto.ml -o toto

and run as

$ ./toto

give me something like

alpha 0
alpha 1
alpha 2
alpha 3
alpha 4
alpha 5
alpha 6
...

?

Instead, the program doesn't output anything, and when I hit Ctrl-C,
it leaves some processes running, which can only be killed with
SIGKILL.

The program works when compiled as bytecode. System info :

$ uname -a
Linux gogol 2.4.18 #1 Thu Aug 22 20:42:28 CEST 2002 i586 unknown
$ ls -l /lib/libpthread*
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       102172 Apr 28 11:57 /lib/libpthread-0.9.so

However, even in bytecode, when I use the Graphics module, some subprocesses
refuse to die when I interrupt the main program.

Any clues ? Thanks very much.
