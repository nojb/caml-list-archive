For most uses, you need not change anything.

There are few incompatibilities for specific functions
* Fileinput on windows only works with sockets (if it works at all!)
  Otherwise you have to do dark magic with threads, as in ocamlbrowser.
* Fileselect on windows is very buggy. Trevor Jim contributed a fixed
  version in the past, but it was rather heavily modified. Maybe some
  other people have working versions. By the way, the ocamlbrowser
  Fileselect works, but is heavily customized too.

Outside of these two small modules, I know of no incompatibilities.

Cheers,
