Subject: [Caml-list] X library for ocaml 3.06?
Date: Mon, 09 Sep 2002 10:45:56 -0400
From: John Carr <jfc@MIT.EDU>

I am writing an OCaml program using the X Window System.  I am doing
most of the work on Solaris 8.  The graphics module included in the
distribution is not adequate.  The efuns package contains an X client
library but I can't get efuns (017+5) to work with ocaml 3.06.  After
some Makefile hacking and manual compilation I was able to get xlib
and dependencies to compile and link, but the library still doesn't
work.

Does anybody know how to build a working efuns/xlib?  Is there any
other Xlib implementation?
