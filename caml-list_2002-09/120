I can only confirm this. At LexiFi, we are implementing a (modestly complex,
honestly said) GUI under Linux that works just fine, after recompilation,
under Win32.

Note also that INRIA did a major cleanup of all the camlTk/lablTk stuff (mainly
a unification of the low level Tk interface of camlTk and lablTk) a
few months ago, one reason more to give it a try.

For a non trivial gui implemented under ocaml with camlTk, delivered
under win32 as well as under linux, have a look at:
