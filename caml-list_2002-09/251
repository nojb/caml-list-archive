For Ensemble, or that I need is the symmetric encryption and
Diffie-Hellman. It is possible
that OpenSSL has a faster implementation of Diffie-Hellman, but as long as
the difference
is not too great, I'd rather use an OCaml library.

Hello Ohad,

Do you think it is really needed? One of my friend who is a degreed
specialist in security said that algorithms used in OpenSSL are
stronger than in Xavier's cryptokit.
