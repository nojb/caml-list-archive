I fixed the problem.

I have now found the META-file in the pcre-src-directory,
added a pcre-directory beyond /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/
and copied the META-file into this pcre-directory.

Now findlib (ocamlfind) found the pcre and the ocamlnet-lib
could be compiled.

Next question: Is there any more detailed documentation somewhere?
Or do I have to browse the *.ml/*.mli-files?



Ciao,
   Oliver
