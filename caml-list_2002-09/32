No, I have not yet found the time to do it. There are some aspects
that cannot be explained in mli files well enough, and a tutorial
would be a great thing. E.g. why ocamlnet has an object-oriented
layer on top of channels (netchannels). You find them everywhere,
but no introduction.

There is an "examples" directory containing some very simple, and
some advanced examples, especially for CGI programming.
