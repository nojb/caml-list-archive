On a related note: has anybody successfully installed ocaml on the 
following two types of architectures:

1. IBM Power3 machines with AIX 4.3.3,

2. Sun Ultrasparc II machines with Solaris 8?

I have an opportunity to use these SMP machines to run some large 
tests, and I am wondering if this means that I have to port my code 
from ocaml to C/C++/f90 :(

Thanks,

--shiv--
