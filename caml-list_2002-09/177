   So he can do things like :
   
   if x <> 0 and 1 / x ... 
   
   like it is possible to do in C, instead of doing :
   
   if x <> 0 then if 1 / x ...
   
   which gives more lines of code, and needs to redefine two time the else
   condition.
   
   Anyway, i don't think the order is defined, but in any case, i guess
   it would be revere sequential if anything (execution starts from the
   right).
   
IMO you are mixing things up, "and" is not an operator and 

   if x <> 0 and 1 / x ... 

is not legal ocaml. 

For let a = ex1 and b = ex2 ... the manual says that the
evaluation is unspecified (6.7.1. local definitions).

For the logical operators (&&, &, ||, or) the manual specifies left
to right (non-strict) evaluation (Module Pervasives).

Bye,

Hendrik
