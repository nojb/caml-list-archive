Hi,

you could try something like this

let read_eol inchan =
  let rec f buf =
    let c = input_char inchan in
    if c = '\000' then Buffer.contents buf
    else begin Buffer.add_char buf c; f buf end
  in f (Buffer.create 64);;   

or in 'revised syntax which I prefer)

value read_eol inchan =
  f (Buffer.create 64) where rec f buf =
    let c = input_char inchan in
    if c = '\000' then Buffer.contents buf
    else do { Buffer.add_char buf c; f buf }
;

(Note there is no exception handling in examples)
