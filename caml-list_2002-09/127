Hmm, for getting backtraces in the toplevel, I decided to Keep It Simple 
Stupid, and it worked.  Just hook the runtime with two external 
declarations and mktop.  No recompiling anything:

test.ml:

external init_backtrace : unit -> unit = "init_backtrace"
external print_exception_backtrace : unit -> unit = 
"print_exception_backtrace"


% ocamlmktop test.ml -o testtop
% testtop


exception Undefined;;
let foo x = if x == 7 then raise Undefined else x*x;;
let rec consecutiveInts a b =
   if a <= b then a::(consecutiveInts (a+1) b) else [];;
consecutiveInts 1 10;;
Test.init_backtrace ();;
try
   List.map foo (consecutiveInts 1 10)
with
   _ -> Test.print_exception_backtrace (); [];;


output:
