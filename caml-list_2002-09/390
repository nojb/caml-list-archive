No, that wouldn't be a good idea.
But writing int_of_string "foo" is a bad thing, while the end-of-file
thing is not a design problem. Is there a function to test eof? (without
consuming a line?)

Well, but what about memory usage?
I just miss an iterator, or sg. like that, which reads a line, processes
it, reads next line...
Just want to write cleaner, which eg. in ruby is just (so intuitive)

IO.foreach("filename.ext") {|line|
	# process line
}

and don't like infinite loops.
