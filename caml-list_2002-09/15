These alignment has "side effects": when you resize the window, they
behave differently: the left and right aligned things can stretch in y
direction, others in x direction.

Well, as I can see only one component is allowed to be
client-aligned. The labels have predefined sizes, they doesn't respect
the actual data. Will osiris do some cool stuff auto-arrange components?
Creating a singe one-row entry field, which is really one row height is
a bit hacking. Specifying the height goes in pixels, not in rows.
Packing is not so simple, so it worth a tutorial.
I think osiris is now low-level to quickly develop GUIs.
Will it be higher-level, or this will be another package?


In the example programs you use mainly explicit placement. In some
examples, the background of the window, where there is no component, is
darkgrey, while the back of the labels, buttons are lighter grey.

I currently can help just with testing/suggestions and maybe some tips
writing the documentation.
