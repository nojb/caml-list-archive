Scratch... Scratch... I'm not sure what you mean.

My point is just that in_channel_length is only meaningful 
for channels connected to regular files. Otherwise, it 
raises Sys_error. Maxence Guesdon's version handles this 
case correctly, since it assumes that a channel is at the 
EOF if-and-only-if reading from it raises End_of_file.

If you mean that the name of function seems to imply that 
its parameter is a regular file, I disagree with you. In 
UNIX anything you can do IO onto is a _file_ descriptor. In 
C buffered IO is done through FILE* variables. One simply 
has to write code which correctly handles the different 
kinds of files that exist in the UNIX world. Some you can 
seek on; on others you cannot, and all you can do is 
continue to read until there is nothing left to read -- that 
is fread(fdesc, buf, max) returns 0 when max > 0.
