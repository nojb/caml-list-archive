At last, some technical data in a message of yours.  You're (slowly)
improving.  If you could just have posted this to caml-bugs@inria.fr
rather than caml-list, this would have been perfect :-)

The cause of the problem is here:

> readlink("/proc/self/exe", "[0303]:2916", 1024) = 11

I.e. /proc/self/exe does not point to the executable name, but to an
inode number.  That must be a truly ancient Linux kernel that you're
running.  (Pre 2.0 ?)  

I'll harden the determination of the program name against this
problem.  In the meantime, do yourself a favor and upgrade to a more
recent Linux kernel (and distribution?).
