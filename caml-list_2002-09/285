They do. See readme.win32:

       Release notes on the MS Windows ports of Objective Caml
       -------------------------------------------------------

Starting with OCaml 3.05, there are no less than three ports of
Objective Caml for MS Windows available:
  - a native Win32 port, built with the Microsoft development tools;
  - a native Win32 port, built with the MinGW development tools;
  - a port consisting of the Unix sources compiled under the Cygwin
    Unix-like environment for Windows.

Here is a summary of the main differences between these ports:

                                      Native MS     Native MinGW        Cygwin
Third-party software required
  - for base bytecode system            none            none            none
  - for ocamlc -custom                  MSVC         MinGW or Cygwin    Cygwin
  - for native-code generation          MSVC+MASM    MinGW or Cygwin    Cygwin
[---cut---]

So if you are going to use ocamlopt from win32 binary distribution, you have
to install Microsoft Visual C and Microsoft Macro Assembler on your computer.

Again, the binary build expects Tcl/Tk 8.3 installed. To work with other
version you can rebuild the whole Ocaml from the sources.

Which one? E.g. module "Str" is already included into the standard library.
