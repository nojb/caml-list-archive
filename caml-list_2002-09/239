Hello,
Microsoft offer their C++ compiler (non optimised version) for free download (no IDE just the SDK) as part of the Dot Net SDK download.

As this seems to be free for most people and for most uses (even commercial) does anybody know if OCaml will work with it or does it only work with the older VC++ 6.0 compiler (it's the VC++ 7.0 compiler that's available for download)?

Here is the link to the MS SDK:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml&frame=true

Any replies would be very welcome.
Mark.
