The problem is indeed due to the locations in your resulting syntax tree
which are not (no more) in order.

By default pr_o.cmo considers that the locations of the phrases of the
resulting syntax tree are in increasing order. It uses them to print
the comments and/or the empty lines between the phrases (and in the
beginning and the end of the file).

The first two lines of your printed result:
   let _ = print_string "1\n"; flush stdout
   WHERE
corresponds for pr_o.cmo to the "comments" of the beginning of the file,
since your first phrase is actually the one with print_string "2\n".

If your resulting syntax tree does not respect the order of locations,
the solution is to use the option -sep added by pr_o.cmo:

   camlp4o ./syntax1.cmo pr_o.cmo -sep "\n\n" test.ml

This options tells pr_o.cmo not to read the source file to print the
comments between phrases, but print an empty line ("\n\n") instead.
