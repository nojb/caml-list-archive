What do you mean with "pseudo-official"?

A remark as developer of free software: One of the advantages
is that I can do what I want, nobody forces me to develop in a
certain way, or direction. Free software is basically software 
without standards. Industry needs standards to make their
products interchangeable, but this is not a key point for free
software, because you have the sources, and you have some
control over them. PostgreSQL is the best example for this;
originally it did not support SQL, but had some unique features
other DBMS did not have. As a user you get the benefits of the
freedom of the developers, but at the price of lacking secondary
virtues such as standard-conformance.

Why don't we have a generally accepted XML transformation API?
It would not be very much work to develop such an API, and to
do a prototype for an implementation. I suppose that auch an
API is not really needed, at least now.
