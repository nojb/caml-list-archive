While Bagley's Shootout was good PR because of its Slashdot exposure, as I 
mentioned recently [1], Bagley confuses doubly-linked lists and deques, and 
then goes on to benchmark C++ doubly-linked list against O'Caml pre-allocated 
array. I don't want to say anything about scientific integrity, since I think 
INRIA simply overlooked the poor quality and extreme lopsidedness of the 
Shootout (They reference it on O'Caml's front page)

The Shootout page I referenced changed a bit since Aug 19, 2002, but, still, 
it was the misleading results that were publicized.
