Sorry but I don't understand the purpose of your question.
If a and b are functions with 'related side effects' the secure
way should be the later ('let a in let b ..'), otherwise
the order of evaluation in the first case is irrelevant
as a and b are two unrelated functions (with no side effects),
or 'let a and b in ..' is the same as 'let b and a in ..' 

Regards.
