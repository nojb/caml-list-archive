An abstract type.  You don't want to know :-)  More seriously: in
3.06, the compiler and runtime system represent lazy values more
efficiently; in particular, the "Value of" indirections present in
3.04 are now shortened by the GC whenever possible.  As a consequence,
the representation of lazy values no longer matches that of a Caml datatype.

> Can I apply pattern-matching on it?

No.  The general "contract" of a lazy value is that you should never
have to distinguish whether it's been evaluated already or not.  Just
perform Lazy.force on the lazy value and match on the result.
