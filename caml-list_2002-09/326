Hmmm, by the way, if a plugin architecture is needed, are we facing the =
same
problem ?

I did look at OCaml some weeks ago for an application which is at the =
moment
written in C++ and that needs a plugin architecture.
There are virtual classes on one side for specifying the interface of =
the
plugin (in ocaml, I think it would be module signatures) and concrete
classes that inherits from the virtual ones and that implements in =
different
ways the same signature (module implementations in ocaml). The =
algorithms
are generic as they are written for the virtual classes.
The loading of the different implementation is done dynamically and
dispatching of methods is done via polymorphism.

Is first class modules the elegant solution for this plugin framework =
(OCaml
not useful here)?
Does Ocaml offer another solution for this problem ?
