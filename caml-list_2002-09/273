Hi list !

I'm pleased to announce the first release of OCamake.

OCamake is an automatic compiler for the OCaml language.
It can be used as :
- a standalone application which compile and link
- a Makefile generator from a given set of files

One of its better usage should be in education where teaching
how-to write a Makefile is sometimes painful ( for both students &
teacher ). Note that OCamake as also special features for integration under
MS Visual Studio.

Examples of usages:

ocamake *.ml *.mli -o myapp.exe
- will compile and link all the sources files in the current directory.

ocamake -clean *.ml *.mli -o myapp.exe
- will delete all the intermediate files produced by the compilation
process.

ocamake -mak *.ml *.mli -o myapp.exe
- will create a Makefile which can be user either by MAKE or NMAKE to
compile the project.

More informations are available in the HTML documentation of the
distribution, which is available at :
http://tech.motion-twin.com/ocamake

OCamake is distributed under the GPL.
I would like to thanks Lexifi for its support in this project.
