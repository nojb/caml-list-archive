There are a few messages in the mailing list talking about wxWindows
integration with OCaml, but I see no announcement of its availability.
I presume that means that nobody got to the point of making it work.

I'd really like to have a portable native-style windowing API, and
wxWindows looks like the best bet, so I'm planning on working on this.
Anybody with interest in helping?

Thanks  ../Dave
