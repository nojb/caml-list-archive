Subject: [Caml-list] mutually referencing compilation units

hello,
given the banality i'm guessing this question has been asked before .. but
i couldn't find any clear statement related to this inthe archive.

So:
Is the fact that two mutually referencing units can't be compiled
supposed to be a Good Thing? It seems to be a consequence of the fact that
order of .cmo's is relevant, and when that design decision was made i
guess the restriction it entailed on mutual reference was not considered
to be a problem.


Thanks

Henri DF
