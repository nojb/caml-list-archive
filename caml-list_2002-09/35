Yes, I have seen it.
The simple CGI-example is very nice. :)
Looks like easy programming. :)
The advanced examples are a littlebid too large for
Ocaml-and-ocamlnet-beginners. ;-)

I first asked, because I want to write two different
tools:

first one: a wget-like tool, which can parse the html-pages
(if possible, this f..... javascript-stuff too) and
can download not only recursively, but can also
select the pages for download e.g. by pattern-matching
on href-tags (url or text of the link) or by selection
of filesizes or so.

And the second tool I wanted to write was a similar tool
for nntp-protocol: Download by attributes (size, date,
MsgID, Subject, author, thread-length, ...).
(I once wrote such stuff (not completed) in Perl
 and after the program grew more and more, it
 becomes more and more a mess...).


So I need access to sockets, some low-level stuff
(Unix.read) and such, or a good library, which helps
here. I need a library, which can parse me the
html-pages and maybe nntp-headers, and I want only
to implement the logic of the tool, and let the
network stuff programming be the work, that the
lib can do.

And I hope the ocamlnet/netstring can help here.
But if it will be more effort to understand the library
than writing the networking-code by myself, then
I will write the sockets-stuff by myself.

That's all about it.

Ciao,
   Oliver

P.S.: Don't forget: I'm not Ocaml-user since years...
      ...since some months - and ONLY IF I HAD SOME
      TIME - could do some Ocaml-programming. So a
      documentation/tutorial would help a lot.

P.P.S.: IMHO OCaml is a very complex language.
