Ok, that was surprising.
But it's a very good idea. :)

BTW: The problem in the tutorial, I mentioned was my own:
I wrote wrong code.
But the reason was, that I didn't understand how the
Camlp4 really works (the Grammar-Module).

I now print the tutorial out to paper, and hope I will
see problems better than on screen.

But in general, Ocaml-Software seems to be written
for many-years-Ocaml-programmers: They are very fluently
in understanding the mli-files and using them as
sufficient for programming.

Maybe I should read more informations7documentations about
the Module-system, so that I can rely on the same
mechanism: Reading the mli-files to understand the
programs.

But nevertheless, an overwiev-documentation is always a good
Idea.

I hope that I will understand the Camlp4-tutorial,
now where I can write my comments on the paper. ;-)

OK, I decided to forget it now.

What is yacc?

It was a joke. :)

It looked like the Camlp4-Preprocessor and the Grammar-Module
did know, what to do, and how to handle mathematical operations.

After experimenting with changing the levels of the tutorial's
code, I thought, that the levels may be levels of priority.

I thought, not to read it in the tutorial, but maybe I have not
seen it there. I will reread the tutorial in a more patient
manner.

Ciao,
   Oliver
