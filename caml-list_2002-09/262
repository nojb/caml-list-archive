Ok,
  Sounds like it would be better to take this off the caml-list, it is
becoming
Ensemble specific. Why don't you send me the exact weakness that you think
may be harmful to your project, and I'll try to answer.

Hello Ohad,

The question is not a speed, but strength of the algorithms. I think
that Ensemble *should* have storng algorithms for security or
pluggable interface to switch in OpenSSL, cryptokit or whatsoever.

I'm developing an enterprise-level application in OCaml using Ensemble
and security is a thing that should be quite strong :)
