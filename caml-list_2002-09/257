Yeah yeah yeah. Bedouin has been inactive for a long period. Basically
because of my lack of time, and also an erosion of interest. Many people
seems to be interested in Bedouin, but it is hard to find contibutors for
the design or the implementation !  I'm willing to continue working on
Bedouin if other people - preferably with real-world experience - show
interest *and* get involved. Hint hint.

For the moment, Bedouin has:
- a mapping from the HTML 4 DTD to OCaml types, ensuring correctness
  of produced pages
- a skeleton of the application logic (handling sessions, dispatching
  pages)
- a skeleton of a widget library (abstraction of form controls, to allow
  an event-like style, with callbacks, etc...)


Gerd's wdialog should also be mentioned: http://wdialog.sourceforge.net/
