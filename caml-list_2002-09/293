I do not know whether LablGTK questions are appropriate here, 
so I apologize in advance... 

I am writing a plugin for some GTK program (JPilot, actually) 
and I would like to write a GUI part of plugin in OCaml. 
Plugin shows its GUI in parent program's window, and it obtains 
parent GTK widgets from parent program. This of course happens 
in C world, that is, in C world I have one or two 'GTKWidget*'s 
Is it possible to move those pointers to LablGTK world, 
that is to obtain GObj.widget from them? 

Sorry if this is a FAQ... 

Thanks in advance, 
Dmitry
