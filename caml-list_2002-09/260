It took me a while, but I just posted a version of my Berkeley DB 
wrapper.  Here's the URL:

   http://minsky-primus.homeip.net/ocaml/bdb.tar.gz

There are currently problems with the transactional support (it 
segfaults and I don't know why), but other than that seems to work 
pretty well.  There is currently good-but-not-complete support for 
dbenvs, dbs, cursors and transactions.
