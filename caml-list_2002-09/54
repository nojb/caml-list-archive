Notice that you should be able to install the sid version of the
packages with something like :

apt-get install -t sid ocaml

(and -t sarge when ocaml 3.06 packages enter testing in a few days).

So you don't need to recompile yourself to get ocaml 3.06 and the other
library packages you are using.

That said, the problem you mention below (if it is a problem) is also present
with the 3.06 debian packages.
