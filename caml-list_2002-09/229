hi

1)
  When I'm trying to compile such file:
=============================================
module M =
 struct
  let open () = print_string "open called\n"

 end;;

M.open ();;
=============================================
  I get errors like

File "somefile.ml", line 3, characters 6-10:
Syntax error

  It is the location of "open" function.  I think it's a parser's bug - am
I right?  Will it be fixed in next OCaml releases?


2)
  I have modified standart buffer.ml and buffer.mli - I've added
functions "get_line" (gets next line from buffer or raises Not_found
if there's no line) and "get_block" (gets specified number of characters
to pre-allocated string).  I think these functions will be useful not only
for me - can you add them (or their analogs) to standart distribution as
Buffer's modification or as some new module (Fifobuff, for example)?


bye
