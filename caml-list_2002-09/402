Wouldn't it be safer to just do something like:

    let suit_to_int = function
      | Spades   -> 0
      | Hearts   -> 1
      | Diamonds -> 2
      | Clubs    -> 3

?  You only have to type it once, and if you change the constructors
around, it won't even compile.  Plus it gives you control over which
int a suit corresponds to -- i doubt you can get any sort of guarantee
if you use Obj.magic.
