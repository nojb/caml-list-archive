Subject: [Caml-list] Timeout patch to X11 Graphics module

Hello,

Since I had problems with threads, and since the required feature does
not really need threads, I've done a little patch to the Graphics module.
Well, in fact, the X11 version of the Graphics module. Someone needs to fix
this for Win32.

A new Timeout of float constructor is available in the Graphics.event type :

type event =
    Button_down                 (** A mouse button is pressed *)
  | Button_up                   (** A mouse button is released *)
  | Key_pressed                 (** A key is pressed *)
  | Mouse_motion                (** The mouse is moved *)           
  | Poll                        (** Don't wait; return immediately *)
  | Timeout of float            (** No event occurs in the specified number of seconds *)

A new timedout field has been added to Graphics.status record type :

type status =
  { mouse_x : int;              (** X coordinate of the mouse *)
    mouse_y : int;              (** Y coordinate of the mouse *)
    button : bool;              (** true if a mouse button is pressed *)
    keypressed : bool;          (** true if a key has been pressed *)
    key : char;                 (** the character for the key pressed *) 
    timedout : bool;            (** true only if no event occured in the given time *)
  }

For example the expression

	wait_next_event [Key_pressed;Mouse_motion;Timeout 3.0]

will return when the mouse is moved, a key is pressed or if 3 seconds
pass, whichever comes first. In the first two cases, the timedout
field will be false. In the last case, it will be true and other
fields will be meaningless (zero or false, actually).

The patch is available at

	http://www.liafa.jussieu.fr/~durak/ocaml-306-graph.patch

Apply it by typing (sorry I'm not an expert in making patches, hope this is correct)

	cd /usr/local/src/ocaml-3.06 && patch -p6 </path/ocaml-306-graph.patch

assuming that your Ocaml sources are in /usr/local/src/ocaml-3.06 and
that the patch is /path/ocaml-306-graph.patch.

I guess it will work with previous versions.

Note that it seems that recompiling the whole Ocaml is unnecessary ;
just type

   cd /usr/local/src/ocaml-3.06/otherlibs/graph && make && make allopt && make install.

Now I can concentrate on implementing ``Standard Tetris'' !!
