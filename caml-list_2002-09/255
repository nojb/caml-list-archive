The Cygwin port of OCaml is just the OCaml Unix sources compiled and
linked against the Cygwin "Unix compatibility" libraries.  The latter
do not (yet?) provide a Unix-compatible thread library, hence no
threads in OCaml-Cygwin.

The Mingw port of OCaml is the OCaml Win32 sources compiled by
Cygwin/Mingw and linked against the native Win32 libraries, which
include Win32 threads.  Thus, OCaml-Mingw supports threads via Win32.
