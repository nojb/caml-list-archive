Thanks for all the help. The mingw32 soloution seems perfect for what I want :) 

A link on the download page to the information contained in README.win32 might be a help to other people like myself who are unsure which win32 version is best for them (maybe the link is there and I just didn't find it). The feature matrix of the various compilers in README.win32 is very helpful.

Thanks once again for all your advice,

Mark.
