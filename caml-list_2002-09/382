There is an SML syntax provided by Camlp4, it is incomplete, but I
managed to translate a rather big program from SML to OCaml with it.

You can take the source of that syntax pa_sml.ml and make your changes
to create your own syntax, but I am afraid that its code is very bad
written, because by mistake I took some version of the SML-NJ grammar
of some years ago which were very unreadable. I should rewrite pa_sml.ml
one day...

Another solution is to take the "normal" syntax pa_o.ml or the "revised"
syntax pa_r.ml as start. I have been working these days on a "Scheme"
syntax, pa_scheme.ml (written in Scheme syntax and bootstrapped by
a revised syntax version pa_schemer.ml).

Or you can start from scratch, if you are courageous...
