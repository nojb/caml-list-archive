Yes it's better.
Is there any reason why this is not in the standard library ?
It seems that there is only one functorial interface to weak hash tables,
and they are intended to be used like a set,  while yours is intended to
be used when we want to be "weak" for the key _and_ for the data.
I think it would be useful to have both.
My 2 cents,
