There is no callcc in Ocaml. You may have used this feature with other
implementations of ML, say SML-NJ. The implementation technology
of the latter is based on continuations, which makes callcc
easily available. Ocaml implementation is not based on continuations,
but on stacks: it proved to be fairly more efficient, but=20
you lose callcc.
