Oups! I didn't notice the and!

The answer to your question is no. In let x = e1 and y = e2 the order
of evaluation between e1 and e2 is not specified, whereas it is
specified for let .. in let .. in. Hence the two programs are not
equivalent.

So, would you like me to send your original question to the list ?

(Sorry for the misunderstanding)
