=09Linking of values are now well formalized in calculus like m-calculus =
(Wells
and Vestegaard) or CMS (Ancona and Zucca). The principal idea is to defin=
e
link between components and variables apart from their definition. Units =
of
Flatt or Felleisen are also a good example of implementation of this idea=
=2E

=09However, "deferred types" (which allows a way to obtain mutually recur=
sive
types across modules) are not managed in these formalisms The main proble=
m
with ML family's languages may be that they need a context to type terms =
and
that incomplete contexts leads to the impossibility of typing modules ...=
 I
am not yet a specialist of the field but you can read the following artic=
les
to understand the general problem of mutually recursive modules (aka mixi=
ns).
