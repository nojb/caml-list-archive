How about using a linear-congruential random number
generators.  These simple algorithms will generate
numbers that don't repeat for a long period of time
(typically they use 32bit integers but I'm sure you'll
be able to find algorithms that generate numbers in a
larger range).  You can generate permutations of by
setting the seeds to different values.

HTH,
Noel
