I'm now setting up my Caml installations.
One thing that I've noticed is that often times when you
suddenly need a package ( say something to do computational geometry
), it becomes a pain to set it up.

So what I would like to do is install everything upfront, including
common libraries that I am likely to need sooner or later.
( Really esoteric libraries can be left off ).

So I looked through the VisualWorks 7 ( Smalltalk ) installation,
which generally comes with about 95% of the VW libraries out there 
( 95% of the noncommercial libraries of course ), looked through the
libraries and tried to come up with a similar list of Caml.

Below I present my half-finished list.
The format is:
Type of library
   Specific package1
   Specific package2
    ...
Type of library.

When I was unsure I put ???? or some comments.

What I am asking is: 
1) If I am missing a type of library please add it.
2) Where I am missing a package please add it.

If several packages are available, please list the "best"
one only, unless there is something which distinguishes
between the two.

Thanks.
