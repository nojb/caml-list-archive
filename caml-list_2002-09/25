Not exactly. I sell, deploy and run Linux based information 
systems.

The customers ask for features. I have to give them to them. 
They don't even *know* what language I am using.

It's not really the kind of business I'm interested in. I 
don't really like the idea of writing commercial software. I 
greatly prefer to write free software and sell it 
nonetheless. I *feel* better. I think that I'd get sick and 
get covered with green warts if I gave up Ocaml for VC++ ;-)
