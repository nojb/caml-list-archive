As Ohad said, OpenSSL offers more ciphers than my Cryptokit, and some
of them probably run faster in OpenSSL, but still the ciphers and
hashes supported by Cryptokit are entirely standard (AES, Triple DES,
RC4, RSA, etc) and have no known cryptographic weaknesses -- provided
adequate key sizes are selected, of course.

Security holes are much more likely to arise as a consequence of
incorrect use of these algorithms, e.g. at the cryptographic protocol
level, than as a consequence of a weakness of the algorithms
themselves.
