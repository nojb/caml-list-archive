Subject: [Caml-list] Genlex - and which parser?

Hello,

I recently (today) experimented with the Genlex-module.
It seems to be very very easy to lex code.

(But some things are predefined, what has advantages and
 disadvantages, I think, but doesn't matter here.)

Which parser can be used together with Genlex?
Is it ocamlyacc? Or others?

Or do I have to write most code for parsing by my own?

Are there any examples in using the Genlex-module?

Seems to be the easiest lexer I found.
If there would be a Genpare-module, this would be
the easiest way for writing little-language's parsers.

So, any hints are welcome.


Ciao,
   Oliver
