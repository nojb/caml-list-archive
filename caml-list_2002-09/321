It's not too bad, just do:

 let (algoA, algoB, algoC) =
   if (use algorithm 1) then
   (M_1.algoA, M_1.algoB, M_1.algoC)
   else if (use algorithm 2) then
   (M_2.algoA, M_2,algoB, M_2.algoC) ...

But admittedly it still is somewhat annoying.

No, you are right. Unfortunately, this either requires 1st-class
modules, or if-then-else on the module level. (The latter can be
partially faked by heroic use of higher-order functors, but you don't
want to see that and it most likely does not apply to your particular
problem, since the condition itself had to be expressible in the module
language). Both is not (yet?) available in OCaml, and in very few other
languages, for that matter (Moscow ML currently being the only MLish
exception). Such a feature is not impossible to add, but represents a
significant complication of the language that may not be considered
worthwhile.
