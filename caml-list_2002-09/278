When choosing a crypto package, there are a few points to consider:

- the people who implement the package
(Good) crypto algorithms are usually secure on paper. But when translated in
code, this is not always the case.

- the range of algorithms supported
Actually this is not so critical because most protocol start with a
negociation phase.

- the maintenance of the package
Flaws are being discovered everyday. It is better to use a crypto package
which is widely used, tested and maintained.

- the license

openSSL seems to be a really good contender. Sun announced yesterday that it
is donated its Elliptic Curve crypto implementation (ECC)  to the project.
That's really for embedded devices because ECC offers the same level of
security with much smaller key size.

I think the last and worst thing to do is to re-implement some crypto from
scratch.

regards,

Arnaud
