To start - I really don't know that much about programming (3 years =
self-taught in scripted web languages - Perl/PHP/Ruby), and I'm trying =
to learn OCaml...

I've mostly dealt with persistent socket servers in other programming =
languages, and I'd like to write one in OCaml.

I've read most of the book - Developing Applications with Objective Caml =
(English PDF), so I understand a little - but I'm still very unsure of =
myself.

Here's the problem I'm trying to solve...

I have a proprietary format I'm trying to read in through a socket - =
when I say proprietary I mean that the EOL character is the ASCII null =
character (\000) and not the '\n' character.

I've looked at the examples in the OReilly book, but I'm not sure how to =
change the default End Of Line character (\n) to \000.

Will I have to do some sort of pattern match on the stream so that I can =
deal with 'each line' using \000 as the EOL character?

Do the input, input_line, read, or read_line methods accept a different =
EOL character as a parameter - or can I define the method differently?

Since I can read in a certain amount of characters with methods like =
read, can I find the location of the ASCII null character and read from =
the stream until right after it?

I hope I've asked good enough questions...

Thanks for any help you guys can give!

Let me know if anything's not clear enough...
