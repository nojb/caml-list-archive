Since Arnaud bite the bullet already, let me give a few infos about
Galax.

Galax is an implementation of the XPath 2.0 / XQuery 1.0 family of
working drafts. (See http://www.w3.org/XML/Query). It is a complete
implementation of those two languages. People on this list will probably
be interested to know it also comes with (alpha) support for XML Schema
and static type inference.

Galax is open-source and implemented in Caml. The development is
(mostly) done by Mary Fernandez from AT&T and myself.

We are planning for an official release by the end of the month (which
is the reason we did not advertise it yet), but people interested can
find a very early prototype and more details on the Galax Web site.
(http://db.bell-labs.com/galax).

Voila,
Stay tuned for more in a couple of weeks :)
