thread killing is a nice but dangerous feature...
Most of the time the client thread has to tell its server  when it may
be interrupted and when it may not. So that it is  simpler that  the
client code checks periodically a global variable, and stops when it
becomes true.
Java API used to have a Thread.kill method, but it became deprecated from
the 1.1 version.
