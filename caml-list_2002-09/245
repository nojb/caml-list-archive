This works: I could bootstrap ocaml with that.
The only trouble, which was solved by a colleague, is that there is no
lib command included: you must replace it by "link /lib" both in
Makefile.msvc and ocamlopt sources. This means that you cannot use the
ocamlopt from the ocamlwin binary distribution, you would have to
compile it yourself.

Also, the code generated is slower than the professional edition (but
just the same as the student edition).
