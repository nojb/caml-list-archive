We support what we have access to here at INRIA, namely Solaris on
32-bit SuperSPARC processors.  (We stopped buying SPARCstations circa 1995,
when Linux or BSD PCs started to make a lot more sense.)

Based on users' feedback, SPARC/Linux and SPARC/BSD have worked in the
past, and UltraSPARC in 32-bit mode seems OK too, but you may have to
adjust a few things to get the latest OCaml running on the latest
SPARC/BSD.

Patches for UltraSPARC, BSD, or whatever are welcome, as long as we
can still test OCaml on our old SuperSPARC/Solaris.
