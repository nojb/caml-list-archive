I don't agree. My customers pay me to develop server
software on *nix, where the clients just happen to be Linux
boxes but might just as well be windows boxes, for all I
care. And I'm paid pretty well actually.

I am not using only O'Caml. As I am developing a data
centric application, I use SQL and XML tools extensively.
Presently, PXP is a very strong XML parser, but it lacks
support for XSLT (XSchema would be nice, too), so I am
forced to go with Xalan of the Apache foundation.

The bottom line is: 1) you don't need to develop Windows
software to make money, and 2) you'd better focus on writing
high quality code with high quality software development tools.

BTW, I'd gladly give up XSLT and SQL if, respectively, we
had a pseudo-official XML transformation API for Ocaml, and
there were Caml server-side bindings with PostgreSQL. In the
first place, I'd be able to statically typecheck my XML
transformation code. In the second place, I'd be able to
write type safe queries in such complex contexts where
baseline SQL is insufficent and the generality of pl/pgSQL
is needed.
