The docs say that there are two kinds of threads in O'Caml: 
Ocaml bytecode threads and POSIX threads, and that it is 
possible to select which implementation to use at compiler 
build time. Two questions: first, what is the implementation 
chosen in the ocaml RPM distribution; second, why must one 
choose one implementation at compiler build time? Why not 
use a compiler switch such as --posix-threads as opposed to 
--caml-threads?
