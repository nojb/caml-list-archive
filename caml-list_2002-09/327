Could we consider making using -pack the standard for a future version of
ocaml (3.07) and add a -nopack version for those that don't want to use
it, especially when building .cmas ?

This would need a bit of discussion first, but mostly, i don't think
anyone would object to this, at least not very strongly.

That said ...

Well, this would cause a problem, which need to be solved before -pack
is supported as standard. What are exactly the cases were it causes
problem, (AIX when not using the GNU linker, i guess, but also maybe
windows ?) and is there any chance this can be solved soonly ?

Alternatively, this could be a feature that could be enabled/disabled at
build time ?
