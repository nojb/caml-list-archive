I definitely need RTTI.  I'm not sure why you think I need method
overloading.

I'm not sure.  All the approaches I've seen in ocaml seem incredibly heavy
compared with RTTI in java (and/or more brittle).  I'm not sure about your
approach, though (it looks pretty light).  Thanks for the suggestion!

Here is a question for the language designers: is there a technical reason
why RTTI can't be done easily in the ocaml object system?  Or is the lack
of RTTI more of a "moral" issue?  Or is it just due to not enough time to
put in all the features one would like?  I can imagine that the fact that
subtyping is implicit for any class that implements the methods of a
superclass might make RTTI very tricky to implement cleanly in a general
way.  

It's too bad we can't all roll our own object systems for ocaml ;-)
