                             PPDP 2002
             Fourth International Conference on Principles
                and Practice of Declarative Programming
                         Pittsburgh, PA, USA
                          October 6-8, 2002
                     http://ppdp2002.cs.brown.edu

                     Early Registration Deadline:
                          SEPTEMBER 12, 2002
                       (** Next Thursday!! **)

PPDP aims to stimulate research on the use of declarative methods in
programming and on the design, implementation and application of
programming languages that support such methods.

In addition to the 18 regular paper presentations, PPDP 2002 features
invited talks by Neil Jones, Catuscia Palamidessi and Janos Sztipanovits.

PPDP is part of PLI, a confederation of conferences and workshops
aimed at the advancement of high-level programming languages.  This
year, PLI consists of three conferences:

  GPCE (Generative Programming and Component Engineering)
  ICFP (International Conference on Functional Programming)
  PPDP (International Conference on Principles and Practice of
        Declarative Programming)

and seven workshops:

  Erlang
  FDPE (Functional and Declarative Programming in Education)
  Haskell
  PLAN-X (Programming Languages for XML)
  Rule (Rule-Based Programming)
  Scheme
  VCL (Verification and Computational Logic)

The hotel's cut-off date for guaranteed reservations at the group rate
is also September 12, 2002, so do register and reserve soon.

We look forward to seeing you in Pittsburgh!
