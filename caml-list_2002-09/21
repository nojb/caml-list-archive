Hmhhh in the campl4-tutorial/-reference they explain an other
Lexer (Plexer). I think it's similar.
Will Genlex not be used? Or is Plexer based on Genlex?

Any way, thanks for your hint.



Some additional words:

In the camlp4-tutorial there is an example for programming a
simple calculator.
I didn't expect to get a working solution/example on page 9
of the tutorial.
That's great!

I have looked for such tools for many years and now I have found it. :)

Again, as I said about OCaml, I can say about Camlp4, that
it's a great piece of work, what the developpers/researchers
have done in providing such a great language and tools.

If I think about how to write such stuff with lex/yacc
in C, and then look at the power of Ocaml wow, then I more
and more see that writing C (and it's followers) are the middle-
ages of programming.

Ciao,
   Oliver

P.S.: I think it's now time to write DSLs. :)
