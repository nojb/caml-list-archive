Unfortunately, your scheme does not scale to class hierarchies deeper
than 1. Consider for example adding `subsubclass' as a subclass of
`subclass_1'. Then you might want to downcast from `superclass' to
`subclass_1', but your object actually is a `subsubclass'. Your downcast
will fail. You need hierarchical exception constructors to make that
work.
