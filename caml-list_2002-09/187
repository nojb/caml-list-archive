The wrappers are part of a larger project which will itself be released
publicly in the next few days.  In any case, I'll post a link to a copy of
just the Berkeley DB wrapper if I remember this evening.  I actually fixed
the bug in question, and the wrapper has decent support for the DB
environments, databases, cursors and transactions.  It's currently
compatible with Berkeley DB 3.3.11 and 3.2.9, but it could be updated for
the 4.x versions without too much work.
I'd be happy to have another pair of eyes on the code.  I find tracking
down bugs in C wrapper code much harder per loen of code than finding bugs
in Caml code proper.
