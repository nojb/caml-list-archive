unmaintained code is not good to have around anyway, it will most
probably break some in the future anyway (when there is a ocaml 4.0 for
example ?).

But the change is only adding the appropriate open at the top of the
files, i guess it could even be done with automatic translation or
something such.

Also, i guess the Pervasive library will be opened by default, and maybe
also the standard library.

This namespace problem is one that ocaml was having since a long time,
and which will become only worse as time passes and more library will be
written. So are you saying that we should stay with something that will
cause more and more problem as time passes, just because some obsolete
and unmaintained code will break in this case ? 

Anyway, this can be done in a painless incremental way.

We decide that starting now, all libraries should use the -pack option
when it is possible, and slowly migrate to using that for the existing
code, but still keep the default behavior as usual. Later, when we are
satisfied that it works well and most libraries are ported to using
-pack (and the acompanying code using it also), we can modify the
behavior to use -pack by default for libraries.

And btw, it is more natural to write, for example Gdk.Event.Button than
GdkEvent.Button, as we do now, don't you think ?

At build time of the ocaml compiler suite, with a configure option, so
that you could build an ocaml suite to either use -pack by default or
not, and a ocamlc option to return the default used pack option, so you
could use it to write the libraries accordyingly (well, maybe this is
not easily).
