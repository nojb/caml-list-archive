I'm not just asking what is available. I'm asking something more.
Specifically I am asking what is needed by someone doing general
tasks, which libraries work best and what approaches to these topics
work best with Caml. Also what topics I may be missing.

It  should  be mentioned on www.ocaml.org. In fact that
mailing list should be more prominently mentioned since
the expectation is that most people visiting are relative
newbies.

Also I don't think the whole question is newbie oriented.
Since I'm asking for opinions some of the topics can border
on advanced ( for example: parsers the Caml way ).
