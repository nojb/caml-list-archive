When                  Sep 21, 2016 - Sep 24, 2016
Where                 Gregynog, UK
Submission Deadline   June  3, 2016
Notification          June 17, 2016
Final Version Due     July  1, 2016

AIMS AND SCOPE=20

The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many
aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as
formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers
new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as
object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and
higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of
application areas (including information systems, concurrent,
distributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an
opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues,
and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

TOPICS OF INTEREST=20

Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:=20
- Foundations of algebraic specification=20
- Other approaches to formal specification, including process=20
  calculi and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing=20
- Specification languages, methods, and environments=20
- Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques=20
- Model-driven development=20
- Graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems=20
- Integration of formal specification techniques=20
- Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification=20

WORKSHOP FORMAT AND LOCATION

The workshop will take place over four days, Wednesday to Saturday, at
Gregynog Hall in Wales, UK (http://www.gregynog.org). Participants
should arrive on Tuesday evening, the workshop will end on Saturday
with lunch.

Presentations will be selected on the basis of submitted abstracts.

IMPORTANT DATES=20

Submission deadline for abstracts: June 3, 2016=20
Notification of acceptance: June 17, 2016=20
Early registration: June 17, 2016=20
Final abstract due: July 1, 2016
Workshop in Gregynog: September 21-24, 2016

SUBMISSIONS=20

The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of
recent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be
selected by the Steering Committee on the basis of submitted abstracts
according to originality, significance and general interest. The
abstracts must be up to two pages long including references. If a
longer version of the contribution is available, it can be made
accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.

The abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair
system.

PROCEEDINGS=20

After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit full papers for
the refereed proceedings. All submissions will be reviewed; selection
will be based on originality, soundness and significance of the
presented ideas and results. The proceedings will be published as a
volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer).

SPONSORSHIP=20

The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.=20
