Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Papers and Demos: Functional Art, Music,
 Modelling and Design


================================================================
	      4th ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on
	     Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design
			 Co-located with ICFP
		   Nara, Japan, 24 September, 2016
		   http://functional-art.org/2016/
================================================================

Call for Papers and Demos

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop.  The language used need not be
purely functional ("mostly functional" is fine), and may be manifested
as a domain specific language or tool.  Moreover, submissions focusing
on questions or issues about the use of functional programming are
within the scope.

We welcome submissions from academic, professional, and independent
programmers and artists.  Submissions are invited in three categories:

1) Original papers

We solicit original papers in the following categories:

* original research
* overview / state of the art
* technology tutorial

All submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM
theme. FARM 2016 is an interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range
of approaches are encouraged. An original paper should have 5 to 12
pages, be in portable document format (PDF), using the ACM SIGPLAN
style guidelines and use the ACM SIGPLAN template
(http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Accepted papers will be
published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the FARM 2016
proceedings. See http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm for information on
the options available to authors. Authors are encouraged to submit
auxiliary material for publication along with their paper (source
code, data, videos, images, etc.); authors retain all rights to the
auxiliary material.

2) Demo proposals

Demo proposals should describe a demonstration to be given at the FARM
workshop and its context, connecting it with the themes of FARM. A
demo could be in the form of a short (10-20 minute) tutorial,
presentation of work-in-progress, an exhibition of some work, or even
a performance.  Demo proposals should be in plain text, HTML or
Markdown format, and not exceed 2000 words. A demo proposal should be
clearly marked as such, by prepending `Demo Proposal:` to the
title. Demo proposals will be published on the FARM website.  A
summary of the demo performances will also be published as part of the
conference proceedings, to be prepared by the program chair.

3) Calls for collaboration

Calls for collaboration should describe a need for technology or
expertise related to the FARM theme. Examples may include but are not
restricted to:

* art projects in need of realization
* existing software or hardware that may benefit from functional programming
* unfinished projects in need of inspiration

Calls for collaboration should be in plain text, HTML or Markdown
format, and not exceed 5000 words. A call for collaboration should be
clearly marked as such, by prepending `Call for Collaboration:` to the
title. Calls for collaboration will be published on the FARM website.

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might
be suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop
itself, please contact the organizers at: farm-2016@functional-art.org

All presentations at FARM 2016 will be recorded.  Permission to
publish the resulting video (in all probability on YouTube, along with
the videos of ICFP itself and the other ICFP-colocated events) will be
requested on-site.

Key Dates:
Submission deadline - June 24
Author Notification - 22 July
Camera Ready - 15 August
Workshop - September 24, 2016
