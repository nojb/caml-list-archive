INVITED SPEAKERS

  Elvira Albert, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PPDP  2016  is a  forum  that  brings  together researchers  from  the
declarative  programming communities, including  those working  in the
logic,  constraint  and  functional  programming paradigms,  but  also
embracing languages, database  languages, and knowledge representation
languages. The  goal is  to stimulate research  in the use  of logical
formalisms  and  methods  for  specifying, performing,  and  analyzing
computations,   including   mechanisms   for   mobility,   modularity,
concurrency,  object-orientation,  security,  verification and  static
analysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools
in industry and education are especially solicited. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to

* Functional programming
* Logic programming
* Answer-set programming
* Functional-logic programming
* Declarative visual languages
* Constraint Handling Rules
* Parallel implementation and concurrency
* Monads, type classes and dependent type systems
* Declarative domain-specific languages
* Termination, resource analysis and the verification of declarative progra=
ms
* Transformation and partial evaluation of declarative languages
* Language extensions for security and tabulation
* Probabilistic modeling in a declarative language and modeling reactivity
* Memory management and the implementation of declarative systems
* Practical experiences and industrial application

This year the conference will be co-located with the  26th Int'l Symp.=20=20
on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 2016)  and=20=20
the 23rd Static Analysis Symposium (SAS 2016).

The  conference will  be held in Edinburgh, UK. Previous symposia were
held  at  Siena  (Italy),  Canterbury  (UK),  Madrid  (Spain),  Leuven=20
(Belgium), Odense (Denmark), Hagenberg (Austria),  Coimbra (Portugal),=20
Valencia (Spain), Wroclaw (Poland), Venice (Italy), Lisboa (Portugal),=20
Verona (Italy), Uppsala (Sweden), Pittsburgh (USA), Florence  (Italy),=20=20
Montreal (Canada),  and  Paris (France).  You might have a look at the=20
contents of past PPDP symposia, http://sites.google.com/site/ppdpconf/

Papers  must  describe original  work,  be  written  and presented  in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published  or   that  are  simultaneously  submitted   to  a  journal,
conference, or  workshop with refereed proceedings.  Work that already
appeared in  unpublished or informally  published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).

After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to
extend their submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the
symposium.   The papers  are expected  to include  at least  30% extra
material over and above the PPDP version. Then, after another round of
reviewing, these revised  papers will be published in  a special issue
of SCP with a target publication date by Elsevier of 2017 (tentative).

Important Dates

  Abstract submission:       9  May, 2016
  Paper submission:         16  May, 2016
  Notification:             20 June, 2016
  Final version of papers:  17 July, 2016

  Symposium:                5-7 September, 2016
=20=20=20
Authors  should  submit  an  electronic  copy of  the  full  paper  in
PDF. Papers  should be  submitted to the  submission website  for PPDP
2016. Each submission must include  on its first page the paper title;
authors  and   their  affiliations;   abstract;  and  three   to  four
keywords. The keywords will be used to assist the program committee in
selecting appropriate  reviewers for the paper.  Papers should consist
of   the   equivalent  of   12   pages   under   the  ACM   formatting
guidelines.  These   guidelines  are  available   online,  along  with
formatting templates  or style files. Submitted papers  will be judged
on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and
clarity. They should  include a clear identification of  what has been
accomplished and  why it is  significant. Authors who wish  to provide
additional material to  the reviewers beyond the 12-page  limit can do
so in  clearly marked appendices:  reviewers are not required  to read
such appendices.
