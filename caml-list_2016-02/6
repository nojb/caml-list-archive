10th International Workshop on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and
Communication Systems
Tunis, Tunisia, October 6-7, 2016
http://www.vecos-world.org


***Important dates

Paper Submission Deadline: April 18, 2016
Notification of paper acceptance: June 15, 2016
Submission of camera-ready papers due: July 7, 2016


***Scope and Aims

VECoS 2016 will be held the 6th-7th October 2016 at the Tunisia Polytechnic
School (EPT) that is the main organizer together with the support of
Digital Research Center (DRC) of Sfax, MeFoSyLoMa Group and Formal Methods
Europe.

The International Workshop on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and
Communication Systems (VECoS) was created by an Euro-Med network of
researchers in computer science. Its first edition VECoS 2007 took place in
Algiers, VECoS 2008 in Leeds, VECoS 2009 in Rabat, VECoS 2010 in Paris,
VECoS 2011 in Tunis, VECoS 2012 in Paris, VECoS 2013 in Florence, VECoS
2014 in Bejaia, VECoS 2015 in Bucharest.

The aim of the VECoS workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners, in the areas of verification, control, performance, quality
of service, dependability evaluation and assessment, in order to discuss
the state-of-the-art and the challenges in modern computer and
communication systems in which functional and non-functional properties are
strongly interrelated. Thus, the main motivation for VECoS is to encourage
the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and
evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, and especially those
developed for concurrent and distributed hardware/software systems.

Beyond its technical and scientific goals, another main purpose of VECoS is
to promote collaboration between participants in research and education in
the area of computer science and engineering. We welcome contributions
describing original research, practical experience reports and tool
descriptions/demonstrations in the areas of verification, control,
performance, quality of service and dependability evaluation.


***Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Model-checking - Equivalence checking - Abstraction techniques
Compositional verification - Parameterized verification
Supervisory control - Probabilistic verification
Correct-by-construction design - Rigorous system design
Verification & validation of IoT - Verification & validation of
mixed-critical system
Security protocols verification - Performance and robustness evaluation
Simulation techniques of discrete-event and hybrid systems
Dependability assessment techniques - QoS evaluation, planning and
deployment
Verification & validation of safety-critical systems
RAMS (Reliability Availability Maintainability Safety) assessment
Certification standards for real-time systems


***Application domains

Mobile and wireless networking, wireless sensor networks, communication
protocols, Internet of things, telecommunication systems, ubiquitous
systems, adaptive systems, real-time and embedded operating systems,
cyber-physical systems (CPS) , mixed criticality systems, service oriented
systems, workflow systems, web services, could computing,
computer-supported collaborative work systems, programming languages, high
performance computing, logistics systems, operations research, manufactory
of the future.


***Invited speakers

Eric Badouel, IRISA Rennes, France
Fabio Gaducci, University of Pisa, Italia
Serge Haddad, LSV ENS Cachan, France


***Submission and Publication

Contributions must have not been published previously, nor already
submitted to other conferences/journals in parallel with this
workshop. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in PDF format and
should not exceed 15 pages using the Electronic Workshops in Computing
(eWiC) format.

Accepted contributions will be included in the workshop proceedings and
published online at CEUR-WS.org indexed by DBLP.

Some of the selected papers from the workshop will be considered for
publication in extended and revised form in a special issue of the
International Journal of Critical Computer-Based Systems (IJCCBS) indexed
by Scopus, ACM Digital Library and DBLP

Papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, on-line via
easychair system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dvecos2016

Azgal Abichou, EPT, Tunisia
Kamel Barkaoui, CNAM Paris, France


***Program Co-chairs:

Mohamed Ghazel, IFSTTAR, Lille, France
Mohamed Jma=C3=AFel, DRC Sfax, Tunisia
