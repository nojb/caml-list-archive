Subject: [Caml-list] 2nd Workshop on Bridging the Gap between Human and
 Automated Reasoning - Call for Papers


                      CALL FOR PAPERS
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                   Second Workshop on:                    |
|  Bridging the Gap between Human and Automated Reasoning  |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

       an IJCAI-16 workshop (supported by IFIP TC12)
               New York, USA, July 9th, 2016
        http://ratiolog.uni-koblenz.de/bridging2016


Human  reasoning  or  the  psychology  of  deduction is well
researched in cognitive psychology and in cognitive science.
There  are a lot of findings which are based on experimental
data about reasoning tasks,  among  others  models  for  the
selection  task  or  the suppression task discussed by Byrne
and  others.  This  research  is  supported  also  by  brain
researchers,  who  aim  at  localizing  reasoning  processes
within the brain.

Automated deduction, on the other hand, is  mainly  focusing
on the automated proof search in logical calculi. And indeed
there is tremendous success during the last decades.

Recently a coupling of the areas of  cognitive  science  and
automated  reasoning is addressed in several approaches. For
example there is increasing interest in modeling human  rea-
soning within automated reasoning systems including modeling
with answer set  programming,  deontic  logic  or  abductive
logic  programming. There are also various approaches within
AI research.

This workshop is a follow-up event of the successful  Bridg-
ing  workshop (http://ratiolog.uni-koblenz.de/bridging.html)
which was located at CADE-25. Like its preceding  event,  it
is  intended  to  get an overview of existing approaches and
make a step  towards  a  cooperation  between  computational
logic and cognitive science. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to the following:

o limits and differences between automated and human reason-
  ing

o psychology of deduction

o common sense reasoning

o logics modeling human cognition

o modeling human reasoning using automated reasoning systems

o non-monotonic, defeasible,  and  classical  reasoning  and
  possible explanations for human reasoning

o application  fields of automated reasoning in the interac-
  tion with human reasoners


The workshop will be held in conjunction with  IJCAI-16  and
is supported by IFIP TC12.
