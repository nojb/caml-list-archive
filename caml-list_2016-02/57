Hello Anton,

Thank you for your detailed explanations.

Well I would have marked the "f x". My reasoning is simple, if f is
executed, it should be green. And f is more important than try regarding
coverage.

Two remarks:

 * If expressions are marked (which I suspected), then the HTML output
should color at expression granularity level and not line granularity
level. Therefore you would have only green or red and never orange[1]
(which would be simpler and clearer);

 * You could do some post-processing to look for such keywords as
“then”, “else”, and “end” and color them accordingly. It might be more a
hack than a clean approach, but I think it would make the output more
readable.

All that said, I'm not using your tool (for now), so I would understand
that you not take my remarks into account. ;-)

Best regards,
david
