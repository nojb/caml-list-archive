FORTE 2016 Call for Papers
36th IFIP International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed 
Objects, Components and Systems
http://forte2016.discotec.org

Part of the DisCoTec 2016 event
http://2016.discotec.org/index.php
6-9 June 2016, Aquila Atlantis Hotel, Heraklion, Crete

FORTE 2016 is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models,
tools, and applications for distributed systems. The conference
solicits original contributions that advance the science and
technologies for distributed systems, with special interest in the
areas of:

- service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid, cloud, and mobile
computing systems;
- object technology, modularity, component- and model-based design;
- software reliability, availability, and safety;
- security, privacy, and trust in distributed systems;
- adaptive distributed systems, self-stabilization;
- self-healing/organizing;
- verification, validation, formal analysis, and testing of the above.

Contributions that combine theory and practice and that exploit formal
methods and theoretical foundations to present novel solutions to
problems arising from the development of distributed systems are
encouraged. FORTE covers distributed computing models and formal
specification, testing and verification methods. The application
domains include all kinds of application-level distributed systems,
telecommunication services, Internet, embedded and real-time systems,
as well as networking and communication security and reliability.

Main topics of interest

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

- Languages and semantic foundations: new modeling and language
concepts for distribution and concurrency, semantics for different
types of languages, including programming languages, modeling
languages, and domain-specific languages; real-time and probability
aspects;
- Formal methods and techniques: design, specification, analysis,
verification, validation, testing and runtime verification of
various types of distributed systems including communications and
network protocols, service-oriented systems, adaptive distributed
systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor networks;
- Foundations of security: new principles for qualitative and
quantitative security analysis of distributed systems, including
formal models based on probabilistic concepts;
- Applications of formal methods: applying formal methods and
techniques for studying quality, reliability, availability, and
safety of distributed systems;
- Practical experience with formal methods: industrial applications,
case studies and software tools for applying formal methods and
description techniques to the development and analysis of real
distributed systems.

Important dates:

Abstract submission: February 15, 2016 (24:00 UTC-11) --- extended​
Paper submission: February 22, 2016 (24:00 UTC-11) --- extended
Notification of acceptance: March 21, 2016
Camera-ready version: April 4, 2016
Early registration: May 9, 2016
Conference and workshops: June 6-9, 2016

Invited speaker

Catuscia Palamidessi (INRIA, France)

Submission and publication

Contributions must be written in English and report on original,
unpublished work, not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s
codes of conduct). The submissions must be prepared using Springer’s
LNCS style. Submissions not adhering to the specified constraints may
be rejected without review. Papers can be submitted electronically in
pdf via the FORTE’16 interface of the EasyChair system.

We solicit four kinds of submissions:

- Full papers (up to 15 pages): Describing thorough and complete
research results, tools or experience reports.
- Short papers (up to 7 pages): Describing research results that are
not fully developed, or manifestos, calls to action, personal views
on FORTE related research, on the current state of the art, or on
prospects for the years to come.
- Tool demonstration papers (up to 7 pages): focus on the usage
aspects of tools. Theoretical foundations and experimental
evaluation are not required, however, a motivation as to why the
tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Papers may
have an appendix of up to 5 additional pages with details on the
actual demonstration.
- Posters (up to 3 pages): Students can submit descriptions of posters
that will be presented at the conference during a students poster
session. Neither the descriptions or the posters will be published
in the proceedings.

Each paper will undergo a peer review of at least 3 anonymous
reviewers. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in
the LNCS Series. The best papers will be invited after the conference
to contribute to a special issue of a top-level journal (such as LMCS).
