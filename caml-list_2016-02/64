For the reasons that Enrico mentioned, it could come from the Coq code
base, so it would be best to use the same version of Coq to investigate
this issue.

This could be related to http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6990
or not.  (I don't know whether the heap growing policy changed between
OCaml 3.12 and OCaml 4.01).

It's helpful to run with OCAMLRUNPARAM=v=4 to monitor how much memory
OCaml requests from the OS and at which points in program execution.
