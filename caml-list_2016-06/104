Subject: [Caml-list] PEPM 2017 Call for Papers

[Please consider submitting!  PEPM has a strong and ongoing tradition
of OCaml- and MetaOCaml-related research - Jeremy]

CALL FOR PAPERS
Workshop on PARTIAL EVALUATION AND PROGRAM MANIPULATION (PEPM 2017)

http://conf.researchr.org/home/PEPM-2017

Paris, France, January 16th - 17th, 2017
(co-located with POPL 2017)

PEPM is the premier forum for discussion of semantics-based program
manipulation.  The first ACM SIGPLAN PEPM symposium took place in
1991, and meetings have been held in affiliation with POPL every year
since 2006.

PEPM 2017 will be based on a broad interpretation of semantics-based
program manipulation, reflecting the expanded scope of PEPM in recent
years beyond the traditionally covered areas of partial evaluation and
specialization.  Specifically, PEPM 2017 will include practical
applications of program transformations such as refactoring tools, and
practical implementation techniques such as rule-based transformation
systems.  In addition, the scope of PEPM covers manipulation and
transformations of program and system representations such as
structural and semantic models that occur in the context of
model-driven development.  In order to maintain the dynamic and
interactive nature of PEPM and to encourage participation by
practitioners, we also solicit submissions of short papers, including
tool demonstrations, and of posters.

Scope
-----

Topics of interest for PEPM 2017 include, but are not limited to:

* Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
  partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active
  libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution,
  refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

* Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
  manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
  binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated
  testing and test case generation.

* Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
  metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
  languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming,
  staged computation, and model-driven program generation and
  transformation.

* Application of the above techniques including case studies of
  program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
  projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust
  tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
  benchmarking.  Examples of application domains include legacy
  program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations,
  visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing,
  middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and
  web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation,
  and security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage
submissions describing applications of semantics-based program
manipulation techniques in new domains.  If you have a question as to
whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop,
please contact the programme chairs.

Submission categories and guidelines
------------------------------------

Three kinds of submissions will be accepted: Regular Research Papers,
Short Papers and Posters.

* Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be
  judged on originality, correctness, significance and clarity.
  Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages in ACM Proceedings
  style (including appendix).

* Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of
  exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting
  academic, industrial and open-source applications that are new or
  unfamiliar.  Short papers must not exceed 6 pages in ACM Proceedings
  style (including appendix).

* Posters should describe work relevant to the PEPM community, and
  must not exceed 2 pages in ACM Proceedings style.  We invite poster
  submissions that present early work not yet ready for submission to
  a conference or journal, identify new research problems, showcase
  tools and technologies developed by the author(s), or describe
  student research projects.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the
workshop and present the work.  In the case of tool demonstration
papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.
Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing guidelines for both
research tool demonstration papers will be made available on the PEPM
2017 web site.

Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses and other support.  PAC also
offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during the
meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with
physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of
North America and Europe.  For details on the PAC programme, see its
web page.

Publication and special issue
-----------------------------

All accepted papers, short papers and posters included, will appear in
formal proceedings published by ACM Press.  Accepted papers will be
included in the ACM Digital Library.  Authors of selected papers from
PEPM 2016 and PEPM 2017 will also be invited to expand their papers
for publication in a special issue of the journal Computer Languages,
Systems and Structures (COMLAN, Elsevier).

Best paper award
----------------

PEPM 2017 continues the tradition of a Best Paper award.  The winner
will be announced at the workshop.

Submission
----------

Papers should be submitted electronically via HotCRP.

   https://pepm17.hotcrp.com/

Authors using LaTeX to prepare their submissions should use the new
improved SIGPLAN proceedings style, and specifically the
sigplanconf.cls 9pt template.

Important Dates
---------------

For Regular Research Papers and Short Papers:

 * Abstract submission : Tuesday 13th September 2016
 * Paper submission    : Friday 16th September 2016
 * Author notification : Monday 24th October 2016
 * Camera ready        : Monday 28th November 2016

For Posters:

 * Poster submission   : Sunday 30th October 2016
 * Author notification : Friday 10th November 2016
 * Camera ready        : Monday 28th November 2016

PEPM workshop:

 * Workshop            : Monday 16th - Tuesday 17th January 2017

The proceedings will be published 2 weeks pre-conference.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date
may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The
official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose
proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the
conference is over, the official publication date remains the first
day of the conference.).
