Subject: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

A few years ago, with over 30 years of programming experience including 15 =
years primarily in Java, I decided I needed a new =E2=80=9Chome=E2=80=9D pr=
ogramming language. I then spent a frustrating few years studying what=E2=
=80=99s out there. I have felt like a man without a country. I developed fa=
irly serious crushes on Scala and then on Haskell, but after a few serious =
dates with them I moved on. I have read deeply about many, many more.

I have converged on OCaml. It is a beautiful language and a highly practica=
l functional language. Although infrastructure such as compilers, editor/ID=
E support, and libraries are on the minimal side, the essentials are all th=
ere and are lovingly maintained. Although the community is small, it is sma=
rt, friendly, and engaged. Some amazing technology is available or work-in-=
progress (such as js_of_ocaml and Mirage).

But this feels like a fragile new home unless we can build a bigger communi=
ty! For one thing, if our community shrinks much, it may no longer be viabl=
e. Also, while I love 1,000 packages on opam, I want 100,000!

As a newcomer to the community, I have to say that there are daunting barri=
ers to a potential new user considering OCaml for a new project. If you lik=
e starting on a new programming language with a book, as I do, you likely s=
tart with Real World OCaml. That book is very inspiring! But then when you =
try to move from RWO to, well, using OCaml in the real world, you discover =
that there is no consensus on Core as a standard library, and that Camlp4 i=
s deprecated.

It appears to me that if, instead, you come to OCaml as a potential new use=
r through ocaml.org, there are other barriers. It is hard for me to judge b=
ecause I came through RWO, but it appears to me that the lack of consensus =
on standard library comes up pretty quickly. I=E2=80=99m more of a language=
 manual guy than a tutorial guy, so I quickly notice that, although the OCa=
ml language manual is well written, has a lovely introductory flow, and has=
 great examples, it fairly quickly gets into terse description of language =
constructs while providing limited help to a beginner in developing intuiti=
on for the language as a whole and how best to use it.

This is one man=E2=80=99s experience and one man=E2=80=99s opinions. Do oth=
ers on this list feel the ramp to OCaml adoption is smoother than my impres=
sion suggests? Who here is excited about making OCaml approachable to newco=
mers? Where is the main ongoing work on this? Who are the main leaders from=
 this perspective?
