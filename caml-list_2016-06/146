Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

Dean,

it is great to see that OCaml is again seen as attractive. This is
fairly different now than, say, 10 years back, when OCaml had a really
hard time (academic projects were finished, and it was unclear whether
other users could be found). At that time, this home was really fragile,
short before collapsing. Fortunately, this did not happen, and now there
is a supporting community, small but to large parts brilliant.

In some sense, there is now the problem of too much choice. You say
you'd like to see 100000 packages. Actually, I'm fearing such a
situation - picking up a common metaphor it would mean there are lots of
wheels which are incompatible to each other. That's not only the choice
of standard library, but also other important base libraries like for
asynchronous networking. I'm not against choice of implementation, but
this small community should definitely do more to avoid unnecessary
fragmentation. Jeremy Yallop kind of answered this for the standard
library: the one coming with the compiler should be the one establishing
base types (like result) so that other libraries can pick that up and
remain compatible on this level. Libraries like Core would then be pure
add-ons.

Fortunately, OCaml added some features that could turn out as very
helpful in that respect. In particular first-class modules help here:
you can now pass modules around like values. I'm hoping that this is
picked up to make currently incompatible implementations again
interoperable on a fundamental level (e.g. Async and Lwt could agree on
a common module type for the core features so that users can run Lwt
with Async's core and vice versa). This gives users additional freedom,
and they are not faced with the question whether they should either go
to Lwt-land or Async-land.

But anyway, I guess you are not yet at this point, and are enjoying
things that are working well. I recently got thrown into the muddy
waters of Scala, and while they are better organized it is feeling like
a dinosaur language. I definitely prefer OCaml's minimalism.
