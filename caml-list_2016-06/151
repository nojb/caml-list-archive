Very true, and we do!

We've always repeatedly claimed that reviewing proposed patches/changes
would be a big help. Some external contributors frequently do it and it is
very useful. (It is particularly useful when they're ready to go to the
level of a code review, but feedback on the design is already useful.)

For a concrete example, the email I sent to announce that we would accept
pull-requests on Github, in addition to patches on Mantis (
https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2014-01/msg00254.html ), starts
as follows:

To repeat again: any help reviewing proposed patches, on *both* Mantis and
Github, is warmly welcome. It's an excellent way to get to know diverse
parts of the compiler distribution codebase, it's informative, low-risk,
interesting, very helpful. Do it!

That should, of course, not prevent us from un-blocking a situation with
the compiler stdlib, where people interested in also improving its state
(such as you) were prevented from contributing by lack of clear upstream
guidance on the range of accepted changes and the decision process. We want
more reviews *and* more good stuff, and we should have both.
