Subject: [Caml-list] Verified refactoring in OCaml and CakeML: 2 postdoc
 positions: closes 13-June-2016


The Trustworthy Refactoring project at the University of Kent is seeking to=
 recruit postdoc research associates for two 3.5 year positions, to start i=
n September this year.

The overall goal of this project is to make a step change in the practice o=
f refactoring by designing and constructing of trustworthy refactoring tool=
s. By this we mean that when refactorings are performed, the tools will pro=
vide strong evidence that the refactoring has not changed the behaviour of =
the code, built on a solid theoretical understanding of the semantics of th=
e language. Our approach will provide different levels of assurance from th=
e (strongest) case of a fully formal proof that a refactoring can be truste=
d to work on all programs, given some pre-conditions, to other, more genera=
lly applicable guarantees, that a refactoring applied to a particular progr=
am does not change the behaviour of that program.=20

The project will make both theoretical and practical advances. We will buil=
d a fully-verified refactoring tool for a relatively simple, but full featu=
red programming language (CakeML https://cakeml.org), and at the other we w=
ill build an industrial-strength refactoring tool for a related industriall=
y-relevant language (OCaml). This OCaml tool will allow us to explore a ran=
ge of verification techniques, both fully and partially automated, and will=
 set a new benchmark for building refactoring tools for programming languag=
es in general.=20

The project, which is coordinated by Prof Simon Thompson and Dr Scott Owens=
, will support two research associates, and the four will work as a team. O=
ne post will focus on pushing the boundaries of trustworthy refactoring via=
 mechanised proof for refactorings in CakeML, and the other post will conce=
ntrate on building an industrial strength refactoring tool for OCaml. The p=
roject has industrial support from Jane Street Capital, who will contribute=
 not only ideas to the project but also host the second RA for a period wor=
king in their London office, understanding the OCaml infrastructure and the=
ir refactoring requirements.

You are encouraged to contact either of the project investigators by email =
(s.a.owens@kent.ac.uk, s.j.thompson@kent.ac.uk) if you have any further que=
stions about the post, or if you would like a copy of the full research app=
lication for the project. We expect that applicants will have PhD degree in=
 computer science (or a related discipline) or be close to completing one. =
For both posts we expect that applicants will have experience of writing fu=
nctional programs, and for the verification post we also expect experience =
of developing (informal) proofs in a mathematical or programming context.
