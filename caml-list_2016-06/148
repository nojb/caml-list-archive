A few thoughts:

As Anil said, we're working on an updated RWO, which should resolve the
camlp4 issue.

As for mixing and matching between libraries that do and don't depend on
Core, there's actually little difficulty here. Core sticks to the standard
interchange types (array, string, option, list, char, and now result) that
are provided by the stdlib, so whether you use Core (or Core_kernel)
becomes more a matter of personal preference, and shouldn't hinder
interoperability.

One remaining problem with Core is the minimal executable size, which is
currently much bigger if you use Core. We're considering some work in three
next few months to make this much better.

Async and Lwt are a real problem. They provide very similar functionality,
and mixing and matching between two schedulers is not so easy. I'd love to
see some resolution here, but it's not clear what the solution would be.
Perhaps once we resolve the executable size issues of Core, there will be
more appetite for some kind of merger of the two libraries.  In the
meantime, we're highly committed to continuing development and support for
Async.
