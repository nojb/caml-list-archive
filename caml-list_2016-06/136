Special Issue on Adaptive and Reconfigurable Distributed Systems

http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-electrical-engineering/call-=
for-papers/special-issue-on-adaptive-and-reconfigurable-distributed-sys/

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D INTRODUCTION
The focal concerns are Service-oriented and component-based software
systems, applications and architectures addressing adaptation and
reconfiguration issues. Different investigation topics are involved, such
as: CBSE, SOA, Functional and Non Functional (NF) requirements (QoS,
performance, resilience), monitoring, diagnosis, decision and execution of
adaptation and reconfiguration. Different research axes are covered:
concepts, methods, techniques, and tools to design, develop, deploy and
manage adaptive and reconfigurable software systems.

The concept of adaptive and reconfigurable software systems has been
introduced in order to describe architectures, which exhibit such
properties. An adaptive and reconfigurable software system can repair
itself if any execution problems occur, in order to successfully complete
its own execution, while respecting functional and NF agreements. In the
design of an adaptive and reconfigurable software system, several aspects
have to be considered. For instance, the system should be able to predict
or to detect degradations and failures as soon as possible and to enact
suitable recovery actions. Moreover, different NF requirements service
levels might be considered in order to complete the execution in case of
failure.


=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D TOPICS
For this special issue, contributions are devoted to adaptive and
reconfigurable distributed systems. Specifically, the relevant topics
include:
- Distributed and centralized solutions for the diagnosis and repair of
software systems
- Design for the diagnosability and repairability
-  Monitoring simple and composite architectures, components and services
- Semantic (or analytic) architectural and behavioral models for
monitoring, planning and deployment of software systems
- Dynamic reconfiguration of software systems architectures
- Software architecture design and validation for complex systems
- Scalability management in software systems architectures
- Collaborative planning and decision-making
- Collaborative technologies for ensuring autonomic properties
- Predictive management of adaptability.
