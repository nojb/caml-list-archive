======================================================================


The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on  logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open  to contributions  in logic-based  program development  in any
language  paradigm.  LOPSTR  has  a reputation  for  being  a  lively,
friendly forum for presenting and  discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after  the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 26th International Symposium  on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation  (LOPSTR  2016)  will  be held  at  the  University  of
Edinburgh,  Edinburgh,  UK;  previous  symposia were  held  in  Siena,
Canterbury,  Madrid,  Leuven,  Odense, Hagenberg,  Coimbra,  Valencia,
Lyngby,  Venice,  London,  Verona, Uppsala,  Madrid,  Paphos,  London,
Venice, Manchester, Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve,
and  Manchester.  LOPSTR  2016  will  be  co-located  with  PPDP  2016
(International  Symposium on  Principles and  Practice of  Declarative
Programming) and SAS 2016 (Static Analysis Symposium).

Topics  of   interest  cover   all  aspects  of   logic-based  program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small   and  programming-in-the-large.   Both  full
papers and  extended abstracts describing applications  in these areas
are especially  welcome. Contributions are  welcome on all  aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

  * synthesis
  * transformation
  * specialization
  * composition
  * optimization
  * inversion
  * specification
  * analysis and verification
  * testing and certification
  * program and model manipulation
  * transformational techniques in SE
  * applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new
perspective,  and application  papers  that  describe experience  with
industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers  must  describe original  work,  be  written and  presented  in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published  or   that  are  simultaneously  submitted   to  a  journal,
conference, or  workshop with refereed proceedings.  Work that already
appeared in  unpublished or informally published  workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).


Important Dates

  Abstract submission (*extended*):                 Jun  20, 2016
  Paper/Extended abstract submission (*extended*):  Jun  27, 2016
  Notification:                                     Aug   3, 2016
  Camera-ready (for electronic pre-proceedings):    Aug  19, 2016
  Symposium:                                        Sep 6-8, 2016


Submission Guidelines

Authors  should submit  an electronic  copy of  the paper  (written in
English) in  PDF, formatted in  the Lecture Notes in  Computer Science
style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title;
authors and their affiliations;  contact author's email; abstract; and
three  to  four keywords  which  will  be used  to  assist  the PC  in
selecting appropriate reviewers  for the paper. Page  numbers (and, if
possible, line  numbers) should appear  on the manuscript to  help the
reviewers in writing their report.  Submissions cannot exceed 15 pages
including references but excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication.  Reviewers are not  required to read  the appendices,
and thus papers should be  intelligible without them. Papers should be
submitted  via  the  Easychair  submission website  for  LOPSTR  2016:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2016
(can be accessed also through the LOPSTR 2016 web site).


Best Paper Award and Prize

A best paper award will be granted, which will include a 500 EUR prize
provided by  Springer.  This  award will  be given  to the  best paper
submitted to the conference, based  on the relevance, originality, and
technical quality. The program committee may split the award among two
or more papers, also considering authorship (e.g., student paper).


Proceedings

The formal  post-conference proceedings will be  published by Springer
in the  Lecture Notes in Computer  Science series. Full papers  can be
directly  accepted  for  publication  in the  formal  proceedings,  or
accepted  only for  presentation  at the  symposium  and inclusion  in
informal  proceedings. After  the symposium,  all authors  of extended
abstracts  and full  papers  accepted only  for  presentation will  be
invited to revise and/or extend their  submissions in the light of the
feedback  solicited at  the symposium.  Then, after  another round  of
reviewing, these  revised papers may  also be published in  the formal
proceedings.
