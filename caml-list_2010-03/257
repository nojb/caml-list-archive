PLMMS Scope
-----------

The program committee welcomes submissions on programming language
issues related to all aspects of mechanised mathematics systems
(MMS). In particular:

  - Mathematical algorithms
  - Tactics and proof search
  - Proofs
  - Mathematical notation

Of particular interest are the dimensions of:

  - Expressiveness
  - Efficiency
  - Correctness
  - Understandability and Usability
  - Modularity and Extensibility
  - Design and implementation

Mechanised mathematics systems, whether stand-alone or embedded in
larger systems, include but are not limited to:

  - Dependent typed programming languages
  - Proof assistants
  - Computer algebra systems
  - Proof planning systems
  - Theorem proving systems
  - Theory formation systems

These issues have a very colourful history. Why are all the languages
of mainstream computer algebra systems untyped? (Not for lack of
trying: Axiom and Magma both enjoy type systems, although they have
not (yet) become mainstream.) Why are the (strongly typed) proof
assistants so much harder to use than a typical computer algebra
systems?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?  What forms
of dependent types may be used in mathematical modelling?  How can MMS
regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and "modularity"?
What are the biggest barriers when using more mainstream languages for
computer algebra systems, proof assistants or theorems provers?

Many programming language innovations appeared in either computer
algebra or proof systems first, before migrating into more mainstream
programming languages.  This workshop is an opportunity to present the
latest innovations in the design of MMS that may be relevant to future
programming languages, or conversely novel programming language
principles that improve upon the implementation and deployment of MMS.


Submission Details
------------------

We welcome submission of proposals to present a demo, as well as
submissions of papers presenting original unpublished work which is
not been submitted for publication elsewhere.

Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library. System demos
will be presented at the workshop, and the material from the demo will
be made available online.

Papers and demos should be submitted via the PLMMS 2010 easychair website:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plmms2010

At least one author of each accepted paper/demo is expected to attend
PLMMS 2010 and present her or his paper/demo.

Papers should be no more than 8 pages in length and are to be
submitted in PDF format. They must conform to the ACM SIGPLAN style
guidelines using 9-point font size (see
http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm - this also
provides latex templates). Each submission must also adhere to
SIGPLAN's republication policy
(http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm). Papers will be
reviewed by at least three reviewers and the authors will have an
opportunity for rebuttal by the response deadline.

Demo proposals may be formatted as the author finds most suitable, but 
should include a brief description of the system and proposed contents 
of the demo.
