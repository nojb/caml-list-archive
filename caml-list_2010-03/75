The following is the call for participation for CUFP, the Commerical Users
of Functional Programming workshop that is co-located with ICFP.  If you
have experience using OCaml (or another functional language) in a practical
application, consider submitting a proposal to give a talk about it at CUFP!

Without further ado:

CUFP 2010 Call For Participation
================================

Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic
research for over 35 years, and have seen an ever larger practical
impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial firms to
biomedical research labs.  At the same time, a vigorous community of
practically-minding functional programmers has come into existence.

CUFP is designed to serve this community.  The annual CUFP workshop is
a place where people can see how others are using functional
programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and
collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about
the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn
practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work.

Giving a CUFP Talk
------------------

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical
setting, we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the
workshop.  We're looking for two kinds of talks:

**Experience reports** are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to inform
participants about how functional programming plays out in real-world
applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights
gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical;
reflections on the commercial, management, or software engineering
aspects are, if anything, more important. You do not need to submit a
paper!

**Technical talks** are expected to be 30-45 minutes long, and should
focus on teaching the audience something about a technical technique
or methodology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play
out in practice.  These talks could cover anything from techniques for
building functional concurrent applications, to managing dynamic
reconfigurations, to design recipes for using types effectively in
large-scale applications.  While these talks will often be based on a
particular language, they should be accessible to a broad range of
functional programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, send an e-mail to francesco(at)erlang-consulting(dot)com or
yminsky(at)janestreet(dot)com by 15 May 2010 with a short description
of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should
give a talk about. Such descriptions should be about one page long.

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.
