Please help disseminate this call for papers

Two changes in the call for papers:

1/ papers describing experiments in other type theory-based proof 
assistants are explicitly invited to this workshop,

2/ EPTCS (http://eptcs.org/) has agreed to host the proceedings.

Call for papers

The Coq workshop will bring together Coq users, developers and 
contributors. The workshop will be organized from submitted papers, 
invited talks and a plenary discussion on the evolution and design of 
Coq. Topics for submitting a paper include:

   * Experiments with type-theoretic proof assistants
   * Language or tactics features
   * Theory and implementation of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
   * Applications and experience in education and industry
   * Tools, platforms built on Coq
   * Plugins, libraries for Coq
   * Interfacing with Coq
   * Formalization tricks and Coq pearls

Authors should submit their paper through EasyChair at the following link:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coq2

Submitted papers should be in (postscript or) portable document format. 
Papers should not exceed 12 pages in length in single-column full-page 
11pt A4 style.

If there is sufficient demand, we will try to organize a time slot for 
demonstrations. Similarly, we may also organize a session on the lessons 
learned from teaching Coq. If you are interested, please send a brief 
proposal.
