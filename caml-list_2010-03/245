Hello Dmitry,

Too bad :-( I got very little feedback to my call: just one data point
(thanks Gaetan).  Perhaps most OCaml users interested in numerical
computations have switched to x86-64bits already?  At any rate, given
such a lack of interest, this x86-32/SSE2 port isn't going to make it
into the OCaml distribution.

Right.  The mode change makes the conversion about 10x slower on x87
than on SSE2.  Apparently, float->int conversion is uncommon is
numerical code, otherwise we'd observe bigger speedups on real
applications...

The SSE2 code is prettier than the x87 code, but this doesn't seem to
translate into a significant performance gain, in my limited testing.

Most x86-32bits C libraries implement sin(), cos(), etc with the x87
instructions, so I'm curious to know what you find objectionable here.

Why not start on this list?  We'll move to private e-mail if the
discussion becomes too heated :-)
