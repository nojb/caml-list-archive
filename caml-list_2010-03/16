Building OCaml from source is definitely not a beginners' question! :o)

I've not come across that way before (by which I mean "you learn a new thing
every day"!), the more usual way, which will work with OCaml, is to specify
a different root for the -prefix option when you run configure. make install
will then install OCaml there. I used to use that when compiling uses OCaml
on a machine for which I didn't have root and I used it just the other day
to compile OCaml 3.12.0 on Maemo so the switch definitely works.

All that said, what distro are you using? Debian and Fedora (and *BSD) all
have native packages for OCaml.

The Caml Hump I believe has up-to-date information as long as it's
submitted. I'm quite lazy and tend only to look for updates to libraries I
use when either I hit a bug or am installing on a new machine ...
www.ocamlcore.org is a pretty good place to start, I think.
