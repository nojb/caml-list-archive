I've just been playing with using camelia on Windows, since some =
students in my class are using it.

My problem is that I can't figure out how to configure Camelia to run a =
non-Cygwin Ocaml.  My installation puts the executables in C:\Program =
Files\Objective Caml\bin, and I can redirect the configuration to look =
here.  But when Camelia tries to run the ocaml toplevel, it complains =
that it cannot find pervasives.cmi.  This is true when I also configure =
the libraries to be in C:\Program Files\Objective Caml\lib\.  When I run =
ocaml from the terminal, it runs fine (i.e., it's able to find the .cmi =
file).

Any camelia users with ideas about what is going on?  Thanks in advance!

-Mike
