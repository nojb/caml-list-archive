Because it's an elaborate configuration.  I don't want to write an
equally elaborate parser when I've already got ocaml to do that for me.
 I'd rather get a compile-time error than a runtime error if the syntax
is bad.  And the app isn't designed to be user-configured.

They also use it for things like debug/release build.  But I suppose you
could say that the two configurations have totally different
dependencies for these purposes.

I know what I'm doing is a little weird.  But I have my reasons for
wanting to do it this way.
