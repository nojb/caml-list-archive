CALL FOR PAPERS

22nd Symposium on Implementation and Applications of Functional Languages
(IFL 2010)
September 1-3, 2010
Utrecht University
Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands
http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/IFL2010/WebHome


After a first successful visit to the USA, the Symposium on
Implementation and Applications of Functional Languages returns to
Europe for its 22nd edition. The hosting institution is Utrecht
University in the Netherlands, although the conference itself will
take place in the ornithological theme park Avifauna in Alphen aan den
Rijn, situated conveniently close to Schiphol (Amsterdam Airport). The
symposium dates are September 1-3, 2010.

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged in the implementation and application of functional and
function-based programming languages. IFL 2010 will be a venue for
researchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in
progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation
and application of functional languages and function-based
programming.

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2010 will use a post-symposium review
process to produce formal proceedings which will be published by
Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All
participants in IFL 2010 are invited to submit either a draft paper or
an extended abstract describing work to be presented at the
symposium. At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously
submitted to other venues. Here we follow the ACM Sigplan
republication policy as defined on
http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm. The submissions will
be screened by the program committee chair to make sure they are
within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the draft proceedings
distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing in the draft
proceedings are not peer-reviewed publications. After the symposium,
authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the feedback from
discussions at the symposium and will be invited to submit a revised
full article for the formal review process. These revised submissions
will be reviewed by the program committee using prevailing academic
standards to select the best articles, which will appear in the formal
proceedings.

INVITED SPEAKER

Johan Nordlander of Lulea University, the designer and developer of
the Timber language, is the invited speaker at IFL 2010. Timber is a
functional programming language that draws some of its concepts from
object-oriented programming, and has built-in facilities for
concurrent execution. The language is specifically targeted at
implementing real-time embedded systems.

TOPICS

IFL welcomes submissions describing practical and theoretical work as
well as submissions describing applications and tools. If you are not
sure that your work is appropriate for IFL 2010, please contact the PC
chair at jur@cs.uu.nl. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 language concepts 
 type checking 
 contracts 
 compilation techniques 
 staged compilation 
 runtime function specialization 
 runtime code generation 
 partial evaluation 
 (abstract) interpretation 
 generic programming techniques 
 automatic program generation 
 array processing 
 concurrent/parallel programming 
 concurrent/parallel program execution 
 functional programming and embedded systems 
 functional programming and web applications 
 functional programming and security 
 novel memory management techniques 
 runtime profiling and performance measurements 
 debugging and tracing 
 virtual/abstract machine architectures 
 validation and verification of functional programs 
 tools and programming techniques
 industrial applications of functional programming

PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended
abstracts to be published in the draft proceedings and to present them
at the symposium. All contributions must be written in English,
conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS series format and not exceed 16
pages. The draft proceedings will appear as a technical report of the
Department of Computer Science of Utrecht University.

PETER LANDIN PRIZE

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the
symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program
committee based on the submissions received for the formal review
process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
