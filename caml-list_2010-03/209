You can get that kind of behavior, albeit in a bit more restricted
fashion, with the camlp4.macro syntax extension.  It provides DEFINE,
IFDEF, etc.

You could also have the two different module implementations under
different names and have the build system symlink or copy the correct
one in place prior to building.  In OMake, this is easy with the
'ln-or-cp' command.
