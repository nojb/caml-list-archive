Hello Marcel,

maybe this is a typo in your post, or maybe not, but did you notice that in=
=20
the code you provide you request a window of size 10x10 and not 20x20 ?

Also you don't tell us the kind of application you're working on, but you=20
should know that the module Graphics is just for minimal purposes, for exam=
ple=20
for short example when you just need a quick/minimal plotting solution.

=46or more advanced usage you should use the SDL bindings:
http://ocamlsdl.sourceforge.net/

=2D-=20
Cheers
