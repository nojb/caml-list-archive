Hi.

I'm pleased to announce the CamlPDF 0.5 release, which includes a couple 
of new modules (Pdfdate for date manipulation, Pdfannot for annotations 
and Pdfmarks for bookmarks). Almost every other module has been improved 
in some way.

Download: http://www.coherentpdf.com/ocaml-libraries.html

More importantly, I've finally found time to write a short introduction 
to CamlPDF, which lets you try some basic work within the OCaml top level:

http://www.coherentpdf.com/introduction_to_camlpdf.pdf

There have been some API modifications which are not backward 
compatible, but the changes to your source are easy to make. This should 
be the last release with such changes.

There is now a CamlPDF mailing list:
