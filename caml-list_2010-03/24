                 16th International Conference on Logic for
             Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning

                           April 25 - May 1, 2010
                               Dakar, Senegal
                        http://www.lpar.net/lpar-16/


The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial 
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of 
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning, 
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to 
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to 
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 16th 
edition will be held in Dakar, Senegal.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In keeping with the tradition of LPAR, researchers and practioners are 
  encouraged submit short papers reporting on interesting work in progress or 
  providing system descriptions. They need not be original. Extended versions 
  of the short papers may be submitted concurrently with or after LPAR-16 to 
  another conference or a journal.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in Computer 
Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational to the applied. 
At one extreme, it underlies computability and complexity theory and the 
formal semantics of programming languages. At the other, it drives billions 
of gates every day in the digital circuits of processors of all kinds. Logic 
is in itself a powerful programming paradigm but it is also the quintessential 
specification language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems 
to networked infrastructures. Logical techniques link implementation and 
specification through formal methods such as automated theorem proving and 
model checking. Logic is also the stuff of knowledge representation and 
artificial intelligence. Because of its ubiquity, logic has acquired a 
central role in Computer Science education.

Topics
------
New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome. 
Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open 
questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices.

   * Verification
   * Interactive theorem proving and proof assistants
   * Model checking
   * Implementations of logic
   * Satisfiability modulo theories
