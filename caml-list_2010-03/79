    LoCoCo 2010 --  Workshop on Logics for Component Configuration
   Workshop of SAT at FLoC 2010, Edinburgh, Scotland, July 10, 2010
                http://lococo2010.mancoosi.org/
                    Second Call for Papers
                   
                                 
Scope:
======
Modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide
the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution,
but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large
repository of possible choices, and configuring these components according
to user needs, resource constraints, and interdependencies with other
components.  Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic
of great importance for many application domains. Some well-known examples
of complex systems of components in the world of Free and Open Source
software are the different distributions for GNU/Linux, BSD, or Eclipse
plugins.

Understanding and solving these questions is an attractive research
topic since the problems to be solved are complex and interesting for
researchers working on solving techniques, and on the other hand have
the potential of high impact on the way the software we all use
everyday is developed and deployed. Not only adequate logical
formalisms to represent a configuration problem are required, but also
sophisticated reasoning technologies to deal with large amounts of
data. Further relevant aspects include diagnosis of failed
configuration settings and an intelligent behavior dealing with user
preferences.

This workshop will focus on logic-based methods for specifying and solving
complex configuration problems for software components.  The goal of the
workshop is to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in
the area of component configuration of software systems, using different
modeling and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programming,
description logics, satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop will be
an opportunity to discuss common and complementary solutions for solving
component configuration.

Topics:
=======
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
o Configuration problems and models: knowledge representation and
  acquisition, incomplete knowledge, inconsistent knowledge, etc.
o Reasoning methods for solving configuration problems: constraint
  satisfaction and optimization, SAT solving and extensions, integer 
  programming, local search, symmetry breaking, etc.
o Interactivity: user preferences, machine learning, distributed
  environments, etc.
o Applications and tools: case studies, current challenges,
  application reports, etc.

Invited Talk
============
An invited talk will be given by Carsten Sinz (University of Karlsruhe).

MISC 2010
=========
The first Mancoosi International Solver Competition will be held in
conjunction with the LoCoCo workshop:

  http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2010

Important Dates
===============
Friday, March 26   Submission deadline
Friday, April 23   Notification about acceptance
Friday, May 21     Final paper due
Saturday, July 10  Workshop

Submission and Publication
==========================
We welcome submissions of various types of papers related to the
topics of the workshop:

* Regular research papers must be original work, and must not have
  been previously published, nor be under consideration for
  publication elsewhere. This category includes system descriptions
  and tutorial overview papers. System descriptions should come with
  an URL allowing to access or download the system, with preference to
  systems that can be downloaded under an open source
  licence. Presentations of system descriptions at the workshop should
  include a system demonstration.

* Presentations reporting on recent or ongoing work.  They are not
  subject to restriction as for previous, simultaneous, or future
  publication elsewhere.

The complete proceedings, containing the accepted papers of both
categories, will be made freely available on the web for the workshop.
It is planned to provide electronic copies on an USB stick to
registered workshop participants. In addition to that, accepted
regular research papers will be published in a special issue of
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).

Submitted papers of both categories must not exceed a limit of 10
pages, and have to be prepared in LaTeX following the EPTCS formatting
instructions.  Authors may provide pointers to additional online
resources if necessary, and which the reviewers may use to their sole
discretion.  Authors of accepted papers will keep their copyright,
however all papers (of both categories) must carry one of the
different brands of the Creative Commons Licence mandated by
EPTCS. Authors of accepted papers for the EPTCS proceedings have to
grant EPTCS a non-exclusive licence to distribute.

Submissions are handled by easychair at
