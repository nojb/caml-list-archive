I am trying to compile 3.11.2 using cygwin, with a non-standard 
-prefix.  I have tried various prefixes, all unsuccessfully.  Everything 
seems to proceed fine during compilation, the only hiccup is that "make 
install" complains it can't find build/partial.sh, but otherwise 
everything seems 'fine'.

But if I try to start the newly installed binary, it immediately dies 
because it can't find pervasives.cmi (even though it is there, in 
lib/ocaml/pervasives.cmi right beside bin/ocaml).  I looked on the 
archives of caml-list and on mantis, and did not find anything helpful.  
I am at a loss as to what to do now.  Any ideas?

Jacques
