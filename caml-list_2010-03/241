                             APLAS 2010
     Eighth Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
                           Shanghai, China
                     November 28-December 1, 2010
	   http://basics.sjtu.edu.cn/conference/aplas2010/

BACKGROUND

  APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by providing a
  forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas
  in topics concerned with programming languages and systems.  APLAS is
  based in Asia, but is an international forum that serves the worldwide
  programming language community.

  APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software
  (AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many
  researchers from Europe and the USA.  The past APLAS symposiums were
  successfully held in Seoul ('09), Bangalore ('08), Singapore ('07),
  Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), Taipei ('04) and Beijing ('03) after
  three informal workshops held in Shanghai ('02), Daejeon ('01) and
  Singapore ('00).  Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in
  Springer-Verlag's LNCS 2895, 3302, 3780, 4279, 4807, 5356, and 5904.

  The 2010 edition will be held at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China.

TOPICS

  The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical issues in
  programming languages and systems.  Papers are solicited on, but not
  limited to, the following topics:

    * semantics, logics, foundational theory;
    * design of languages and foundational calculi;
    * type systems;
    * compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
    * program derivation, analysis, transformation;
    * software security, safety, verification;
    * concurrency, constraints, domain-specific languages;
    * tools for programming, verification, implementation. 

  APLAS 2010 is not limited to topics discussed in previous symposiums.
  Papers identifying future directions of programming and those
  addressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms are
  especially welcome.  Demonstration of systems and tools in the scope
  of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool presentations category.
  Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are welcome to
  consult with Program Chair prior to submission.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION

  We solicit submissions in two categories:

  1. REGULAR RESEARCH PAPERS, describing original research results,
     including tool development and case studies, from a perspective of
     scientific research.  Regular research papers should not exceed 16
     pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and
     figures.  They should clearly identify what has been accomplished
     and why it is significant.  Submissions will be judged on the basis
     of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity.
     In case of lack of space, proofs, experimental results, or any
     information supporting the technical results of the paper could be
     provided as Appendix or a link to a web page.

  2. SYSTEM AND TOOL PRESENTATIONS, describing systems or tools that
     support theory, program construction, reasoning, and/or program
     execution in the scope of APLAS.  Unlike presentations of regular
     research papers, presentation of accepted papers in this category
     is expected to be centered around a demonstration.  The paper and
     the demonstration should identify the novelties of the tools and
     use motivating examples.  System and Tool presentations papers
     should not exceed 8 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including
     bibliography and figures.  Submissions will be judged based on both
     the papers and the systems or tools as described in the papers.  It
     is highly desirable that the tools are available on the web.

  Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page
  at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2010.  Acceptable
  formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or Acrobat
  Reader.  Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for
  publication elsewhere.  Papers must be written in English.  The
  proceedings are planned to be published as a volume in
  Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Accepted
  papers must be presented at the conference.
