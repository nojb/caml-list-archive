Hi,=0A=0ACCSS is a preprocessor for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), extending=
 the=0Alanguage with arithmetic operations and variables.  It was born out =
of=0Afrustration with the unbearable slowness and lack of support for some=
=0ACSS3 constructs in other similar tools such as LESS [1].  Here are=0Asom=
e points to be aware:=0A=0A - The CSS source is actually parsed into an AST=
, which is then converted=0A   again into a CSS textual representation for =
output.  You can therefore=0A   use it as a pretty-printer.  On the downsid=
e, comments are stripped out.=0A=0A - Because it is an actual parser, it is=
 fairly straightforward to hack=0A   your own custom transformations to the=
 AST.  The scanner is Ulex-based,=0A   whereas Menhir is required for build=
ing the parser.=0A=0A - CCSS knows only of CSS syntax, and has no knowledge=
 of actual CSS=0A   properties and valid values for each.  This simplifies =
the program=0A   and makes it future-compatible, but also means that will g=
leefully=0A   accept nonsensical CSS properties such as the following:=0A=
=0A   h1 {foo: bar;}=0A=0A - The scanner/parser does not cover some of the =
hairy corners of CSS.=0A   It does however handle new syntactic constructs =
introduced with CSS3.=0A=0A - The arithmetic operations are unit-aware, and=
 will complain if you=0A   try adding apples and oranges, for example.=0A=
=0A=0AExamples of use and the syntax for the language extensions are descri=
bed=0Ain the project's homepage, which also includes building instructions =
and=0Adownload links [2].  Note that the source-code is released under the =
terms=0Aof the GNU GPL v2.=0A=0ALast, but not least, though no particular a=
ttention was given to performance,=0Ait does fulfill the initial goal of ma=
king execution time as close to zero=0Aas not to get in the way...=0A=0AHop=
e you find it useful -- feedback is welcome!=0A=0ABest regards,=0ADario Tei=
