Dear colleagues,

This is the call for participation for PLACES'2010, a workshop
for foundations of concurrent and distributed programming.
Applications on the web today are built using numerous
interacting services; soon off-the-shelf CPUs will host hundreds
of cores; and sensor networks will be composed from a large
number of processing units. =A0Many normal software, including
applications and system-level services, will soon need to make
effective use of thousands of computing nodes. At some level
of granularity, computation in such systems will be inherently
concurrent and communication-centred.

To exploit and harness the richness of this computing
environment, designers and programmers will utilise a rich
variety of programming paradigms, depending on the shape of
the data and control flow. Plausible candidates for such paradigms
include structured imperative concurrent programming, stream-
based programming, concurrent functions with asynchronous
message passing, higher-order types for events, and the use of
types for communications and data structures, to name but a few.
Combinations of these abstractions will be used even in a single
application, and the runtime environment needs to ensure seamless
execution without relying on differences in available resources such
as the number of cores.

The development of effective programming methodologies for the
coming computing paradigm demands exploration and understanding
of a wide variety of ideas and techniques. =A0This workshop aims
to offer a forum where researchers from different fields
exchange new ideas on one of the central challenges for
programming in the near future, the development of programming
methodologies and infrastructures where concurrency and
distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern.

With these backgrounds, PLACES'10 is held welcoming as an
invited speaker William Cook from Texas Austin, and excellent
contributions from researchers from divsese fields of
programming studies. We cordially invite your participation in
this workshop. We attach the basic information below.
