EXTENDED DEADLINES
-----------------
Abstract submission: 21 March, 2010
Full paper:          25 March, 2010

=====================================================================


PPDP 2010 aims to bring together researchers from the declarative
programming communities, including those working in the logic,
constraint and functional programming paradigms, but also embracing a
variety of other paradigms such as visual programming, executable
specification languages, database languages, AI languages and
knowledge representation languages used, for example, in the semantic
web. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical
formalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analysing
computations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity,
concurrency, object-orientation, security, and static analysis. Papers
related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools in industry and
education are especially solicited.

The conference will take place in July 2010 in the Castle of
Hagenberg, Austria, colocated with the 20th International Symposium on
Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 2010),
organised by the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) of
the Johannes Kepler University Linz.

Topics:
     * Logic, Constraint, and Functional Programming
     * Database, AI and Knowledge Representation Languages
     * Visual Programming
     * Executable Specification Languages
     * Applications of Declarative Programming
     * Methodologies: Program Design and Development
     * Declarative Aspects of Object-Oriented Programming
     * Concurrent Extensions to Declarative Languages
     * Declarative Mobile Computing
     * Integration of Paradigms
     * Proof Theoretic and Semantic Foundations
     * Type and Module Systems
     * Program Analysis and Verification
     * Program Transformation
     * Abstract Machines and Compilation
     * Programming Environments
The list above is not exhaustive - submissions describing  new and
interesting ideas relating broadly to declarative programming are
encouraged.

Submission guidelines:
Papers should be submitted via the Easychair submission website
for PPDP 2010:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ppdp2010
Papers should consist of the equivalent of 12 pages under the
ACM formatting guidelines. These guidelines are available online,
along with formatting templates or style files.
Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance,
relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. They should include
a clear identification of what has been accomplished and why it is
significant. They must describe original, previously unpublished work
that has not been simultaneously submitted for publication
elsewhere. Authors who wish to provide additional material to the
reviewers beyond the 12-page limit can do so in clearly marked
appendices: reviewers are not required to read such appendices.
No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a
conference or a journal) is allowed.


Proceedings:
The proceedings will be published by ACM Press. Authors of accepted
papers will be required to sign a copyright form.  Camera ready papers
for accepted papers should be prepared and submitted according to the
final instructions that will be sent by the publisher after
notification of acceptance.


Invited Speakers:
Maria Paola Bonacina (Università degli Studi di Verona, Italy)
Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft Research)
