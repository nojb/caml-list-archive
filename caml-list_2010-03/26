Is this native code compilation?

If so, you should be able to use gdb to debug into the Caml bindings at the
assembly level -- does that work?  Unfortunately at the moment there is no Caml
compiler support for emitting the debug info required by gdb to debug at the
language level.  That said, ocamlopt-compiled assembly code is fairly easy to
read, and you should be able to get something resembling a backtrace using
"where".
