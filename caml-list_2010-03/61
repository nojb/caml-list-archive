                  The 2010 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML
                   http://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/ml2010
                   Baltimore, Maryland, United States
                       Sunday, September 26, 2010
                       co-located with ICFP 2010

ML is a family of programming languages that includes dialects known
as Standard ML, Objective Caml, and F#. The development of these
languages has inspired a large amount of computer science research,
both practical and theoretical. This workshop aims to provide a forum
to encourage discussion and research on ML and related technology
(higher-order, typed, or strict languages).

The format of the 2010 Workshop on ML will be different than that of
recent years, returning to a more informal model: a workshop with
presentations selected from submitted abstracts but without published
proceedings. We hope that this format will encourage the presentation
of more exciting (if unpolished) research and deliver a more lively
workshop atmosphere.


Important Dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submission:	25 June, 2010
Notification:	9 August, 2010


Format
~~~~~~

The workshop will consist of presentations by the participants,
selected from submitted abstracts. Participants are invited to submit
working drafts, source code, and/or extended abstracts for
distribution on the workshop homepage and to the attendees, but as the
workshop will have no formal proceedings, any contributions may be
submitted for publication to other venues. (See the SIGPLAN
republication policy for more details.)


Scope
~~~~~

We primarily seek research presentations on topics related to ML,
including (but not limited to):
  * applications: case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.
  * extensions: higher forms of polymorphism, generic programming,
    objects, concurrency, distribution and mobility, semi-structured
    data handling, etc.
  * type systems: inference, effects, overloading, modules, contracts,
    specifications and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting,
    etc.
  * implementation: compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial
    evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, etc.
  * environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language
    interoperability, functional data structures, etc.
  * semantics: operational, denotational, program equivalence,
    parametricity, mechanization, etc.

Research presentations should describe new ideas, experimental
results, significant advances in ML-related projects, or informed
positions regarding proposals for next-generation ML-style
languages. We especially encourage presentations that describe work in
progress, that outline a future research agenda, or that encourage
lively discussion.

In addition to research presentations, we seek both Status Reports and
Demos that emphasize the practical application of ML research and
technology.

Status Reports: Status reports are intended as a way of informing
others in the ML community about the status of ML-related research or
implementation projects, as well as communicating insights gained from
such projects. Status reports need not present original research, but
should deliver new information. In the abstract submission, describe
the project and the specific technical content to be presented.

Demos: Live demonstrations or tutorials are intended to show new
developments, interesting prototypes, or work in progress, in the form
of tools, libraries, or application software built on or related to ML
technology. In the abstract submission (which need only be about half
a page), describe the demo and its technical content, and be sure to
include the demo's title, authors, collaborators, references, and
acknowledgments. A demonstration should take 10-15 minutes. The exact
time per demo will be decided based on the number of accepted
submissions. (Please note that you will need to provide all the
hardware and software required for your demo; the workshop organizers
are only able provide a projector.)


Submission Guidelines and Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Email submissions to mtf AT cs.rit.edu. Submissions should be at most
two pages, in PDF format, and printable on US Letter or A4 sized
paper. Persons for whom this poses a hardship should contact the
program chair. Submissions longer than a half a page should include a
paragraph synopsis suitable for inclusion in the workshop program.
