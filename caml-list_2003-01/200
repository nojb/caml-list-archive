Hi,

I want to write a smallish translator that would read mathematical formulae in 
an easy to read (for humans, that is) format and translate them to a computer 
language (ocaml, fortran, c, latex, etc) for output.  In the process it could 
do simple consistency checks (like making sure the dimensionality of physical 
equations are correct, for example) on the parse tree. 

What are the advantages/disadvantages of using camlp4 vs. a combination of 
ocamllex and ocamlyacc?  

Is there already a translator like this out there (to save me the effort)?  

Any tips on how consistency checks on the equations could be made harnessing 
the power of the type system?

Thanks,
Daniel.
