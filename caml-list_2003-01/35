ok, I got the problem. The next question is: can I extract the string 
rappresenting a variable from a variable ?

in my example I would like to generate a piece of code with a datatype
(ff) that is the parsing result of the string n.

for example, if n = " a + b " I would like to generate a piece of code
like Add (a,b), where Add is part of the datastructure:
type ff =
    | A1
    | A2
    | Add of int * int

and this DS will be visible from both the program and the preprocessor.

el:
	[[ n = STRING ->
		let node = magic_function ( parse_string n ) in
		let id = gen_id() in
		(<:patt<$lid:id$>>,<:expr<$node$>>)
	]];

who can I do that ? what is the magic function ?

tnx,
p
