OCaml does not of unsigned integers.
Using Int64 or Bignum modules as Sven suggested you would be a threat to
your program performances since it involves boxing.

BTW, why do care about the integer sign ?
Only the printer show you -1, but the hardware representation, taking note
that OCaml int are 31 bits, doesn't change between signed and unsigned, does
it ? The only main difference I see is when comparing two signed integers.
Then perhaps something like :

let ui_compare x y =
    x lsr 16 < y lsr 16 || x land 0xFFFF < y land 0xFFFF

Is what you need.

ui_compare 1 2;; // true
ui_compare (-1) 2;; // false
