Oh, these poor little users that want to use software without any
effort, that's so lovely ...

Any computer user must have read and understood the licence (or, less
bad than nothing, a digest) of the software it uses. This is pointless
to care of the ones that do not. Even if they come from the whole
majority, faults must not be agreed but fighted against.
