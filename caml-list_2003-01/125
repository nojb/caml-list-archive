THANK YOU FOR RELEASING CHARTPAK WITH THE BSD LICENSE!

It makes it possible to develop commercial programs with ChartPak and
Ocaml. I hope that more Ocaml-developers realize that GPL and to some
extent LGPL makes it difficult to use their code in commercial
applications where the developers can make a living out of selling the
software.

The fear that the use of a BSD-license will make developers keep their
changes is wrong, since no commersial developer wants to maintain more
software than necessary.

(Please do not start a GPL/LGPL-discussion. For those who believe that
you can be a commercial software developer - not a consultant - around a
GPL-software, just look at Mandrake. Mandrake will probably go bust any
minute now.)
