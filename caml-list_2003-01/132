That's easily explained: Lacaml requires static linking of the
C-libraries, because it has to fiddle around with objects contained in
them, which isn't possible with shared libraries. Thus, you will have to
build a custom toplevel that is (implicitly) linked against the modified
static libraries:

  ocamlfind ocamlmktop -o mytop -package lacaml bigarray.cma lacaml.cma

Executing this custom toplevel (it's _huge_!) and typing in your code
should work without problems...

Markus Mottl
