Hello, you have found the development version of jocaml.

Development is currently stopped but will be restarted.


Of course, there is currently no documentation about this totally
unstable and non-working version.


Yes there will be syntax changes.

The main idea is to avoid the duplication of AST nodes of the old
jocaml. Then, the typechecker is responsible for discriminating between
processes and expressions.
