Fair enough.  Perhaps a function Unix.really_sleep (that ignores
signals) is in order.

Good point.  Should be easy to fix.

Well, Caml calls the X Windows drawing primitives XDrawRectangle and
XFillRectangle with exactly the same arguments.  But that seems to run
into an, hmmm, oddity of X Windows, described in colorful language in
the "Unix Haters" handbook:

Guess we'll have to work around this one.
