Thanks. I know about autoconf, but would like to avoid it. Apparently,
the Ocaml team don't like it neither, since they don't use it in
Ocaml.

I was seeking for something simpler. I'm not very fond of m4 macros
(even if I did hack several years ago such stuff).

In my opinion, autoconf was suited for the problem of configuring C
code for lots of Unix variants. This is not what I need (in particular
Ocaml has a unique implementation).

Maybe my perception of autoconf is wrong, but the mere fact that my
Debian distribution (ok it is sid, a.k.a unstable) requires several
versions of it makes me really feel uneasy.

Regards.
