I've got a dull installation problem, so tune out now if you don't care
about getting lacaml to work on RH 8.0.

Has anyone had any luck installing lacaml on RH 8.0?   I've been trying to
install using the stock LAPACK, BLAS and F2C, and have been running into
trouble.  First of all, RH 8.0 doesn't include libf2c.a --- it only
include libg2c, and then only the .so version, not the .a version.  I
tried linking against the libg2c.a supplied in the g77-compat library, and
it seemed to work.  But then when I tried actually using lacaml, I hit
this:


        Objective Caml version 3.06

# #use "topfind";;
Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives:
  #require "package";;      to load a package
  #list;;                   to list the available packages
  #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
  #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
  Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded

- : unit = ()
# #require "lacaml";;
Loading /usr/lib/ocaml/bigarray.cma
Loading /usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/lacaml/lacaml.cma
The external function `lacaml_Sssqr_diff_wrapper_bc' is not available
#

Any advice is welcomed.
