Hello,

Have a look at the Printexc module
<http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/libref/Printexc.html>

As far as I understand your needs, you can write

try
  ...
with e ->
  Printf.printf "Exception: %s\n" (Printexc.to_string e) ;
  raise e

Notice that the << _ >> pattern is changed into a (binding) variable.


Cheers,
