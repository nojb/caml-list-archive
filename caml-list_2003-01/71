Jim,

After all, I found you have done the work three months ago and reported to
caml-list.  I seem to have reinvented the same but I still have problems
with some of the labltk applications.

When ocamlbrowser.app starts, its GUI components joggle restlessly  in their
top window.  A similar phenomenon can be observed with demo.app.  Do you see
this?

Scrollbars do not react as expected.  I can drag the slider of a scrollbar.
However, clicking the arrow buttons does not move the slider nor have effect
on scrollbar's associate panel.  Clicking in the space between the slider
and arrow buttons is not effective either.

Ocamlbrowser.app fails to quit when the "Quit" item is selected from the
Apple's main menu bar.  Once it is selected, a "busy icon" appears and
ocamlbrowser becomes uninteractive.  I have to force-terminate the
application in that case.  so far this behavior is observed only from
ocamlbrowser.  It is not observed from other labltk examples found under
examples_labltk.  I have not checked examples_camltk, though.

For last, I would like to ask one thing about your build process:

> Follow these instructions to compile and install Tcl/Tk
> (summarized from http://mini.net/tcl/4052):
> 
>  tar zxvf tcl8.4.1-src.tar.gz
>  tar zxvf tk8.4.1-src.tar.gz
>  mv tcl8.4.1 tcl
>  mv tk8.4.1 tk
>  cd tcl/macosx
>  make >& make.log
>  sudo make install
>  cd ../../tk/macosx
>  make >& make.log
>  sudo make install
> 
> (NOTE: the mv's are in fact necessary.)

Could you explain why mv's are necessary?

Regards, 
Ken
