Did you read my answer?
http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200301/msg00120.html

What I believe is happening is that, the way you define it, execute
cannot be given a polymorphic type. This has become more confused
because you wrote a .mli.  Just erase the .mli (or get it out of the
way) and compile lisp.ml. You should get a "this type variable is not
bound" error, which is what Pierre Weis is referring to.

Also note that '_a is only meaningful in output from the compiler.
If you write it in a .mli it will only be interpreted as a normal type
variable, in particular _it cannot match a non-generalizable one_
(only a closed type can).
