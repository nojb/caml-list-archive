In the previous message we have forgotten some unessential information ;-) 
the title of the book is "Introduzione alla programmazione funzionale" 
and it is published by Esculapio.

> About the book
> 
> As far as we konw, this is the first book on OCaml written in
> Italian 
> 
> The book gives an introduction both to basic concepts and techniques
> of functional programming, and to its theoretical foundation.
> 
> In the first part of the book Objective Caml is used to present the
> principles of functional programming.  Particular attention is devoted
> to higher order functions: they are introduced in the first chapter.
> Moreover recursion and basic data structures are presented, and the
> relation among inductive data types, recursive definitions and
> inductive proofs is highlighted.  The OCaml module system is also
> introduced.
> 
> The second part shows the fundation of the functional paradigm.  It
> contains an introduction to pure and applied lambda calculus, and a
> brief account of its role in defining the concepts of computability
> and decidability. The type system of languages in the ML class is also
> discussed, and the concept of evaluation in an environment, together
> with the difference between static and dynamic scope of declarations.
> 
> The book is the result of about ten years teaching experience in
> basic computer science courses at the University of "Roma Tre" in Rome.
> 
> About the authors: Marta Cialdea Mayer is associate professor at the
> Faculty of Engineering of "Roma Tre" University, where she holds
> courses on Artificial Intelligence and Functional Programming.  Carla
> Limongelli is Research Associate at the same Faculty, where she
> presently hold the course of Algorithms and Data Structures.
