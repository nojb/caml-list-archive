Subject: [Caml-list] file descriptors as integers?

The Unix module publishes the type "file_descr" as an abstract type.
This makes it difficult to use file descriptors in some (IMHO) useful
ways.

When I manage a large number of descriptors, an efficient technique to
is to use the descriptor as the index into an array of per-connection
data structures.  But since the descriptor is abstract, I cannot use
it as an integer to do this.

I know I can use hash-tables in ocaml to create a similar relationship
between (fd,data) but it is less efficient.  Is there any kind of
interface to get the integral value of a file descriptor, or perhaps a
more encapsulated way to accomplish a similar result?

Thank you.
