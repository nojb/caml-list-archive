Hi,

Can anyone offer tips for profiling a program for memory consumption?

One of my native compiled applications consumes a too much memory
and I'm having a hard time tracking down the source.  I did time=20
profiling with gprof and here are the top four consumers:

Flat profile:

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls   s/call   s/call  name
 21.66      2.38     2.38     1040     0.00     0.00  mark_slice
 12.28      3.73     1.35     1035     0.00     0.00  sweep_slice
 10.19      4.85     1.12 13611466     0.00     0.00  compare_val
  4.73      5.37     0.52  1804453     0.00     0.00  Hashtbl__find_117

I'm assuming mark_slice and sweep_slice are part of the garbage collector=
=2E
The nature of the program does create a lot of small data structures with
short life span, and my hunch this is where the problem lies.

Any tips?

Thanks,

Tom
