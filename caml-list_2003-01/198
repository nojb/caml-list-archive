Hello,

I think about buying a book on FP-programming.

Is there a book, which can be recommended?

I know "The Craft of functional programming",
but after a while (since jumping from some
haskell-experiments to OCaml) have not read
further in it.

It's an interesting book, but too specific
focussed on haskell.

Are there more general books?
But I'm not a studied computer scientist, so
it's better if it is not too much specialized
mathematics and theory. It should be an introductional
book, but on an interesting level, which is
forcing the reader to explore practical problems.



TIA,
  Oliver
