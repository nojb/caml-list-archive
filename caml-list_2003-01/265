Dear All,

I'm pleased to announce the release of the XmlRPCServer-0.1.0 package
for OCaml.  The package and documentation can be fetched from:

http://www.simula.no/~hans/ocaml/xmlrpc/

XmlRPCServer is a server side implementation for the OCaml
XML-RPC-0.1.0 package developed by Shawn Wagner.  The main motivation
for writing this software was to be able to call services written in
OCaml from other languages.  Interoperability has been tested against
XML-RPC implementations in Python and Java, see documentation.  The
package has been developed and tested under Debian Linux, but will
probably work for other distributions.

XML-RPC and XmlRPCServer might serve as an RPC alternative between
OCaml applications, at least as long as performance is not an issue.
The xoridl tool provided with the package is able to create both
client stubs and server skeletons, based on an interface description,
shielding the application programmer from the details of marshaling
and unmarshaling the RPC calls.

If you find any bugs or have problems installing the package, please
let me know, and I'll try to help.


Kindest regards,

Hans Ole Rafaelsen
