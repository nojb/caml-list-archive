Yesterday, I reported that it is possible to build native clickable
application using slightly modified ocaml-3.06 and Tcl/Tk.  I found a
critical problem that occasionally kills the Finder and other applications.

The reason seems that the native applications as suggested in my yesterday's
fails to handle user interaction as expected by Mac OS.  I try to fix this
problem.  For the moment, native labltk is recommended only for the brave.
