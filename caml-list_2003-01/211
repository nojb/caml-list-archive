The book uses Caml Light syntax. I agree this is annoying for those
who want to start with Objective Caml. But Caml Light is ok when=20
learning
FP and the syntax differences are really minor so that=20
shifting/translating from one
to the other is straightforward.

Great book for doing "real" Ocaml programming (as opposed to learning).
But the focus is, imho, more on technical than on "fundamental" issues.

Personnaly, i use Cousineau and Mauny as a textbook when teaching
and the Oreilly as a reference book for my hacking.

So the Oreilly book may be a good choice ..

Just my 2 cents.
I would be happy to hear opinions from other Caml users
