I think you have it completely backwards.

There is no licence 'agreement'. I am not bound by
it, I have agreed to nothing.

It is completely the other way around.

Copyright may be applied to my use of software.

A 'licence' is a unilateral RELEASE from the
restrictions otherwise imposed by
copyright. And it is on my head to ensure that the
release is valid and authoritative (provably emnating
from the copyright holder) in case I am sued for
breach of copyright.
