That's certainly fair.  There is a steep learning curve, but the
advantage is portability and not having to write all of the corner
cases yourself.

Autoconf has a lot of built-in macros for C/UNIX code, for sure, but
to say that you can't use it for Ocaml code is like saying that you
can't use GNU make for Ocaml projects (or csound code, or LaTeX
documents).  It is a particularly general-purpose tool, although it
will want to be able to preprocess the configurable files somehow.  In
C, this is trivial -- m4 macros for the Makefile which define
preprocessor constants.  In other language contexts, you will have to
use m4 macros.

I don't understand your concern.  The autoconf package generates a
configure script, which is portable to any system, even one without any
autoconf installed.  The reason to have multiple versions of autoconf
installed is that different development versions of packages are
relying on different versions of autoconf's macros/behaviors *to
generate* the configure script.
