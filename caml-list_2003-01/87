The
  14th Int. Conf. on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA'03)
will be part of the
   Federated Conf. on Rewriting, Deduction and Programming (RDP'03).


IMPORTANT DATES:
 Jan  15 2003: Deadline electronic submission of title+short abstract
 Jan  22 2003: Deadline electronic submission of papers
 Mar  15 2003: Notification of acceptance of papers
 Apr   7 2003: Deadline for final versions of accepted papers
 Jun 9-11 '03: Conference.


RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all
aspects of rewriting.
Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

* APPLICATIONS:
  case studies; (rule-based) programming; symbolic and
  algebraic computation; theorem proving;
  system synthesis and verification; proof checking.
* FOUNDATIONS:
  matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;
  strategies; constraint solving; explicit substitutions.
* FRAMEWORKS:
  string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
  higher-order rewriting; proof nets; constrained
  rewriting/deduction; categorical and infinitary rewriting.
* IMPLEMENTATION:
  compilation techniques; parallel execution; rewriting tools.
* SEMANTICS:
  equational logic; rewriting logic.


INVITED TALKS will be given at RTA'03 by:
  * David McAllester     Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago
                         Joint invited speaker with TLCA
  * Jean-Louis Giavitto  Universit=E9 d'Evry, France
  * Pat Lincoln          SRI International


BEST PAPER AWARDS:
A 1000 Euro award wil be given to the best paper or papers as decided
by the PC. The award may also totally or partially go to the best
paper with a student as main author, according to the submission letter.

RTA'03 SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submission categories include regular research
papers and system descriptions. Also problem sets and
submissions decribing interesting applications of rewriting
techniques will be very welcome.

As usual, accepted papers will appear in the Springer-Verlag
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. See the RDP'03 web
page <http://www.dsic.upv.es/~rdp03/> for details.
