Sometimes, it's acceptable to just omit the record type:

        type t = C of int

You lose the naming of the arguments of the constructor, but for small
numbers of arguments (e.g. 1 or 2), this is often tolerable.

You mean, in pattern-matching over records?  Caml offers the same
functionality without the ... notation, e.g.

        type r = { x: int; y: int }

        match r with { x = 1 } -> ...

Because records are declared in advance, there is no requirement that
all record labels be mentioned in a pattern matching.
