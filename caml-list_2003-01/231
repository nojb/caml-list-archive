Would it be possible to try some of these optimisation patches, if you have 
them? (such as float storing, inlining, SSE2?) 

I would be particularly interested to see how you include it in the ocamlopt 
compiler code, which I'm trying to understand...

Incidentally, what's a good way to learn the layout and functioning of the 
asmcomp compiler? (docs?)

Thanks,
Daniel.
