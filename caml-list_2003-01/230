I am using ocamlyacc for a compilers course.  I think I'm sticking to
ocamlyacc because all the other students are using bison, but I got
curious when reading this thread.  I decided to check out camlp4, and
I found this page:

  http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/

... where I read what could be construed as another disadvantage of
camlp4:

  Developpment stopped: no more extension, or bug fix is assured

I'm not sure what to make of it, though.  There's an old thread in the
archives where the principle camlp4 developer at the time seems to
indicate an intention to only work on a version that's separate from
the ocaml distribution.

What's the current situation?  Is there some kind of version split
going on now?
