You're both right.
Benchmarks give invaluable insight into specific
problems.

If the specific problem involves long-running
processes then that's what we should be benchmarking:
it doesn't matter what happened in the first second.

If the specific problem involves starting a program
hundreds-of-times a day to do a small computation then
that's what we should be benchmarking: it doesn't
matter what the performance was after millions of
iterations.

best wishes, Isaac
