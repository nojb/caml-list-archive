hi folks,

I have a problem expanding an <:expr<>> quotation.
the code snippet below raise this error
ocamlc -c -pp "camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo" -I
/usr/lib/ocaml/camlp4 test.ml
File "test.ml", line 19, characters 13-42:
This expression has type MLast.patt * ff but is here used with type
  MLast.patt * MLast.expr
  
how can I write the variable 'content' in the preprocessor step ?

It should be written down just like a string... is there any generic way 
to achive the same as I do with <:expr<$str:"ddd">> for strings with any
datatype ?

Of course immagine that the variable 'a' came from a more complex
function like a parser...

tnx,
p

---------
(*pp camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo *)

open Pcaml;;

type ff = 
    | A1
    | A2

let el = Grammar.Entry.create gram "el";;
EXTEND
    expr:
        [[ "test"; n = LIST1 el SEP ";" ->
            <:expr< let $list:n$ in 1 >>
        ]];
    el:
        [[ n = LIDENT ->
            let a = A1 in  (* <---- the problem is here!!! *)
            (<:patt<$lid:n$>>,<:expr<$a$>>) ]];
END

------
let a = test b ;;
