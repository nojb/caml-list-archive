I do not believe, that this is normal, to be expected, or general
case.  There are, for sure, programs that may be faster in Java than
in O'Caml. But those should be exceptions!

Also it could be, that you have a excellent written Java application,
using all performance improvements that are possible with Java and
comparing that against a poorly written O'Caml application using all
anti-performance improvements possible ;-)

Would you mind to post some code showing the performance difference? I
am very interested in that as I "sell" O'Caml as generally faster than
Java to some of my colleagues, and I do not want to be a story teller
;-)


Thanks in advance,
Clemens.
