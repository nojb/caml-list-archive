Ahem. The correct term for that is "proprietary." What are Red Hat and
SuSE Linux if not commercial?

That was part of my reason for choosing BSD, but not all (see below).

Yes, if you have a product-centered business model.

:-)

But quite apart from wanting to keep open (for myself) the option of
using my code in a proprietary app, there is another very important
reason I like the BSD license:

I believe very strongly in informed consent in all areas of life. That
means, for example, that when someone accepts a software license, they
should know what they just agreed to. And unfortunately, most software
licenses never get read; they're just too damn long and complex. If
you're an open source developer, you have probably read the GPL, but I'd
wager most end users haven't. And you have undoubtedly also used
Microsoft products. Have you ever read their EULA in its entirety? I bet
you haven't.

The BSD license is one of a handful of open source licenses that is
clear and concise enough that ordinary people (who are neither lawyers
nor geeks) *might* read and understand it. I'm not saying they will, but
I think there is a reasonable chance that, when they see that the entire
license is displayed in one screen of their browser, they will actually
read it.
