I think it is a legitimate tactic.  If your code can run in 100
milliseconds, I could care less about performance.  I want high performance
for programs that are going to run for hours, days, or weeks.  For these,
startup costs should hardly matter.

True, but it depends a lot on the application.  If you're doing heavy
graphics or big simulations, you simply can't ignore performance.
