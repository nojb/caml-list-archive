Subject: [Caml-list] Trying to build a toplevel as a win32 dll

Hello everybody,

I'm trying to build a Ocaml toplevel as a win32 dll.

In its simplest form, this means that one obtains a win32 dll that has only
one function for receiving as a string any (correct) ocaml syntax normally
entered into the toplevel and returns a string containing the result
normally pretty-printed by the toplevel (or the error message).

Its really just to be able to use Ocamls toplevel technology as a dll
callable from other software.
Of course, I could use the ocaml toplevel as a console application to which
my program would send some text and capture back the result, but I wish to
avoid this and call the ocaml engine "natively".

Did somebody manage to achieve this or have ideas about how to do it ?

Thanks in advance for your help

Rabih
