Hello.


I have recently heard of a version of JoCaml on OCaml's CVS (jocamltrunk) programmed with OCamlP4. I have managed to compile it ; however I have noticed that the syntax has completely changed since the last official beta version (1.07). Where could I find more informations about this version, in particular about it's new syntax ?

Moreover, is this project being actively developped ;) or is this the last version that will ever be implemented ?

I know I should not really have posted this here but JoCaml's mailling-list seems to be dead.


Thank you.
