Thanks to you and Basile, who also replied.

I think I now understand that I need to use the more low-level alloc() 
function with the appropriate tag, since there doesn't seem to be a version 
of alloc_array() suitable for doubles.

At the moment my main worry is that I'm allocating new arrays to pass to the 
function faster than the gc can clean them up... I need to find out about 
hanging on to allocated values on the C side of things.

Thanks,
Daniel.
