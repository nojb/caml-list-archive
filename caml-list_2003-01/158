Hello,

does it exist a way to get hold of a the string (if any) associated
with an exception, when the exception has been caught with the "_"
(any) exception?  What I am interested in is to get hold of the
information which the run-time normally prints when it exits.

let _ = List.nth [4; 5] 4

itherther [14] [08:30] [~] ./a.out 
Fatal error: exception Failure("nth")

I want to get the string produced, or the information needed to
produce it myself.

The intended usage for this is in a RPC server library, where the
application raise some exception.  It would be convenient to re-raise
this as an remote exception, or at least report it back to the client.


Kindest regards,

Hans Ole Rafaelsen
