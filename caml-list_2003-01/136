Hello,

I'm using Ocaml as an interpreter to a language I designed.
I just ran it with a large program and the interpreter dies.
What happend?  The only error message was "killed".

I was monitering the cpu process with "top" and the=20
interpreter was only consuming 70% of memory when
it was killed.  I've tried both regular and native compilation and the
results are the same.

Thanks,
Tom
