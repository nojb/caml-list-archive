I'm using Linux (i386).
I tried both native and byte-code compilation=20
and both produce the same message: "Killed".

If the OS is killing it, is there some way to adjust
the settings to let it run a little bit longer?

You probably run out of stack space. Native compilation handles larger
programs than byte-coded. (In byte-coded you should get an error message
saying out of stack. Which OS do you use?)

When I get that problem it is often List.map over large list (more than
a 1000 elements) that is the reason. List.map is not tail-recursive.
Rewrite into a loop and use an accumulator (or use rev_map).
