I perfectly agree, and i take bringing the words:

    " You have to be responsible, mature, to stand on your own, no one
      will do your job for you, etc. etc. "

and preventing people from a 'puerilistic' (what a beautiful word :)
laziness, as an *important* service to the society.

I am currently the *only* user for my software :) that is mainly
oriented to help in my computer ady to day use, and sometimes drawing
pretty pictures.

I think it is a lie to pretend one can be able to use a computer without
knowing anything about them. A friend of mine was bond to this believe,
he bought a computer and one week later was turned crazy by the
easy-to-use-and-user-friendly-interface-it-has. The only help i accepted
to give him was a hundred questions list, with a little introduction on
how to use search-engines and usenet, to give him tools for the answer
quest. It did not work since he is a little bit too lazy, but what else
can i do ? will not bring the food to his mouth, would i do ?

[Not pretending you are a lier, i feel you are someone sympathetic.

You can turn (some parts of your softwares :) into Socrates, or meet a
country ground where people are in better spiritual
dispositions. Nothing get me more sad than seeing almost all peoples are
like old children, that have lost childs qualities [aspire to justice,
aspire to communion, aspire to knowledge] and only the flaws remains
[fear, laziness, seek for forgiviveness].

Objective Caml, the computer language that discriminates philosophs :)
