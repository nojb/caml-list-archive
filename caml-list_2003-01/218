Due to specific approach, "more general book" in functional
programming commonly contains introduction to "lambda calculus" and
other "mathematics". IMHO if You really want to understand the FP,
this "mathematics" will be very helpfull.

May be, the one practical problem in FP is 
"how the calculation can be perform?" or 
"what the anatomy of algorithm?". Nothing else.
The rest--is syntax of particular language :).

I can recommend the two books:

1. "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", by Abelson,
    Sussman, and Sussman ("SICP", "Wizard book").
    http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/
    One of the bibles in lisp/scheme world.

2. Field, A.J. and Harrison, P.G., 
   "Functional Programming", Addison-Wesley, 1988.
   Good theoretical introduction in functional programming.
   Available from amazon.com (or at local bookstores 
   which are selling used books).

Regards!
