                       Active-DVI


Active-DVI is a presenter and previewer for texts or slides written in LaTeX,
hence the presentation tool of choice for the discriminating hacker.

Version 1.4.0 is now available. As the release number shows, this is a
major improvement w.r.t version 1.2.0 of Active-DVI.

This new version has been developed by Jun Furuse, Didier Rémy and
Pierre Weis with also contributions by Didier Le Botlan, Roberto Di
Cosmo, Xavier Leroy, and Alan Schmitt.

In addition to the regular features of the Active-DVI previewer:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion
     (using the graphics LaTeX package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

this release introduces a lot of new features

   * Interactive demos, via launching of applications from within the slides

   * Background colors and background images for slides

   * Annotations of texts (visible when the mouse is on the annotated text)

   * Hyper references within the same document or to other dvi files

   * Animated transitions from slide to slide

   * Text movements within the slide

   * Recording of text and arbitrary playback of recorded elements

   * Superposition effects for included images (alpha channels and blending)

   * A manual

   * A lot of examples, including talks using popular LaTeX packages seminar
     and prosper (cf. http://prosper.sourceforge.net/).

   * A new user's interface in the redesigned LaTeX package advi.sty.

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of various talks in
the directory ``examples''.

The source code, RPM packages, and information are available at
