I'm working on an OCaml application which I'd like 
to do the following:  load an existing postscript 
file from disk, launch a window in which the 
document is displayed,  and allow the user to select a
rectangle on a page of the document using the mouse
(and of course have access to the bounds of the rectangle
within the application).  What libraries/tools are 
available to do such a thing?

Thanks
