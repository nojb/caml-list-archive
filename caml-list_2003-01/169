For the record, this facility existed in the original ML from LCF 20=20
years ago,
the variable was called "it" and it was extremely useful in top-level=20
debugging.
It was still there in ML V6.2 circa 1985, and thus also in early=20
versions of Caml.
I do not remember who took "it" off, but maybe "it" could be=20
resurrected...
