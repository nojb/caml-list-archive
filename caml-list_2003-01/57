I indeed tried once to port ocamlbrowser to lablgtk, but quickly
realized that the text widget was much too weak for that.
That attempt is applications/browser, and is only updated once in a
while.

But with GTK2 this shall become possible.
I must just find some time to do that, knowing that ocamlbrowser is
rather dirty code, with lots of dependencies on Tk.

By the way, gtk-osx is 1.2-based, not 2.2.  And it is carbonized
rather cocoated.  Doesn't seem so attractive, but I definitely hope we
get a nice aqua gtk at some point.

Cheers,
