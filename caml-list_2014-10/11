CALL FOR PAPERS

The 7th NASA Formal Methods Symposium

http://www.NASAFormalMethods.org/nfm2015

27 =96 29 April 2015
Pasadena, California, USA

Paper Submission: 10 Nov 2014


THEME

The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission- and safety-critica=
l systems require advanced techniques that address their specification, ver=
ification, validation, and certification.

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum for theoreticians and practiti=
oners from academia, industry, and government, with the goals of identifyin=
g challenges and providing solutions to achieving assurance in mission- and=
 safety-critical systems. Within NASA such systems include for example auto=
nomous robots, separation assurance algorithms for aircraft, Next Generatio=
n Air Transportation (NextGen), and autonomous rendezvous and docking for s=
pacecraft. Moreover, emerging paradigms such as property-based design, code=
 generation, and safety cases are bringing with them new challenges and opp=
ortunities. The focus of the symposium will be on formal techniques, their =
theory, current capabilities, and limitations, as well as their application=
 to aerospace, robotics, and other mission- and safety-critical systems in =
all design life-cycle stages. We encourage submissions on cross-cutting app=
roaches marrying formal verification techniques with advances in critical s=
ystem development, such as requirements generation, analysis of aerospace o=
perational concepts, and formal methods integrated in early design stages a=
nd carrying throughout system development.


TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Model checking
Theorem proving
SAT and SMT solving
Symbolic execution
Static analysis
Runtime verification
Program refinement
Compositional verification
Modeling and specification formalisms
Model-based development
Model-based testing
Requirement engineering
Formal approaches to fault tolerance
Security and intrusion detection
Applications of formal methods to aerospace systems
Applications of formal methods to cyber-physical systems
Applications of formal methods to human-machine interaction analysis


INVITED SPEAKERS

Dino Distefano
Software Engineer at Facebook, California, USA and Professor at Queen Mary =
University of London, UK.

Viktor Kuncak
Leads Lab for Automated Reasoning and Analysis at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerla=
nd.

Rob Manning
Chief Engineer at NASA/JPL.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper Submission:	10 Nov 2014
Paper Notifications:	12 Jan 2015
Camera-ready Papers:	9 Feb 2015
Symposium:   27 =96 29 April 2015


LOCATION AND COST

The symposium will take place at the Hilton Hotel, Pasadena, California, US=
A, April 27-29, 2015.

There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested individu=
als, including non-US citizens, are welcome to submit, to attend, to listen=
 to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees mu=
st register.


SUBMISSION DETAILS

There are two categories of submissions:

- Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (15 p=
ages)
- Short papers describing tools, experience reports, or descriptions of wor=
k in progress with preliminary results=20=20
  (6 pages)

All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not bee=
n published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully reviewed =
by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a volume of Sp=
ringer=92s Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and must use LNCS styl=
e formatting. Papers should be submitted in PDF format.
