e are other Jane Street libs which compile just fine on Windows. Batteries,=
 as others have noted, works out of the box. Usually, I find that the bigge=
st problem in third party libs is in build systems (becoming less so with O=
asis, OCamlbuild and so on) making na=EFve decisions about Windows but that=
 doesn't usually take much patching.

> Most of what I do is Windows-oriented, but some of what I've done is Wind=
ows and Linux. My experience is that it's important to keep Windows in the =
picture early on to avoid pain later - so ensure that daily builds are work=
ing on Windows or perhaps that one of your developers is always working on =
Windows or something... that should avoid accidentally selecting a Unix-onl=
y library and only realising that a painfully long way down the road (or th=
at the library you thought was cross-platform contains an assert false for =
the function you need when running on Windows!). If you write something whi=
ch works on Windows in OCaml it will probably translate with little pain to=
 Linux but the reverse isn't necessarily true.=20

At a recent compiler hacking session in Cambridge, Don Syme pointed out a g=
reat Travis-like service for running regular Windows builds called Appveyor=
(.com).  In order to get more familiar with the Windows toolchain, I ported=
 some of Thomas Braibant's instructions for compiling OPAM on Windows using=
 it here:

Cygwin scripts: https://github.com/ocaml/opam/blob/master/appveyor.yml
Build output:   https://ci.appveyor.com/project/avsm/opam/build/1.0.38

Appveyor can be used much like Travis and build every Git checkin on Window=
s, except that they unfortunately overwrite each other's status flags (the =
green tick or red cross against each commit), so they cannot be simultaneou=
sly used on one GitHub repository right now.  I contacted GitHub support an=
d they indicated that they are adding support for multiple CI tools into th=
e UI, but do not have a time estimate for when that would be ready.

In the meanwhile though, I hope Appveyor comes in useful for anyone wanting=
 to automate Windows testing via a free hosted service.  Pull requests to i=
mprove OPAM's Appveyor scripts in this regard (for MinGW or Cygwin or ideal=
ly testing them both) would be welcome.=20

best,
