Other reasons for wanting things from the build directory are 'cmt/cmti' files for merlin/ocamlspot/ocp-index (or their equivalent file that only stores documentation used by opam-doc).
Do these require the original source files to extract&format the documentation strings?

It does, but it also requires more disk space by keeping all the binaries and intermediate files around.

Perhaps this tool could be extended to install the source files too, or something equivalent provided at the opam level:
https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/spotinstall

Then you wouldn't need to modify the build system of every package to install its sources / its documentation /its annotation files.
