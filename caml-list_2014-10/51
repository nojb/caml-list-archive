Subject: [Caml-list] ICFP 2015 Call for Workshop and Co-located Event
 Proposals

         CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                            ICFP 2015
 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                   August 30 - September 5, 2015
                        Vancouver, Canada
               http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/

The 120th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on
August 30-September 5, 2015.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers
and developers to hear about the latest work on the design,
implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2015 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN. These events should be less formal and more focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and foster the exchange of new ideas. The preference is for one-day
events, but other schedules can also be considered.

The workshops are scheduled to occur on August 30 (the day
before ICFP) and September 3-5 (the three days after ICFP).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission details
 Deadline for submission:     November 16, 2014
 Notification of acceptance:  December 15, 2014

Prospective organizers of workshops or other co-located events are
invited to submit a completed workshop proposal form in plain text
format to the ICFP 2015 workshop co-chairs (Tom Schrijvers and Nicolas
Wu), via email to icfp2015-workshops@cs.kuleuven.be by November 16,
2014. (For proposals of co-located events other than workshops, please
fill in the workshop proposal form and just leave blank any sections
that do not apply.) Please note that this is a firm deadline.

Organizers will be notified if their event proposal is accepted by
December 15, 2014, and if successful, depending on the event, they
will be asked to produce a final report after the event has taken
place that is suitable for publication in SIGPLAN Notices.

The proposal form is available at:
