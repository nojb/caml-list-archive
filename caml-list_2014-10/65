Subject: [Caml-list] NETYS 2015 Call for Papers

*CALL FOR PAPERS

THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORKED SYSTEMS**
**NETYS 2015**
**May 13-15, 2015, AGADIR, MOROCCO**
**http://www.netys.net*



*Aim and Scope:**
*
NETYS aims to bring together researchers and engineers from both the 
theory and practice of distributed and networked systems. The scope of 
the conference covers all aspects related to the design and the 
development of these systems, including, but not restricted to, 
multi-core architectures, concurrent and distributed algorithms, 
parallel/concurrent/distributed programming, distributed databases, 
cloud systems, networks, security, formal verification, etc.

NETYS will provide a forum to report on best practices and novel 
algorithms, results and techniques on networked systems. Original 
contributions as well as experience papers on the principles, design, 
implementation, modeling, analysis, verification, and application of 
networked systems are solicited. Specific concepts common to different 
forms of such systems are most welcome.

NETYS is coupled with the METIS Spring School which aims at introducing 
young researchers to the domain of distributed and networked systems 
through tutorials on basics, as well as lectures on new research topics 
and current trends in this domain.

*Paper submission:**
*
Submissions should contain original research and sufficient detail to 
assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. NETYS welcomes 
papers on theory, case studies and comparisons with existing 
experimental research, tools, as well as combinations of new theory with 
experimental evaluation.

NETYS is soliciting two forms of papers: full and short papers. Full 
papers are allowed a maximum of 15 pages in Springer's LNCS format, 
whereas short papers are allowed a maximum of 5 pages (in the same 
format), both in the submission and in the proceedings. A full paper 
submission might be accepted as such, as a short paper or a poster. A 
short paper may be accepted as such or as a poster.

Posters will be presented at the conference to reflect work in progress 
and will not lead to a publication in the proceedings. Authors are given 
the option to accept or not the type in which their paper is selected 
for acceptance.

*Publication:*

Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series will publish the 
proceedings of the conference (www.springer.com/lncs). It is required 
that each accepted paper be presented at the conference by one of its 
authors.

The Computing Journal could publish extended versions of selected papers 
(www.springer.com/computer/journal/607)

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. A 
paper is eligible for the best student paper award if at least one of 
its authors is a full-time student at the time of submission. This 
should be indicated in the submission.

*Submission instructions:*

All submissions should follow the LNCS template. Submitted papers must 
be written in English. Full papers are allowed a maximum of 15 pages in 
LNCS format, whereas short papers are allowed a maximum of 5 pages, both 
in the submission and in the proceedings. Papers exceeding these limits 
may be rejected without review.

Paper submission will be handled by EasyChair, so please make sure that 
you have an active account. The papers must be submitted electronically at:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=netys2015

*Important dates**

- Abstract submission deadline: January 5, 2015
- Paper submission deadline: January 9, 2015
- Acceptance notification: March 9, 2015
- Camera ready copy due: April 10, 2015
