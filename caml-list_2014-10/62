There is a surprisingly-well-maintained list of book available at:
  http://caml.inria.fr/about/books.en.html

The only book that (1) would be relevant to you and (2) I have
experience with is "Nouveaux exercices d'algorithmique", by Michel
Quercia, which I warmly recommend. I haven't had the luck to get my
hands on Sylvain Conchon and Jean-Cristophe Filli=C3=A2tre's "Apprendre =C3=
=A0
programmer avec OCaml", but I'm confident it is excellent -- and goes
far deeper than its beginner-oriented description suggests.

Among English-language books, I'm not sure which one would fit the
bill of being math-oriented enough; maybe John Whitington's new book,
"More OCaml: Algorithms, Methods, and Diversions".

If you are also interested in programming language theory (but I'm
afraid that's quite far from the agr=C3=A9gation), you may like Didier
R=C3=A9my's online lecture notes, "Using, Understanding, and Unraveling the
OCaml Language"
