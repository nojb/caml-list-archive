Thanks! Having an issue really helps tracking that things get done.

Indeed. exn-source-easy (or -autolink) could simply depend on the "clean
API" in the exn-source library, by being implemented as just
  let () = Exn_source.register ()

Then simply making sure to pass the flag -linkall when building that second
cma means that explicitly requiring it (in the build system) will enable
the feature.
