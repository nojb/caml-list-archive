Subject: [Caml-list] JLAMP special issue on Open Problems in Concurrency
 Theory -- 2nd cfp

JOURNAL OF LOGICAL AND ALGEBRAIC METHODS IN PROGRAMMING

SPECIAL ISSUE ON OPEN PROBLEMS IN CONCURRENCY THEORY

CALL FOR PAPERS


* Aims and Scope

This special issue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming is
devoted to the themes of the Research Seminar on Open Problems in Concurrency Theory,
which took place in June 2014 in Bertinoro, Italy, and was co-sponsored by
the IFIP Working Group 1.8 (see http://opct2014.cs.vu.nl/ for more details).

This is an open call for papers, therefore both participants of the research seminar
and other authors are encouraged to submit their contributions. Submissions are invited
in the field of concurrency theory; specific topics include, but are not limited to,
the following:

- Models of concurrency
- Process calculi
- Behavioral relations and metrics
- Expressiveness
- Programming languages and types
- Quantitative and security aspects
- Verification, testing, and synthesis

Papers surveying important open problems in concurrency theory are also welcome.


* Submission Guidelines

We expect original submissions of 20-30 pages, which present high-quality contributions
that have not been previously published in another journal and that are not simultaneously
submitted for publication elsewhere. Longer papers will be considered if there is a clear
justification for why additional pages are necessary; prospective authors should contact
the guest editors to discuss this.

Each paper will undergo a thorough evaluation by at least two reviewers. The authors will
have some time to incorporate the comments of the reviewers and submit a revised version
of their papers, which will be evaluated again by the reviewers to make a final decision.

Submissions will be handled through the Elsevier Editorial System (EES) and can be uploaded
from the JLAMP webpage (http://ees.elsevier.com/jlamp/). Authors must select "SI: OPCT 2014"
when they reach the "Article Type" step in the submission process. Contributions should be
typeset in PDF format and comply with the JLAMP author guidelines. Accepted manuscripts
can be posted to arXiv.


* Important Dates

Submission of papers:    November 15, 2014
First review decision:   February 28, 2015
Revision due:            April 30, 2015
Acceptance notification: May 31, 2015
Final manuscript due:    June 30, 2015
Expected publication:    July 31, 2015
