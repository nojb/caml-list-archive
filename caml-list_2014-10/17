CALL FOR PAPERS

The 7th NASA Formal Methods Symposium

http://www.NASAFormalMethods.org/nfm2015

27 =E2=80=93 29 April 2015
Pasadena, California, USA

Paper Submission: 10 Nov 2014


THEME

The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission- and
safety-critical systems require advanced techniques that address their
specification, verification, validation, and certification.

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum for theoreticians and
practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with the goals of
identifying challenges and providing solutions to achieving assurance in
mission- and safety-critical systems. Within NASA such systems include for
example autonomous robots, separation assurance algorithms for aircraft,
Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen), and autonomous rendezvous and
docking for spacecraft. Moreover, emerging paradigms such as property-based
design, code generation, and safety cases are bringing with them new
challenges and opportunities. The focus of the symposium will be on formal
techniques, their theory, current capabilities, and limitations, as well as
their application to aerospace, robotics, and other mission- and
safety-critical systems in all design life-cycle stages. We encourage
submissions on cross-cutting approaches marrying formal verification
techniques with advances in critical system development, such as
requirements generation, analysis of aerospace operational concepts, and
formal methods integrated in early design stages and carrying throughout
system development.


TOPICS

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Model checking
Theorem proving
SAT and SMT solving
Symbolic execution
Static analysis
Runtime verification
Program refinement
Compositional verification
Modeling and specification formalisms
Model-based development
Model-based testing
Requirement engineering
Formal approaches to fault tolerance
Security and intrusion detection
Applications of formal methods to aerospace systems
Applications of formal methods to cyber-physical systems
Applications of formal methods to human-machine interaction analysis


INVITED SPEAKERS

Dino Distefano
Software Engineer at Facebook, California, USA and Professor at Queen Mary
University of London, UK.

Viktor Kuncak
Leads Lab for Automated Reasoning and Analysis at EPFL, Lausanne,
Switzerland.

Rob Manning
Chief Engineer at NASA/JPL.


IMPORTANT DATES

Paper Submission: 10 Nov 2014
Paper Notifications: 12 Jan 2015
Camera-ready Papers: 9 Feb 2015
Symposium: 27 =E2=80=93 29 April 2015


LOCATION AND COST

The symposium will take place at the Hilton Hotel, Pasadena, California,
USA, April 27-29, 2015.

There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested
individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to submit, to attend,
to listen to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all
attendees must register.


SUBMISSION DETAILS

There are two categories of submissions:

- Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results (15
pages)
- Short papers describing tools, experience reports, or descriptions of
work in progress with preliminary results
  (6 pages)

All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not
been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully
reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a
volume of Springer=E2=80=99s Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and =
must use
LNCS style formatting. Papers should be submitted in PDF format.
