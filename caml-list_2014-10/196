Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild on cygwin



I found the same problem. The reason why I'm trying to use the cygwin port =
is because in the other ports debugging is very bad and compiling most of t=
he libraries is a pain. But at the end, it is not possible to make commerci=
al applications with cygwin. So I end up using the three ports when working=
 on windows.
