Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Errors in installing 'lwt'

Thanks for the hint Francois. The command sequence you proposed worked 
successfully.

However can you explain to me what I have now. I think I have now two 
versions of the ocaml compiler installed, one system wide (4.02.0) and 
one installed by opam (4.01.0).

If I use a fresh shell I still get version 4.02 until I issue the 'eval' 
command to get the new paths. If I try to switch back to 4.02 opam tries 
to install 4.02 from scratch, i.e. it does not use the system installation.

Is there any possibility to switch back to the system installation in 
the same shell or do I need to use a fresh shell?

I still feel uncomfortable because I don't know why the installation of 
'lwt' fails with my system installation of ocaml.

Regards
Helmut
