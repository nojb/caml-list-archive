Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml projects for the FOSS Outreach Program

Dear Caml-list,

The Xen Project will be participating in Round 9 of the GNOME Outreach Prog=
ram, which aims to help groups that are underrepresented in free and open s=
ource projects to get involved.  This was initially aimed at female partici=
pants, but as a pilot is now being expanded to participants in the Ascend P=
roject.  It is a continuation of the very successful GNOME Outreach Program=
 for Women and we are running the program in conjunction with GNOME and oth=
er prominent open source projects.

There are further instructions here:
http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/OutreachProgram/Round9
https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen

You can find OCaml-related projects on the ideas list (primarily to do with=
 Mirage OS), but bear in mind that this list is not exhaustive.=20=20

http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Outreach_Program_Projects

If there is an area that you would like to work on as an intern, please get=
 in touch with myself, Thomas Gazagnaire <thomas.gazagnaire@cl.cam.ac.uk>, =
Dave Scott <dave.scott@citrix.com> or Richard Mortier <richard.mortier@nott=
ingham.ac.uk> directly to discuss your ideas.

Two previous participants in the program last summer that worked on OCaml a=
nd Mirage OS blogged about their experiences in depth:

 - Mindy Preston: http://www.somerandomidiot.com/blog/2014/08/22/opw-fin/
 - Jyotsna Prakash: http://1000hippos.wordpress.com/

Beginners are most welcome, but bear in mind that this round runs from Dec =
9th 2014 to March 9th 2014 and  so will not work for full-time students.  F=
ull-time students should aim to apply for Round10 which runs over the summe=
r of 2015.

best,
Anil=
