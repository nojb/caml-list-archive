Yes, except for '.' which is hardcoded. So, in the simplest case, it works.

Noted. I'd like to add functionality like this. The first thing I'm 
going to add is automatic finding of the stdlib, since this just 
requires parsing the output of "ocamlc -config".

Unfortunately, I don't believe most OPAM packages install their source, 
just the .mli files. I wonder how much extra space installing source 
would take on average, and if people think it's worth it, for this or 
other reasons.

Thanks,
