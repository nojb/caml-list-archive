Subject: [Caml-list] ANN: exn-source  - exception backtraces with source
 code printing

Hi,

OCaml 4.02 has new facilities for installing a new backtrace handler, 
and processing the back trace symbolically. As a little proof of 
concept, I've built a package which you can add to any project to get 
backtrace with source code printed and highlighted:

https://github.com/johnwhitington/exn-source

Here's the start of a backtrace:

http://www.coherentpdf.com/exnsource.png

By default, it prints five lines either side, and looks the current 
directory for source code. But as one can see from the screenshot, one 
can add /usr/local/lib/ocaml to get stdlib source and so on...

It's somewhat difficult to test this kind of thing (we can't use 
exceptions at all inside a backtrace handler, for example), so I'm 
appealing for help. Attach exn-source to your code and let me know how 
you get on...

Thanks,
