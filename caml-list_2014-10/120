*** CALL FOR TRACK PROPOSALS ***

24th IEEE International Conference on Enabling Technologies:
Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE 2015)

15-18 June 2015, Larnaca, Cyprus

http://www.cyprusconferences.org/wetice2015/

DEADLINE: 21st November 2014

The IEEE International Conference on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure =
for
Collaborative Enterprises (WETICE) is an international forum for the state-=
of
-the-art research in enabling technologies for collaboration, consisting of=
 a
number of related conference tracks.

The conference proceedings are published by IEEE Computer Society and are
also available online through the IEEE's Xplore digital library. The procee=
dings
will be submitted for indexing through INSPEC, Scopus, Compendex,
Thomson Reuters, DBLP, Google Scholar and EI Index.

WETICE is based on a flexible structure of self-contained and self-managed
tracks. Over the past years WETICE hosted tracks on a variety of topics such
as adaptive computing, collaborative software processes, collaborative
modeling & simulation, service-oriented architectures and cloud computing,
autonomic green computing, collaborative verification and validation of
systems and services, dynamic network management, collaboration tools for
cultural heritage and collaborative web knowledge.

The 24th WETICE edition will be held on June 15-18, 2015 in Larnaca, Cyprus.
The conference organizing committee solicits proposals for organizing and
hosting tracks. Prospective track chairs should submit a proposal for
organizing a track, which should include at least the following items:

1) The title and the acronym for the proposed track with a description of
objectives, covered topics and the motivation for having such a track in
WETICE. The motivation should compare the proposed event to any related
ongoing tracks and why the proposed track differs from them or
complements them.

2) A short description of the activities the track chair(s) will plan to un=
dertake
upon acceptance of the proposal, to disseminate the call-for-papers for the
track through, e.g, track web site, mailing lists, social networks, selected
contacts, etc. The track proposers should also indicate the potential audie=
nce
by estimating the number of people who are supposed to participate to
WETICE and attend the track.

3) A short CV of the prospective track chair(s) with reference to research
interests and publication record directly related to the themes of the
proposed track, and any previous experience of involvement in the
organization of similar events. A link to a personal web page with addition=
al
information would be helpful.

4) A list of potential program committee members for the proposed track,
with name and affiliation of each member and (when available) a link to
relevant personal web pages.

All proposals will be reviewed by the WETICE Steering Committee using the
criteria described above. The Committee reserves the right to accept a
proposal as is, require modifications, recommend merging with tracks that
covers similar topics or reject a proposal. Upon acceptance of a proposal, =
the
track chairs will be notified of their responsibilities in managing their t=
rack,
according to what defined by both IEEE and WETICE conference rules. The
Committee reserves the rights to cancel a track at any time if these
responsibilities are not addressed adequately by the track chair(s).

Please submit your track proposal as a PDF email attachment to the WETICE
Program Chairs, Andrea D'Ambrogio (dambro@uniroma2.it) and Khalil Drira
(khalil@laas.fr).

The deadline for submitting track proposals is November 21st, 2014.

The notification of the decision taken by the Steering Committee will be se=
nt
to the chairs of the proposed track before or on December 15th, 2014.

Please contact the Program Chairs for any additional information or request.
