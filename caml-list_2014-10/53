Subject: [Caml-list] Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC 2015): first
 call for papers

Apologies for multiple copies.

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

12th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction, MPC 2=
015
K=C3=B6nigswinter, Germany, 29 June - 1 July 2015
http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/MPC2015/


BACKGROUND

The MPC conferences aim to promote the development of mathematical principl=
es
and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process
of constructing computer programs, broadly interpreted.

The 2015 MPC conference will be held in K=C3=B6nigswinter, Germany, from 29=
th June
to 1st July 2015. The previous conferences were held in Twente, The
Netherlands (1989), Oxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995),
Marstrand, Sweden (1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany
(2002), Stirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST), Kuressaare, Estonia (200=
6,
colocated with AMAST), Marseille, France (2008), Qu=C3=A9bec City, Canada (=
2010,
colocated with AMAST), and Madrid, Spain (2012).


TOPICS

Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in program
construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for
program construction in programming languages and systems. The notion of
"program" is broad, from algorithms to hardware. Some typical areas are type
systems, program analysis and transformation, programming-language semantic=
s,
security, and program logics. Theoretical contributions are welcome, provid=
ed
that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on
applications are welcome, provided that their mathematical basis is evident.

We also encourage the submission of "pearls": elegant, instructive, and fun
essays on the mathematics of program construction.


IMPORTANT DATES

   * Submission of abstracts:      26 January 2015
   * Submission of full papers:     2 February 2015
   * Notification to authors:      16 March 2015
   * Final version:                13 April 2015


SUBMISSION

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines) must be
submitted by 26 January 2015. Full papers (pdf) adhering to the LaTeX llncs
style must be submitted by 2 February 2015. There is no official page limit,
but authors should strive for brevity. The web-based system EasyChair will =
be
used for submission (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmpc2015).

Papers must report previously unpublished work, and must not be submitted
concurrently to a journal or to another conference with refereed proceeding=
s.
Accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.
Please feel free to write to mpc2015@easychair.org with any questions about
academic matters.

The proceedings of MPC 2015 will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series, as have all the previous editions. Authors
of accepted papers will be expected to transfer copyright to Springer for
this purpose. After the conference, authors of the best papers will be
invited to submit revised versions to a special issue of the Elsevier journ=
al
Science of Computer Programming.
