Subject: [Caml-list] =?ISO-8859-1?Q?OCaml_messages_in_French_/_messages_d?=
 =?ISO-8859-1?Q?=27OCaml_en_fran=E7ais?=



Hello everybody,

I am new on the list. I have been teaching (O)Caml for 14 years, in France =
and South America.

I wasn't able to find a way to easily customize OCaml interpreter spoken la=
nguage, the way Caml-light did,
so I decided to make a source patch, mainly designed for my classroom compu=
ters, in order to translate
OCaml interpreter messages (errors, warnings, tracing, interruptions, and s=
o on) in French.

It now works quite well, so I was wondering if someone could be interested =
by that tool...


I have some questions :
- Is it the right place to talk about that?
- Am I duplicating some previous translating work?=20
- Is there some license issues about spreading such a patch?
- May I post an alpha version here, as an attachment, so as to get members'=
 feedback?

Given the subject matter, you can go on with the discussion in French, of c=
ourse.

Thanks for your attention.


Alexis Irlande
