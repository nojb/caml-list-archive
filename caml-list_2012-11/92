OMake has some nice features for more complex projects, for example
polling the FS for changes and automatically rebuilding.

However it requires your users to have OMake installed too, so
ocamlbuild has an advantage here (it is installed together with the compiler).

Try oasis, it provides a good starting point:
http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/

You can later extend it with custom rules in _tags/myocamlbuild.ml if needed.

Kaputt seems to be a superset of OUnit feature-wise, don't know about the others.
I've only used OUnit.

Are you writing an application or a library?
If you're writing a library it is probably better to avoid unneeded dependencies, or provide optional
subpackages (see the recent thread about pgocaml.batteries).
That way people who don't use batteries/core can still use your package.
