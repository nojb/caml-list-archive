Subject: [Caml-list] integrated Formal Methods 2013, Turku, Finland: 2nd
 Call for Papers

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

**********************************************************************
10th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2013)

June 10 - 14, 2013 - Turku, Finland
http://www.it.abo.fi/iFM2013/

**********************************************************************

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
Applying formal methods may involve modeling different aspects
of a system which are best expressed using different formalisms.
Correspondingly, different analysis techniques may be used to examine
different system views, different kinds of properties, or
simply in order to cope with the sheer complexity of the system.
The iFM conference series seeks to further research into hybrid
approaches to formal modeling and analysis; i.e., the combination of
(formal and semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding
modeling and analysis, and covering all aspects from language design
through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their
integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

- Formal and semiformal modelling notations;
- Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice;
- Refinement;
- Theorem proving;
- Tools;
- Logics;
- Model checking;
- Model transformations;
- Semantics;
- Static Analysis;
- Type Systems;
- Verification;
- Case Studies;
- Experience reports

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
iFM 2013 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or
experience reports related to the overall theme of method integration.=A0
The conference proceedings will be published by Springer Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series. All papers must be original, unpublished,
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions must be
in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; we suggest to use
the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, available in llncs2e.zip=A0
and the typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip as a template for your
contribution). Papers should not exceed 15 pages in length. Each paper
will undergo a thorough review process.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their
authors must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement.
At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the
conference by the early date, to be indicated by the organizers, and
present the paper.

INVITED SPEAKERS
We have the pleasure of announcing the following distinguished speakers
who have kindly accepted our invitation to lecture at iFM 2013:

- Jean-Raymond Abrial, Marseille, France
- Cosimo Laneve, University of Bologna, Italy
- Susanne Graf, VERIMAG, France
- Kim Larsen, Aalborg University, Denmark

SPECIAL ISSUES
To celebrate the 10th edition of iFM, special issues of two prominent
Springer journals are agreed upon:

- Formal Aspects of Computing
- Software and Systems Modeling

The two special issues will be based on extended and revised versions of
the best papers from iFM 2013, complemented by an open call for papers.
All submissions (including the papers selected from iFM) will go through
a separate peer-review process according to the usual scientific standards
of these journals.

WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS
The iFM conference will be accompanied by two days of workshops and
tutorials. The conference will take place during 12-14.6.2013 and the
tutorials and workshops right before it, during 10-11.6.2013.
