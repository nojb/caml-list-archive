Subject: [Caml-list] OPAM exceptions


--f46d043c823c9c1f4104ce031fa6
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

While running opam install [packages], several packages installed fine and
then one failed with:

The compilation of oasis.0.3.0 failed in
/home/aa144/.opam/3.12.1/build/oasis.0.3.0.
cannot unlock /home/aa144/.opam/3.12.1/lock (29885)

I was running 'opam list' in another window, so perhaps that caused some
problems. After this, most commands kept failing with the same error until
I manually removed the lock file. But still I get the following errors:

$ opam switch system
  'opam.opt switch system' failed
