International Symposium on High-level Parallel Programming and Applications
                                        HLPP2013,  Paris 1-2 July 2013.


Aims and scope:
As processor and system manufacturers increase the amount of both inter-
and intra-chip parallelism it becomes crucial to provide the software
industry with high-level, clean and efficient tools for parallel
programming. Parallel and distributed programming methodologies are
currently dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message
passing, or equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.
Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have
a key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.

Since 2001 the HLPP series of meetings has been a forum for researchers
developing state-of-the-art concepts, tools and applications for high-level
parallel programming. The general emphasis is on software quality,
programming productivity and high-level performance models. The 2013
symposium will be a self-contained event, held in central Paris.
HLPP 2013 invites the submission of papers written in English on all topics
including (but not limited to) the following aspects of multi-core,
parallel, distributed, grid and cloud computing:

- High-=C2=ADlevel programming and performance models (BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM,
etc.) and tools
- Declarative parallel programming methodologies
- Algorithmic skeletons and constructive methods
- Declarative parallel programming languages and libraries: semantics and
implementation
- Verification of declarative parallel and distributed programs
- Software synthesis, automatic code generation for parallel programming
- Model-driven software engineering with parallel programs
- High-level methods for heterogeneous/hierarchical platforms: GPGPU, FPGA
etc.
- High-level parallel methods for large structured and semi-structured
datasets
- Applications of parallel systems using high=C2=ADlevel languages and tools
- Teaching experience with high=C2=ADlevel tools and methods

Proceedings:
Authors of accepted papers will be expected to register and to present
their paper at the symposium.
All accepted papers will be eligible for publication in a special issue of
Springer's International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP).

Paper submission:
Submitted papers must not have been published or simultaneously submitted
elsewhere.  Submission should include a cover page with authors' names,
affiliation addresses, fax numbers, phone numbers, and email addresses.
 Please, indicate clearly the corresponding author and include up to 6
keywords from the above list of topics and an abstract of no more than 450
words.  Submissions should cover approximately 15 pages and camera-ready
versions will be 20 pages long.  Full manuscripts should be prepared with
the Springer IJSS latex macro package and submitted via the IJPP online
editorial system.  Only PDF files will be accepted.  Each paper will
receive a minimum of three reviews.  Papers will be selected based on their
originality, relevance, technical clarity and presentation.  Authors of
accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be registered and
presented at the symposium.  Accepted papers will be made available at the
time of the meeting and published in the symposium proceedings.
