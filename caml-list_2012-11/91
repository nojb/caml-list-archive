Subject: [Caml-list] Preferred layout for new packages

Hi,

I'm kinda new to the OCaml eco system and therefore a bit confused on a
number of issues:

1. Build system: what to use? I have tried OMake some time ago and
liked the automatic recompilation, but writing the OMakefiles was quite
awful and it does not seem popular. What is the state of the art
solution?

2. Unit tests: I used OUnit which was okay, but maybe there are better
solutions? I've seen that there is Kaputt and I have seen that there is
https://github.com/camlunity/ocaml-quickcheck as well as
https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML which was extracted from
batteries recently.

3. Stdlib: I don't mind depending on batteries and/or core, are there
any reasons against? Especially in the unit tests it drove me nuts that
I wasn't able to display results without writing printers, and I know
batteries has at least a generic printer.

regards,
Marek
