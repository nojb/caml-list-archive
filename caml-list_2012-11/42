Subject: [Caml-list] Compiled code that uses the stack when it can.

Is there a way to get ocamlopt to leave the C sources behind?
Does ocamlopt ever use the stack to call functions that it compiled?
Does anyone know of compilers that use the stack when they can but uses the=
 heap when it must?
Is there literature on this?
This slide set is very useful but seems to suggest that internal functions =
representations are treated uniformly.
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/talks/compilation-agay.pdf

I am thinking about static code analysis to determine two or perhaps three =
ways free variables in a function might be handled.
It is hard enough that I would like to see if it has been done before.
