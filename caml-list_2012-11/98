Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Preferred layout for new packages

My current, personal preferences are the following:

Use for in-house development:
- omake
- batteries (some of it)

Avoid in new projects:
- camlp4/camlp5
- ocamlbuild

I'm glad for the many libraries and tools written by the community. 
They are all fine as long as they work and are:
- maintained, unlikely to break anytime soon or easy to take over or 
replace;
- not invasive.

Martin
