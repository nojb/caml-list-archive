Yeah, I saw that.  I will install it and have a look.

Ok, I had only seen the Monad module in batteries.  Also, I tend not
to like batteries as it bloats the executable size; I get something
like a 5MB executable for a small amount of code.

In general, what I would like in a "monad library" would be a
collection of "standard monads".  I am using scarequotes because I
don't know what all of this means.  Looking at the Haskell Wiki
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad#Common_monads) lists the
common monads as "Maybe, List, State, Reader, and IO".  I would assume
that a monad library would have these and a method for building new
ones.

Great.  Thanks for the info!
