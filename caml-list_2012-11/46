Hi list,

We had a successful meeting last Friday for our first Cambridge functional
programmers meetup. As requested by those who turned up, I've created a
meetup group to help us organize. If you are interested, please join here:

http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/

We're probably going to have another meeting in early December. It will
probably just be another pub meetup. If you've got any requests for dates
or for particular pubs, please let me know.

Now that we've got an online home at meetup.com, I'll avoid spamming this
list with future announcements. Thanks,

Mike
