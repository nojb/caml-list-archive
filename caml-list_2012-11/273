FACS 2013: CALL FOR=20
PAPERS

The 10th International Symposium on Formal Aspects of Component=20
Software
Nanchang, China, October 28-30,=20
2013

http://www.jxcsst.com/facs2013/

Scope
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Component-based=20
software development is a paradigm that has been
proposing sound engineering=20
principles and techniques for coping with
the complexity of=20
software-intensive systems. However, many
challenging conceptual and=20
technological issues remain that require
further research.

Moreover,=20
the advent of service-oriented and cloud computing has
brought to the fore=20
new dimensions, such as quality of service and
robustness to withstand=20
inevitable faults, which require established
concepts to be revisited and new=20
ones to be developed in order to meet
the opportunities offered by those=20
architectures. As software
applications become themselves components of wider=20
socio-technical
systems, further challenges arise from the need to create and=20
manage
interactions, which can evolve in time and space, and rely on the use=20
of
resources that can change in non-computable ways.

FACS 2013 is=20
concerned with how formal methods can be used to make
component-based=20
development fit for the new architectures of today
and the systems that are=20
now pervading the socio-economic world.
Formal methods have provided=20
foundations for component-based
software through research on mathematical=20
models for components,
composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to=20
verification,
deployment, testing, and certification. Whilst those avenues=20
still need
to be further explored, time is also ripe to bring new techniques=20
to the
fore, such as those based on stochastic models and=20
simulation.

Topics of Interest
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The symposium seeks=20
to address the development and
application of formal methods in all aspects=20
of software
components and services. Specific topics include, but are=20
not
limited to:

-- formal models for software components and their=20
interaction
-- stochastic techniques for modeling and verification
--=20
simulation techniques for complex networks of interacting components
--=20
formal aspects of services, service oriented architectures, business proces=
ses,=20
and cloud computing
-- design and verification methods for software=20
components and services
-- composition and deployment: models, calculi,=20
languages
-- formal methods and modeling languages for components and=20
services
-- model based and GUI based testing of components and=20
services
-- models for QoS and other extra-functional properties (e.g.,=20
trust, compliance, security) of components and services
-- components for=20
real-time, safety-critical, secure, and/or embedded systems
-- industrial or=20
experience reports, and case studies
-- update and reconfiguration of=20
component and service architectures
-- component systems evolution and=20
maintenance
-- autonomic components and self-managed applications
--=20
formal and rigorous approaches to software adaptation and self-adaptive=20
systems
