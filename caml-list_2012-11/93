The community is trying to standardize on Oasis, which generates 
ocamlbuild-based build systems.  In the future, this may generate some 
other build system if a better one comes out.

iTeML is more of a test extraction framework, and builds on top of OUnit 
and a hacked version of the Jane St. quickcheck library.  It can easily 
support other frameworks, and it would be interesting to explore a 
custom framework designed with iTeML in mind.

Batteries' dump function is a terrible printer for anything beyond the 
most basic of purposes, just as the Pervasives.compare is also 
terrible.  Batteries' printer combinators (`List.print Int.print stdout 
[1;2;3]`) are what I use for most purposes.
