Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Monad Library?

The Core library [1] has a good monad library that gets used in
basically every single Jane Street program (and notably inside async).
Among its features are:

* Module types for monads with one or two type parameters

* Functors to make modules satisfying those signatures given just bind + return

* "Infix" submodules which one can locally open ("let open
Option.Monad_infix in") in order to temporarily work inside another
monad -- very useful.

It notably does *not* feature a syntax extension to make monadic
computations look pretty. You must write out the binds and returns
yourself. To be honest, the reason for this is mostly history, but we
actually have some anecdotal evidence now that writing in the explicit
style makes things easier to understand for authors and readers of
code.
