Subject: [Caml-list] camlimages problems on mac


Hello,

When installing camlimages 4.0.1 with MacPort (Mac OS X 10.7.5, Latest MacP=
orts),
the resulting camlimages has no support for JPEG, PNG, PPM, XPM, etc=85 whi=
ch makes it sort of useless.

When compiling the source using omake, the same happens. It can find the he=
ader files, but can't find specific functions inside.

The source code for camlimages seems perhaps outdated w.r.t. changes in the=
 API of libpng, libjpg, giflib, tifflib, etc=85=20

Could anyone confirms this dire state of affairs? Is there a "modernizer" p=
atch floating around? or some work in progress? Is it the same on Linux?

Thank you,
Samuel=
