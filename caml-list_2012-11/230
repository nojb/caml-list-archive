 Models of Computation (TAMC13)

                FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS: TAMC 2013
    The 10th annual conference on Theory and Applications of
                     Models of Computation

          University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong

Important Dates
Submission deadline : 11:59 pm EST January 11, 2013
Notification of authors : late February or early March, 2013
Final versions deadline : to be announced soon

The TAMC proceedings will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science Series by Springer (http://www.springer.com/lncs).

* computational geometry
* continuous and real computation
* cryptography
* data structures
* design and analysis of algorithms
* distributed algorithms
* fixed parameter tractability
* graph algorithms
* information and communication complexity
* learning theory
* natural computation
* network algorithms, networks in nature and society
* online algorithms
* optimization
* parallel algorithms
* privacy and security
* property testing
* proof complexity
* quantum computing
* randomness, pseudo-randomness
* randomized algorithms
* streaming algorithms
