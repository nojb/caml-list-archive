Subject: [Caml-list] Cyclic data structures: internal representation

Good morning,

One can create cyclic data structures in OCaml, using the keyword let rec. =
For example:

  # let rec l0 =3D 1 :: 2 :: l0;;
  var l0 : int list =3D
    [1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; 1; 2; ...]

I am wondering what the internal representation (in the AST) of such a data=
 structure is. It could be a cyclic data structure on the AST itself, but I=
 doubt it because it would make it difficult to manipulate. Another solutio=
n I see is keeping a data structure with free variables inside (or referenc=
es, for that matter) and binding these free variables in some other place. =
l0 would then bounded directly to  [1 ; 2 ; l0 ] in the AST. Any idea what =
the internals of OCaml do?

Related questions:
- is there any easy way to check if a list is cyclic or not? The only way I=
 see is to go down the list, checking at every step if this particular subl=
ist has already been seen. But it's rather heavy.
- the documentation on the =3D sign (http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-o=
caml/libref/Pervasives.html) mentions that "Equality between cyclic data st=
ructures may not terminate." It seems to terminate if one or the other of t=
he data structures is not cyclic. Does it ever terminate when both data sst=
ructures are cyclic, or does it always loop?
  # let l1 =3D [1; 2] in l0 =3D l1;;
  - : bool =3D false
  # l0 =3D l0;;
  (* doesn't finish *)

Thank you,
Jean-Baptiste Jeannin=
