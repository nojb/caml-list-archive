Subject: [Caml-list] Ocamldebugging custom runtime executables


--bcaec51d25d426111c04cd78ddcd
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Dear caml-list,

I have been annoyed by a feature I was not quite familiar with, as I had
compiled a library with the -custom option and was oblivious to the fact
that the option would be passed to client code of that library, resulting
in a "custom runtime" for any program linking to that library.

Now, I am under the impression that the ocaml 4.00 debugger can load such
custom runtime executables, while my ocaml 3.12 debugger does not like
them: "... is not a bytecode file.".

I did not find this mentioned in the 4.00 changelog though. And looking at
the manual for 3.12 makes it look as if it should have been able to load
such files:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ocaml-3.12-refman.html#htoc199
"Rarely useful; moreover it prevents the debugging of programs compiled in
=E2=80=9Ccustom runtime=E2=80=9D mode."

I would therefore be interested in knowing whether ocaml 3.12 debugger
should have been able to debug such custom runtime, and if so, why did I
get this error?

- Valentin
