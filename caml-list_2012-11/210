pa_monad is really useful and nice, I think the updated library is
available as pa_monad_custom OPAM package.

First I would need to find an answer what do you mean by a monad library.

Monads is a general abstraction with a very simple interface. so they
don't require library as such.

However I agree it would be good to have some library that provides a
monadic interface to some common functionality found maybe in std
libraries, also some way of composing monads would be good having
monad transformers along. Batteries included offer monadic interface
to some common data types like list, bool, option.

You could look at Xavier Leroy's lectures here [1] to see the
excellent examples of using monads in OCaml.

For somewhat advanced type system trickery to use generic interface
for monads you can look at this excellent post [2].
