Subject: [Caml-list] MSVC port of ocaml-4.00.1

Hi,

I am building a microsoft visual C 32 bit version of ocaml-4.00.1 from 
the distribution sources.  It's been very difficult.

I have been forced to make substantial changes to flexdll 0.30 to make 
it work.   I'm still trying to find a minimal patch to flexdll that 
works.  The flexdll changes are restricted to the MSVC compile chain, so 
that when I get a patch put together it won't break the other tools.

There are also a number of changes I will make to README.win32 to 
explain about more of the environment variables that are required. I've 
found some additional environment variables.  Also, some have specific 
restrictions on their content.

Has anyone else put together an MSVC OCaml 4?

Bill Smith
