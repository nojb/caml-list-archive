Subject: [Caml-list] Github OCaml mirror available

There have been quite a few Git mirrors of the OCaml compiler tree floating=
 around for the past few years.  I've grabbed the "OCaml" organisation on G=
ithub, where key community projects can be hosted such as OASIS, the ocaml.=
org website, and a mirror of the compiler itself.

You can find it at:
http://github.com/ocaml/ocaml

The conversion scripts were based on Benedikt Meurer's very useful guide, w=
ith the exception that SVN tags and branches are converted into native Git =
tags, and an authors file exists.  You can find the scripts that drive it h=
ere:
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-scripts/tree/master/vcs-sync/svn-ocaml

For those concerned about Github being a proprietary service, I'm also sett=
ing up a git.ocaml.org mirror of all the repositories hosted on Github.  Th=
is will be ready in a few weeks.  Note that the compiler Git repository is =
a *read-only mirror*, and that all active development occurs within the INR=
IA SVN, and issues should continue to be reported via Mantis:=20

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis

Thanks to Leo White and Christophe Troestler for helping with getting this =
working!  Please consider this experimental for a few weeks in case any iss=
ues come up with the scripts that cause us to delete the repository and rec=
reate it.  If anyone feels strongly about needing a Mercurial mirror, pleas=
e also get in touch.
