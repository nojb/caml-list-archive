     CALL FOR WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS AND SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

           CADE-24

     The 24th International Conference on Automated Deduction
     Lake Placid, USA, 9-14 June 2013

          http://www.cade-24.info

     Submission deadline: 2 December 2012

CADE is the major international forum at which research on all aspects
of automated deduction is presented.


CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

Workshop proposals for CADE-24 are solicited. Both well-established
workshops and newer ones are encouraged. Similarly, proposals for
workshops with a tight focus on a core automated reasoning specialization, 
as well as those with a broader or more applied focus, are very welcome.

Please provide the following information in your application document:

+ Workshop title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days).
+ Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is
  the workshop relevant for CADE?
+ Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case
  information on previous meetings should be given.
+ Are there plans for publication?

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Tutorial proposals for CADE-24 are solicited. Tutorials are expected to be
half-day events, with a theoretical or applied focus, on a Topic Of Interest
for CADE-24. Proposals should provide the following information:

+ Tutorial title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.
+ Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously.

CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for tutorials that
would like this service.

CALL FOR SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

The CADE ATP Systems Competition CASC, which evaluates automated theorem
proving systems for classical logics, has become an integral part of the
CADE conferences.

Further system competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to
foster the development of automated reasoning systems in all areas
relevant for automated deduction in a broad sense.

+ Competition title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Duration and schedule of the competition.
+ Room/space requirements.
+ Brief description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.
+ Is the competition new or has it been organized before?
  In the latter case information on previous competitions should be given.
+ What computing resources are required and how will they be provided?
