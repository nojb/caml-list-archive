CiE 2013 is the ninth conference organised by CiE (Computability in
Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer
scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new
developments in computability and their underlying significance for the
real world. Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005),
Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponte
Dalgada (2010), Sofia (2011) and Cambridge (2012).


The Nature of Computation is meant to emphasize the special focus of
CIE13 on the unexpected and strong changes that studies on Nature have
brought in several areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science.
Starting from Alan Turing, research on Nature with a computational
perspective has produced novel contributions, giving rise even to new
disciplines.

Two complementary research perspectives pervade the Nature of
Computation theme. One is focused on the understanding of new
computational paradigms inspired by the processes occurring in the
biological world, while focusing on a deeper and modern understanding of
the theory of computation. The other perspective is on our understanding
of how computations really occur in Nature, on how we can interact with
those computations, and on their applications.


CiE 2013 conference topics include, but not exclusively:

* Admissible sets
* Algorithms
* Analog computation
* Artificial intelligence
* Automata theory
* Bioinformatics
* Classical computability and degree structures
* Cognitive science and modelling
* Complexity classes
* Computability theoretic aspects of programs
* Computable analysis and real computation
* Computable structures and models
* Computational and proof complexity
* Computational biology
* Computational creativity
* Computational learning and complexity
* Computational linguistics
* Concurrency and distributed computation
* Constructive mathematics
* Cryptographic complexity
* Decidability of theories
* Derandomization
* DNA computing
* Domain theory and computability
* Dynamical systems and computational models
* Effective descriptive set theory
* Emerging and Non-standard Models of Computation
* Finite model theory
* Formal aspects of program analysis

We particularly welcome submissions in emergent areas, such as
bioinformatics and natural computation, where they have a basic
connection with computability.

* Antonina Kolokolova (St. John's NF) * Benedikt Loewe (Amsterdam)
* Giancarlo Mauri (Milan)             * Rolf Niedermeier (Berlin)
* Geoffrey Pullum (Edinburgh)	      * Nicole Schweikardt (Frankfurt)
* Sonja Smets (Amsterdam)             * Susan Stepney (York)
* S. P. Suresh (Chennai)              * Peter van Emde Boas (Amsterdam)

The PROGRAMME COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers (European and
non-European) in computability related areas to submit their papers (in
PDF format, max 10 pages using the LNCS style) for presentation at CiE 2013.
The submission site https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2013 is open.
We particularly invite papers that build bridges between different
parts of the research community.

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer Verlag.
