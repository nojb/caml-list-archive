Subject: Re: [Caml-list] camlimages problems on mac


Merci Pierre-=C9tienne ! With your patch, I was able to compile camlimages =
with full support for all file formats. I also noticed that MacPorts actual=
ly applies the same patch, yet the MacPorts version does not work. I suspec=
t that's because the MacPorts' patch fails to add -I/opt/local/include and =
-L/opt/local/lib to the OMakefile before compiling.
