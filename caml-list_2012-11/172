Subject: [Caml-list] DWARF output for native-code

Greetings programs,

For fun, I=E2=80=99ve started to write some gdb scripts to inspect the memo=
ry
of an OCaml program. Without type information, I can only print
immediates and blocks hierarchy, and of course with type information I
can display values as they appear in the source code.

The way to pass type information (and other things) to the debugger
would be to make the compiler output DWARF data. OCaml just started to
output debug information with CFI (Calling Frame Information, since
OCaml 4.0.0), but debugging OCaml native programs with gdb could
become awesome with information like a precise source code =E2=86=92
executable code mapping, values location, type information, etc.

I=E2=80=99ve read some docs about the DWARF format, and I=E2=80=99ve looked=
 at the
OCaml compiler=C2=A0: a lot of code is to be (re)written in order to pass
debug information from source code AST to backends, but I would like
to try anyway. I=E2=80=99ve discovered that a =C2=AB=C2=A0dwarf=C2=A0=C2=BB=
 branch already exist
on the repository: it is actively developped by =C2=AB=C2=A0shinwell=C2=A0=
=C2=BB since
september. Even if it looks far from completion, it seems to have the
same goal.

I could not find any reference to this branch on the Web nor on this
list, so before I contact directly this developper, I prefer to ask
here: are there any information about this on the Internet? (goal,
roadmap, =E2=80=A6) I would be very interested in contributing to this.

Regards,
