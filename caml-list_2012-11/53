I just tried to configure it using godi, and this is what is supported
on my system:

External libraries: lablgtk2 bmp ppm png jpeg tiff freetype(2) ps

Most of my image libraries are installed through homebrew (I see for
instance "jpeg" or "libpng", I don't know where the ppm support comes
from).

To get support for gifs, I installed giflib (still through homebrew).

After doing this, camlimages seems to compile fine.
