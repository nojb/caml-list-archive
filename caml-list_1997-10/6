Since I have seen a couple of litprog tools mentioned, I will add a
little to the discussion. There are a number of litprog tools
available for this purpose: nuweb/noweb/funnelweb/CLiP etc that I
would suggest looking at the litprog FAQ (at the usual places), and
then making your own decision. noweb/nuweb are easy to learn (a few
pages of docs). Others have more features/take more time to get
proficient at. There is a news group comp.programming.literate.
