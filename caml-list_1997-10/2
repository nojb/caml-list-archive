Hi,

I am writing again about a topic we had on the list last year
(cf. http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/caml-list/0676.html and
http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/caml-list/0680.html).

As Xavier writes it is a pain that in some circumstances
(specifications of types and signatures) the same code has to be
written twice, first in the specification and then in the
implementation.

Is there any solution to this? 

Has anybody tried to include parts of an interface into an
implementation (for instance by means of a preprocessor)?

Greetings,

Hendrik
