The best programming environment for Caml is the Unix operating system
and the GNU Emacs editor.  As an added value, both are 100% free, run
on any reasonably recent machine (and a lot of unreasonably old ones),
and give a rock-solid environment for all your computing as well...

If you insist on an MSDOS-style IDE, I don't know any that will work
out of the box with Caml.  However, I had a look at RHIDE, and it
seems relatively trivial to adapt to any command-line compiler
(such as Caml Light), not just DJGPP.

In the Caml Light manual, chapter 9:
