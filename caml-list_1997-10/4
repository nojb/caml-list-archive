I am using FunnelWeb (a language-independent literate programming system)
for almost everything, and it is a nice solution to this problem, too.

For my current project, I edit a single FunnelWeb file (currently >800k)
in the folding-mode of Emacs, and a single run of FunnelWeb
(8 seconds on a SparcStation 20) produces a Makefile, 48 OLabl modules
with interfaces, among these 4 lexers and 4 parsers, several special
auxiliary files, and a LaTeX file containing 400+ pages of documented code.

The documented code in the literate programming style can be very nice
and useful, but even if you do not want to go literate,
FunnelWeb is still a very useful preprocessor
(I must admit that I am sometimes lazy on documentation, too...)


FunnelWeb is available via:
  URL: http://www.ross.net/funnelweb/introduction.html

There is also a modified version (which I haven't tried yet)
that allows HTML output and line directives:

Happy weaving!
