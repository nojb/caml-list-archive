I wrote such a C library to handle (boxed) 32 or 64 bits integers (you
can find  it on my  web page).  But it appeared  that it was  not very
efficient, and  when I rewrote my  program using an  encoding with two
Caml integers, it was really faster.

So I  would suggest you to  write such a  library in Caml. For  a good
starting point, you  may have a look at the  module Nativeint in ocaml
sources (in utils/nativeint.ml).
