Currently ;-)

I'll see whether commuting arguments is sufficient enough an incentive to
switch modes: but what concerns the problem with HOFs, there should really
be a solution - at least what concerns the standard library.

I agree: "open" is potentially dangerous. It is not only confusing at
times, it can even break modules (e.g. if you add functions to one module
which shadow definitions in another module).

Best regards,
Markus
