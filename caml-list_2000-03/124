You have a very good point. In fact -modern was chosen arbitrarily
when integrating olabl code in ocaml, and was to be changed
before the release.  It might have avoided some confusions.

-labels would be OK. I just avoided it because it seemed to imply that
one couldn't use labels in classic mode, which is not true.

In my opinion -strict or -pedantic would be wrong: this is not the
intended meaning.

This is the intended behaviour. If you have problems in accessing
those APIs in classic mode, then this means something should be done
about it in the API. The implementor of a labelled library may not
realise that one parameter order is not so nice, just because he
doesn't care about it.

For instance, if you use LablTk in classic mode, you will have to put
the widget as last parameter in most functions. If you feel this is
weird, then you should report the inconvenience.

There are no plans to change this.
At least a consensus would be needed.
