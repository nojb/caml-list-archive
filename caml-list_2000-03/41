HAs anyone been so crazy as to try to build a palm pilot version of ocaml ? or
even a TI 89/92 version ? todays palm come with 8MB of memory, this is
plentifull for an caml toplevel. the TI version could cause more problems
(having only ~500kb memory i think).

both of these computer use a 68000, or some modified version thereof, so it
should be possible to reuse the m68k code that is already in ocaml.
