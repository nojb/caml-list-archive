Actually, that's over-simplifying.  In fact, I would simply turn off
label mode--EXCEPT that I might want to use something like tk, which
has an API I don't think is usable without labels.

So I would either have a mixture of source files, some compiled with
labels on some with off, or all labels.  And even in the files where I
want labels, I'd rather not use them on the standard library, but I
would have to.  :(
