I have kept out of the label debate as I haven't had a chance to really play
with 2.99
yet, have hardly ever used OLabl, and generally feel more optimistic about
what labels
might offer me than terrified about how Ocaml might suffer. 

So, I am just throwing an ill-cautioned suggestion when I say that it looks
to me
as if  Claudio is onto something.

Would it be possible to set up something along the lines:

MyModule:foo       need labels
MyModule.foo       labels checked if used

open MyModule:    needs labels
open MyModule     labels checked if used

Then the only case where you are committed is when you are inside a module
that you are actually writing using functions that you have just defined.
But if you are using labels inside your own module then surely you can't
object
to labels......
then surely you are happy with a label enforcing mode.

I suppose then that you would be able to write

Mod1.Mod2:foo
Mod1:Mod2:foo

and it would mean the same thing.

Is this impossible to implement ?
