I see two dangers:
- this could result in an over-featured library;
- the "regular" and the "extended" library may diverge.
On the other hand, I don't think it would be a bad thing if more
people contributed to the development of O'Caml.

Anyway, you can always set up a repository on Sourceforge or any
similar site and see what happens. :-)
