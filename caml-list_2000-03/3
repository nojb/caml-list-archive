Easy: transfer the bytecode executable file from one system to another.
Assume it's called exec.byt.  Then run

                ocamlrun exec.byt

on the second system.  Or, edit the first line of exec.byt
(the one with #!) to put the full path of ocamlrun on the second system,
provided it supports the #! notation.
