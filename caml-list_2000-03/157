just redefine the above mentioned operations in caml, taking the overflow in
account, it should not be too difficult, altough it should be a bit less
efficient than the normal +, -, ... (altough i am not sure about it, maybe you
could just ignore it and use the normal functions. At least for + and - it
should work without problem.

to test them, use a function to print the type as unsigned int, and use
#install_printer to use it as default printer for ints.
