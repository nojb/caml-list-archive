Is it possible to alias an exception as with functions or type definitions?
I would like to write a module that is a "virtual module" in the sense
that it just regroups identifiers that are defined in other modules.
This works fine for types and functions:

  type running_prog = Programs.running_prog;;
  let is_finished = Programs.is_finished;;

Apparently, I cannot do the same thing with exceptions (and hence
with functions that raise an exception). The obvious solution is to
write a wrapper as in

  exception Erreur_load of string;;
  let load s =
    try
      Analyse_program.load s
    with
        Analyse_program.Erreur_load s -> raise (Erreur_load s)
;;

which is quite awkward. It would be nice to have a way to define an alias
for an exception in the same way as for identifiers and types.
