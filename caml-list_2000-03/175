BTW,  I should also like to point out that the sources and makefiles in the
distribution produce not only the interactive NML tools, but they also make
a DLL for use by any other program, and a COM server version with both a
low-level interface and an IDispatch interface for VBasic. Also included is
a sample of use from VBasic. Finally, there is a Mathlink version of NML
that allows Mathematica 3.x/4.x to call on the numeric services of
NML/IPLib. That way no one is tied to my particular paradigm -- feel free to
use it in any of these ways...
