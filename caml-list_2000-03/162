Yes, but only once the system has been installed.  (ocamlc is a script
starting with e.g. #!/usr/local/bin/ocamlrun, so it can be run
directly only after ocamlrun is installed in /usr/local/bin.)  While
the system is being built, it is necessary to say where ocamlrun
resides.

For your particular situation (cross-compiling), as I explained to you
before, you want boot/ocamlrun to be the native (not cross-compiled)
runtime system, and byterun/ocamlrun to be the cross-compiled,
runtime system, suitably modified for your target architecture.
