 Something I do not understand: how could I use Labltk, for which I want
to be modern, and List.fold_right, for which I do not want labels, in the
same file ?
 By the way, the label "acc" (or even "accu") does not mean anything for me
in fold_right: the iterator associates one function to each
constructor of the type so I would prefer

val fold_right: cons:(hd:'a -> tl:'b -> 'b) -> nil:'b -> list:'a list -> 'b

 Please ! The debate is about presence of labels in the standard library,
not in the language.
 Today, it is possible to teach Ocaml without speaking about objects,
modules (functors are not so common in libraries), streams, etc. If labels
are in the standard library you will have to explain one more (nice
and not so simple) feature before being able to use one
simple list iterator ...
