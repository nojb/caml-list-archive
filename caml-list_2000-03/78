I'm no expert, but sourceforge.org seems pretty good. The thing
I think I will find a bit clumbsy is the way releases are built,
but I haven't made one yet. 

As for cooperative development, it may be an excellent idea
to have a sourceforge based ocaml library so that ocaml
users can help each other (and the ocaml implementors).
This is much better than each person 'doing their own thing',
or 'hassling' the implementors.
