I have been following this discussion somewhat remotely.  I've not
been able to do much programming lately, and almost no OCAML (I have
dabbled with Olabl a few times).  From what I can see:

1) please do not call it ``modern'' mode.  Call it ``label'' mode.
   The word modern has baggage attached to it.  Other words that would
   be as good but also have (somewhat different) baggage include:
   different, changed, messed-up, experimental...  My point is that we
   should use a word that is not ``good'' or ``bad'', and calling it
   ``label'' mode seems best.  I have no opinion on what ``classic''
   mode should be called, although I think ``classic'' is fine (there
   is a little baggage, but it is split between has-withstood-the-
   test-of-time and old-fashioned, so is fairly neutral overall).

2) I do not expect to use label mode very frequently, except when
   dealing with ugly APIs (typically ones imported from some outside
   world, such as Tk).  If I can, in classic mode, program as I always
   have done, and access these APIs, but otherwise ignore labels
   (especially in the standard libraries!), I will be happy.

3) I hope classic mode will remain the default for a *long* time.
