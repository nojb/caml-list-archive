Just thought I'd say -- the new error diagnostic produced for missing
cases
from matches  -- listing cases that are not tested for -- is superb.
This is saving me a lot of time. Thanks!

BTW: I'm about to find out about 'convincing management' to use ocaml.
I'm working in a C++ shop (C++ is mandatory for much of the production
code for reasons of both efficiency and binary compatibility),
with the task of writing a code generator -- which will (probably)
generate C++, but will (hopefully) be written in ocaml.

[I tend to push people to breaking point though -- I'm also writing the 
code using my literate programming tool :-]
