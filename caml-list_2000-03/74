And why not "as", i.e. "t as x", as I explained once in a previous post.
I never did get an explanation as to why this wasn't an better solution.  It
reuses a rarely-used keyword in a perfectly backward-compatible way.  
I think it's simply a typical case of a new (and not necessarily terribly 
crucial) language feature muscling in on the limited "ultra-convenient" 
concrete syntax that's available!   No offence intended ;-)

Cheers,
Don

It is clear that labels are a good thing ...

But why did you use the same character ":" for types and labels !

whit not (for instance) x:t to say that x as type t
and                     l#x to say that x as label l

the syntax l#x:t is much better than l:x : t !!

I know that # is allready used for methods ... but some characters are
still usable:

~
£ it looks like the l of labels (but its ascii code is greater than 128,
but is this really a problem ? probably ?)
