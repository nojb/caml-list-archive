Sure, but

let f a b c =
   match a,b,c with
        0,1,2 -> 3

is a lot more cluttered than

f 0 1 2 = 3

This wouldn't really be an issue except that pattern matching is so
common. Intuitive brevity (as opposed to the brevity represented by
languages such as perl) is what makes both haskell and *ml so
readable. While both functions seem equally readable because they are
both small, once you have a screen full of them there is a significant
difference in clarity.

Cheers,
Julian.
