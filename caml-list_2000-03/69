I also think that it is a sensible strategy of INRIA to keep the interfaces
of their libraries uncluttered. An "experimental" repository for libraries,
where people can work out possible additions cooperatively, would be a very
appealing project. I would also be prepared to volunteer in such an effort.

Xavier once posted the following mail:

  http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/caml-list/1087.html

Is it still possible to get CVS-accounts at INRIA? It would also be
possible to use "http://sourceforge.net", but I have no experience in
setting up projects there nor whether there might be any objections to
doing such a project on a host outside the control of INRIA - maybe John
Skaller, who uses it for his Python-compiler, can tell us more about it?

Markus Mottl
