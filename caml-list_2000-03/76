You're right: for the time being our libraries are in some sense
minimalist (due to the ancient times problems with memory capacities
of micro computers and 1.4 Mb floppies). It may be time now to get
reasonably featured libraries. For instance, you mentioned few
functions that sound adequate to be added (in the first place because
there are not a zillion of them).

We also have the tools you mentioned to develop the Caml compiler
(``CVS-repository, mailing lists, bug tracking, patch manager,
etc...''), except may be ``etc...'':), so that there is no need to set
up another site to develop the Caml standard library (on the other
hand the use of SourceForge may be very relevant for other
cooperative developments out of the Caml compiler). In any means we
must avoid confusion and divergence with 2 different standard libraries.

Caml users may contribute to the wish list associated to the caml bugs
tracking system: you may contribute in a useful way if you also
provide the code associated to your wishes.

Best regards,
