Actually, there are OCaml bindings available in NML for just this purpose.
My first major application of NML was a hybrid OCaml/NML program for solving
a highly nonlinear problem that computes the phase variations in an optical
system that give rise to measured image blur functions. If you are
interested in a copy of the source for this app (about 700 lines of OCaml/50
lines of NML) just drop me a note. The OCaml is terrific for overall program
organization, while the NML is quite expressive for the array computations
and Fourier analysis...
