I would still vote for ~ because it denotes some kind of equivalence
spcialy when you write "fun x~x -> " which fell like somthing reflexive
even if it is not symmetric.

Ok, and I agree ! What I mean is that it could happend sooner if there
was a mode that is conservetive over both modern and classic modes. I
will give a first working answer ...

What I want is that it is possible to assign an unlabeled argument to a
function waiting for a labeled one. I give a simple modification of
Ocaml which seems to verify that in can compile both the programs
written for classic and modern mode.

An example with Array.blit:

> ocaml -modern
        Objective Caml version 2.99 (99/12/08)
 
# let f a x b y len = Array.blit a src_pos:x b dst_pos:y len;;
Warning: Argument without label used when waiting for a label

val f : 'a array -> int -> 'a array -> int -> int -> unit = <fun> 
# let g a x b y len = Array.blit a b len src_pos:x dst_pos:y;;
Warning: Argument without label used when waiting for a label
Warning: Argument without label used when waiting for a label
Warning: Argument without label used when waiting for a
label                                                                     
val g : 'a array -> int -> 'a array -> int -> int -> unit = <fun> 
                                                                      
This is a very simple trick which is a bit dirty (just look at it). I
think one could do much better, specially if unification over types had
been purely functional in Caml (then one could try to type in some way,
fail and try something else).

The main problem is that now Ocaml must print a warning when there are
more than one way to assign an unlabeled argument to a function waiting
for a labeled one. Otherwise, one of the role of labels is lost: capture
more bugs)

The List.fold_left fun:(+) does not work yet because I did not modify
the unification algorithm ... A simple solution is to ignore the
Clflags.classic in unification as no permutation are done by unification
anyway !

Just giving yourself some indication like

val (+) : a:int -> a:int -> int 
(* same labels means permutation is irrelevant ! *)

To get less warnings should not be difficult.

val extract_label :
