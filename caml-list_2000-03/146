Just use the caml integer and ignore the fact that they are signed ?

after the moto :  that doesn't matter in the above mentioned application,
since the integers are being used to represent characters] 

But then i don't know what you use it for ...

And also, you would have to check exactly how integer overflow work, but in my
experience max_int+1 = min_int.
