I have some code for processing ISO-10646 characters and UTF-8,
which uses caml integers. ISO-10646 has 2^31 code points, which
can be covered by caml integers on a 32bit machine. Using an
unboxed type is mandatory for performance.

Unfortunately, caml integers are signed, which makes most of the
code I have written wrong (I haven't taken the care to handle
integers over 2^30 correctly).

What is the best way to handle this problem?
Would a (standard?) library module (written in C), that treats
integers as unsigned be a reasonable solution?

[This may require writing 'uint_add x y' instead of 'x+y',
but that doesn't matter in the above mentioned application,
since the integers are being used to represent characters]
