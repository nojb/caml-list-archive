Hello, I am a teacher in italian school.
For this year we have decided to study functional
programming and an introduction course in caml (0.6)
in dos and in Linux.
For the next year we think to study caml also for
the view of "conceptual database design".
Do you know any examples or reference ?

Saluti

p.s. I have no subscribe to mailing-list so
please respond to e-mail address. Thanks
