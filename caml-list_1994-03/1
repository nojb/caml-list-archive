Hello Caml-list listener's

Does anybody know if there exist any documentation of the type-
checker of Caml Light. 'The ZINC Experiment: An Economical
Implementation of The ML-Language' by Xavier Leroy, 1990 does
not include type-checking :-(.

I'm trying to attach equality type variables to Caml Light
together with imperative type variables and overloaded
builtin operators. The code of Caml Light is not 'just' the
Hindley/Milner/Robinson kind of thing, though there are
similarities. What are dangerous type variables and why does
the type checker include two unification algorithms?

Best regards

Martin Elsman
