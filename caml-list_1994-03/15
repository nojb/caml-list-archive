Yes, this is described as bug (1) in the file KNOWN-BUGS in the 0.6
distribution.

A simple workaround is to change the definition of the DEST function:
instead of

 let DEST = 
   fun (App p) -> p 
     | (Var _) -> failwith "DEST";;

write

 let DEST = 
   fun (App(x,y)) -> (x,y)
     | (Var _) -> failwith "DEST";;
