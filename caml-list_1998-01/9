I am please to announce the release 2.1 of the bindlib library for
Objective-Caml.

This is a completely rewritten library with no more strange restrictions 
and a wider variety of examples. Have a try !

THE BINLIB PACKAGE
------------------

  This is a library for the Objective-Caml (and NJSML if someone
  really wants a port) providing reasonable tools to write programs
  manipulating data structures with binders (like lambda-terms or 
  quantified formulae). It is quite efficient and not too difficult 
  to use (at least for me).

  I do not know of any available alternative to this package resulting
  in a code as small, and as efficient (both in memory and speed) ! 
  So give it a try !

Availability:
-------------

It is available from my URL:

History
-------

Version 2.1 January, 15th, 1998:

  - added bind_val family of functions.
  
  - added is_closed and related functions.

  - added bind_pair, bind_list and related modules

  - more complex examples available.

  - only an objective-caml version at the moment 

Version 2.0 November, 21th, 1997 (not really distributed):

  - complete rewriting (no more strange restrictions) !

  - only an objective-caml version at the moment 

Version 1.2 November, 15th, 1995:

  - Provide an SML version.

  - Correct a bug (this bug could only appear with the native 
    Caml-Special-Light compiler).

  - The function cumul-abs is not provided anymore (the library decide 
    by itself how it should optimized abstraction).

  - The price to pay: start_term can only be called while no other
    construction is already started. Another function local_start is
    provided to start a new construction of a term inside another.

Version 1.1, October, 17th, 1995:

  - Correct a major bug: when more than one variable is bound outside
    of the current sequence of binding, then the version 1.0 does not
    work at all. This bug has now been corrected.

  - The library now raises the exception "Binlib_error" instead of
    "Invalid_argument".

  - The memory usage has been optimised to take in account binder
    which binds a variable with no occurrence. In the benchmark this
    is not visible, but other examples shows an improvement of a factor
    greater than 2 !

  - The library only works for terms with less than 32768 free
    variables in each sub-term. An exception is raised if you
    use too many variables.

  - The library has now been tested on a bigger scale and should be
    more reliable (I hope)

Version 1.0, September, 27th, 1995:

  - first public version
