First Call for Papers

===============
 OpenCERT 2019
===============

=======================================================================
9th International Workshop on
Open Community approaches to Education, Research and Technology
- towards "Open community approaches" CERTification processes -
=======================================================================

https://opencert.github.io

Porto, Portugal, October 8, 2019

Satellite event of the 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods (FM 2019)
http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=opencert2019
Submission deadline: June 24, 2019
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Open Community is a generalisation of the concept of Open Source to
other collaborative efforts. It includes Open Content, that is, some
form of non restrictive license, and Open Knowledge, that is, the
freedom to use, reuse, and redistribute knowledge without legal,
social or technological restriction.  The 9th International Workshop
on Open Community approaches to Education, Research and Technology
expands the scope of the International Workshop on Foundations and
Techniques for Open Source Software Certification, whose 8 editions
run from 2007 to 2014. The new scope of the workshop aims to promote
the use of the Open Community approaches in Education and Research
while also exploiting them to achieve wide diffusion and proper
assessment of new, innovative Technology. The workshop general focus
is on

1. EDUCATION, by exploring forms of open learning and collaborative
learning in both formal and informal education contexts, as well as
the use of peer reviewing and strategies and methods to ensure (and
aiming at certifying) that such use guarantees a proper and fair
assessment;

2. RESEARCH, by aiming at
* establishing open research projects as “cauldrons” of open data,
  open knowledge and collaborative development, as well as devising
  methodologies and tools for the management and assessment of such
  projects;
* defining open peer-review methodologies for the assessment of
  research outputs and appropriate bibliometrics based on the
  community open feedback rather than on a questionable analysis of
  citations;
* defining, more specifically, quality metrics and a formal process to
  certify open source software (OSS) products and the outcomes of
  other peer-production efforts.

3. TECHNOLOGY, on the one hand by fostering and exploiting open
communities to make new technologies globally available and accepted
and, on the other hand, to support such communities in the production
process and to certify the information and data produced or made
publicly available by such communities, especially in the case of
advices provided by thematic communities and user/consumer
support/review communities.

In the context of FM, OpenCERT 2019 will propose thematic aspects
related to the area of Formal Methods

1. EDUCATION: open and collaborative approaches in Formal Methods
education;
2. RESEARCH: open community research in Formal Methods, formal
modelling of learning and collaboration
3. TECHNOLOGY, integrating Formal Methods technologies and tools
within OSS projects as a means for Formal Methods acceptance and
diffusion;

but still accepting submissions outside these aspects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors are invited to submit, via Easychair, research contributions
or experience reports.

All papers should be written in English and prepared using the
specific LNCS templates available at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

There are nine categories of submissions

RESEARCH PAPERS to present original research and the analysis,
interpretation and validation of the research findings.

POSITION PAPERS to present innovative, arguable ideas, opinions or
frameworks which are likely to foster discussion at the workshop.

PROJECT PAPERS to describe a new open community project (e.g. on a
hosting provider or a dedicated portal) or a new research project, or
the status of an ongoing project or the outcomes of a recently
completed project.

SURVEY PAPERS to collect previously published studies on topics
related to the workshop and analyse them in the context of open
communities.

CASES STUDY PAPERS to report on case studies, preferably in a
real-world setting.

TOOL PAPERS to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel
extensions to an existing tool aiming at supporting open community
approaches, or the use/customisation of an existing tool in the
context of open communities.

TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS to demonstrate the tool workflow(s) and
human interaction aspects, and evaluate the overall role of the tool
in supporting open community approaches.

TEACHING EXPERIENCE PEPERS to report on teaching experiences using an
open community approach in a formal education context (e.g. by
university students) or in informal education.

LEARNING EXPERIENCE PAPERS to report on a learning experience within
an open community in a formal education context (e.g. by university
students) or in informal education.

Contributions will be in the form of

* FULL PAPERS between 12 and 15 pages for submission (and between 12
  and 16 pages for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* SHORT PAPERS between 6 and 8 pages for submission.
* PRESENTATIONS extended abstract up to 4 pages, which will be
  included in the pre-proceeding but not published in the
  post-proceedings.

"Short papers" and "Presentations" can discuss new ideas which are at
an early stage of development and which have not yet been thoroughly
evaluated.

The program committee may reject papers that are outside these lengths
on the grounds of length alone.

Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness,
originality and relevance. All submitted papers will be posted on
GitHub at

	https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/

and the review process will be carried out as an interactive, open
discussion between the authors and the reviewers. Final decisions
about acceptance/rejection of papers will be made through a closed
discussion among the PC members.  Notification and reviews will be
communicated via email.  Accepted papers will be included in the
workshop programme and will appear in the workshop pre-proceedings.
Pre-proceedings will be available online before the Workshop.
