Theme
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

One of the main issues behind many failing systems is the ad-hoc
verification approach that involves a variety of formalism and techniques
for the modeling and analysis of various components of the present-age
(cyber)-physical systems. For example, control and communication protocols
are usually modeled using automata theory, and thus analyzed using model
checking techniques, while the modeling of physical aspects often require
multivariate calculus foundations, which are in turn analyzed using
paper-and-pencil based analytical proofs, simulation or theorem proving.
The fundamental differences between these modeling and analysis techniques
limit us to analyze the whole system as one unit and thus miss many corner
cases, which arise due to the operation of all the sub-components of the
system together. One of the major concerns is that, despite the
above-mentioned evident limitation in the analysis methods, many
safety-critical systems, such as aerospace, smart-transportation,
smart-grid and e-health, are increasingly involving physical elements.
Moreover, we are moving towards integrating more complex physical elements
in our engineering systems. For example, we are moving towards Quantum
Computers to meet the high-performance needs. Similarly, phonic components
are increasingly being advocated and used in aerospace applications due to
their lightweight and temperature independence compared to traditional
electronics-based components. Finally, the impact of physical components is
relevant to both the safety and security of the overall system. For
example, a malfunction in sensor measurement may lead to safety issues
whereas sophisticated physics based side-channel (e.g., power and acoustic
measurements) attacks lead to the security violation of the underlying
system.

The objective of the workshop is to gather scientists and engineers
interested in formal verification techniques for the modeling, analysis,
and verification of safety and security critical physical systems. We
encourage submissions on interdisciplinary approaches that bring together
formal methods and techniques from other knowledge areas such as quantum
computing, control theory, biology, optimization theory, and artificial
intelligence.

Submission
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Authors should prepare their papers in one column style of CEUR-WS. There
are two categories of submissions:
Regular papers describing developed work with theoretical or experimental
results (upto 15 pages)
Short papers on experience reports, tools or work in progress with
preliminary results or just new ideas for discussion (upto 6 pages)


Electronic submission is done through EasyChair. The submissions will be
reviewed by at least three PC members. At least one author of each accepted
paper is expected to attend FVPS and presents her/his paper.

The authors of the best papers will be invited to submit extended versions
to a special issue of a Formal Methods/CPS Journal.
