FroCoS 2019

The 12th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems

London, UK, September 4-6, 2019

Website: https://www.frocos2019.org

Contact: chair@frocos2019.org


Due to requests from potential authors and from current authors wishing to =
polish their papers, we have extended the submission deadlines. The new dea=
dlines are:


1 May 2019 (abstract), 8 May 2019 (paper)


Authors who have a good paper and are in doubt whether to send it to FroCoS=
 may note some highlights of this year's edition: two affiliated workshops,=
 two affiliated tutorials, a financially supported best paper award, five o=
utstanding invited speakers (to be announced soon) and some support for you=
ng researchers traveling to the conference (including widely available chea=
p accommodation). We hope to see many of you this September in London -- in=
 the beautiful campus of the Middlesex University, located 40 minutes from =
the city center and 20 minutes from Camden Town's iconic music venues!


GENERAL INFORMATION

The 12th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS =
2019) will take place in London. It will be hosted by the Department of Com=
puter Science at the Middlesex University London, from 4 to 6 September 201=
9.

FroCoS is the main international event for research on the development of t=
echniques and methods for the combination and integration of formal systems=
, their modularization and analysis. The first FroCoS symposium was held in=
 Munich, Germany, in 1996. Initially held every two years, since 2004 it ha=
s been organized annually with alternate years forming part of IJCAR. If we=
 also count the IJCAR editions, this year FroCoS celebrates its 20th editio=
n.

FroCoS 2019 will be co-located with the 28th International Conference on Au=
tomated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2019=
). The two conferences will provide a rich programme of workshops, tutorial=
s, invited talks, paper presentations and system descriptions.


SCOPE OF CONFERENCE

In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation, program d=
evelopment and verification, artificial intelligence, knowledge representat=
ion, and automated reasoning, there is an obvious need for using specialize=
d formalisms and inference systems for selected tasks. To be usable in prac=
tice, these specialized systems must be combined with each other and integr=
ated into general purpose systems. This has led to the development of techn=
iques and methods for the combination and integration of dedicated formal s=
ystems, as well as for their modularization and analysis.

FroCoS traditionally focuses on these types of research questions and activ=
ities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2019 seeks to offer a common forum for=
 research in the general area of combination, modularization, and integrati=
on of systems, with emphasis on logic-based methods and their practical use.

Topics of interest for FroCoS 2019 include (but are not restricted to):

   * combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order, temporal, m=
odal, description or other non-classical logics)

   * combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving

   * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability procedures, constra=
int solving techniques, or logical frameworks

   * combination of logics with probability and/or fuzzy measures

   * combinations and modularity in ontologies

   * integration of equational and other theories into deductive systems

   * hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint propagation

   * hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural language semant=
ics

   * combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems

   * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and specificati=
ons

   * integration of data structures into constraint logic programming and d=
eduction

   * combinations and modularity in term rewriting

   * methods and techniques for the verification and analysis of informatio=
n systems

   * methods and techniques for combining logical reasoning with machine le=
arning


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing original wo=
rk, written in English, not overlapping with published or simultaneously su=
bmitted work to a journal or conference with archival proceedings. Selectio=
n criteria include accuracy and originality of ideas, clarity and significa=
nce of results, and quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNC=
S style is 16 pages in total, including references and figures.

Any additional material (going beyond the page limit) can be included in a =
clearly marked appendix. This appendix will be read at the discretion of th=
e committee, and must be removed for the camera-ready version.

Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submitted =
electronically as PDF files via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferen=
ces/?conf=3Dfrocos2019

For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to attend =
the conference and present the work. Prospective authors must register a ti=
tle and an abstract three days before the paper submission deadline.

Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at http://=
www.springer.com/br/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines


IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission: 1 May 2019

Paper submission: 8 May 2019

Notification of paper decisions: 6 Jun 2019

Camera-ready papers due: 1 Jul 2019

FroCoS conference: 4-6 Sep 2019


PUBLICATION DETAILS

The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture=
 Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS).


BEST PAPER AWARD

The program committee will select the FroCoS 2019 Best Paper, which will be=
 awarded 500 Euros. The award will be presented at the conference.


SUPPORT FOR STUDENT AND YOUNG RESEARCHER PARTICIPATION

We have some limited funding for supporting students and young researchers =
traveling to the conference -- courtesy of direct sponsorship from Amazon a=
nd Springer and indirect sponsorship from the Association for Symbolic Logi=
c. In addition, some funding will be available through the EUTypes COST act=
ion website. In all cases, authors of accepted papers will be given precede=
nce. Please see the conference website for more details.

In addition, the Middlesex University is offering accommodation at a =A330 =
daily rate in some excellently maintained shared flats located close to the=
 conference venue (https://www.mdx.ac.uk/student-life/accommodation/platt-h=
all).

<p>Due to requests from potential authors and from current authors wishing =
to polish their papers, we have extended the submission deadlines. The new =
deadlines are:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>1 May 2019 (abstract), 8 May 2019 (paper)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Authors who have a good paper and are in doubt whether to send it to Fro=
CoS may note some highlights of this year's edition: two affiliated worksho=
ps, two affiliated tutorials, a financially supported best paper award, fiv=
e outstanding invited speakers (to
 be announced soon) and some support for young researchers traveling to the=
 conference (including widely available cheap accommodation). We hope to se=
e many of you this September in London -- in the beautiful campus of the Mi=
ddlesex University, located 40 minutes
 from the city center and 20 minutes from Camden Town's iconic music venues=

</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The 12th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroC=
oS 2019) will take place in London. It will be hosted by the Department of =
Computer Science at the Middlesex University London, from 4 to 6 September =
2019.</p>
<p>FroCoS is the main international event for research on the development o=
f techniques and methods for the combination and integration of formal syst=
ems, their modularization and analysis. The first FroCoS symposium was held=
 in Munich, Germany, in 1996. Initially
 held every two years, since 2004 it has been organized annually with alter=
nate years forming part of IJCAR. If we also count the IJCAR editions, this=
 year FroCoS celebrates its 20th edition.</p>
<p>FroCoS 2019 will be co-located with the 28th International Conference on=
 Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2=
019). The two conferences will provide a rich programme of workshops, tutor=
ials, invited talks, paper presentations
 and system descriptions.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE&nbsp;</p>
<p>In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation, progra=
m development and verification, artificial intelligence, knowledge represen=
tation, and automated reasoning, there is an obvious need for using special=
ized formalisms and inference systems
 for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized systems mu=
st be combined with each other and integrated into general purpose systems.=
 This has led to the development of techniques and methods for the combinat=
ion and integration of dedicated
 formal systems, as well as for their modularization and analysis.</p>
<p>FroCoS traditionally focuses on these types of research questions and ac=
tivities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2019 seeks to offer a common forum =
for research in the general area of combination, modularization, and integr=
ation of systems, with emphasis
 on logic-based methods and their practical use.</p>
<p>Topics of interest for FroCoS 2019 include (but are not restricted to):&=
nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order=
, temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics)<span class=3D=
"Apple-tab-span" style=3D"white-space:pre">
</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solvin=
g &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combination of decision procedures, satisfiability proced=
ures, constraint solving techniques, or logical frameworks</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combination of logics with probability and/or fuzzy measu=
res &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combinations and modularity in ontologies</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* integration of equational and other theories into deducti=
ve systems</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint p=
ropagation</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural la=
nguage semantics</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems</=
p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs an=
d specifications</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* integration of data structures into constraint logic prog=
ramming and deduction</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* combinations and modularity in term rewriting</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* methods and techniques for the verification and analysis =
of information systems</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;* methods and techniques for combining logical reasoning wi=
th machine learning</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing original=
 work, written in English, not overlapping with published or simultaneously=
 submitted work to a journal or conference with archival proceedings. Selec=
tion criteria include accuracy and
 originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and quality of =
presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 16 pages in total, i=
ncluding references and figures.</p>
<p>Any additional material (going beyond the page limit) can be included in=
 a clearly marked appendix. This appendix will be read at the discretion of=
 the committee, and must be removed for the camera-ready version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submitt=
ed electronically as PDF files via EasyChair at
<a href=3D"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfrocos2019" class=3D"O=
WAAutoLink" id=3D"LPlnk780206" previewremoved=3D"true">
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfrocos2019</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to atte=
nd the conference and present the work. Prospective authors must register a=
 title and an abstract three days before the paper submission deadline.&nbs=
p;</p>
