TABLEAUX 2019
The 28th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tabl=
eaux and Related Methods
London, UK, September 3-5, 2019
Website: https://www.tableaux2019.org
Contact: chair@tableaux2019.org

Due to requests from potential authors and from current authors wishing to =
polish their papers, we have extended the submission deadlines. The new dea=
dlines are:

1 May 2019 (abstract), 8 May 2019 (paper)

Authors who have a good paper and are in doubt whether to send it to TABLEA=
UX may note some highlights of this year's edition: two affiliated workshop=
s, two affiliated tutorials, a financially supported best paper award for y=
oung researchers, five outstanding invited speakers (to be announced soon) =
and some support for young researchers traveling to the conference (includi=
ng widely available cheap accommodation). We hope to see many of you this S=
eptember in London -- in the beautiful campus of the Middlesex University, =
located 40 minutes from the city center and 20 minutes from Camden Town's i=
conic music venues!

GENERAL INFORMATION
The 28th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tabl=
eaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2019) will take place in London. It will=
 be hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the Middlesex Universit=
y London, on 3-5 September 2019.
TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research on all aspe=
cts -- theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems developm=
ent and applications -- of the mechanization of tableaux-based reasoning an=
d related methods is presented. The first TABLEAUX conference was held in L=
autenbach near Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1992. Since then it has been organize=
d on an annual basis; in 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and=
 2018 as a constituent of IJCAR.
TABLEAUX 2019 will be co-located with the 12th International Symposium on F=
rontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2019). The conferences will provide a=
 rich programme of workshops, tutorials, invited talks, paper presentations=
 and system descriptions.

SCOPE OF CONFERENCE
Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for automated =
reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical logic, and a large nu=
mber of non-classical logics. For many logics, tableau methods can be gener=
ated automatically. Areas of application include verification of software a=
nd computer systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its =
required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
   * tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics (including firs=
t-order, higher-order, modal, temporal, description, hybrid, intuitionistic=
, substructural, fuzzy, relevance and non-monotonic logics) and their proof=
-theoretic foundations;
   * sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for classical and non-cl=
assical logics, as tools for proof search and proof representation;
   * related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking, connection me=
thods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);
   * flexible, easily extendable, light-weight methods for theorem proving;=
 novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification in classical a=
nd non-classical logics;
   * systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and application=
s (provers, proof assistants, logical frameworks, model checkers, etc.);
   * implementation techniques (data structures, efficient algorithms, perf=
ormance measurement, extensibility, etc.);
   * extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven learning;
   * techniques for proof generation and compact (or humanly readable) proo=
f representation;
   * theoretical and practical aspects of decision procedures;
   * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software developme=
nt, verification, deductive and temporal databases, knowledge representatio=
n, ontologies, fault diagnosis or teaching.
We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau procedures to rea=
l-world examples. Such papers should be tailored to the tableau community a=
nd should focus on the role of reasoning and on logical aspects of the solu=
tion.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Submissions are invited in three categories:
(A) research papers reporting original theoretical research or applications=
, with length up to 15 pages excluding references;
(B) system descriptions, with length up to 9 pages excluding references;
(C) position papers and brief reports on work in progress, with length up t=
o 9 pages excluding references.
Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of external =
reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance and originality. Any =
additional material (going beyond the page limit) can be included in a clea=
rly marked appendix, which will be read at the discretion of the committee =
and must be removed for the camera-ready version.
For category A submissions, the reported results must be original and not s=
ubmitted for publication elsewhere. For category B submissions, a working i=
mplementation must be accessible via the internet. Authors are encouraged t=
o publish the implementation under an open source license. The aim of a sys=
tem description is to make the system available in such a way that people c=
an use it, understand it, and build on it. Accepted papers in categories A =
and B will be published in the conference proceedings. Accepted papers in c=
ategory C will be published as a Technical Report of the Middlesex Universi=
ty London.
Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submitted =
electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system: http://easychair.org/=
conferences/?conf=3Dtableaux2019
For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend the confe=
rence and present the paper. A title and a short abstract of about 100 word=
s must be submitted before the paper submission deadline. Formatting instru=
ctions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at http://www.springer.com/=
br/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines

IMPORTANT DATES
Abstract submission: 1 May 2019
Paper submission: 8 May 2019
Notification of paper decisions: 6 Jun 2019
Camera-ready papers due: 1 Jul 2019
TABLEAUX conference: 3-5 Sep 2019

PUBLICATION DETAILS
The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer series Lecture=
 Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS).

BEST PAPER AWARDS
The program committee will select (1) the TABLEAUX 2019 Best Paper and (2) =
the TABLEAUX 2019 Best Paper by a Junior Researcher, of which the latter wi=
ll be supported by 500 Euros. Researchers will be considered junior if eith=
er they are students or their PhD degree date is less than two years from t=
he first day of the meeting. "Paper by a Junior Researcher" means that the =
paper's main author(s) is/are junior; this information should be indicated =
by adding a star (*) at the submission's title and at the submission's juni=
or author(s) name(s). The two awards will be presented at the conference.

SUPPORT FOR STUDENT AND YOUNG RESEARCHER PARTICIPATION
We have some limited funding for supporting students and young researchers =
traveling to the conference -- courtesy of direct sponsorship from Amazon a=
nd Springer and indirect sponsorship from the Association for Symbolic Logi=
c. In addition, some funding will be available through the EUTypes COST act=
ion website. In all cases, authors of accepted papers will be given precede=
nce. Please see the conference website for more details.
In addition, the Middlesex University is offering accommodation at a =A330 =
daily rate in some excellently maintained shared flats located close to the=
 conference venue (https://www.mdx.ac.uk/student-life/accommodation/platt-h=
all).

</div>
<div>GENERAL INFORMATION</div>
<div>The 28th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic=
 Tableaux and Related Methods (TABLEAUX 2019) will take place in London. It=
 will be hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the Middlesex Univ=
ersity London, on 3-5 September
 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research on all=
 aspects -- theoretical foundations, implementation techniques, systems dev=
elopment and applications -- of the mechanization of tableaux-based reasoni=
ng and related methods is presented.
 The first TABLEAUX conference was held in Lautenbach near Karlsruhe, Germa=
ny, in 1992. Since then it has been organized on an annual basis; in 2001, =
2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 as a constituent of IJCAR=
.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>TABLEAUX 2019 will be co-located with the 12th International Symposium=
 on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2019). The conferences will prov=
ide a rich programme of workshops, tutorials, invited talks, paper presenta=
tions and system descriptions.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>SCOPE OF CONFERENCE&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for autom=
ated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical logic, and a lar=
ge number of non-classical logics. For many logics, tableau methods can be =
generated automatically. Areas of
 application include verification of software and computer systems, deducti=
ve databases, knowledge representation and its required inference engines, =
teaching, and system diagnosis.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:&nbsp; &nbsp;<span s=
tyle=3D"white-space:pre">
</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics =
(including first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal, description, hybrid,=
 intuitionistic, substructural, fuzzy, relevance and non-monotonic logics) =
and their proof-theoretic foundations;
<span style=3D"white-space:pre"></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for class=
ical and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and proof represen=
tation;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking=
, connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* flexible, easily extendable, light-weight methods for t=
heorem proving; novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification=
 in classical and non-classical logics;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations =
and applications (provers, proof assistants, logical frameworks, model chec=
kers, etc.);&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* implementation techniques (data structures, efficient a=
lgorithms, performance measurement, extensibility, etc.);&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven l=
earning;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* techniques for proof generation and compact (or humanly=
 readable) proof representation;
<span style=3D"white-space:pre"></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* theoretical and practical aspects of decision procedure=
s;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;* applications of automated deduction to mathematics, sof=
tware development, verification, deductive and temporal databases, knowledg=
e representation, ontologies, fault diagnosis or teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau procedures t=
o real-world examples. Such papers should be tailored to the tableau commun=
ity and should focus on the role of reasoning and on logical aspects of the=
 solution.<span style=3D"white-space:pre">
</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Submissions are invited in three categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>(A) research papers reporting original theoretical research or applica=
tions, with length up to 15 pages excluding references;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<=
/div>
<div>(B) system descriptions, with length up to 9 pages excluding reference=
s;&nbsp;</div>
<div>(C) position papers and brief reports on work in progress, with length=
 up to 9 pages excluding references.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of exte=
rnal reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance and originality.=
 Any additional material (going beyond the page limit) can be included in a=
 clearly marked appendix, which
 will be read at the discretion of the committee and must be removed for th=
e camera-ready version.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>For category A submissions, the reported results must be original and =
not submitted for publication elsewhere. For category B submissions, a work=
ing implementation must be accessible via the internet. Authors are encoura=
ged to publish the implementation
 under an open source license. The aim of a system description is to make t=
he system available in such a way that people can use it, understand it, an=
d build on it. Accepted papers in categories A and B will be published in t=
he conference proceedings. Accepted
 papers in category C will be published as a Technical Report of the Middle=
sex University London.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be submi=
tted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system:
<a href=3D"http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtableaux2019" class=3D"=
OWAAutoLink" id=3D"LPlnk689514" previewremoved=3D"true">
http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtableaux2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend the =
conference and present the paper. A title and a short abstract of about 100=
 words must be submitted before the paper submission deadline. Formatting i=
nstructions and the LNCS style files
 can be obtained at http://www.springer.com/br/computer-science/lncs/confer=
ence-proceedings-guidelines</div>

</div>
<div>BEST PAPER AWARDS&nbsp;</div>
<div>The program committee will select (1) the TABLEAUX 2019 Best Paper and=
 (2) the TABLEAUX 2019 Best Paper by a Junior Researcher, of which the latt=
er will be supported by 500 Euros. Researchers will be considered junior if=
 either they are students or their
 PhD degree date is less than two years from the first day of the meeting. =
&quot;Paper by a Junior Researcher&quot; means that the paper's main author=
(s) is/are junior; this information should be indicated by adding a star (*=
) at the submission's title and at the submission's
 junior author(s) name(s). The two awards will be presented at the conferen=
ce.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>SUPPORT FOR STUDENT AND YOUNG RESEARCHER PARTICIPATION</div>
<div>We have some limited funding for supporting students and young researc=
hers traveling to the conference -- courtesy of direct sponsorship from Ama=
zon and Springer and indirect sponsorship from the Association for Symbolic=
 Logic. In addition, some funding
 will be available through the EUTypes COST action website. In all cases, a=
uthors of accepted papers will be given precedence. Please see the conferen=
ce website for more details.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In addition, the Middlesex University is offering accommodation at a =
=A330 daily rate in some excellently maintained shared flats located close =
to the conference venue (https://www.mdx.ac.uk/student-life/accommodation/p=
