Autonomous systems have been increasingly deployed in safety and
mission-critical application. For example, future autonomous cars are ready
to hit the public roads in a few years. Due to a direct impact on
human-lives, their functional safety, security, and dependability are
important for both general public and Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEMs). Formal Methods techniques have the potential to address some of the
most important verification and dependability challenges associated with
such autonomous systems. Indeed,  industrial standards, such as ISO 26262,
ISO 61508, IEC 62304, EN 50128  explicitly recommend the use of formal
methods in the design and development of autonomous systems. The main
purpose of this workshop is to bring together people from both industry and
academia and serve as a forum to discuss practical applications of formal
methods. Moreover, we believe this workshop will help to discuss the
readiness of formal methods in industrial applications by discussing the
needs of autonomous systems industry and challenges faced by formal methods
researchers.

The focus of the workshop will be on formal verification techniques for the
modeling, analysis, and verification of safety and security critical
autonomous systems. We encourage submissions on interdisciplinary
approaches that bring together various formal methods and techniques such
as model checking, runtime verification and theorem proving.
