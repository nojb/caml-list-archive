John,

Is there a push to get some of that stuff pushed into the
standard library?

I keep on finding things that I want to do again and again,
which should be in the standard library but which seem to
be missing. A couple of examples I have found are:

  - a function to find the intersection of two lists
  - a function to remove duplicate entries in a list

I found the first as part of the MetaPRL project and wrote
the second myself, but both operations are so common they
should be part of the standard library.

In the spirit of John's post, is there any thing I can do
to help push functionality into the standard library?

Cheers,
Erik
