Ahh, that is not why I am here.

I am here because programming is fun and exciting.  I am here because I 
like to try new or different things.  I like to open my mind to ideas I 
haven't heard before, to concepts that are new to me.  OCaml has more 
of that than any other language I've learned in a long time, even 
though I do have experience with functional, imperative, and OO 
languages.  I am still trying to consider all the possibilities that 
camlp4 opens up, and that's just one aspect of it.  The native code 
compilation means that, with a shell on an ARM machine, I can compile 
OCaml code to run on my Zaurus without the need for a large runtime 
environment.  The bytecode compilation means that I can take this stuff 
I compiled on Linux and run it on AIX.

Yes, there is pain everywhere.  I've never been one to shy away from the 
"all foo sucks, but foo x sucks less" [1].

But if you hate programming, then stop doing it.  Find something you 
enjoy.

I'd much rather use a keyboard to tell the computer what to do than have 
to listen to the conversations of everyone else with their computers.

Besides, written communication has been around for a very long time, 
too.  It predates the invention of the digital computer by, oh, several 
millennia.  I think it's quite false to complain that using written 
communication is somehow forcing humans to work like computers.

Then SOLVE IT ALREADY.
