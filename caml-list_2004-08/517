I already explained why I'm stuck with Windows.

But to offer a different philosophical take: Linux is boring too.
*Programming* is boring.  I only care about the artistic results, the
games I could make via programming.  I'm interested in tools that make
it all less painful.  Emphasis on *less* painful.  There's still plenty
of pain to be had from OCaml, same as any current programming language.
Nobody has written the UberLanguage yet.  I'm not even sure the paradigm
of 'written computer language' is what we need.  I think we need voice
driven programming and a biological model of software grafting.  In
other words, computers need to work like we do.

So, to me that's a problem to be solved.

Would be plenty happy to discuss it on ocaml-biz.
