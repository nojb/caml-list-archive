As you've obviously noticed from the responses to the post, nobody here 
seems to want to ever touch Windows if they can possibly avoid it.  And 
I don't blame them.  The whole platform is a mess, and programming 
there is even more of a mess, and if you do it the "normal" way, it's 
also incredibly expensive:

Windows XP Pro Retail                  $194  (newegg.com)
Visual Studio                         $1645  (buy.com)
------------------------------------- ------------------
Total cost                            $1839

1 CD-R to burn a Debian ISO           $0.30 or less

Why should I pay so much for the privilege of developing on a platform I 
hate?

Well then, show me the code.

I am tired of you complaining about this or that feature that nobody 
wants, demanding people write it because the gaming marketplace wants 
it, and doing nothing at all to address it.  This is not the only place 
you've been doing that.

Now, I have complained here on several occasions about the size of the 
standard OCaml library compared to that of, say, Python.  But I'm doing 
something about it.  (http://quux.org/devel/missinglib)

This list is not your pro bono private contractor.  Everybody here is 
working on/with OCaml because either 1) they are getting paid to do so, 
or 2) they want to do so.

I seriously doubt that anybody here wants to work with Windows.  So 
unless you come up with some cash or code, shut up already.

OK then.  How about porting whatever it is in OCaml that doesn't work on 
Windows?  Go ahead.  I'm sure if you do a good job of it, people will 
be happy to take your patches.

And oh yes, that 30-line signature really improved the quality of your 
post...
