I do not know what you are comparing but maybe a custom comparison
function would make things even faster?  As an example,

          min : 'a -> 'a -> 'a
and
          let min' x y = if (x:int) < y then x else y

have (very) different speed characteristics!

Same: why don't you define the meaningful equality?  Sure, you do not
have the convenience of the name "=" but you can use "===", "=^=",
"=~=",...  This probably would also make your software easier to
understand (the "strange" comparison on cyclic structures would be
made explicit).
