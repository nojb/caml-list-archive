Since there is some interest, I have started a yahoo group to manage 
the forum - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml-sig-bayarea/join

The link has also been updated at the Ocaml Alliance Network Wiki. 
My email was already on there. Apparently, Ocaml is not alone in being quick! :)

Please feel free to sign up. Postings are restricted to members only, in 
an attempt to limit spam. Let's see how that works out.

Thanks for tolerating the noise if this was not of interest to you.

regards,
