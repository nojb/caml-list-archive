But who needs the tag bit? Only the garbage collector. Maybe it's
an advantage to see 32 tag bits as a whole, e.g. the question
"does the block contains any pointer" can be calculated bit-parallel.
Anyway the garbage collector could works on blocks and needs 
just one additional memory access per block.
