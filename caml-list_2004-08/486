Hi,
I have a little ocaml app which needs to read/write packets from a
serial device.

The different packet types are originally defined as c structs and i
would like to  be able to read the incoming bytes and convert them
into ocaml records with as much automation as possible.

Is there any way to automate this process? CamlIDL will automate the
process of translating the c structs into ml, which is a first step,
but are there any tools which would allow me to then populate the ml
record from an incoming set of bytes?

Any tips/pointers appreciated!


Henri
