I would be very pleased to see source files or CVS access as soon as 
it's possible.  I may be able to help out on this, and I suspect others

If you publish the source code, I'd be willing to look into it.

I'm also willing to host an Arch or Subversion repository for the 
project if that would be useful for you.  (Arch preferred!)
