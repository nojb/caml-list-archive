That does sound mighty interesting.  FWIW, I just packaged up IKVM for 
Debian.  IKVM is a JVM written in C# that runs under Mono.

I think there is nothing but good that can come out of these things.

One of the classic, common, and often still valid arguments against 
functional languages is that there are far fewer modules available for 
them than for a l
anguage like Perl, Python, or Java.  I'm talking about text-processing, 
network interaction, etc.  OCaml is probably the best out there from 
what I've seen for a functional language, but it still has a ways to go 
to catch up.

Painless integration with other languages means that this problem 
suddenly drops away if you can take the performance hit and one-time 
setup complexity.
