I think you need to consider that the INRIA team's goals
are closer to 'showing it is possible for a well typed
functional language developed using theory to actually
also compile fast code fast' rather than 'taking over
from other industrial languages'.

Ocaml is great for writing language translators.
The *obvious* use for it for a game developer
is to write a game scripting language in it --
rather than try to write games directly in Ocaml.

That way you bypass all the problems, and get to
say how great Ocaml is for writing translators with :)

Oh yeah, did I mention before I've spent 5 years developing
such a tool already .. ?
