Hi Brian,

Yes, that technique is the one that I said previously works just fine. I was
hoping for a higher level generic handler, instead of wrapping each
individual lib call with this try-catch block.

I have been doing C++ to OCaml for years now with no difficulty. The catch
here is that OCaml appears to be interposing between the established higher
level catch handlers and the source of the throw exceptions. It appears to
insist on not allowing any lower dynamic exceptions to propagate above its
interface with a C call.
