Sure, but he chose to do some on Windows. He could have done the same on linux
or some other Oses, like Mac OS X for example, it would even have been less
crowded there, but he chose not to.

Also, i believe that a small Linux Live DVD, with the needed drivers and the
whole game on it would be a rather good devel plateform.
