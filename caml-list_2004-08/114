>From one of the many pendants-R-us discussion forums I'm on, this question 
came up: which is grammatically correct: "a 'a list", or "an 'a list", 
when discussing Ocaml types in english?  Is there a standard (de-facto or 
de-jure) or just whatever sounds right to the ear of the writter?

To the french reading this discussion: please remember that English as a 
language not only borrows words from other languages, it often lures 
unsuspecting languages down dark alleys, hits them over the head with a 
lead pipe, and rifles through their pockets for loose grammar.
