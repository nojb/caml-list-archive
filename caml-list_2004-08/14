One problem with even the simple minded solution of a type of array
without set is that it isn't a covariant container, like a list, and you can't
make it one, even though that should be allowed. That may not bug you, but it
was an annoyance for me when I discovered this. Jacques Garrigue said it was
probably too much work to fix that. Any functional array you build on top of
arrays gets bit by this.
