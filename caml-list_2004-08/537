I think that you might be happier using Clean than OCaml. The Clean team has
inverted priorities (with regards to OSes they support) from the OCaml team.
For them, Windows support and then Mac support are first, and Unix is a second
class citizen. There are even some (very primitive) game libraries for Clean.

I think it's a good thing for OCaml that Unix support comes first, for many
reasons, not the least important of which is that the Unix community does tend
to have more of a programmer oriented, "can do" mindset, IMO. I concur with
everything John Goerzen wrote about programming being (potentially) fun, and
cross compilation as meaning more than Windows (ARM is very interesting to me
lately) as a target. But priorities can differ, and I think with your stated
priorities you may be happier there.
