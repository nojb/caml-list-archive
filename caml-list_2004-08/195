How terribly rude.  I sent you a private mail to avoid spamming the
list with yet more crap, and you forward it back here.  In fact, I'm 
starting to be convinced that you're some kind of surreal troll, given
your stunning lack of ability to shut up and write code.

I took out an amusing five minutes to google for 'brandon j. van every'
to see if I could find any MIT-licensed free code written by you, and
unfortunately failed to come up with a single hit.  It was drowned out
by your numerous posts to various lists asking the same repetetive 
questions so familiar to this list.

My personal highlights from the google results include:

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2003-August/178976.html
http://coding.derkeiler.com/Archive/Lisp/comp.lang.lisp/2004-01/1329.html
http://lists.complete.org/freeciv-dev@freeciv.org/2003/12/msg00471.html.gz

I found reference to the 'free3d' library.  However, it was GPLed
(tsk tsk, how can I make money from it??!) and not available anywhere.

I wonder if this post will get through the filters given its "meta"
nature (some might describe it as "irrelevant").  I hope it doesn't ;-)
