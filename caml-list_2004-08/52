Yes, that's the same problem I'm seeing.  I think it *might* be
possible to get around it by using a connection type with type
parameters.  Maybe.  I'll investigate more in a few hours.

This is an upsetting problem, but I believe that it's known that there
are some drawbacks to mixing classes and functors.  (And, well, if
it's not, it should be now.)  Anyway, we'll see what can be done.

If one of the approaches I'm thinking of would work, it might either
suggest a rather painful (and non-obvious) change to the Dbi API, or
it might be possible to define a functor or simple wrapper to turn a
Dbi module into a Dbi' module that works well for this.

And maybe someone who's done a lot of work with classes and modules
will mention a really nifty solution.  :)

John.
