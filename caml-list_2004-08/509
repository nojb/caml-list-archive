I am using the HOL-light proof verifier which is written in OCaml.

What I would like to do is store the state [to an executable image] so
that I would not have to read in all the initialization files the next
time I run the program. {There used to be a command in Common Lisp "dump"
which would store an executable image to a file that could then be
restarted. My question is: is there something like this in OCaml.}

Thank you.
