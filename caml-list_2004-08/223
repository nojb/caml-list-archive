Conservative GC has the drawback that there *are* pathological cases
where the GC, because of its conservatism, retains memory that could
actually be discarded.  If I remember correctly, the PLT Scheme folks,
who use the BDW conservative gc, apparently ran into this with the web
server that is distributed with DrScheme, and I've seen mention of
other programs that use the BDW gc occasionally running into this
problem.  In these cases it is often possible to tune the program to
eliminate the pathological case, but it's often difficult to figure
out the source of the problem.  Accurate (that is, non-conservative)
gc, of course, does not have this problem.
