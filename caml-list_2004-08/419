It's doable in principle. For example, the old MacScheme compiler used 
parameters to tune compilation on a per-function basis; low optimization 
settings resulted in generation of bytecode; high optimization settings 
resulted in generation of native code. Both types of function could 
coexist in the same runtime, with the different kinds of closures 
represented by different appliable types.

I don't know what implications such a scheme might have for type safety 
in Ocaml.
