OK, ignore my request for further explanation, it all makes good sense now,
even though it was counterintuitive behavior at first. It does suggest that
making a syntactic distinction between type abbreviation and datatype
definition a la SML is a good idea.

I never ran across this behavior before since I assumed the phantom type had to
be abstract and always coded it that way.

All of this phantom type stuff makes me wish we had dependent types anyways...
