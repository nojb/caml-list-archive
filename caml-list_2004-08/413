Hi all,
Here are some explanations on OcamIL.
OcamIL compiles Ocaml programs to verifiable MSIL bytecode.
I  have not advertised at all about it so far because I still consider it is
not mature yet.

Some implementation details:
OcamIL is a modified ocamlopt compiler. Modifications are made as late as
possible in order to achieve maximum compatibility with ocamlc/opt. One big
issue is the compilation of an untyped intermediate language to a typed
runtime.

Two tracks have been followed : 1) type reconstruction and 2) type
propagation
1) The current OcamIL distribution relies on the first approach. It gives
enough good results to allow to bootstrap OCamIL and build an Ocaml
toplevel for .NET. Interoperability with C# has been successfully tested.
2) However, it leads to unadequate data representations that entail poor
performance. I'm currently working on the second approach.
This involves a lot of code restructuration. Source files (as a patch to
ocaml sources) together with a correct license will appear in the next
release (expected late october ?)

About interoperability:
We do not want to add weird FFI features to the Ocaml syntax. We prefer an
IDL approach, inspired by what have been done for Caml and Java by the
OJacare project ( http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~henry/ojacare/index.en.html ).

About mono:
OcamIL is developped and tested on windows, but I'm willing to make it
compatible with Mono.
However, mono still lacks .NET compatibility. OcamIL relies on parts of the
Reflection library that are not available yet.
Moreover, the mono bytecode interpreters behaves strangely: some executables
produced by OcamIL don't run in the bytecode interpreter, but do run when
previously compiled by the mono bytecode-to-nativecode compiler.
Please Mono users wait for the next OcamIL release, which will be announced
on this list.
