Assuming the reader pronounces the 'a as alpha, it would be "an 'a list".
One could also say "a tick-a list" but that would be weird.

Funny that you chose an exception to the rule.  Welcome to English.
"historical" uses an, even though most people pronounce the 'h' as a
constant.  Normally, we would say "a hundred".
