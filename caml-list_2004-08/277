Yes.

Short answer: Mach-O (Darwin/Mac OS X executable file format) sucks 
dead donkey dingos, and you can quote me on that.

Longer answer: apparently the version of O'Caml provided as a Fink 
package was not compiled with the correct link options.

Slightly longer answer still: don't use Fink; it almost always ends up 
costing you more than it buys you. You can build O'Caml, gtk, and 
lablgtk from source. The trick when you build O'Caml, though, will be 
to ensure that the LDFLAGS that the stub libraries get include "-bundle 
- -undefined suppress -flat_namespace". There's actually a good 
discussion of the issues at 
<http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/porting/shared.php?phpLang=en>

Best of luck, and please let me know if you continue to encounter
