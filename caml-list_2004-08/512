There is no such thing. I tried this, using the mingw cross environment in
debian, and altough i was able to build cross gtk+ programs without problem
(well, there where some troubles with fonts, but apart of that it worked
great), my tries to cross-build ocaml failed lamentably.

This would indeed be a great great additional functionality.
