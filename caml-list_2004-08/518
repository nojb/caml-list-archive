If you are talking about http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jrh/hol-light/
then it is written in CamlLight, not Ocaml. HOL-light does not seems
to be actively developped (but I don't know really and may be wrong).
CamlLight is somehow an ancestor of Ocaml, and it is not, as far as I
know, actively worked upon. The Cristal team actively work on Ocaml
and Caml Light is no more developped (but has gotten minor maintanance
fixes sometimes)

Not in Ocaml, and probably not in CamlLight (which I don't know much).

Did you consider using Coq? I don't know much of it, but it is
actively worked on (by the Logical team). Perhaps Coq has some
features you want.

If I understand well the status of HOL-light, it is an unmaintained
software written in a language which is no more developped - this
seems to be two valid reasons to switch to some other prover, like
Coq. See http://coq.inria.fr/

Take everything above with a grain of salt. I don't know really
HOL-light & Caml-light.
