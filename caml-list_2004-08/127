That sounds handy--but the handiest recent new feature for teaching
that I've seen is the stuff with -dtypes in the caml-mode that's
distributed with O'Caml 3.08.  You can hit C-c C-t to get the type of
the expression under point, or middle-click in the emacs buffer to
highlight the entire top-level expression in one color, and highlight
the smallest expression under the mouse in another color, while
displaying the type of that smaller expression in the mode-line. (In
other words, you can drag around with the middle button in a single
top-level expression, displaying the type of what you're hovering
over.)

This works even when a file has not compiled cleanly: the compiler
type annotation file includes all of the types it's figured out up
until the spot where it found a conflict.  And that can be a great
help when trying to figure out why a problem happened.

John.
