my c style is inspired by arthur whitney of kx.com.  he is a genius.  his
language, k, is superquick.  it's an APL dialect.  he's written kdb in k,
and it goes like the clappers.  the most impressive thing is that k comes
in at <100Kb and kdb <50Kb.  he's a genius.

yeah, i'm familiar with the pattern.  basically, i want to write my dbms
core in ocaml -- my only other option at the moment is c. i have to say
that looking at the -S output i am given great hope that ocaml has got
what it takes.  i thought i'd never find a functional language that was
fast, but i always believed it was possible to write a fast compiler for
one!  (i was brought up on miranda and prolog)

the only interface where such amortizing could occur is the API to the
database core, but i want to write the core in ocaml and i think it's
possible (see thread 'what is this magic?')

you mean ocaml is not a suitable language for developing a dbms?

thanks,
