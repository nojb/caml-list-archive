Better interfacing with other Java components.  I know of at least one 
programmer who is currently using Jython, who would love to switch over to 
Ocaml- but can't, because he needs to talk to stuff written in Java.

Wether or not it's a good replacement for the main virtual machine is open 
to debate.  I comment that Jython hasn't become the main Python 
environment either.  But that doesn't mean it's a bad idea.
