I'm mildly surprised I didn't see any announcements of this language here.  
I saw it over on LtU:
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/pes20/acute/
http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/

(Note: I have nothing to do with this project, I just thought it might 
interest people- especially people like me, who are pining the death of 
Jocaml).

I haven't read any of the papers on it yet, so other people's comments and 
opinions are welcomed.
