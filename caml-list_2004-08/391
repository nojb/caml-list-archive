Generative and component approaches have the potential to
revolutionize software development in a similar way as automation and
components revolutionized manufacturing. Generative Programming
(developing programs that synthesize other programs), Component
Engineering (raising the level of modularization and analysis in
application design), and Domain-Specific Languages (elevating program
specifications to compact domain-specific notations that are easier to
write and maintain) are key technologies for automating program
development.

GPCE arose as a joint conference, merging the prior conference on
Generative and Component-Based Software Engineering (GCSE) and the
Workshop on Semantics, Applications, and Implementation of Program
Generation (SAIG). The goal of GPCE is to provide a meeting place for
researchers and practitioners interested in cutting edge approaches to
software development. We aim to foster further cross-fertilization
between the software engineering research community on the one hand,
and the programming languages community on the other, in addition to
supporting the original research goals of both the GCSE and the SAIG
communities. We seek papers both in software engineering and in
programming languages, and especially those that bridge the gap and
are accessible to both communities at the same time.
