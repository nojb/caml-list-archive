The technical program of JELIA'04 includes:

3 invited talks
	-Representing and Reasoning with Preferences by Francesca Rossi
	-Engineering of logics for the content-based representation of information by Franz Baader
	-Formal Methods in Robotics by Bernhard Nebel

52 paper presentations with sessions on
	-Actions and Causation
	-Applications (2 sessions)
	-Belief Revision
	-Complexity Issues
	-Description Logics
	-Logic Programming
	-LPNMR (2 sessions)
	-Modal, Spacial and Temporal Logics
