That is indeed interesting.  It looks like they have a good start.  
Unfortunately, there's one huge problem: there is no source code at 
all.  (Doesn't that violate the OCaml license?)

They are working in a pure Windows environment and have yet to port some 
libraries such as Str and Unix.  These are both things I can help with, 
but without the source code, it's completely useless to me.

Indeed.  (And how well it allows other .NET programs to call OCaml 
code.)
