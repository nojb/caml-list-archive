interesting.  Somehow I managed to edit it poorly, in the file I
copied it from, the original statement is actuallly :

  let w = area#misc#realize () ; area#misc#window

and the next statement is a let, so the ;; is not really needed, I
just like to put them in for clarity.

  Alex> which is the same as

  Alex>  let w = area#misc#realize area#misc#window;;

Neither of the above works properly :

This expression has type Gdk.window = [ `drawable | `gdkwindow ] Gobject.obj
but is here used with type unit

However your response woke up some neurons - why wouldn't it be :

  let w = (area#misc#realize ()); area#misc#window ;;


Which also makes sense, the first statement being called for a
side-effect, and the second is the value for w.

ding-ding-ding we have a winner.  The above _does_ work.
