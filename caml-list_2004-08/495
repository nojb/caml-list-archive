Frankly, there is more to a language than who wins in the "marketplace".
If that is all that matters, we should all just go home now, because
VB, Java, C++, and C# have far more share of the marketplace than Python.

Incidentally, I'm a long-time Python user.  I still use it.  I am moving
towards OCaml, though, and not because of performance.  I'm going to
OCaml because it provides the benefits of a strongly-typed language
without sacrificing the flexibility I love in Python.  In some ways,
thanks to things like camlp4, OCaml is more flexible.  OCaml also is
functional at its heart, something I like.  While Python keeps wishing
it's a functional language, OCaml *is*.

I'd say Python is far better at the latter than some others, such as
Perl.  But yes, OCaml beats it at both.

*cough* Java?  VB?  I think that goes a long way to showing that
performance is not as critical to some as you may think.

I've never said that performance matters to nobody.  I'm just saying
that there are lots of people, myself included, that don't care about it
very much.

I've had this argument with you before on freeciv-dev, and want to just
reiterate this here: in my book, a language doesn't succeed or fail
based on how well it does in "the marketplace".  If we went by that,
we'd conclude that Linux is a failure, Ada is a failure, Prolog, Lisp,
OCaml, Python, Perl, and perhaps C are all failures too.

Yet a strong case could be made for each of those that they're a
success.

Let's keep things in perspective, please.
