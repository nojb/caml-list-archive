To belabor a point: yes, I choose to develop commercial games.  Windows
PCs and consoles are the primary markets for those.  I believe the
choice of problem domain is first, language is second, and OS is third.
If you can get Linux onto 50% of the home users' desktops, great, do so.
I'll give Linux equal attention at that time.  Meanwhile, Microsoft has
95% of the consumer desktop marketshare.  They've got the job done
today, so that's where we play.

I think you're underestimating the number of other resources that need
to be accessed on Windows to ship a high quality commercial title.
Although it may eventually be possible to wrap up such tools under an
OCaml-centric, platform-neutral rubric, that day is not today.  If you
have any serious interest in the problem, please join us on
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocamlgames/ and also look at

I see.  Linux is The One True Operating System [TM].  Ok, we have
intractable world views.  You're a Linux booster, and I don't like any
platform.
