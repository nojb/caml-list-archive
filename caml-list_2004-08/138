I'm intrested as well. And my opinion is that beginner/ignorant questions
should be tolerated as long as they're about games.

Not sure if it's the case, but I think there's a lack of game related
information (from ocamls point of view). Basic things such as structuring
the game core and so on. Would be refreshing to see some topics about this.
