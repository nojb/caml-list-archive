    Bonjour,

Yes, that was the point. The 'unification' question was mostly pure
rhethoric. My actual problem is that I have many parallel
functor/object in my code because I some times need the first, some
times the later - and I never know from the beginning which one I
finally be using.

I am usually scared of using _objects_ even if _objects_ do suit my
needs admirably.
