I'd rather that the Windows-centric guys on the list put their time=20
into good Windows support for Ocaml, rather than continually harping at=20=

people like me, who couldn't give a rat's patootie whether the existing=20=

level of support for Windows improves any time soon.

I haven't ported my Cf library to Windows because I don't have a=20
Windows box and I'm not a Windows developer.  I put forward a call for=20=

Windows-centric guys on this list over a year ago to help me get my=20
library ported and compiling under Microsoft Visual-C with the straight=20=

Windows Ocaml port.  I have had not a single ping on the subject.  It's=20=

like they don't even notice, and frankly=97 it's not like it really bugs=20=

me.  It just tells me that Windows-centric guys don't like my code. =20
That's fine.  I don't like theirs all that much either.

Meanwhile, not a week goes by on this list without some Windows-centric=20=

guy complaining about the vacuum of Windows support for Ocaml.  I'm=20
starting to believe the problem is that Windows-centric guys are lazy=20
bums who whine too much about what other people choose to do with their=20=

time when they should be spending their own time coding on things that=20=

are important to them.
