    Bonjour,

I have been said privately that detecting side-effects may be quite
difficult.

Quid about the work done by Fran=E7ois Pessaux and Xavier Leroy on
type-based analysis of uncaught exceptions (1998) ? Is it planned to
be added to the Caml compiler (I am of course directly interested
because heavy user of exceptions but I don't know how important this
is for typical Caml programs like symbolic computation, etc.)

An other point is that I meant of course compilation-time warnings.

let rec map f =3D function
  | [] -> []
  | head :: tail -> f head :: map f tail

Once a function like [map] is compiled there is no way to know if it
intented to be used in a commutative context or not. What I had in
mind was just propagating a "with-side-effects" tag in the inferred
type (that is more or less the way exceptions are handled in Pessaux
and Leroy's work, isn't it ?)
