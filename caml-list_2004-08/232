Have you tried using a combinatory parser?

Such parsers are usually *MUCH* easier to use, allow much wider choices
of grammar, much better error messages etc, and are usually more than
fast enough.

I don't know what combinator parsers are available for O'Caml, but
Parsec (for Haskell) is pretty sweet.=20


Does anyone know of any good combinator parsing libraries for O'Caml? If
there aren't any then I might be tempted to do one myself (getting sick
of yacc).
