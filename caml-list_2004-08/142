OCaml is a cutting edge language technology in need of more library
support and refinement for practical problems. OCaml Games is for making
game development in OCaml viable, practical, and preferrable to any
other language.

Commercial developers, hobbyists, and newbies are equally encouraged to
subscribe. Posters should discuss OCaml in a Game Development context.
Some topic drift is ok as long as this core concern is returned to.

The group is unmoderated, but people are expected to remain civil and
voluntarily de-escalate conflicts that get out of hand. In the case of a
major meltdown, the Listowner will issue warnings, temporarily moderate
the group, or remove extremely disruptive posters.
