Why is C so much better?  It's actually pretty darn difficult to 
interface to C from a higher-level language.

And (b) is sometimes just NOT an option, either because of time 
constraints or because you don't know what the original code does to 
start with.

That's way too easy: JDBC.  (Not because OcamlDBI sucks but because so 
many databases have JDBC available.)

How about the JavaMail API, which includes nice IMAP support and stuff?
