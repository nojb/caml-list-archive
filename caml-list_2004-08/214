How does the GC of mlton work ? If I understood correctly mlton does
have 32-bit integers so if it has a mark-and-copy family garbage
collector, its tags are kept apart.

ML-Kit has a region garbage collector. It collects static information
by analyzing the source-code at compile time but it is not enough so
it is combined with an other kind of 'dynamically computed' collection
(also by regions if I understood correctly the simple explanations of
the user manual)

Maybe could you find more information (or at least their filling) on
the subject ? (C interface, performances, etc.)
