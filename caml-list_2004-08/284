"Fink is broken, don't use it" is a silly answer.  How about reporting a
bug?  Other than a strange bug that isn't reproduceable, no-one has ever
filed a bug against ocaml, so until this point, I've never had any reason
to think there was something wrong with the fink package.

Actually, the fink script just builds ocaml, and only specifies options
because of the prefix.  If it isn't building correctly on OSX, probably
most people who build it themselves would do it wrong as well.  In this
case, the bug would be against ocaml itself.

But, if it could be fixed, fink allows the package to include patches, at
which point it becomes significantly more helpful than trying to compile it
yourself.
