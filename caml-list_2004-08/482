There is a good reason to be able to choose languages: to access
libraries written for these languages.

It's nice if accessing a library doesn't force to use a particular
language. Especially if we want to access two libraries written for
different languages in the same program.

And especially as most libraries are written for low-level languages
which are not pleasant to write big applications directly in.

* * *

While C and C++ have more important libraries to access, bridging to
other languages can be much easier. It creates another opportunity to
use C/C++ libraries if someone has gone the trouble of wrapping them for
some high level language.

I made a bridge between my language Kogut and Python (quite nice), and
between Kogut and Perl (not nice because the Perl object model is
unusual). This allows to use Gtk+ via PyGTK or Gtk2-Perl without any
Gtk-specific glue on my side. Hello-world-type Gtk+ applications work
in both cases (I haven't tried anything more serious yet).

I will try to make a bridge with OCaml, but I'm not quite sure how it
should look like, because OCaml is statically typed.
