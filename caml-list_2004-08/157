The point is not what I (or whoever) think but what the bayesian
filter does or does not filter. It is _just_ a bayesian filter, not a
semantic based natural language parser.

When I recommend you to make your post more technical it means :

- adding blocks of Caml code in your signature instead of the current
one that just says the Caml filter is a crap (exercice : make a Caml
program that chooses randomly 20 lines of code in the Caml compiler
and adds them to your signature)

- using more specifically Caml oriented words - something like "In the
next Seattle meeting we will discuss how inclusion polymorphism /
functors < add technical content here > can be applied to 3D rendering
for real-time games < add technical content here >"
