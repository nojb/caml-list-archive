Hi,

I recently upgraded to OCaml 3.08, and ran into problems with the
changed implementation of structural equality.  To support NaN, the (=)
operator no longer checks for physical equality or its operands.  This
causes two problems:
  1) Our application runs 9% slower because comparison isn't as
efficient.  When x == y, checking "x = y" takes time proportional to the
size of the structure, instead of constant time.
  2) We've been cheating and using (=) on structures that may be cyclic.
This works fine on earlier versions of ocaml, because the structures
contain a unique identifier as their first field.  But now that
structural equality checks no longer begin with a physical equality
check, we can get an infinite loop.


To work around this, I've been defining
   let (=) x1 x2 : bool =
     (compare x1 x2) = 0
at the start of each file, since the "compare" function still starts
with a physical equality check.  Is there a better way to override a
definition in the Pervasives module?

Also, has there been any discussion of restoring the old meaning of (=)?
I know it breaks NaN, but the performance difference might make this
worthwhile, even if you have no sympathy for those of us who use = on
cyclic structures. :)


Thanks,
Matt
