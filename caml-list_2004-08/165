Hi Daan,

I suspect the wrong "ar" is called.  It should be the "ar" that comes
with Cygwin, and not the one that comes with the standalone Mingw
distribution.  The latter doesn't handle long command lines via
"response files".

More generally, the installation instructions weren't too clear on
this but I tried to clarify them in 3.08: the "mingw" port of OCaml
should be built with Cygwin and the Mingw stuff distributed along with
Cygwin, but not with the standalone Mingw32 distribution.  It's all
very confusing, I know...

Hope this helps,

- Xavier
