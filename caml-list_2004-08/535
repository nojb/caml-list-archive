Just to clarify things, that is what I really would like to see.  One of 
the great things about GCC is that I can set it up to run on nearly any 
adequate host, and generate code for any supported target.  It would be 
really handy to be able to do that with OCaml, too.

And yes, that means compiling windows programs on Linux, like for my 
current DSL compiler project, or compiling Palm apps on Windows, or even 
Windows games on Windows, should I ever want to wade back into that sewer.
