was the C hard to read or the O'Caml?  Any style tips for my caml?

if i write a c extension that mmaps and msyncs then will the vector
element assignment become a call rather than a movb (or movl)?  that is,
is Bigarray a 'special' c extension that ocaml knows how to optimize and
access just like C or is it a c extension that i can model my C extension
code on?

can i specify that an int32 is held in a register or does the compiler do
this?
