Good news.  Yet another way of getting Ocaml on your Windows system.

The ocaml package has been added to the Cygwin distribution.

Objective Caml is a fast modern type-inferring functional
programming language descended from the ML (Meta Language)
family, containing objects, modules, and a high-performance
native-code compiler.  The O'Caml compiler was developed at
INRIA Rocquencourt, projet Cristal.

See <http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/> for more information.

Notes:

- This package includes two compilers: the bytecode compiler and the
  native compiler.  Each compiler also exists in two versions -- bytecode
  and native (i.e., each compiler was built with the bytecode compiler and
  the native compiler, in turn).

- This package also includes all the libraries and packages in
  /usr/lib/ocaml, including "labltk".  You will need to install the tcltk
  package and possibly the X11 packages to use labltk.  The "labltk"
  package wasn't tested on Cygwin, so use at your own risk.

- There may have been a temporary glitch in uploading the packages.  This
  has been fixed on the master site, but some mirrors may have pulled the
  corrupted version of the package in the meantime.  If you're unlucky
  enough to have selected such a mirror, try another mirror.  FWIW,
  mirrors updated at any point after August 31, 14:08 GMT should be fine
  (look at the timestamp on setup.bz2).


To update your installation, click on the "Install Cygwin now" link on the
http://cygwin.com/ web page.  This downloads setup.exe to your system.
Once you've downloaded setup.exe, run it and select "Interpreters" or
"Devel" and then click on the appropriate field until the above announced
version number appears if it is not displayed already.

If you have questions or comments, please send them to the Cygwin mailing
list at:  <cygwin at cygwin dot com>.  I would appreciate it if you would
use this mailing list rather than emailing me directly.  This includes
ideas and comments about the setup utility or Cygwin in general.

If you want to make a point or ask a question, the Cygwin mailing list is
the appropriate place.
