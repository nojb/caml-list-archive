thanks for the sample code, I will review it, tomorrow (or today :-)

yes thats the case. I was wondering if the `(polymorhic) variants would help 
not to have that much types for the variants

yes, nice try :-)

The idea was really funny. I spent too much time for the compiler and too less 
time for a genius ant :-) We send two ants, but the good ideas came 
afterwards, as usual :-) There are still some private ant-contests going on, 
and someone announced a ant which could not be beaten (he said)... 
I'll try to write a ant, just to see what my compiler generates ....

cheers
