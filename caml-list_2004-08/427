There was a link on a Mozilla blog to some new "advanced" VM
being developed by Alice-ML language group.

http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/pipermail/alice-users/2004/000321.html

I hope they are smart enough to use LLVM for a back-end.  Their
VM is supposed to do JIT, and LLVM rocks with that.  Anyway,
maybe worth a look, since it will definitely handle ML constructs,
and I think (?) they want to handle JVM as a subset.

I think that LLVM is also working on a JVM front end (?).  Maybe if
OCaml emitted LLVM, it could interoperate on some level with that,
even though JVM doesn't handle ML constructs, since LLVM would - 
but maybe not, it depends.
