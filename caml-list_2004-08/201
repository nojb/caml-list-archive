My apologies for responding publically when you sent it privately.  I
received your post in the wee hours of the morning and that aspect of it
got lost in the shuffle.  All of my [Caml-list] mail goes into one
folder, whether public or private.  I suppose I could play with the
Outlook 2000 "except if addressed directly to me" option.  Being MS
software I don't know that it'll work though.  :-)  If it doesn't,
sorry, these errors are going to happen sometimes.  Also I don't know
that I really want such e-mail separated out anyways.  On the balance, I
think I'll just try to be more careful, even early in the morning.

In any event, I didn't answer in a rude manner, call something crap,
accuse anyone of sp*m, etc.  I don't have anything to be ashamed of in
how I responded publically.  I am wondering why you choose to respond to
me, either privately or publically?  I am noticing now it's not the 1st
time you've sent me something privately that didn't serve any
demonstrable need.  I'm choosing to ignore a number of aspects of your
public post.  I don't mind giving an apology for things I should, and I
wouldn't want to taint the apology with other issues.

It was never GPLed, it was LGPLed back in the day.

Try http://www.indiegamedesign.com/Free3d_2004.zip
I put it up there several months ago, but I do not announce it at all.
It is old, dead, probably useless code.  But, some student in
comp.graphics.algorithms was interested in it, so I put it up.  With a
MIT license.  If anybody is even mildly curious to see if it runs on a
X11 box, I'd be highly amused.  I gave that kid fair warning about what
it is and isn't.  Some day I suppose I'll have a Linux box again and
then I'll see if any of it runs.
