That is *NOT* what I said.  I didn't imply that the Python or OCaml 
support was not available.  I simply implied that it was not 
*INSTALLED*.

For my purposes, all of the following work fine:

 * kaffe
 * gij
 * gcj

At least two of those should be available for FreeBSD/amd64.

I rarely need Java features newer than 1.1.

You do make a valid point about the availability of JVMs implementing 
Java 1.3 or above.  I am not talking about that, though.

Speak for yourself.  I don't have 20 different machines from all sorts 
of different platforms that I'd like to support.
