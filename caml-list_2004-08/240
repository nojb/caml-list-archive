The issue isn't strictly one of style. You're using an entirely 
context-free parser generator to attempt to parse a grammar that _is 
not_ context free. The joker in this deck is that no non-trivial 
grammar is context-free, so all real-world "context free" grammars use 
some kind of trick to get past it. Hence the effort to turn (1) into 
(k) or, better still, (inf), cf. ANTLR, Spirit, Bison 1.50 or later, or 
Elkhound.

Quite. My advice remains to be to use Elkhound.
