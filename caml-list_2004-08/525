Well, let's look at that, because I believe you are missing the point.

Who ever said that cross-compilation support would only involve running=20
a compiler on x86 Linux to target x86 Windows?  It could involve=20
running a compiler on x86 Linux to target arm Zaurus, or m68k Linux, or=20
x86 FreeBSD, or amd64 Linux.  Or running a compiler on PowerPC NetBSD=20
to target Alpha NetBSD.  Or whatever else.

Believe it or not, this *is* useful.  In some cases, the target platform=20
does not have enough resources to support a development environment=20
(for instance, Arm-based PDAs).  In other cases, the target platform=20
may not be available for the developers.  Or, it may be excruciatingly=20
slow.  Or perhaps it is being bootstrapped and programs are being=20
compiled for it for the first time.  Or perhaps it just sucks to work=20
with (*cough* Windows *cough*).

Why should that make us care?  Why must you persist in measuring the=20
success or failure of everything on pure user count?  I would say that=20
is a pretty damn poor way to measure success, if not a completely=20
stupid one.

In that case, please explain the popularity of Perl, Python, sed, awk,=20
Tcl, and Bourne shell.  All of which have had for a long time, or=20
continue to have, roughly the same level of support for Windows as=20
OCaml does.  Or less.

Actually, I think you'll find most people here *DO* have a=20
platform-neutral "world view".

=46ine, but somebody HAS TO DO THE WORK to port things to such a=20
different, expensive, and problematic platform.  It's a lot easier to=20
port Linux code to FreeBSD than to Windows.  And a lot cheaper.

So you are saying that nobody on Windows is willing to try something=20
new?  That they're only interested in "proven" technologies?  That it's=20
only useful if it's popular?

In that case, you've convinced me to write off the Windows platform for=20
MissingLib.  Thank you.

That's right.  It's accessible EASIER than SF projects are.  It took me=20
about 2 seconds to get to what I'd want and download it.

With SF, it takes a lot longer.  First, I have to hope that SourceForge=20
is up at the time.  Next, I have to find the appropriate project page,=20
click on Files, wait for that to load.  Now, I get to click on a file=20
to download and have yet ANOTHER page to wait to load.  There, I have=20
to select a mirror, and finally I might possibly get a download if that=20
mirror is reachable at the time.

I think that offering a simple tarball with the source is just fine.

Although, according to you, the problem is that Windows people won't use=20
something unless it's already popular.  So it's an insoluble problem=20
for him, isn't it?

> Should I fault you for the public administration of your project?=20

Oh please, tell us what is so wrong with posting the source code easily=20
accessible as a tarball.  Is it that Windows people can't figure out=20
how to use Winzip?
