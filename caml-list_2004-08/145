I am irritated, yet again, that I cannot get my announcement for ML
S*attle to pass the mailserv filters.  Who do I e-mail to do something
about this?  I also want the words "Brand*n" and "S*attle" removed from
the bayesian filter.  They are an unreasonable detriment to my ongoing
organization of OCaml local discussion groups and mailing lists, and
frankly I'm suspicious that someone put them there deliberately.  Either
that or the bayesian filter is stupid enough to assume that any high
volume of posts must by needs be filtered.


Cheers,                         www.indiegamedesign.com
Brand*n Van Every               S*attle, WA

Praise Be to the caml-list Bayesian filter! It blesseth
