Not AFAIK.  However, I'd be willing to give any code in MissingLib to 
INRIA and let them use it under the OCaml copyright for the purposes of 
putting it into the standard library.  MissingLib is designed to "play 
nicely" with the standard library.  As an example, Extlib uses their 
Enum type to handle a lot of things.  MissingLib uses a standard 
Stream.  Less featureful but more compatible with different things.  So 
it should be easy to integrate if anyone is interested.

The feeling I got from some at INRIA, though, was that they are not 
really interested in expanding the standard library too much for 
various reasons.

Both should be fairly easy to accomplish, actually.  If you send me a 
patch, I'd be happy to add it to MissingLib :-)
