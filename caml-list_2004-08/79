I have a large .mdb file, which google tells me is a Microsoft Access
database, which I want to access using ocaml on Unix.  Are there any
helpful tools or libraries?

There is a C package, "mdbtools", that will provide a starting point
if nothing exists in ocaml.

(The file, produced by the state government, used to be published in
a different proprietary format which I had written C tools to read.
I had already considered rewriting my tools, and this is a chance to
write them in ocaml.)
