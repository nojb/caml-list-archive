[I'll try to keep this brief and to-the-point.  Hopefully only very
very occasional messages about this to caml-list should be necessary.]

A group of business users of Objective CAML, including Nicolas
Cannasse and myself, are building a website containing resources for
the promotion of the language to business users.  The website is here,
and we would welcome contributions:

http://wiki.cocan.org/

In particular, if you are a programmer or consultant who would like to
offer your services to businesses within your area, we would
appreciate you adding a note here:

http://wiki.cocan.org/people

If you are a company which uses Objective CAML, and you don't mind
other local businesses contacting you, please add a note here:

http://wiki.cocan.org/companies

If you are in / run a user group, then add a note here:

http://wiki.cocan.org/user_groups

If you'd like to know more about our objectives for OCaml in business,
then you can read about them here:
