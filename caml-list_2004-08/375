That's easy for a Python programmer to say. However I suggest
you pick some language you don't know and have someone
tell you how it works then look at some code... sure,
you can figure out what it does -- painfully -- but you
can't *see* what it does. Which you can for a language you're
familiar with. I think it's like driving a car. Knowing the 
theory is different to being able to do everything automatically.

I wouldn't want to go thru the agony of CPS transforming
some code to avoid stacks -- only to find the result
just used a list instead :)

Ah no, but it doesn't!  Felix has an explicit yield
operator 'read event', it can only be used in procedures, 
not in  functions.  So functions are stackable, whilst 
procedures are not -- context switching isn't
supported in functional code, only in procedural code.

Perhaps that seems like an onerous restriction,
but it in theory it isn't -- functions aren't
allowed to have side effects.. and reading data
has a definite side effect.
