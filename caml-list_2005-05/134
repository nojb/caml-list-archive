Doesn't look like a beginner question...

Indeed, looking at the sources, .so/.dll is only handled in ocamlc,
not in ocamlopt.
That means that, in ocamlopt, you must either provide a static
library, or use the -cclib option and hope that the system linker does
the right thing. In practice, -cclib ml_scintilla.so should work on
Unix, but the .dll equivalent is not going to work on Windows, as the
linker does not support it.

If by stub you mean the ml_scintilla.lib that the windows librarian
builds for you, then you will need it with ocamlopt (but not with
ocamlc).
Of course in both cases you also need an ocaml specific stub library
to wrap calls.

Except these linking problems, you can assume identical behaviour.
If there are significant discrepancies, please report them.
