You could use the Scintilla (http://www.scintilla.org/) text editing 
component - and the editor based on it, SciTE 
(http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html).

It "understands" OCaml source inasmuch as it can syntax color it... 
combined with the ability [in SciTE] to export to LaTeX (as well as 
HTML, PDF and more), your needs may be met.

Note that the specific colors used for the syntax elements are easily 
adjusted by editing the "caml.properties" file.
