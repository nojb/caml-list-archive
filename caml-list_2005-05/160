CamlTemplate 1.0 has been released.

CamlTemplate is library for generating text from templates in
Objective Caml. It can be used to generate web pages, scripts,
SQL queries, XML documents and other sorts of text.

Features:

   * A versatile, easy-to-learn template syntax that supports
     common scripting-language constructs, while encouraging a
     separation between presentation logic and application
     logic.

   * The supported Caml data structures accomodate lists, tables
     and trees of items in a straightforward manner.

   * Works well with mod_caml and mod_fastcgi.

   * Supports any ASCII-compatible encoding, including UTF-8.

   * Optional support for multithreading.

Changes since the last release:

   * Fixed bug: META always depended on 'threads' even if
     threads weren't enabled. Thread support is now compiled
     into a separate file which can be linked in if needed,
     instead of being enabled when CamlTemplate is compiled
     (thanks to Janne Hellsten).

   * Fixed incorrect interpretation of backslashes.

   * Fixed reading of template files on Cygwin (thanks to Janne
     Hellsten).

   * Fixed incorrect handling of syntax errors in macro call
     arguments.

   * Added a FastCGI example.

CamlTemplate is available via GODI, or from:

http://saucecode.org/camltemplate

Enjoy!
