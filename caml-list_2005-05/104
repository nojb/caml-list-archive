> It is really a nice application, both visually and from an educational
> perspective.  However, it has been written in c# and DirectX, so is
> not available on Unix or MacOSX.  Some port discussions have been
> taking place, but so far nothing concrete has seen the light.  So, if
> some people on this list are in search of a great projet, I think that
> would fit and would also help popularizing OCaml!  The project is also
> technically interesting as it mixes OpenGL, XML, networks,...

> Such a library would already allow many educational tools in addition
