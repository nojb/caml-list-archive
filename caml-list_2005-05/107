                          Call for Papers

                  The 2005 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

                 http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/ml05/

                To be held in conjunction with ICFP 2005
                           September 29, 2005
                            Tallinn, Estonia

The ML family of programming languages, whose dialects include
Standard ML, Objective Caml, Alice and nML, has inspired a tremendous
amount of language research, ranging from type inference to module
systems to operational semantics and implementation. Languages from
the ML family have also been successfully applied in areas ranging
from compilers and theorem provers to low-level system software, web
applications and video games.

The goal of the Workshop is to provide a forum for researchers,
developers, and users to hear about and discuss the latest work on the
use, design, and implementation of ML-like languages.  Previous ML
Workshops have been held in Edinburgh, Pittsburgh, San Francisco,
Orlando and Baltimore.

The 2005 Workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in Tallinn,
Estonia. We seek papers on any ML-related topic, including (but not
limited to):

* applications
* extensions: objects, classes, concurrency, distribution and mobility,
     semi-structured data handling, etc.
* type systems: inference, modules, specification, error reporting, etc.
* implementation: compilers, interpreters, partial evaluators,
     garbage collectors, etc.
* environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers,
     cross-language interoperability, etc.
* semantics

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results, or
informed positions regarding proposals for next-generation ML languages.
In order to encourage lively discussion, submitted papers may describe
work in progress.  Proceedings will be published as a volume of
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS).

Submission Procedure:

Technical summaries, in English and not to exceed 5000 words
(approximately 10 pages), should be submitted via the Web interface
at http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/ml05/ by Friday, June 10, 2005.

Email submissions must be in PDF or Postscript form. The Postscript
should be interpretable by Ghostscript, use standard fonts (or include
the necessary fonts), and print correctly on US letter paper (8.5x11
inches).

All submissions must include a return postal address and an electronic
mail address. Receipt of the submissions will be acknowledged within 2
days.

Notification of the acceptance or rejection of papers will be given by
Friday, July 15, 2005.

Copies of the papers will be distributed at the workshop, then later
published as a volume of the ENTCS series.
