Interesting. But is "input engine" the right term for this? From your 
description and the fact that it works with Egg, I'm guessing it's a 
kanji conversion server, much like Canna or Wnn. By the way, when you 
say it is more accurate than previously used engines, are you referring 
to all of them (including, say, Wnn7) or only the open source ones?

Looks like there's not much in Japanese either ;-) I was thinking I 
might offer to translate the documentation, but I guess I'll have to 
wait a bit for that. Oh, well, it's a new project, so that's okay.

Thanks for doing this!
