You can take a look at it ever at <http://dst.purevoid.org/>.  The Apirl 
27th entry on the main page contains a link to the SVN repository.  I know 
I've been hoping to get a chance to play around with what they've got and 
see if I can't contribute some for a while now -- hopefully life will play 
nice with me in that regard soon.
