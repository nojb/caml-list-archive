The proper use of CAML_DLL, along with your exposition on the
differences between the bytecode and native runtime models was key to
making this all work for me... but it is now.

This is actually funny - about a year and a half ago, when I was first
looking at OCaml, I corresponded with Harry Chomsky and pointed out a
bug in the makefile being distributed with this project - having to do
with [not] defining CAML_DLL! :)

I also contributed a small amount of code to the project, but ended up
not being able to use the "OCaml Win32 API" because of the license. :(
