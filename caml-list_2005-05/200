I wrote a little program to color syntax-highlight LyX files by treating 
anything in typewriter font as code. This has several advantages - no need to 
annotate by hand, code can be extracted and even tested, easy to alter the 
document self-consistently and so on.

I chose to put all code snippets on their own minipage, to help lay them out 
aesthetically. However, LaTeX does a poor job of distributing them on the 
page, so any alterations to the document need to be carefully checked to make 
sure the LaTeX output hasn't become very ugly (e.g. huge gaps).

I think the solution I used works reasonably well but there is plenty of room 
for improvement. Ideally, I'd like to get rid of LaTeX...
