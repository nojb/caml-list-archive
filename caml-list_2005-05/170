Here's a job advert for a functional programmer to work at Credit Suisse
First Boston.  Nowadays, banks are doing lots of interesting things with
computers, and they are pretty knowledgeable about programming languages
too.  This modelling and analytics group, who I know slightly, are
specifically looking for someone who knows functional programming.  It
looks like an interesting job, so I'm taking the liberty of spamming the
Haskell and Caml mailing lists.
