Not a server.  For each Emacs process, Egg spawns a different Mana
process.  Hence I call it an engine.

For input methods, client/server models are out of favor today.
Modern conversion engines (Anthy, Prime) are using the same
configuration as Mana, or completely subsumed to applications (SKK,
Sumibi). The one of the reason for client/server models is resource
sharing.  but Mana mmaps dictonary files, hence large amount of the
memory is shared among Mana processes.

Only the open source ones.  Note my comparison is just an impression.

Thank you for the interest!  Anyone interested in Mana is invited to the
Mana development mailing-list.
