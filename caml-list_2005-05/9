Parsing WSDL means parsing XML Schema, which is not straightforward.
Stefano Zacchiroli and I have written an approximative parser for XML 
Schema (used in CDuce); you could use it as a starting point. I'm 
currently reimplementing such a parser using my OCaml+CDuce extension
as the implementation language, and trying to follow closely the XML 
Schema spec, but I guess you won't want to switch to this experimental 
language just to parse XML Schema.
