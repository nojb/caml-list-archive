I have an implementation for mostly arbitrary feed forward networks in OCaml.
Training can be done with gradient descent (fixed learning rate or
adaptive) and momentum; I have yet to integrate in a second order
optimizer (a wrapper around Nocedal's L-BFGS code), but it should be
straight forward. I haven't really had the need as I'm not working with
neural nets right now. The code is written in an imperative style. I haven't
released the code yet, but can provide it if you're interested.
