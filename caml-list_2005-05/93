It would refuse to parse the type if it noticed that a function was
passed to or returned from a SOAP stub.  I wasn't even aware that you
could pass higher-order functions to SOAP functions - in fact, I don't
even know how that would work with the majority of languages used to
implement SOAP servers (ie. Java and C#) which don't support functions
as first class objects.
