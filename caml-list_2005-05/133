I tried this on the beginners list, but may not have been asking the 
right question(s)... :)

1) Can DLLs appear as input to the ocamlopt compiler like they can 
with ocamlc?  The manual says "yes": "Arguments ending in .o, .a or 
.so (.obj, .lib and .dll under Windows) are assumed to be C object 
files and libraries. They are linked with the program."

I get "ocamlopt.opt: don't know what to do with ml_scintilla.dll."

2) If DLLs can in fact be used with ocamlopt, is the model the same as 
with ocamlc?  In particular,

2a) can I use them *without* stub libraries?

2b) can I in general expect that an app that works well with ocamlc 
and a collection of OCaml cma libs and compiled DLLs (LablGTK and 
associated runtime) will work with ocamlopt - assuming that I generate 
and replace cmo/cma files with cmx/cmxa files?
