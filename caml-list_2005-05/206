That's a good question. Based on the error messages, I presumed not, but 
I didn't specifically ask. But if that file did exist, what on earth 
would it be? As far as I know, there is no such thing as an '.so.cmxa' 
file, nor any reason for it to exist.

Another good question; I'll try to find out.

Hmm ... thank you, but that's a kludge, not a solution. What I would 
really like to find out is whether this error was caused by something 
under my control. If so, I'll fix it; if not, someone needs to report a 
bug to the Mandrake[*] team.

Anyway, thanks for the response.

     always makes me think of apes with purple buttocks.
