                    TYPES Summer School 2005

        Proofs of Programs and Formalisation of Mathematics

              August 15-26 2005, Goteborg, Sweden

       http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/TypesSS05/


During the last ten years major achievements have been made in using
computers for interactive proof developments to produce secure
software and to show interesting mathematical results. Recent major
results are, for instance, the complete formalisation of a proof of
the four colour theorem, and a formalisation of the prime number
theorem. See the following articles in The Economist and Science:

http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3809661
http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/307/5714/1402a

The summer school is a two weeks' course for postgraduate students, 
researchers and industrials who want to learn about interactive proof 
development. The present school follows the format of previous TYPES 
summer school (in Baastad 1993, Giens 1999, Giens 2002).  There will be 
introductory and advanced lectures on lambda calculus, type theory, 
logical frameworks, program extraction, and other topics with relevant
theoretical background.  Several talks will be devoted to
applications.

During these two weeks we will present three proof assistants: Coq,
Isabelle and Agda, which are state-of-the-art interactive theorem
provers.  Participants will get extensive opportunities to use the
systems for developing their own proofs. No previous knowledge of
type theory and lambda calculus is required.

The school is organised by the TYPES working group "Types for Proofs
and Programs", which is a project in the IST (Information Society
Technologies) program of the European Union. A limited number of grants
covering part of travel, fees and ackommodation are available. Neither
participation nor grants are restricted to TYPES participants.
