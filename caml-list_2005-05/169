I have a request for an additional [very helpful] export from 
dlllablgtk2 which I will detail on the LablGTK list... but in terms of 
  discrepancies, I only see a minor one:

I notice that the fonts in the editing widget itself as well as in the 
surrounding menu and status bars appear differently [in native code] 
relative to their appearance in bytecode.

It looks like the same font face and size in each case, but where the 
bytecode version seems to be "bold", the native one looks thin and 
"spidery".  I can supply screenshots, run further tests, whatever 
would be helpful if someone wants to look into this.

I have one more issue which I will bring up in this group, since it 
presumably effects anyone using GTK apps on Windows: what can I do 
about the [gratuitous to me] console window opened with my OCaml/GTK app?

Aside from the philosophical debate about having a "stdout" or not, a 
very large number of Windows app certainly manage without one. :)

Did someone on this or the LablGTK list have a piece of code yielding 
a tiny/invisible console window for GTK apps on Windows?  I thought I 
had seen something like that previously, but my searches are coming up 
empty.
