To make a long story short: I couldn't find a file manager that had just 
the right combination of features, so I created Bantam. It attempts to 
be a fast, light, unobtrusive productivity aid for power users of 
POSIX/X11 systems. Important features include:

  * An arbitrary number of directory views
  * Single-keystroke commands
  * Internal text file viewer
  * Configurable interface to external viewers and editors
  * A minimum of visual clutter (i.e. no icons, etc.)

Bantam 0.1 is now available in source and Linux binary packages. The 
binary should work on any system with Tcl/Tk 8.4 installed. If you have 
any trouble installing or running it, *please* let me know.

The Bantam home page is <http://matt.gushee.net/software/bantam/>.

Enjoy!
