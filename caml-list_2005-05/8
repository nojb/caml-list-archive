I've asked about OCaml and SOAP before on this mailing list and didn't
get a response.  As far as I can find out, there are two
possibilities, but both seem unsuitable.  OCaml-SOAP (from INRIA) -
the home page for this has disappeared in the site redesign.  O'SOAP -
seems to be all about writing command-line clients and attempts no
mapping of data types.

				---

    Is anyone interested in discussing writing a SOAP client
    with me, in pure OCaml, and probably based around ocamlnet
    and/or PXP?

				---

General plan: a tool which could take a WSDL description file and
generate OCaml stubs for functions and datatype conversions.  The
stubs would use PXP to make and parse SOAP XML, and ocamlnet to
dispatch the requests off to the server.

My personal itch is the Google Adwords API
(http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/).

Rich.
