Subject: error using MSVC7.x and OCaml3.07:  entry point must be defined

X-Spam-Level: 

I am compiling a group of C/C++ libraries and compiled Ocaml libraries 
using ocamlopt and the MSVC7.x  tools, including Nmake (Version 
7.00.9466, same as the associated MASM) and CL (version 13.00.9466).  
The Ocamlopt version is 3.07. I am running under WinXP on an AMD Athlon 
processor.

I consistently get the following error message when the final link step 
executes:
"LINK : fatal error LNK1561: entry point must be defined"

I can write a simple .c program and a companion simple .ml program, 
link them together and have the resultant ml-main routine call and 
execute the c program correctly.   So the toolpath appears to work ok 
for simple cases.

I have checked one of the intermediate ASM file results, and I do 
indeed see an "EXTERN _Main__entry: PROC" statement which I would 
assume would be carried through to the final stage of linking.

I would be grateful for any tips or suggestions, particularly if this 
has been seen before, or if some obvious error in approach has been 
taken.

Thanks,

Andy
