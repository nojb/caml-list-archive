Hi all,

I need to extend plexer.ml for my application (I want to add tokens like
"[<", ">]", "[>", "<]" ect), but I'm having trouble to to
compile it outside the ocaml distribution, and how to extend it... 

This is how it's compiled in the ocaml distribution:
../../boot/ocamlrun ../boot/camlp4r -nolib -I ../boot -o plexer.ppo
-verbose plexer.ml

how can I compile it as an object in my tree ?

Do I just need to get plexer.ml or I also need token.ml, stdpp.ml and
friends ?

thanks,
p
