Dear List,
Thanks for all the help with OCamlNet all that while ago!  With this 
help, I have written an alpha of a web-indexing script using FastCGI 
and OCaml.  The script supports file icons, thumbnailing with 
ImageMagick, piles, multiple icon sizes, multiple sorts, and cookies 
for user preferences.

http://capricorn.dnsalias.org/mike/index/

The script uses templates (in the templates folder) to skin the output; 
the "icon", "list" and "piled-list" views are simple examples of those 
templates.  You can download the source at

http://capricorn.dnsalias.org/mike/index/download.tgz

I haven't packaged it yet, so you'll have to edit local.ml to set 
things like your web directory location.  The icons are Apple icons, so 
redistributing them is probably illegal; I'll replace them with KDE 
icons or something in the final version.

Thanks for your help, comments welcome,
Mike
