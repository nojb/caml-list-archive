-- The Haskell Workshop ----------------------------------------------

The Haskell Workshop 2005 is an ACM SIGPLAN sponsored workshop 
affiliated with
the 2005 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP). Previous
Haskell Workshops have been held in La Jolla (1995), Amsterdam (1997), Paris
(1999), Montreal (2000), Firenze (2001), Pittsburgh (2002), Uppsala 
(2003), and
Snowbird (2004).


-- Scope -------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the Haskell Workshop is to discuss experience with 
Haskell, and
future developments for the language.  The scope of the workshop 
includes all
aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, implementation, and
teaching of Haskell. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the
following:

* Language Design,
    with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as 
well as
    critical discussions of the status quo;
* Theory,
    in the form of a formal treatment of the semantics of the present 
language
    or future extensions, type systems, and foundations for program 
analysis and
    transformation;
* Implementations,
    including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic
    compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, 
memory
    management as well as foreign function and component interfaces;
* Tools,
    in the form of profilers, tracers, debuggers, pre-processors, and so 
forth;
* Applications, Practice, and Experience,
    with Haskell for scientific and symbolic computing, database, 
multimedia and
    Web applications, and so forth as well as general experience with 
Haskell in
    education and industry;
* Functional Pearls,
    being elegant, instructive examples of using Haskell.

Papers in the latter two categories need not necessarily report original
research results; they may instead, for example, report practical experience
that will be useful to others, re-usable programming idioms, or elegant 
new ways
of approaching a problem. The key criterion for such a paper is that it 
makes a
contribution from which other practitioners can benefit. It is not 
enough simply
to describe a program!

If there is sufficient demand, we will try to organise a time slot for 
system or
tool demonstrations.  If you are interested in demonstrating a Haskell 
related
tool or application, please send a brief demo proposal to the program chair
(daan@cs.uu.nl).


-- Submissions -------------------------------------------------------

Authors should submit papers in postscript or portable document format 
(pdf),
formatted for A4 paper, to Daan Leijen (daan@cs.uu.nl). The length should be
restricted to 12 pages in standard ACM SIG proceedings format. In 
particular,
LaTeX users should use the most recent sigplan proceedings style 
available from
the Haskell workshop web-site. Furthermore, the "abbrv" style should be 
used for
the bibliography. Accepted papers are published by the ACM and appear in 
the ACM
digital library.

Each paper should explain its contributions in both general and 
technical terms,
clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work. Authors should strive 
to make
the technical content of their papers understandable to a broad audience.
