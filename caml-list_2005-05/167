Thanks for the explanation of the key difference between the models,
Nicolas!

I have this running just fine now, and it is not really as grim as you
make it sound above. :)  Since my DLL really only exists to provide an
interface between OCaml and C-land, I just followed the model used by
LablGTK, and build that interface one of two ways: "dllscintilla.dll"
for bytecode, and "libscintilla.lib" for native.
