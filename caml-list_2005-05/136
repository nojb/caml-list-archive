I had been hoping that the ocamlopt manual was not wrong, and that I 
was just missing something... simple. :)

Actually, it looks like Nicolas brings up a large conceptual 
difference... I was at first tempted to say that his points about 
ocamlrun.dll did not apply to my case, but then I realized that my 
DLL, while primarily concerned with interfacing between OCaml and the 
C-land Scintilla editing widget, does in fact call on the OCaml 
runtime for things like string and tuple allocation.

Put a different way, ml_scintilla.dll definitely has a dependence on 
ocamlrun.dll - which logical need would not go away even if I 
repackaged the DLL as a static lib.

So, where (in both a conceptual as well as linking-specific terms) do 
I find the hooks (caml_alloc_string, caml_alloc_tuple, 
caml_named_value etc) into the OCaml runtime when it is embedded in my 
ocamlopt-generated executable?
