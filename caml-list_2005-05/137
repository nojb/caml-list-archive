Actually the symbols are only imported from ocamlrun.dll if you compile-with
or define the CAML_DLL preprocessor variable.
If you don't have CAML_DLL defined, symbols will be resolved at linking
time, and will then be found in your executable.
So it's possible to have a staticly linked library in both bytecode
(with -custom) and nativecode.

You can have a look at the OCaml Win32 API library Makefile that have
different ways of building and linking it
(http://ocaml-win32.sourceforge.net/).
