Sounds like someone decided to pay for efficiency with uncleanliness.
That is not the only way to pay for things.  One could instead, for
instance, pay with a more difficult implementation.

The old "ah, let the algorithm deal with it!" saw.  Yawn.

Since when are all numeric problems batch problems?  Batching in C is
only practical when problems are simple and highly repetitive.  What a
3D graphics guy often really wants, is the ability to inline a bunch of
function "pipeline" stages into one fairly complicated function.  The
transitions between pipeline stages should all be optimized together.
