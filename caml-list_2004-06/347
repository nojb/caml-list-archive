Try as I might, I cannot get a message about the Seattle ML SIG to go
through.  I am avoiding the use of certain words on the presumption that
I am filtered because of them.  I have two questions:

1) is there any practical way to test the filter's algorithm?

2) can't we have something else, like a "known ok posters" list?

I notice that in the time I've been trying to get a legitimate
announcement through, we've gotten some nudie enhancement product
thingy.  I do not like the algorithm's priorities.  I feel like I'm
spelling out letters to avoid a smart animal hearing them.
