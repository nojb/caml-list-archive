This is because Ocaml isn't a scripting language.  The only reason it does 
as well as it does is because it's a clearly superior language to it's 
competitors- C++, Java, C#, etc.  :-)

I disbeleive that any language can be the one perfect language for all 
tasks.  While I'd like to see a fileutils package and, of course, I'm a 
submitter to extlib, I don't want to see Ocaml start being contorted in 
order to improve it as a scripting language, and thereby making it a less 
usefull applications language.
