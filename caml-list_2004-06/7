Yes, it is looking for an expression:

if true then
  p "yes"
else
  p "no";
p "done";;

You may have meant:

if true then
  p "yes"
else
  begin
    p "no";
    p "done"
  end;;

Yes, it is looking for pattern matches.

try
  p "test"
with
  Not_found ->
    begin
      p "exc";
    end;
    p "done";;

You probably meant:

begin
  try
    p "test"
  with
    Not_found ->
      p "exc";
end;
p "done";;

I got a feeling for how these sorts of things work by looking at the 
indentation style (in emacs). It's fairly obvious that pattern matches 
(including "try ... with ..." as well as just "match ... with ...") need 
either brackets or "begin ... end" to nest them as, without this, the 
compiler couldn't tell which pattern was matching which match.

Cheers,
Jon.
