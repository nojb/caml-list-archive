Sure.  I think it's pretty cool that an application language does
relatively well as a scripting language, when it plainly wasn't
designed to do that.

I think it'd be possible to assemble a very capable scripting language
without affecting the core language at all.  "OCamlScript" would be:

* normal OCaml
+ Regexp/OCaml (a Camlp4 extension, modified to use pcre)
+ File utilities module
+ ExtLib
+ a bunch of helper functions which I've been writing (eg. slurp
  all lines of a file into memory in various ways) - some of this
  is in ExtLib.

It might also make sense to add some operators using Camlp4 for
handling files.  eg. I've always thought it's a crying shame that you
can't write to a file in Perl using 'command >filename'.  You could
actually _do_ something like that in OCaml + Camlp4, which could be a
real timesaver.

This would be an interesting project for someone ...

Rich.
