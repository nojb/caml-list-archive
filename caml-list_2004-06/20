I personally think that OCaml should not be teached as first language. Just
let the students "enjoy" Java and Perl for few years, and when they'll later
eventually discover OCaml, after all that pain, they'll really be able to
enjoy it. That's a kind of programmer's Graal : the quest for it is a
teaching :)
