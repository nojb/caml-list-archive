I was unaware of this.  I'll have to study up on that.

Looking back, I see I was a part of those threads.  Frankly, I could
care less how people want to license their own software.  I'm only
interested in whether the MLGame people have considered the LGPL, a
license that's potentially useful to me.  I find that a lot of people
who release their first cut of something as GPL, simply haven't thought
through the commercial implications.  They can often be persuaded to
change to LGPL on the grounds of greater utility to a larger audience.
But if they have thought it through and aren't interested, so be it.  No
big deal.  Not everybody's interested in commercial stuff.

What gets me riled up is the zealousy of a lot of people in the GPL
camp.  Charges of MIT / BSD "evil profiteers," "you're just here to rip
us off," "all software should be free," "the contractual service model
is the only valid business model," etc.  I don't respect that kind of
thinking, any more than I respect people who think property rights
shouldn't exist.  Far too many MIT / BSD style projects have proven that
open source under that model works just fine, is enlightened, provides
people with real benefit, is not inequitable, etc.  It all depends on
whether you're into idealistic theory, or what works out in pratice.  My
own idealism is tempered by pragmatism.  I don't like extreme idealists
who are not so tempered.
