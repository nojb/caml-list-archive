Thought I'd point this article out for the people who've stopped reading 
slashdot:

The original GPLS was the best advertising Ocaml ever had.  It's why I 
learned Ocaml- I discovered the original GPLS and started noticing Ocaml 
ranking among the top scorers for fastest execution, least memory used, 
and fewest lines of code, and said to myself "I've got to check that 
language out- obviously there's something going on there."

What's starting to happen, now that the project has started up again, is 
advocates/supporters of other languages have started to submit improved 
versions of the code for their languages.  For example, I notice that 
Ocaml has dropped from it's #1 place in least lines of code to #2, with 
Ruby taking the lead.  

I don't think we need to make a big thing out of this (hey, #2 across the 
board is pretty damned good- we're beating both Java and C++ across the 
board, in fact the only other language that comes close to Ocaml's 
performance is, unsurprisingly, version of SML- MLton and SML/NJ).  But if 
you have some spare time, and want to help out Ocaml's marketing, wander 
over.
