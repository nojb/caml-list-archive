Ok, so multiresolution maths for science and engineering is your
business model.  Sounds like a valid one for your problem domain.  It's
only your multiresolution planet stuff *for games* that I'm unimpressed
with.  As a game designer I'm very aware of the complexity limits of
games, of what a user can actually deal with and enjoy.  Simillarly, the
vast majority of films are only 90 minutes long and obey Three Act
Structure.  It is a pity that I want to be a world class game designer,
not a world class multiresolution maths guy.  Sounds like you will make
far more money far more easily than I will.

Still, I will keep trying to think how I might use higher level
languages such as OCaml for valid business models.  I definitely don't
think financial grunt coding is where it's at.  Corporate
industrialization is the province of Java and C#.  I've been led to
OCaml via 3D graphics and AI problems.  Maybe the latter might be more
fruitful for me.
