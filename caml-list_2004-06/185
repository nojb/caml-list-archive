And use the operating system's run-time linker?  That would make for 
very long library names... but maybe that wouldn't be too terrible.

Do you mean in memory, or by installed programs that aren't necessarily

maintain a count of the processes that currently have a library mapped 
into memory?  Could GODI take care of the second problem?
