You can think "with ... -> ..." almost as "fun ... -> ...", so for the
latter you certainly expect all that follows to be part of the body of
the function.  This is also the same for the "match ... with ... ->
..." close.

Try this:

  (try p "test" with Not_found -> p "exc"); p "done"

or

  begin
    try p "test"
    with Not_found -> p "exc"
  end;
  p "done"
