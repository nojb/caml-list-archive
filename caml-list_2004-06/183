Or applications which run ocaml script internally, which become
common recently.

Assuming a particular locale is quite problematic.

Camomile needs to set LC_ALL to acquire LC_NUMERIC value.  Camomile
does not use LC_NUMERIC value currently, but it provides API to
getting all LC_* values for the user.

You can temporally save the current LC_NUMERIC value, change its value
to C, and restore the value after the conversion.  What is a problem?
