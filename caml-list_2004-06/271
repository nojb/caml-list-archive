The problem is that most people can't differentiate between their
instincts and their prejudices.  For example, most people's instinct is
that C++ should be as fast as C.  But the one measurement I've seen says
otherwise.  Show me another measurement, and I'll admit the issue is open
to debate.  But until you do, my response to all the logic and reasoning
in the world will still be "and yet it moves."  One measurement- no matter
how flawed and questionable- is worth a million opinions.  Otherwise we're
just stumbling around Plato's cave.
