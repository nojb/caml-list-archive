Precedence: bulk

actually i'm not the kind who tries to subvert the type system ;)

the scenario is as follows: an application saves state using some
polymorphic variants.
later the application has grown and adds more polymorphic variants to
the 'vocabulary' of state it might read in.
so, i wanted to be sure that the later application could still read
the earlier variants in a safe manner.
