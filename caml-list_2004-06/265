Thinking about it a little more, the good thing with LOC count is, as I've
read somewhere else, in large softwares (say > 50,000 LOC), LOC count was
quite a fairly good measure of the size of a project in terms of spent
resources. In other words, according to surveys, the effort involved (as
measured in man-months) was fairly proportional to the LOC count, which is
why LOC count still prevails as a measurement of a software project.
However there has never been any survey measuring code size in terms of
zipped kilobytes unfortunately, although one might suspect the correlation
between this measurement and the effort involved would be stronger than with
LOC count.

Also, it is not obvious at all how this translates to small programs of <200
lines like in the shootout.
