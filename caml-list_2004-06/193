While I agree that LC_NUMERIC makes converting floats into strings that are
intended to be converted back into floats by other programs a major pain,
locales aren't all bad. Adding locale support and ctype.h routines was one
of the first things I did for annexlib. Being able to do things like case
conversion according to the user's character set is very nice.
