Actually, the idea I like is to pick a standard compression algorithm- say 
gzip, or bzip2- and compress the files.  This actually gives you a decent 
approximation of the amount of information the soure code contains- and 
entire sidesteps a lot of issues.  In addition to newlines and indenting, 
it also minimizes the effect of variable name length.  For example, the 
average name length for ocaml programs is probably a lot shorter than the 
average name length for java programs.
