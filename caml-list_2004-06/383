My feeling is that custom linking is nearly obsolete - better use dll
libraries which are well supported in ocaml now.

It is doable by linking the libcamljitrun.a instead of
libcamlrun.a. Since -lcamlrun is a builtin library name (in ocamlc
-custom), the trick (suggested by Xavier Leroy) is to copy
libcamljitrun.a into a unique directory like
/usr/local/lib/ocamljitdir/ and pass -cclib
-L/usr/local/lib/ocamljitdir/ to your ocamlc command.

Ocamljitrun is under LGPL as is GNU lightning. I believe that the
special exception applying to Ocaml like software like ocamljitrun do
not apply to the GNU lightning library, which is LGPL, but as I said
many times, I AM NOT A LAWYER.

the Ocamljit library should be buildable as a shared library - just
edit the GNUUmakefile of ocamljit appropriately to add -fPIC to the
compilation command, and build a shared library instead of a static
one. As usual on x86 there is a small penalty (because of register
shortage for global offset table access) in shared libraries.
