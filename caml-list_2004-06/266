As someone who used to write some code in APL, I was
always a fan of LOC as a measure of *something*, because
APL always wins. It used to be said that a line of APL
was like 40 lines of FORTRAN...but that because of that,
you should expect each to take the same amount of time
to read. 

The point of APL being compact was not that the 
programs were smaller, but that idioms were easier to
recognize/learn/use, and the structure of the language 
helped the programmer structure his/her thought. 

I actually believe that those are two of the advantages of
ML as well.
