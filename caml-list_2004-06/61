Unfortunately, those bindings are over three years old, and despite the 
claim of being generated automatically, are continually becoming stale 
and rarely work.  There are now tools called "Kalyptus"and "Smoke" in 
the kdebindings module of the kde.org CVS server, which is used to 
generate several language bindings, none of which is C, but one of which 
is Smoke.  In the smoke directory it looks like there are now 
conversions for both Qt and KDE.  So maybe the pieces are all there now.

Somehow, C++ was automatically wrapped with C and mostly worked.
Creating a C layer seems to be half the problem, so I've been asking on
comp.lang.c++.moderated about automated C wrappers.
