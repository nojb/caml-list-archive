By the way, how well does this work?  Just out of curiosity.

I've never taught beginning anything to anyone, so I know diddly squat 
about about what works and what doesn't work.  That said, I think I'd 
rather teach Ocaml as a first language than either C++ or Java, but I 
think Scheme might be an even better language than Ocaml as a first 
language.
