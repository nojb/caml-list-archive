No, my objective is to use OCaml on top of extant C++ libraries, such as
the Nebula2 3D engine.  "Borgging" some of the engine over time may be
possible, but against that, is the implementation reality that the rest
of the Nebula2 developers are implementing in C++.

Am I allowed to just scream at you every time someone utters this
drivel?  Compare how Xavier feels about the 'real world'.  I think all
the 'exterior constant' O() theory guys should be hung from the rafters.

It may very well be.  There is still the reality that when you plan to
use extant libraries, that have ongoing development, with programmers
attached to them, all of whom are working in an imperative OO paradigm,
that you have to communicate successfully with them.  If you're going to
convert them, your religion has to be compelling.  And you may not be
able to convert them, you may have to settle for interoperating with
them.  The alternative is to write everything for OCaml from scratch and
that's just not industrial reality.  One of OCaml's strengths as far as
gaining language converts, actually, is that it doesn't immediately
force C++ people to abandon an imperative, OO mode of thinking.

The "Worse Is Better" school of technological development has won.  You
have to deal with that reality if you want to benefit from it.
Otherwise, have fun writing all your own code from scratch.

I didn't say I had any faith in the industrial robustness of the
solution.  I haven't heard of anyone using OCaml SWIG besides its
author.  I'm also aware that SWIG was designed to bind scripting
languages, not for native-native code linkage.

I don't.  I've totally avoided it, and I despise the thought of having
to deal with it.  I went looking for higher level languages rather than
worry about STL.  Thanks for reminding me that there's a dimension of
the C++ migration problem I hadn't considered.  I don't make much use of
templates... but they're germane to the C++ idiom, they won't be
'optional'.

So where are you finding these OCaml jobs?  Clue us in.

*Now* you're a 3D graphics researcher.  Oy vey!
