I don't understand what you're saying, so maybe you can clarify.

Here is my understanding of the LGPL.  Since ancient times, one has been
perfectly free to do whatever one likes *on top of* a LGPL library, i.e.
linking to it.  There is no 'exception' required, that's why it's the
LGPL not the GPL.  The only stipulation is you must redistribute the
source code *of the LGPL library* along with your proprietary stuff on
top of it.  Your proprietary stuff can be completely and utterly closed.

Now, how does OCaml create any complication with a LGPL licensed
library?  Surely OCamlSDL doesn't patch OCaml itself?  Nor MLGame?  And,
I would note that SDL and OCamlSDL are LGPL licensed.  So where is a
'licensing issue' coming from, except by choice of MLGame's authors?
