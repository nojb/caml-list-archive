Sorry for changing the subject, but can ocamljitrun be used with
"ocamlc -custom"? I have a program which uses some small C modules,
and I couldn't find an obvious way to make it compile or run using
ocamljitrun. AFAIK, -custom links the bytecode interpreter with the
binary as part of its magic.

On topic, does that affect licencing? It doesn't really matter to me,
but it might for some people I guess...
