I'm not using it for that. I have a conflict: I need to marshal
a data structure containing bignums out, and, I need to put
it in a Hashtabl which won't work with bignums because 
polymorphic equal fails on abstract types.

I wrapped the bignums in a class just to get a comparable id.
Now I can't marshal it :(

I'm using native code.. and I don't want to output any
functions. All I want is the bignums to be treated 
like an address for comparison, but written out as a value
when marshalling..

It seems the only way to do this is to write an equal function
for my terms... anyhow i just deleted the caches .. more grief
than they wre worth, and didn't seem to speed anything up anyhow.
