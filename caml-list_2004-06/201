Mmmmm... now you're bringing back the memories.  Yeah, I think COBOL
pretty much has to rank as one of the least dense programming languages
out there (not counting fringe stuff like unlambda) -- especially if you
go all "hardcore" and type things like MULTIPLY A BY B GIVING C. instead
of C = A * B.

Heh.  COBOL was fun.
