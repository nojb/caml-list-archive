I beleive it was Fred Brooks who first opinioned that programmers produced
about the same number of working lines of code per month no matter what
the language was- and that therefor higher level languages (by which he
meant Fortran and PL/1) that did more work in fewer lines of code were
more productive than lower level languages (by which he meant assembly 
language).
