Yes, and did you read what the manual says about that string? The string
is not supposed to be the window title. On X11, it's the the name of an
X display and/or a geometry specification. I'm not sure what it's
supposed to be on Win32 platforms.

Nonetheless, the behavior of open_graph leaves something to be desired.
For example,

  # open_graph " 400x600" (* Note the leading space. *);;
  - : unit = ()
  # open_graph "400x600";;      
  Exception: Graphics.Graphic_failure "Cannot open display 400x600".

So the function distinguishes a display name from a geometry spec by
whether there is a leading space? Yech. Maybe the signature should be

  open_graph : ?display:string -> ?geometry:string -> unit -> unit

And at least one of the following should work:

  # open_graph "0";;  
  Exception: Graphics.Graphic_failure "Cannot open display 0".
  # open_graph "0.0";;  
  Exception: Graphics.Graphic_failure "Cannot open display 0.0".
  # open_graph "localhost:0.0";;
  Exception: Graphics.Graphic_failure "Cannot open display localhost:0.0".
  # open_graph "127.0.0.1:0.0";;
  Exception: Graphics.Graphic_failure "Cannot open display 127.0.0.1:0.0".
  # open_graph "localhost:0";;
  Signal 13
  bash-2.05a$ 
  
Brilliant.

P.S. When asking questions of this sort, it would be helpful if you gave
  some information about your system, e.g. the platform and version of
  OCaml--especially with libraries like Graphics that have
  platform-dependent features.
