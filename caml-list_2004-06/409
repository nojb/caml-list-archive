Sorry, but I thought continuing an entry in the bug tracking was better 
than adding one (but I was unable tu actually make a comment in that 
entry !)

Someone (I do not remember who) suggested a call to select in place of 
sched_yield.

My thought about semantics in that
- a system call saying schedule just now or later (like the semantics of 
sched_yield in 2.4) only lower the percentage of CPU a thread get, 
except if you manage to have your thread "in phase" (I do not know if 
this is proper english) with the scheduler.

Then to lower your % of CPU you should use renice (but I do not know if 
the semantics of renice is per thread or per processus).

However a system call saying "I do not not need CPU for a while" could 
be usefull ... but it should have another name not to break existing 
program ... and should have an (optional ?) argument saying how long is 
this while.

So I think the 2.6 developper are right, but should have created a new 
system call. and let sched yield unchanged.

Any one can feel free to forward my post to a kernel developpers list :-)
