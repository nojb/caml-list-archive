I agree. What's worse, these combinatorial types can accept only C++ types as 
parameters. How to reliably specify that in ocaml client code, it's almost 
impossible to know...

Maybe SWIG's approach is a good middleground then? But it makes me wonder, why 
should I want to use C++ stdlib if I have ocaml? >:-)

The alternative I thought was a syntax extension to handle it for class and 
function templates. But I don't think it's going to work out, either.
