No, for me personally language evangelism is not the point. Language
evaluation is the point. If it comes out that the best language for
solving my problems is actually JAVA, I swallow and say "yes, thanks for
this information" (this is the current state of affairs, by the way). If
it turns out that Python/SWIG is what would do best what I need and I can
motivate people to do that, I'd do Python/SWIG.

How do you define "evangelism"? The word means "spreading the good
message". So this means benchmarking is good for finding out if a language
is useful? Yes, I think this is what a benchmark is about, right?

And yes, ease of mixed-language programming could be a useful parameter.

I certainly do not have your OpenGL device driver background :-) and I
spare you with my definition of what "real work" is :-D . In any case, I
would be interested in looking at a set of benchmarks that tells me if
what I want to achieve can be done easily and efficiently in a given
language or not, without me having to write too many comparative
benchmarks myself. One per week is clearly too many for me. Ballpark
figures are useful already.

Cheers,
Wolfgang
