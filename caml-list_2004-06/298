OK. Imagine client ocaml code that uses template class C < T >. I had imagined 
that the specializations in the ocaml code ( C < int >, C < vector<float> 
>, ... ) could be determined automatically, after which the specializations 
are generated in C++ stub code, and linked in... So I guess I had in mind a 
more generic version of SWIG's approach, however I doubt this won't be a good 
mapping.... Can you guys imagine any other alternatives, or should we avoid 
templates in C++ libraries that want an ocaml binding (like KDE) ?

Cheers,
