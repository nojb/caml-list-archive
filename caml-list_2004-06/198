   Isn't this what cash is about (minus the regexp stuff and the camlp4 sugar)?
Yes, that was my intent.

Thanks for the hype!

Now that I'm at it...

Of course Cash would score somewhat higher than OCaml, if only because
it can get the script on the command line :-).

Anyway, all those language comparisons are always biased; is `program
length' a good measure of scripting capacity ?  It turns the
comparison into a shortest script challenge, doesn't it ?
