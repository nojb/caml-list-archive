What about counting characters instead (counting several spaces in
a row as only one character) ? As most languages just don't mind
where you cut the lines, this seems to me a more fair measure.
Also, this would give complete freedom on the indentation style
without resulting in any disadvantage for the language rank.

Just a suggestion :)
