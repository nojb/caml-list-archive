Ignoring the flamefest for a bit, I actually have a question for people
who do 3D rendering pipelines.  Over in Extlib (plug:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocaml-lib/) we have "enumerators"- 
basically Java or C++ STL Iterators.  Except that we have lazy mapping and 
filters- basically, as each element is iterated, all the currently 
applicable maps and filters are applied to it.

So my question is: would this be a better paradigm to experiment with a 
graphics pipeline in?  What other tweaks or features might make it more 
usefull?
