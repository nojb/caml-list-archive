OK, I just tried this and it doesn't work.  It seems (without looking
at the ocamlopt source anyway ...) that the .cmx file carries a
high-level representation of the code which is actually assembled in
the .o file.  When I replaced just the .o file with a similar one
carrying my assembler, OCaml inlined the original code which therefore
must have come from the .cmx.

I'm guessing that people would object to extending OCaml to allow
inline asm because it would break bytecode compilation?
