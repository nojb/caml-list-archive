                        MetaOCaml Workshop

      GPCE'04 Workshop (Vancouver, Canada, October 25th, 2004)


MetaOCaml is a multi-stage extension of the widely used functional
programming language OCaml. It provides a generic core for expressing
macros, staging, and partial evaluation. The workshop is a forum for
discussing experience with using MetaOCaml as well as possible future
developments for the language. The scope of the workshop includes all
aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, and implementation
of MetaOCaml. The workshop welcomes reports on 

  - novel applications (especially interpreters),
  - extensions (macros, new language constructs, offshoring translations),
  - implementation techniques (compilation, RTCG), support (debugging,
    profiling),
  - educational use, 
  - basic theory (staging annotations, static typing, static analysis,
    environment classifiers, etc).

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the
Program Committee (PC). The PC will work to provide detailed and
constructive comments to the authors. The workshop will only have informal
proceedings, and is intended to be close in spirit to the Haskell, ML, and
Scheme workshops.

Based on author requests and PC decisions, authors will be given either 25 
minute or 15 minute slots to present their ideas, and both will be 
followed by 15 minutes of questions and discussion. At the end of the 
workshop, one hour will be allocated to an open discussion to review the 
outcomes of the meeting, and to discuss future challenges and directions 
for MetaOCaml.

For uniformity, authors are encouraged to use the latest ACM SIGS 
conference style file (option 1). We also request that submissions be 
limited to 12 pages in this style. Registration for the workshop is part 
of registering for GPCE'04. The event is co-located with OOPSLA'04, which 
already provides housing and transportation information.
