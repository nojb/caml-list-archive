Hello,
I would like to program a plugin in ocaml. A plugin to already existing 
programs that are written in C. The plugin is in form of a DLL, and the 
plugin's interface is described by a set of C structures and exported 
functions in the DLL.

There's also one more constraint: the plugin must be self-contained; it 
must not require any other DLL (except for system DLLs) to function. It 
must be deliverable as -one- .DLL file.

Is this possible?

Thanks,
Magnus Jonsson
