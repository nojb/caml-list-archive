I am having a problem adding threads to a large project I am working on. If I added "-thread" and "threads.cmxa" and compile, it works fine. However, when I run ocamldep, it generates a dependency on $(OCAML_BUILD_DIR)/lib/ocaml/thread.cmi which then leads to the following when I run make:

ocamlc -thread <snip> -c $(OCAML_BUILD_DIR)/lib/ocaml/thread.mli
I/O error: $(OCAML_BUILD_DIR)/lib/ocaml/thread.cmi: Permission denied

The dependency on thread.cmi seems to be bogus. Is there a switch I can give ocamldep so that it won't generate this? Is it likely that something in my build process is tricking ocamldep into producing it? I've tried this a number of ways, and can't get the thread code to compile alongside the rest of the project.
