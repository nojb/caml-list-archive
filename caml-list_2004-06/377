And, of course, to build that map you have to look at every element of the
array. Of course, you can then re-use the map, but it has to be generated
somehow.

You still have to look at the strings to find out where those corresponding
strings are. Now, with something like your second example you can sort the
array (Once again having to look at everything in the array) and use a
binary search to find the range of strings starting with, say, athlon,
without having to look at every element in that particular search.

Your original questions didn't say anything about such extra information or
patterns in the strings you're searching. If you want an answer you like,
you have to give us enough data about the problem that we have a hope of
coming up with one! Don't say: How do I find every substring in an array of
strings. Say: In an array of strings of the format
'processortype.memory.operatingsystem', how can I find all strings that have
'linux' in the operatingsystem field?


Aside: Why did you cc'ing caml-list when I only replied to you in that last
email? (This one is going to caml-list too)
