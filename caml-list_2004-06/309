Hello all, its time for another release of Ocamldap. This release 
includes a few bug fixes
in the high level code, and some pragmatic additions to various 
components.

LDIF parser
- added methods to write as well as read LDIF
- added base64 encoding support (for read and write), the parser
should now be fully compliant with the LDIF standard
- added methods to read and write LDIF to and from strings

High level stuff
- dependancy generation (for generators) in ldapaccount has been fixed 
so that it doesn't
pollute the object with strange objectclasses. It will not add 
objectclasses in order to satisfy
generator dependancies anymore.
- added two new methods, service_exists, and services_present to 
ldapaccount, which will allow
listing of the services on the account, and querying individual ones. 
Most of this code was moved
in from rmwd.

Low level stuff
- added some very preliminary handling of referrals (don't raise an 
exception when you hit one :P).
There is much work to do in this area. Currently openldap's C library 
is transparently following referrals,
and there are a lot of cases where that isn't good at all. I would like 
to add the ability for the library user
to control with great detail what is done with referrals.

as always, the Ocaml link database contains the authoritative link to 
the code

however you can download binaries for version 1.5.0 from here

Happy ldaping,
-Eric Stokes
