Hello,

Missinglib 0.4.1 is now ready.  It represents major new effort since
0.0.1 was announced on caml-list.  This library is designed to provide
all those useful but missing features that the standard library
lacks.  Its pieces are designed to be used independent of each other,
so you do not have to subscribe to the "Missinglib way" just to use a
few of its functions (though its pieces do complement each other).

The "crown jewels" of Missinglib include the ConfigParser, a flexible
framework for reading and generating configuration files; and
Streamutil, which provides many elegant stream-related functions such
as map, filter, map_stream, and of_channel_lines.

 [ Please add missinglib to the Humps.  Thanks. ]

Here is an excerpt from the README (API docs are at the URLs below):

-------------------------
What is Missinglib?
-------------------------

It's a collection of OCaml-related utilities.  The following modules are
are provided:

Compose                 Utilities for chaining functions together

Composeoper             Haskell-like operators for chaining functions

ConfigParser            System for parsing configuration files
                        These configuration files can have multiple
                        sections and resemble .INI files.  This module
                        is designed to be mostly compatible with
                        Python's ConfigParser module.
                       
Hashtbloper             Hash table convenience operators

Hashtblutil             Hash table utilities

Lexingutil              Lexing-related utilities

Listutil                List-manipulation utilities
                        Functions are provided to help extract
                        portions of lists and be more convenient
                        for association lists.  Also, lists of strings
                        or chars can be written directly to output channels.
                        
Slice                   Underlying API for Slice operators

Sliceoper               Flexible subparts of arrays, lists, and strings

Streamutil              Stream parser, conversion, and creation utilities
                        Provides features to create streams the yield
                        the lines of an input channel, the blocks of an
                        input channel, convert finite
                        streams to lists, map and filter streams
                        (similar to those functions on lists), and
                        fold streams.
                        
Strutil                 String-related utilities
                        Includes functions to strip whitespace from
                        the beginning or end of strings, to split
                        strings into lists by whitespace or a custom
                        delimeter, etc.

Unixutil                Operating system utilities
                        Includes functions to process directories
                        (possibly recursively), test for file
                        existence, and an implementation of "rm"
                        with "-r" and "-f" options.

The entire library has no prerequisites save the OCaml standard library and
findlib and is designed to install without complexity on a variety of
systems.  It could also easily be embedded within your own source trees
so that users need not have it installed beforehand.

** THIS IS CURRENTLY ALPHA-QUALITY CODE; MAJOR API FLUCTUATIONS MAY YET OCCUR.
