CALL FOR PAPERS

Multi-agent systems are communities of problem-solving entities
that can perceive and act upon their environments to achieve their
individual goals as well as joint goals. The work on such systems
integrates many technologies and concepts in artificial
intelligence and other areas of computing. For this reason, over
recent years, the agent paradigm gained popularity in many
sub-fields of computer science. A full spectrum of multi-agent
systems applications have been and are being developed; from
search engines to educational aids to electronic commerce and
trade, e-procurement, recommendation systems, simulation and
routing, to cite only some.

Although commonly implemented by means of imperative languages,
mainly for reasons of efficiency, the agent concept has recently
increased its influence in the research and development of
computational logic based systems.

Computational logic provides a well-defined, general, and rigorous
framework for studying syntax, semantics and procedures, for
attending implementations, environments, tools, and standards, and
for linking together specification and verification of properties
of computational systems.

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss techniques, based on
computational logic, for representing, programming and reasoning
about multi-agent systems in a formal way.

Following the workshop on Multi-Agent Systems in Logic Programming
affiliated with ICLP'99, the first CLIMA workshop took place in
London, UK, affiliated with CL'2000. The 2001 edition of CLIMA,
took place in Paphos, Cyprus, affiliated with ICLP'01. CLIMA'02
took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was affiliated with ICLP'02
and part of FLOC'02. The fourth edition of the workshop, CLIMA IV,
took place in Fort Lauderdale, USA, and was co-located with
LPNMR-7 and SAIM'04.

We solicit unpublished papers that address formal approaches to
multi-agent systems. the approaches as well as being formal must
make a significant contribution to the practice of multi-agent
systems. relevant techniques include, but are not limited to, the
following:

* logical foundations of multi-agent systems
* knowledge and belief representation and updates in multi-agent systems
* agent and multi-agent hypothetical reasoning and learning
* extensions of logic programming for multi-agent systems
* nonmonotonic reasoning in multi-agent systems
* theory and practice of argumentation for agent reasoning and interaction
* operational semantics and execution agent models
* model checking algorithms, tools, and applications for multi-agent logics
* semantics of interaction and agent communication languages
* distributed constraint satisfaction in multi-agent systems
* temporal reasoning for multi-agent systems
* modal logic approaches to multi-agent systems
* logic based programming languages for multi-agent systems
* distributed theorem proving for multi-agent systems
* logic based implementations of multi-agent systems
* decision theory for multi-agent systems
* specification and verification of formal properties of agent systems

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS We welcome and encourage the submission of
high quality, original papers, which are not simultaneously
submitted for publication elsewhere. Please refer to the workshop
web pages for further instructions concerning the submission
procedures.
