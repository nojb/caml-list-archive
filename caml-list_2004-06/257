Hi, all

Does anybody know how to deal with C++ classes, such
as vectors, maps, in Ocaml? It seems that currently
Ocaml can  only support the interoperation of C. So
the first step is to try encapusuate a C++ class with
C interface, then write C interface for Ocaml.
However, it is so inconvient for std classes. Does
anybody has any better ideas?

Thanks a lot!

Andy
