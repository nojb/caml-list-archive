Felix uses an array of offsets to locate pointers.
And in Felix all types are fully expanded (except in sums
due to a design stupidity in C++).

A disadvantage of the offsets approach is that
Felix pointers and C pointers can't be mixed
in polymorphic functions operating on pointer to T:
the distinction is entirely static. In Ocaml, the
check is done at run time -- meaning less code bloat
and a small performance hit.

Expanded types provide superior efficiency
in some cases, and of course include boxing (pointers)
as a special case and so subsume systems that only box.
