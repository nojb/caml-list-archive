I must stay I've stopped reading a while ago :-)

I was about to post a long and detailed reply explaining the
difference between computational types and storage types, why I think
32-bit floats might be useful as the latter but not at the former,
quoting cycle counts from various processor manuals, mention what
could conceivably be done in OCaml at minimal implementation costs,
discuss SSE2 a bit, and generally answer the OP's initial questions.

Then I looked again at my caml-list inbox and saw this ridiculous
flamefest about who is / isn't qualified to talk about computer
graphics, on top of the usual Felix advertising and C++ discussions.

Then I decided not to post.

I long for the days when the caml-list had about one message per
day, but it was actually relevant to Caml.
