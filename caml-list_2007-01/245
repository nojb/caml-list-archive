I hit a shortcoming of OCaml's here. For a ray tracer, single-precision floats 
are fine. But in OCaml you can't mix them with other types in a data 
structure to save memory, you just use a pointer to a BigArray. I think this 
is a justification for having float32 in the language.

I'll take the rest of the discussion back off list...
