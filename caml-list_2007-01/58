"realworld task": spamfilter.

Then, if thisfits the needs of the mathematical
teaching during the time they are studying, can
be very interesting.
Starting with string-comparisons on fixed strings
from a list (file based), which seem to be definitely
spam, can be changed to strings or patterns that are
often inside spam, soyou can use probabilistic methods.
Later you can try neural nets and support vector machines.

Also the filter can have an inputlanguage 8domain specific language)
so that the global/general behaviour can be controled by the
admin (fuzzy logicrules for the filtering and configuration
of any kind) and does not depend on the mathematical built
in's only.

The module system can be very helpful in combining the approaches.

If the sources will be published, also other peoplewould have a benefit,
and maybe some students will use it and developing it maybe late
after finishing studying there...


Best wishes,
