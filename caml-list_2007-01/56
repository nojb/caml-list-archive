For the graphics, I would rather suggest lablTk. It is much easier to
use for beginners. And you can even work interactively using the
Tk.update command.

For writing programs, emacs helps a lot. In particular, the possibility
to execute phrases in the toplevel while editing a file makes things
much easier. Emacs looks scary, but for this specific case you only
need a limited number of key combinations :-)
Once you've installed Tcl/Tk (required for LablTk), then you can use
ocamlbrowser. It can be helpful too, particularly for browsing the
library.

(These are very personal suggestions...)
