I am pleased to announce the OCaml Summer Project. The project is aimed 
at encouraging growth in the OCaml community by funding students over 
the summer to work on open-source projects in OCaml. At the end of the 
summer, we will fly all of the students who have completed their 
projects succesfully out for a meeting in New York, where people will 
present their projects and get a chance to shmooze with other members of 
the OCaml community.

The project is being funded and run by Jane Street Capital. As people on 
the list likely know at this point, we make extensive use of OCaml here 
at Jane Street, and are excited about the idea of encouraging and 
growing the OCaml community.

If you'd like to learn more about the project, you can look at our 
website here:

We'd love to have professors tell their students about the project, 
since we hope it will do some real good in terms of increasing interest 
in functional programming.

Please direct any questions or suggestions you have to 
osp@janestcapital.com.
