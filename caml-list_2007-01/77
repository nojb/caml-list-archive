I have been trying to do this too and have finally managed to get wxHaskell
0.9.4 working with wxWidgets 2.8.0.

My guide + code to do it can be found here:
http://riftor.g615.co.uk/content.php?view=3D53&type=3D2

I hope that it works for you too, it should do! Let me know if you have any
problems,

Dominic Orchard
