I find them prinicipally useful in three situations:

1) When I am writing code for an easy subset of a problem, and wish to
extend it later. This is the least useful case, easiest to replace.

2) When I have different overlapping kinds of data, with a common root
and common parent, and functions that are only defined on certain
branches of the 'type tree.' This would be the hardest to replicate.

3) When I have intermediate labelled data for gathering different
subproblems together. This is the neatest use: I extend my algorithm
to handle a case that might return the top two, and I just add an
additional case to the destructor for `TopTwo instead of `Best or
`SecondBest.
