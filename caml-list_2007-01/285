-------------------------------------------------------------
Position available at Paris 7

The laboratory PPS of University Paris 7 is looking for candidates for a
one year position, available immediately, around the CDuce project.
CDuce is a programming language for XML (see http://www.cduce.org),
close in spirit to OCaml, and whose compiler is implemented in OCaml.

According to the profile of the recruited person the position will focus
more on the development environment (e.g.: libraries for web development
or web services, Eclipse plugins, Windows port) or on the research
aspects (e.g.: concurrency, typing, distribution, verification) around
CDuce.

Candidates should be fluent in OCaml or in another functional language.
Experience in Web development, environments for software development
and/or XML would be useful as well.

The annual gross salary will be around 28.000 Euros. If interested
please send a mail to staff@cduce.org as soon as possible.
