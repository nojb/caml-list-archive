Although I disagree with this first step, I think OCaml need a hand in
becoming more mainstream. unfortunately, it seems that INRIA is not really
interested in making this happened, maybe tweaking syntax and extending the
libraries [1].

At the moment, every one seems to have their own standard libraries to extends
the deficiency/problems/lacks of the common one, and also a bunch a
syntax extensions, that are also incompatible/redundant with each other
for most of them.

[1] I would certainly prefer to be dead wrong here, but at the moment
    I'm conforted in this idea.

Cheers,
