To be more precise, I'm searching a modeling language (such as UML for 
OO methods) and a tool to design my developments in ocaml. That tool 
doesn't need to be written in ocaml.

As for uml, it seems to be not very convenient for functional languages 
(i didn't use oo features of ocaml) and not very popular in fp community.

After a short search on the web, i didn't find anything for that. The 
main argument is that functional languages don't need heavy design 
methods based on graphical representations.
As for me, I think that designing with a graphical modeling language 
could be profitable.
