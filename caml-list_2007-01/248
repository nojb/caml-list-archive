Well, looking at the benchmark module, it appears that message if one or 
more of the following occurs:
The number of iterations is too low (default minimum = 4)
The amount of cpu time taken is too low (default minimum = 0.4 seconds)
The wallclock time was less than 1 second and the number of iterations was 
less than 1000.

So either make the functions more intensive (which obscures the calling 
time and thus is bad here), do more calls, or supply a smaller value for 
min_cpu:

let _ =
   let results = latencyN 4000000 ~min_cpu:0.1
      [("function", call_f, ());
       ("method", call_o, ());
       ("closure", call_fc, ());
       ("obj. closure", call_foc, ())]
   in
   tabulate results;;
