you can only wrapp via C - functions

I have done it a few times, it's much typing :-)
you must write a c function for the methods of the class you want to 
wrap and give them a pointer to the c++ class, so you can call the 
method there. Often you define on the c++ side an adapter class which 
delegates method calls to the ocaml side (f.e. when wrapping events from 
and to c++/ocaml). For big libraries it's a neverending task without 
more tools.
There is the platinum framework (on sourceforge), a c++ class lib with a 
little gui. This lib compiles for win32, Linux, WinCE and qnx, I have 
done some wrapping to the gui part, together with the event handling and 
it works very nice (if you want to read it as an example).

Python, Ruby and Perl all have wrappers for QT and they use tools to 
generate the C interface I think. Maybe worth to look at...

cheers,
