                Symbolic-Numeric Computation 2007 (SNC 2007)

                    July 25-27, 2007 -- London Canada

                http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/snc2007

Overview:

  Algorithms that combine ideas from symbolic and numeric computation have
  been of increasing interest over the past decade.  The growing demand for
  speed, accuracy and reliability in mathematical computing has accelerated
  the process of blurring the distinction between two areas of research that
  were previously quite separate.

  The goal of the present workshop is to support the interaction and
  integration of symbolic and numeric computing.  Earlier meetings in this
  series include the SNAP 96 Workshop, held in Sophia Antipolis, France,
  and the SNC 2005 meeting, held in Xi'an, China.  Following the tradition,
  Symbolic-Numeric Computation 2007 will be held July 25-27 in London, Canada.

  SNC 2007 is affiliated with the 2007 International Symposium on Symbolic and
  Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2007).  Co-located with this workshop will be
  PASCO 2007, the 2007 International Workshop on Parallel Symbolic Computation.
  SNC and PASCO will be held immediately prior to the ISSAC 2007 meeting, both
  at the University of Western Ontario, Canada.  ISSAC 2007 will be held
  nearby in Waterloo, Canada.

Call for Papers:

  The program of SNC 2007 will include invited presentations, contributed
  research papers and posters.   Specific topics include, but are not
  limited to:

  * Hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms
  * Approximate polynomial GCD and factorization
  * Symbolic-numeric methods for solving polynomial systems
  * Resultants and structured matrices for symbolic-numeric computation
  * Differential equations for symbolic-numeric computation
  * Symbolic-numeric methods for geometric computation
  * Symbolic-numeric algorithms in algebraic geometry
  * Symbolic-numeric algorithms for nonlinear optimization
  * Numeric computation of characteristic sets and Gröbner bases
  * Implementation of symbolic-numeric algorithms
  * Model construction by approximate algebraic algorithms (e.g. numerical
    sparse interpolation, the approximate Buchberger-Moeller algorithm)
  * Applications of symbolic-numeric computation

  The conference invites submission of papers presenting original research,
  either in the form of extended abstracts (3 pages) or full papers
  (up to 16 pages in 11 point font).  A paper template is available at
  http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/snc2007/site/submission/submission.html .
