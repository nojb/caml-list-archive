Well, seeing that the very useful native exception backtrace patch has been
sitting idle (acknowledged) for more than a year, I think that's not
working it out too well :\

Seeing the number of people monitoring the issue, I think lots of people
are waiting it.

I'm not saying the patch is perfect, but at least if somebody in the
ocaml team would say something about it, we could improve it.
