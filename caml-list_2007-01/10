Hi all,

I have wrapped a C library for use with Ocaml and didn't find 
the task too daunting. I have now found a C++ library that would
be useful, but the Ocaml ORA book makes no mention of wrapping
C++ libraries.

Has anyone got any experience wrapping C++ libraries in Ocaml?
Is it possible? Painful but doable? Too painful to think about?

Any pointers or advice appreciated.

Cheers,
Erik
