The freely available first chapter of my book "OCaml for Scientists" covers 
the basics of OCaml:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/chapter1.html

The remainder of the book should be accessible to people from a variety of 
disciplines and covers topics including numerical analysis, parsing, 
visualisation using OpenGL and optimisation. The final chapter walks through 
five complete applications written in OCaml. The code from the visualisation 
and final chapters is freely available:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/visualisation/
  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/complete/

You may also enjoy our "Benefits of OCaml" pages, that discuss various 
language features and also has several example programs (symbolic 
manipulation, a tiny interpreter, mandelbrot renderer, ray tracer and maze 
generator):

There are a couple of demos that haven't been linked in yet. A rabbit 
renderer:

and a 19-line Sudoku solver:

HTH!
