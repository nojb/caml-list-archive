I have a question... I hope it will not be dismissed right away, thou I
guess most of you will find it stupid (some might however agree with me...
hopefully).

Cut the crap!

So... why actually are polymorphic variants useful? Why can't they simply be
implemented as normal, concrete (or how would you call them? ...) variants?
Doesn't the use of polymorphic variants just mess up the function type?

I'm not orthogonally against polymorphic variants, it's just that I am
looking for an alternative concept that could be used instead... Maybe
subtyped records?
