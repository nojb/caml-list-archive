Just one proposal per student, I'm afraid.  We'd rather you chose a project
you liked and believed in, and come up with the best proposal you can fo
rit.

We will pay for the travel and your stay.  I don't expect we'll pay for all
of your meals, but we'll have a few dinners for the group.  As for the visa
issue, my expectation is that students will figure this out on their own.  =
I
suspect that for the most part I believe a tourist visa should do, but I
don't really know the details, and it will no doubt vary from country to
country.
