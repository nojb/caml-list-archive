While understanding what is going on under the covers *is* important, 
there is a key reason for using the macros: as the documented and 
recommended interface to the OCaml GC machinery, their use gives you a 
much better chance that your code will easily / automagically survive 
changes to the GC mechanism in the future... like if direct support of 
multi- cores and processors ever becomes a reality. ;)
