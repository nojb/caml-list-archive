I've searched for how to set up a cross compiler for OCaml and came  
across an old message on this list that suggested I could modify the  
generated config/Makefile and a couple of source files. Trying this I  
am running into a number of problems because a lot of the other  
config generated files still have configuration for the host, not the  
target. I can slog through and probably get something working  
eventually, but I'm not sure I would have a high confidence in the  
finished product due to my unfamiliarity with the compiler in  
general. Before I go through this exercise I thought it would be  
worth asking if anyone here has done this more recently (the other  
message was Mar 99).

Specifically I'm trying to generate powerpc-603-linux-elf from an x86- 
linux box. I have the gcc cross compilers installed and working.

Thanks in advance.

Matt
