Subject: ocamlc vs ocamlc.opt?

X-Spam: no; 0.00; ocamlc:01 ocamlc:01 bytecode:01 findlib:01 ocamlfind:01 lablgtk:01 -thread:01 threads:01 lablgtk:01 gtkinit:01 cmo:01 usr:01 lib:01 ocaml:01 stublibs:01 

I just ran into a problem where building a bytecode executable failed 
with findlib ("ocamlfind ocamlc ...") but the equivalent non-findlib 
command worked.  Then I saw that I could force the same error message 
in my non-findlib build by just matching findlib's ocamlc.opt, while I 
had used ocamlc.

The command line is:
ocamlc -o bait -I +lablgtk2 -I +lablscintilla -thread threads.cma 
lablgtk.cma gtkInit.cmo scintilla.cma bait.ml

which works fine.  Changing ocamlc to ocamlc.opt yields:
Error on dynamically loaded library: 
/usr/lib/ocaml/stublibs/dlllablscintilla.so: undefined symbol: 
caml_names_of_builtin_cprim

This is on FC6, with a Yum-installed OCaml 3.09.3 package.  Both of 
the versions of the compiler identify themselves as 3.09.3 with the 
same standard library location, and both were built on Dec 2 of 2006.

So should the versions of ocamlc behave the same excepting performance 
issues, or ?
