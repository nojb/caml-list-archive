                             CALL FOR PAPERS
                       COMPUTER AIDED VERIFICATION
                                CAV 20007
                       19th International Conference
                      July 3-7, 2007, Berlin, Germany
                           http://www.cav2007.org

                        ** Submission is now open **

Aims and Scope:

       CAV'07 is the 19th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the
       theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for
       hardware and software systems. CAV considers it vital to continue
       its leadership in hardware verification, and maintain its recent
       momentum in software verification. The conference covers the
       spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with
       an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and
       techniques that are needed for their implementation. The
       proceedings of the conference will be published in the
       Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A
       selection of papers will be invited to a special issue of the
       International Journal on Formal Methods and System Design.

Topics of interest include:

     - Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations
     - Hardware verification techniques
     - Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification
     - Program analysis and software verification
     - Modeling and specification formalisms
     - Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for
       verification
     - Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology
     - Applications and case studies
     - Verification in industrial practice

Invited Speakers:

     - Byron Cook, Microsoft Research
     - David Russinoff, AMD
     - Thomas Kropf, Robert Bosch AG

Events:

     This year, there will be eight affiliated workshops:

     - AHA 07: International Symposium on Automatic Heap Analysis

     - ARTIST Workshop on tool platforms for modelling, analysis and 
       validation of embedded systems

     - BMC 07: 5th International Workshop on Bounded Model Checking

     - FMICS 2007: 12th Intl. Workshop on Formal Methods for Industrial 
       Critical Systems

     - GVD 2007: 3rd German Verification Day

     - HW-MC-COMP: Hardware Model Checking Competition

     - PDMC 07: 6th Int. Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Methods 
       in verifiCation

     - SMT 2007: 5th International Workshop on Satisfiability Modulo 
       Theories

     - SMT-COMP: Satisfiability Modulo Theories Tools Competition

     - SPIN 2007: 14th International SPIN Workshop on Model Checking of 
       Software


Paper submission:

     There are two categories of submissions:

       A. Regular papers. Submissions, not exceeding thirteen (13) pages
          using Springer's LNCS format, should contain original research,
          and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the
          contribution.  For papers reporting experimental results,
          authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available
          with their submission. Submissions reporting on case studies in
          an industrial context are strongly invited, and should describe
          details, weaknesses and strength in sufficient depth.
          Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings
          or submission of material that has already been published
          elsewhere is not allowed.

       B. Tool presentations. Submissions, not exceeding four (4) pages
          using Springer's LNCS format, should describe the implemented
          tool and its novel features. A demonstration is expected to
          accompany a tool presentation. Papers describing tools that
          have already been presented in this conference before will be
          accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool
          are reported and implemented.

     Information concerning the procedure for submissions will be
     available on the conference home page:

                 http://www.cav2007.org

     Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee for inclusion
     in the proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in
     the LNCS series. Papers exceeding the stated maximum length or
     submitted after January 28, 2007 run the risk of rejection
     without review.

     On an experimental basis for this year, authors will be granted
     access to the text content of their reviews during the review
     process. Authors will be given a short time period in which to
     submit feedback, which may (at the PC's discretion) be taken into
     account in the decision process. Strict guidelines on length and
     content of feedback will be provided to the authors.

Important dates:

       Paper submission (firm): January 28, 2007
       Author feedback period: March 9-11, 2007
       Notification of acceptance: March 23, 2007
       Final version due: April 20, 2007
