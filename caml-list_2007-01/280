                       Final Call for Papers

  1st International Workshop on Quality Aspects of Coordination (QAC'07)

                 June 4-5, 2007, Shanghai, China

                    http://www.cwi.nl/qac07/

*******************************************************************************

Overview and Topics of Interest:

Modeling, analysis, and ensuring end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS)
represent key concerns in large-scale distributed applications.
Deregulation and increased competition in the telecommunications
industry mean that, increasingly, providers use components and services
offered by multiple vendors to compose such applications.  This
highlights the conspicuous absence of compositional models of QoS that
reflect their underlying architecture of component/service composition.

Connectors have emerged as a powerful concept for composition and
coordination of concurrent activities encapsulated as components and
services. Compositional coordination models and languages serve as a
means to formally specify and implement component and service
connectors. They support large-scale distributed applications by
allowing construction of complex component connectors out of simpler
ones. A promising approach to support compositional models of QoS
involves augmenting connector models to reflect and account for the QoS
properties of composed systems. This presents an emerging area of
research with potential high impact. Dynamic changes in a distributed
environment may lead to scarcity of resources (e.g., bandwidth, CPU
cycles, and memory), and cause perceptible degradation of QoS of a
running application. Offering performance guarantees to satisfy users'
end-to-end QoS requirements raises additional challenges for component
connectors. It involves monitoring fluctuations that can trigger such
degradations, and escalating them to the proper architectural levels
where actors can take counter-measures such as substitution of alternate
components and services from other vendors.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for international experts
to discuss issues related to coordination and compositional models of
connectors with QoS guarantees in large-scale distributed systems.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Compositional QoS models
* Compositional models for connectors and coordination with QoS
* Quantitative models for components and connectors
* Relation between QoS in adjacent architectural layers
* Modeling and analysis of trade-offs along different QoS dimensions
* QoS issues in coordination of web services
* Performance of middleware-based architectures
* QoS-sensitive monitoring and adaptation mechanisms
* Dynamic reconfiguration of systems and connectors
* Quantitative model checking
* Testing quantitative models
* Experience with QoS in coordination (case studies)

Submission and Proceedings

Submissions to the workshop will be evaluated on the basis of
originality, relevance, technical soundness and presentation
quality. Papers should be written in English and not exceed 15
pages in ENTCS format. The workshop proceedings will be published 
in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, Elsevier, 
as post-proceedings; in addition, informal workshop proceedings 
will be handed out to participants during the workshop.

Papers must be submitted in electronic form by email to M.Sun@cwi.nl. 
Submissions must not have been published or be concurrently
considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be
reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. 
The final version of the papers must be prepared in LaTeX, 
adhering to the ENTCS format instructions (see
http://www.entcs.org/final.html).

Note that within one or two days after submitting your paper, you
will get a message from the program committee chair, confirming
that your paper was received complete and printed fine. Should you
need help with your submission, or should you have any questions,
please contact Sun Meng at M.Sun@cwi.nl.
