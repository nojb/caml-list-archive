Ok, so someone writes a simple application that loads the whole file
into memory and then plays it. Unfortunately disk transfer speeds being
in the order of 100 Mb/sec means that its going to take 110 seconds to
load that file. Thats bad!

Obviously, the smart way to do it is to stream that file off disk 100kB
chunks at a time. Thats what libsndfile is designed and optimised for.
