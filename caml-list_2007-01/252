Sure, but I'm really interested in understanding the "penalty" for
using objects instead of, say, closures, and how much (if anything)
you get back by turning a method into a closure (as I did with the
obj. closure test).  It looks like there isn't much penalty, which
makes objects much more attractive to me for certain applications, and
there's not much gain to be had by "closurizing" method calls.

Well, for closures you don't need to build the closure at call-time,
that happens when it is created.
