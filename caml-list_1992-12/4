Hi everyone

We're thinking of doing some experiments using CAML as the
basis for a parallel distributed system.  (It's only in the
early stages at present, so don't ask me how!!)  Is anyone
else doing anything with CAML and parallelism?  I'd be
especially interested in anyone who's ported Reppy's
Comcurrent ML constructs, but anything to do with parallel
execution would be of interest.

Thanks in advance,
