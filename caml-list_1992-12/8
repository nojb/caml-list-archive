I don't know the answer to your questions on installing CAML V3.1.
I'd just like to point out that if all you need is to run Caml Light
program written on your PC on Unix machines, the easiest way is to
install Caml Light on your Unix machines. You'll get full portability
between the PC and the Unix machine.

Caml Light for Unix is available by anonymous FTP from nuri.inria.fr,
directory lang/caml-light.
