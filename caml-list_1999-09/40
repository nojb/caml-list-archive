I think this can lead to a problem when using gards ('when' cases) in the
pattern matching.

typically,
let f=
  function
     n when n >= 0 -> true
   | n when n < 0 -> false;;

is said to have a non exhaustive matching but the pattern matching is
actually exhaustive.

This is because it is sometimes really tricky to look into when-clauses in
order to check if there are exhaustive or not.

This is a bit more explained in the FAQ:
http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/FAQ_EXPERT-eng.html#gardes_partielles

In your case, if your not using gards, I guess a little script may be able
to find which cases are not in the pattern matching.
(Maybe this can even be done using camlp4, I don't know)
