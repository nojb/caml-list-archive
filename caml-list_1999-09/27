I just came across the paper "Typing in object-oriented languages:
Achieving expressiveness and safety" by Kim Bruce, and was struck,
once I referred back to the O'Caml documentation on the new object
system, by the similarities.

So, I was just wondering whether the features of the new object system
are based on this paper, a predecessor of this paper, or perhaps the
language LOOM, which apparently shares syntax with the examples in the
paper.

(The presence of # types seems too much to be chance.)

Thanks,

John Prevost.
