John, have you tried Haskell? From what you write I think you haven't.

As a programmer, I want to type less, use less keywords, and still have as much
power.

This is one of the reasons I like Smalltalk better than Java. In Java you end
up with a screenful of compact source, while in Smalltalk, you have nice little
pieces combined to something useful.

Regards, Tommy
