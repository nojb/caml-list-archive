Hi,

It would be very helpful for me if the Caml compiler could report at least
one missing match case when it says a match is non-exhaustive.  Is this
feasible to implement fairly painlessly?  When working with very large
datatypes, e.g. 100 constructors, it's very hard to know which case has been
missed...

Thanks,
Don
