Good afternoon.
=09I need a double-ended queue implementation. The lists
can get very long, so I would like to use imperative operations to
change the links.

=09I've tried all the na=EFve type declarations --- all of which
don't seem to work.  I've tried the age old tricks. What am I not
understanding? or doing right? I'm not fussy: tuples, records or
objects are fine.

Best regards,

steve
