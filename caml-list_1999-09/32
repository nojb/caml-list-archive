> Were there any Y2K related changes in Ocaml from version 1.05 to 2.02?

No year 2000 changes.  As far as we know, all versions of OCaml are
Y2K-safe.

However, OCaml 1 has a year 2004 problem in the Unix library: the type
"int" was used to represent a number of seconds since the Unix epoch,
and since Caml integers are signed, 31 bit (on 32-bit platforms), this
causes a roll-over in Jan 2004.

To work around this problem, OCaml 2 uses the type "float" to
represent Unix time.  This ensures correct time values till the year
570843811, and progressive degradation of the accuracy of time values
afterwards :-)
