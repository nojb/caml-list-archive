ESOP is an annual conference devoted to the design,
specification and analysis of programming languages and
programming systems. Both practical and theoretical papers
are welcome. Possible topics include: Programming paradigms
and their integration, including concurrent, functional,
logic and object-oriented; computational calculi and
semantics; type systems, program analysis and concomitant
constraint systems; program transformation; programming
environments and tools. Papers pointing out new directions
or combining theory and practice are particularly
encouraged.

The conference proceedings will appear as a volume in the
LNCS series published by Springer-Verlag. ESOP accepted
papers are eligible for the EAPLS Best Paper Award, which is
given to the best paper presented at any of the ETAPS 2000
conferences.

Submitted papers must be in English and must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Simultaneous
submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS
conferences is forbidden. As accepted papers will be
restricted in length to 15 pages in the Springer-Verlag LNCS
style, authors are asked to adhere to this length and
format.

Authors are asked to submit their papers electronically.
Instructions are at http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~esop2000.
