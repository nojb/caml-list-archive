One issue that comes up if you are running on a 32-bit RISC machine is
alignment of doubles (8-byte floats): if you link against code which
has been compiled to assume that they are all 8-byte aligned, and use
it directly on ocaml float arrays, you get bus errors because ocaml
(on 32-bit machines) only aligns to 4-byte boundaries.  I have a patch
for ocaml which makes it align doubles on 8-byte boundaries.
