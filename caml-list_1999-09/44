The two object systems was designed independently and are actually
very different, even though they seem to have roughly the same
expressive power.  For instance, O'Caml has no notion of "MyType" and
does not use a matching relation (<#). But these two notions can more
or less be expressed using recursive types and type instantiation.

Indeed, I chose this syntax because the # abbreviations have
(very) roughly the same meaning as the # types of Kim Bruce.
