The following behaviour is clearly correct, but I think it is
undocumented:

Various functions in the String and Str modules accept
"String.length s" as a valid character index for "s". For example,

  Str.string_match regexp s (String.length s)

does not raise an Invalid_argument exception, but returns true or
false depending on whether regexp allows an empty string.

As mentioned above, I see that this is correct.

Should the documentation should be changed to mention this behaviour?


Thanks,

Steve
