Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OUD - call for participation

Dear OCaml users,

We have now updated the OUD website with the abstracts of all the 
speakers: http://oud.ocaml.org/2012/#schedule

As a reminder, early registration is on August 9th, so be sure to
register soon.  All of the student applications will receive a
response shortly, so thank you for all the applications.

There is a lot going on during the week of ICFP in addition to the
OCaml workshop, and you might want to also attend some of the other
events that are co-located (including the ML workshop the day before).
I have written an overview of the week here:
http://anil.recoil.org/2012/07/31/the-functional-week.html

We had a lot of fun last year in Japan, and I hope to see you all
in Copenhagen in September for an equally memorable get-together!
Feel free to contact myself or Didier with any queries.
