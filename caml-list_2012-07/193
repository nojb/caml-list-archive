Subject: [Caml-list] Beware of compiler internals (Was: ocamldoc for ocaml's
 compiler?)

Dear list,

The new 4.00 release has added fairly interesting feature relying on
the compiler internals: the new -bin-annot option allowing to export
and manipulate the typedtree of an OCaml program has already stirred
interest among tools writers (see Jun Furuse's OCamlspotter changes,
or the questions of Hongbo Zhang).

I just wanted to remark that the interface those tools expose are
*not* stabilized and will *certainly* change before the next OCaml
release: this code is very young, not reliable (don't expect all
features to work as advertized), and flaws will certainly be
discovered and fixed.

To my knowledge, there is no compatibility guarantee coming from the
compiler writers. Please keep that in mind when experimenting with
those features: they are experimental, and if you decide to rely on
them everyone will be interested in your feedback, but you're on your
own and you should expect maintenance work (or even feature loss)
during the next few releases.

Regards -- from San Francisco.
