Subject: [Caml-list] PLPV 2013 First Call for Papers

                    The Seventh ACM SIGPLAN Workshop
                                   on
      Programming Languages meets Program Verification (PLPV 2013)

                      http://plpv.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/

                           22nd January, 2013
                              Rome, Italy
                      (Affiliated with POPL 2013)

                            Call for Papers

Overview

The goal of PLPV is to foster and stimulate research at the
intersection of programming languages and program verification, by
bringing together experts from diverse areas like types, contracts,
interactive theorem proving, model checking and program analysis. Work
in this area typically attempts to reduce the burden of program
verification by taking advantage of particular semantic or structural
properties of the programming language.  One example are dependently
typed programming languages, which leverage a language's type system
to specify and check rich specifications.  Another example are
extended static checking systems which incorporate contracts with
either static or dynamic contract checking.

We invite submissions on all aspects, both theoretical and practical,
of the integration of programming language and program verification
technology. To encourage interaction between different
communities, we seek a broad scope for PLPV.  In particular,
submissions may have diverse foundations for verification (based on
types, Hoare-logic, abstract interpretation, etc), target
different kinds of programming languages (functional, imperative,
object-oriented, etc), and apply to diverse kinds of program
properties (data structure invariants, security properties, temporal
protocols, resource constraints, etc).

Important Dates

Submission	 8th October,  2012 (Monday)
Notification	 1st November, 2012 (Thursday)
Final Version	 8th November, 2012 (Thursday)
Workshop	22nd January,  2013 (Tuesday)

Submissions

We seek submissions of up to 12 pages related to the above
topics; shorter submissions are also welcome. Submissions may describe
new work, propose new challenge problems for language-based
verification techniques, or present a known idea in an elegant way
(i.e., a pearl).

Submissions should be prepared with SIGPLAN two-column conference
format. Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN republication
policy. Concurrent submissions to other workshops, conferences,
journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.

To submit a paper, access the online submission site at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plpv2013.

Publication

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital library.
