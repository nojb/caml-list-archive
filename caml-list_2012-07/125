Yes, this is perfectly right, and also already discussed
in the aforementioned PR. However, such links are scarce
while links to annot files (or annot files themselves, for
the matter) would really clutter the source directories.

At least, it is how I see things, but I am very interested
to gather input on the subject in order to reach consensus
on how to settle the issue.
