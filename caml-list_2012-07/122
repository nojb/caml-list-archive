I don't know if you will find my suggestion clean,
but when I encounter a similar problem I design an
ocamlbuild plugin that just copies the file to the
build directory.

This will avoid relying upon a relative path, and
fits ocamlbuild structure by just declaring a dependency
and a rule to barely copy the file from its original
place to the build directory. Notice that this is akin
to what ocamlbuild actually does for source file, the
only difference is that ocamlbuild cannot determine the
dependency in your case. Hence, you have to declare it
manually.


Hope this helps,
