Oh, I understand. Certainly I meant no slight on you! I can see how the
syntax definitions lead to a very complex state machine, and I'm often
surprised when the highlighting is correct in the face of complex
language features.

If no one else has, I might venture forward. Though I do wonder what
all those Vim folks at Janestreet are doing? I guess just suffer looking
at some confused highlighting in presence of first-class modules if they
are rare enough anyway.
