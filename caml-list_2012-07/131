The fact that Ocamlbuild does not pollute my working directory is a key 
feature to me and I would frown at everything which would compromise it. 
I don't even like the links to the executables and I call Ocamlbuild 
with the -no-links option.

Tuareg has been able to find the .annot files in the _build directory 
for some time now.
