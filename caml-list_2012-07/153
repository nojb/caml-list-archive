TSD SERIES

TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in
both spoken and written language processing from all over the world.
Proceedings of TSD form a book published by Springer-Verlag in their
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.  TSD Proceedings
are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation
Index.  Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major citation databases
such as DBLP, SCOPUS, EI, INSPEC or COMPENDEX.


The TSD 2012 conference will be accompanied by a one-day satellite workshop

    Hybrid Machine Translation

Topics of the MT Workshop include all themes of machine translation (with

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic with a

trade-fair center. Brno is the capital of South Moravia, which is
located in the south-east part of the Czech Republic and is known
for a wide range of cultural, natural, and technical sights.
South Moravia is a traditional wine region. Brno had been a Royal
City since 1347 and with its six universities it forms a cultural
center of the region.

Brno can be reached easily by direct flights from London, Moscow,
Saint Petersburg, Eindhoven, Rome and Prague and by trains or

Margraves, Church of St.  James, Cathedral of St. Peter & Paul,
