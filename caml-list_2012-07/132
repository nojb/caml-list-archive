It feels very odd, at first, that the "dep" function of the Ocamlbuild 
API declares a dependency for tags rather than for a given file. I 
understand the rationale, it is strictly more general as this allows to 
add a dependency to a file only in some specific context, i.e. for 
specific rules. But we have to tag the file first (unless all files are 
tagged with their own name? I don't remember). Tagging a file to be able 
to declare a dependency does not feel very intuitive to me.

I'm not even sure this works with every rules, I'm a little blurry on 
how tags are added to commands. Are all tags of the file names which 
appear in the command added automatically?

Cheers,
