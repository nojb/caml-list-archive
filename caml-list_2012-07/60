Subject: Re: [Caml-list] pretty-printing with camlp4?

As far as I know, no such facility exists in Camlp4.

Note however that there is quite a difference between parsers and
printers. Supporting extensible parsing is very difficult, because
parsing is quite a complex process. On the contrary, "printers" as
presented here or as implemented in Camlp4 are more like regular tree
traversals, calling a pretty-printing library that takes care of the
visual formatting aspects. An "extensible printer" can therefore be
summarized as an extensible tree traversal, something that is not too
difficult to achieve with a decent software architecture; for example
Camlp4's MapGenerator framework.

If you don't need the "extensible" parts of Camlp5 printer's support,
because your datatype to print is fixed, you can use the
pretty-printing library directly. Camlp4 uses the Format module of the
standard library, but I personally found it to be a bit painful to
use, and have a preference for the Pprint library of Fran=E7ois Pottier:
  http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/pprint/pprint.tar.gz

(There are other pretty-printing libraries for OCaml that I haven't
tried, such as Martin Jambon's easy-format:
http://mjambon.com/easy-format.html )

My advice would be to use one of those pretty-printing libraries, to
see if it fits your bill, or if you really need another abstraction
layer such as Camlp5 printers.
(Of course you can also use Camlp5 directly if it solves you problem.)
