Call for Contributions

ISWC2012 workshop on

What will the Semantic Web look like 10 years from now?

http://stko.geog.ucsb.edu/sw2022/


The Semantic Web, as a field, is undergoing a major shift. After 10 
years of mainly foundations-driven research, we now see strong 
indicators that Semantic Web methods are entering mainstream technology, 
in a number of forms. The consequent rise in commercial interest will 
likely have a fundamental impact on the field. Some established research 
results will make it into mainstream applications. Others will become 
obsolete. Radically new ideas will emerge. It is thus the right time for 
the community to contemplate the way ahead. In this workshop, we will 
provide an exciting forum for the discussion of the future of the 
Semantic Web. Researchers and practitioners from all corners of the 
field are invited to provide their insights and projections. The event 
will focus on discussions and the exchange of ideas, and will use a mix 
of different styles of interaction between the participants.

It is always good to try to look ahead and anticipate the development of 
a field. For the Semantic Web, it is now particularly important because 
recent developments indicate that Semantic Web technologies are entering 
the industrial mainstream. Schema.org and the Facebook Open Graph 
Protocol are bringing metadata to bear on the Web large-scale. IBM's 
Watson and Apple's Siri incorporate Semantic Technologies. Google is 
revamping its search approach and is going more semantic in implementing 
their knowledge graph. And these are just a few of the prominent examples.

The commercial uptake will be a game-changer for the field. It seems 
that only a fraction of the research results of the past ten years are 
currently being picked up. It seems that shallow semantics brings added 
value in many, but not all, application areas. In others it seems that 
there are roadblocks for which deep semantics is required for added 
value - but current approaches are still limited. Linked Data and Big 
Data are popular buzzwords right now, but could they be hitting a peak 
on the expectation curve? If so, what is going to happen in the 
subsequent dive? If not, how will those areas affect the field's future? 
In this workshop, we intend to bring together researchers from all 
corners of the broader Semantic Web community, to share and discuss 
projections of the way ahead in Semantic Web technologies and knowledge 
engineering in general.


WORKSHOP FORMAT AND STRUCTURE

This full-day workshop is open for all interested parties. We ask for 
responses to the question in the workshop's title, and they can be of a 
variety of formats, including short (4-6 page) papers, abstracts, 
slidesets or any other (up to 6 page) approach an author may wish to 
include. The submitted material will be assessed by the program 
committee and the organizers, and decisions will be made which of the 
contributions can be presented, and in what form. Depending on the 
contributions, we will have primarily short oral presentations, panel 
discussions, posters, and demos. Most importantly, the workshop will 
focus on the exchange of ideas and on discussions.


SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Sumissions, which are due by July 31, 2012, can take a variety of 
formats, limited to a maximum of 6 pages. They can be

* single-page abstracts

* short papers (4-6 pages)

* a set of slides (maximum 4 slides per page)

* any other format (e.g., HTML5 limited to an equivalent of 6 pages, 
audio or video limited by 5 minutes) - authors are encouraged to contact 
the chairs to get approval.

All accepted submissions will be made available through the workshop 
web-page and the electronic conference proceedings of ISWC 2012. 
Accepted papers and other suitable material will be made available via 
CEUR-WS. Selected papers may be considered for a fast-track submission 
to a Semantic Web journal. Submissions must be made via easychair at 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sw2022
