Subject: [Caml-list] 4.00.0 is coming

Dear OCaml users,

We are in the last stages of fixing bugs before 4.00.0 is released.
If your favorite bug report is still open and you want to know
whether we will fix it before 4.00.0, look at its "Target Version"
field.  If this is 4.00.0+dev, we are trying hard to fix your bug.
If it is not and you want to insist that we fix your bug before
the release, just drop me a note.  I'm not making any promise,
but we will carefully review your bug before taking a decision.

Thanks for your cooperation,

-- Damien
