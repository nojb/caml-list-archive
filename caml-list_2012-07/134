Subject: [Caml-list] CFP: Programming for Separation of Concerns at ACM SAC
 2013


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Call for Papers

Programming for Separation of Concerns (PSC) at
ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC)
www.dmi.unict.it/~tramonta/sac/


Coimbra, Portugal March 18-22, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Separation of concerns (SoC) techniques such as computational reflection, a=
spect-oriented programming (AOP), subject-oriented programming (SOP) and co=
ntext-oriented programming (COP) have been successfully employed to produce=
 systems whose concerns are well separated, thereby facilitating reuse and =
evolution of system components or systems as a whole. However, a criticism =
of such techniques is that they may bring about degraded performance compar=
ed with conventional software engineering techniques. Besides, it is diffic=
ult to precisely evaluate the degree of flexibility for reuse and evolution=
 of systems provided by the adoption of these SoC techniques. Other serious=
 issues come to mind, such as: is the use of these techniques double-edged?=
 Can these systems suffer a ripple effect, whereby a small change in some p=
art has unexpected and potentially dangerous effects on the whole?

The Programming for Separation of Concerns (PSC) track at the 2013 Symposiu=
m on Applied Computing (SAC) aims to bring together researchers to share ex=
periences in using SoC techniques, and explore the practical problems of ex=
isting tools, environments, etc. The track will address questions like: Can=
 performance degradation be limited? Are unexpected changes dealt with by r=
eflective or aspect-oriented systems? Is there any experience of long term =
evolution that shows a higher degree of flexibility of systems developed wi=
th such techniques? How such techniques cope with architectural erosion? Ar=
e these techniques helpful to deal with evolution of legacy systems?=20

Authors are invited to submit original papers. Submissions are encouraged, =
but not limited, to the following topics:

- Software architectures
- Configuration management systems
- Software reuse and evolution
- Performance issues for metalevel and aspect oriented systems (AOSD)
- Software engineering tools
- Consistency, integrity and security
- Generative approaches
- Experiences in using reflection, composition filters, aspect- subject- fe=
ature- orientation and change-oriented-software-engineering
- Evolution of legacy systems
- Reflective and aspect oriented middleware for distributed systems
- Modelling of SoC techniques to allow predictable outcomes from their use
- Formal methods for metalevel systems


Submission Guidelines
--------------------------------

Original papers from the above mentioned or other related areas will be con=
sidered. Only full papers about original and unpublished research are sough=
t. Parallel submission to other conferences or tracks is not acceptable.=20

Papers can be submitted in electronic format via the SAC website (www.softc=
onf.com/c/sac2013/) within 21 September 2012. Please make sure that the aut=
hors name and affiliation do not appear on the submitted paper.

Peer groups with expertise in the track focus area will blindly review subm=
issions to the track. At least one author of the accepted paper should regi=
ster and participate in the PSC track. Accepted papers will be published in=
 the annual conference ACM proceedings.

The camera-ready version of the accepted paper should be prepared using the=
 ACM format (guidelines will be given on the SAC website). The maximum numb=
er of pages allowed for the final papers is six (6), with the option, at ad=
ditional cost, to add two (2) more pages.

A set of papers submitted to the PSC track and not accepted as full papers =
will be selected as poster papers and published in the ACM proceedings as 2=
-page papers, with the option, at additional cost, to add one (1) more page.


Important Dates
----------------------

Paper Due September 21, 2012
Author Notification November 10, 2012
Camera Ready November 30, 2012
