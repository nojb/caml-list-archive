I believe both SourceForge and Savannah require that the projects they
host all be Open Source.

Personally, I release software under the Hacktivismo License (
http://hacktivismo.com/hessla.html ) which supports human rights and
prohibits the software from being used to spy on people, etc.  I have
an additional provision that my software may not be used to wage or
support war, by the military, or by military contractors.

While I distribute my software with source code, and allow most anyone
to copy and modify it at will and for free, it is still not technically
"Open Source", as it does not allow people to use it to wage war,
etc...  So my projects, for example, could not be hosted on Savannah or
SF.

I am not sure what the status of the rest of the software created for
OCaml is, but I would bet that at least some of it does not strictly
conform to the definition of Open Source, and would therefore fall in
the same boat.
