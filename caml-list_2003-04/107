Personally, I don't find having to type three extra characters (space
asterix close-paren) to end a comment to be that big of a burden.  If a
comment is long enough that three extra characters pushes it over a line
length, then the comment is long enough to deserve it's own line.  And if
the burden of typing the three extra characters is enough that you stop
writting (as many) comments, well, you have other problems IMHO.

I am not seriously opposed to this, I just don't see the value.
