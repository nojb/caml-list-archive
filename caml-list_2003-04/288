Hey, somebody yell if you've been able to use the digraph and dynarray code I 
posted earlier! I'd also love to have wishlists!!!

Some other things I forgot to mention: An undirected graph adaptor is easy. I 
initially started with a vertex/edge weighted graph... Also I plan to 
functor-ize the graph modules making it more generic, ultimately the 
representation should be abstracted away completely. Then you have classes, 
oops, modules that have different time/space complexities for storage and 
update, query operations....

BTW, does somebody have a good idea of how to make one module inherit from 
another? Say, for implementing Graph using Digraph. It's too bad there isn't 
an Ada like package extension mechanism.

Cheers,
