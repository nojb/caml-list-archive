That's precisely the simple idea used in htmlc (see
http://pauillac.inria.fr/htmlc/eng.htm): the HTML templates are HTML
files with SSI directives and occurrences of variables to be replaced
by their values. Variable values are defined separately in simple
configuration files; environment specific variables can also occur:
their value is then picked up from the environment.

Normally, those HTML templates are statically compiled while updating
the Web site (thus checking for errors in advance, before serving the
pages). However, htmlc can be called dynamically to produce the answer
to a query.

Htmlc is written in Objective Caml and you're welcome to join the
development team or send enhancement patches; any suggestion is also
warmly welcome.

All the best,

Pierre Weis
