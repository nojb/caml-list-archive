IMHO many people just want to issue their SQL commands and get
back the resulting rows, without writing too much code. And they 
don't use many of the special features, like asynchronous messages etc. 

If someone want's to start a DBI-like interface, please also have a look
at Ruby/DBI (I'm the creator of it). 

http://ruby-dbi.sf.net

And it's DBI specification:

http://ruby-dbi.sourceforge.net/DBI_SPEC.html

Also take a look at Python's DB API.

Even if I'm not a OCaml guy, I'd like to help with the interface
as much as I can.

You can't compare JDBC with DBI. DBI is a very pragmatic approach to
a database interface, without much overhead (in terms of additional code), 
whereas JDBC doesn't help write less code. I don't like to read hundreds
of pages, before I can issue a simple SQL statement. With DBI, it's just
5 lines of code.
