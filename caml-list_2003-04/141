Actually, I was about to use this as an argument for why multi-line 
comments are better.  I do this a lot- comment out huge swaths of code, 
and then uncomment it one function at a time.  I do this by moving the (* 
around.  Very fast.  Very simple.  Simply dd on the line with the (*, page 
or arrow down to the next break point, and do a p.

Oh don't be silly.  Of course we need a GUI- so we can multiple xterms on 
the same screen!  :-)

A more legitimate analogy would be not needing both a mouse and a 
trackball.  You know- some people prefer mice, and others track balls, and 
sometimes it's more easy to use one than the other, so we really need 
both.
