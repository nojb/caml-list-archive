If every developer could maintain archives of their own software on the
server then that would probably be ideal.

Alternatively, if the solution chosen requires a group of
administrators to maintain the archives then I have some spare time to
assist in this effort.

A seperate, but important issue is finding, installing and maintaining
server software and applications that will provide services such as:
authentication of the contributing developers or administrators,
archiving of old versions of the software, providing a searchable list
of the available software, allowing mirroring and backups.

I am guessing that what will be required, at minimum, will be a web
server, and probably a database, along with an application (possibly
just static html, or maybe something more) that integrates all of the
services noted above and/or any others that might be useful.

There are probably all sorts of turn-key solutions that do all of this,
but I am not of aware of any myself.

Are there any suggestions along these lines regarding what we can use?
