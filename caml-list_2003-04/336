Hi, 
I chanced upon this in /. today:

"Schemix is a Scheme running in the Linux kernel. It 
presents /dev/schemix to send Scheme forms to, and has extensions to read 
and set (C) kernel variables, call kernel functions, and make devices. If 
you've wanted to prototype your drivers in a high-level language that's 
100% in the kernel, here you go." 


Haven't looked in deep detail, but it sounds pretty nifty if it works 
well. Does anyone know if there would be any fundamental obstacles for 
doing something similar with ocaml?


thanks
henri
