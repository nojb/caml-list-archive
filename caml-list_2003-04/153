The most likely explanation is that you created a very large list, say of 
length over 50_000, and tried to apply some non-tail-recursive operation to it, 
perhaps even implicitly. There was a very recent thread on this topic. 

The second explanation is that you wrote some (non-tail) recursive function 
and it blew the stack. 

If you switch to the bytecode compiler and run with stack trace, you'll find out 
pretty quickly.
