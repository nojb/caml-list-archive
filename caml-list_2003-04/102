Hello to everybody

I've connected a ocamlex/ocamlyacc parser to a graphical button; this parser 
parses a file. 

When I click on the button repeatedly and fast several times, the parser 
starts but it crashes. Failures happen at unrelated, apparently random 
positions, and strace shows unrelated, apparently random (in the range of 
open files) Unix.select errors before the parse_error. 

I have put Unix.lockf locks, but readers are not exclusive. So I thought to 
skip the whole reparsing in case a reading lock is already there, but the 
F_TEST (*Test a region for other process locks*) command is documented for 
use in Unix.lockf : file_descr -> lock_command -> int -> unit, that returns 
unit, so how could a TEST ever be possible?

Any hint? BTW the whole is in a program with threads and runs in a ocaml 
compiled with posix threads, but this part does not use threads. 

Thank you in advance for any advice

Ernesto
