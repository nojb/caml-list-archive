Very subjectively, I found that labltk was simpler to code, at least
for simple GUIs.  The appearance is fairly clean and attractive
(especially if you override the default fonts), but looks somewhat
out-of-place in a more modern desktop environment.

I found lablgtk more complex to code, but it is more flexible and has
a richer set of ready-made components.  It is very attractive, and
(obviously) fits in well on a Gnome desktop.
