The jail(8) facility in FreeBSD allows that: you may create a virtual
machine inside a server, which is completely isolated from everything
else inside the host machine. Some ISPs are using it to provide root
accounts.
Still, I expect that setting up a really secure virtual machine is far
from trivial: you get just the same problems as with a real machine.

By the way, I recall somebody talking about setting up a cvs server
written in ocaml (safe and fast code) inside a FreeBSD jail to provide
maximum security.  I don't know how far that project went. Maybe he is
reading this list and can provide more details.
