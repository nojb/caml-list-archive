Aha!  OK- here is a really good reason to add single line comments, with 
#! as the comment delimiter- so we can put
#!/usr/local/bin/ocaml
as the first line in our programs, and have Ocaml as an interpreted 
scripting language, as well as a interpreter/bytecode/native language.

proposal.

All of the above are valid operator names.  Not sure about [*].  See page
