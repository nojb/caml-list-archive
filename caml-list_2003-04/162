Funny, I am currently also applying my tool to NLP (natural language
processing): because of the isomorphism between context-free grammars and
algebraic datatyes, it is possible to learn propositions about derivation
trees (or even more general: learn non-recursive functions). The problem
there is rather the size of CFG extracted from a large, annotated
corpus for German (many, many thousands of productions), which really
looks messy.

But that's what the closure is for: it abstracts away the subtree that
still needs to be computed.

Given that you already run into problems for comparatively small sizes,
I suppose that you are using the byte-code interpreter? Its builtin
stack space is 256KB, i.e. 64K-words.

Yes, I haven't yet implemented handling of continuous attributes, because
I am aiming at an even more general system, where you can specify abstract
algebras (signatures) that describe how to handle values of some abstract
types, i.e. not only continuous (numeric) values. I have already done
so separately in another project, but wasn't very satisfied with the
design. Furthermore, I'd like to integrate it into AIFAD.

That would be great! - Thanks!
