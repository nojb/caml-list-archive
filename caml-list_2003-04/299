Well, when I selected the JServ protocol (=AJP), the main reason was its
simplicity. You don't need 309 pages to describe it, the network
protocol is much simpler (it's basically CGI over a socket).
Furthermore, many people used it, and it is included in every Linux
distro.

I never compared AJP with fastcgi, I just picked something that worked.

The disadvantage of AJP is that there have been numerous and frequent
updates of the protocol since AJP-1.2 (what I implemented for O'Caml).
Up to now, even the newest JK connector supports the old version 1.2,
but this will likely change some day, and we need an implementation for
a newer version.
