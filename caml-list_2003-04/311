In case you need specific drivers provided by LAPACK or BLAS but not
yet interfaced from LACAML, there are two ways to change this situation:

  * Contribute code that interfaces the function. Since LAPACK is a huge
    library with tons of specialized algorithms, this is the preferred
    solution :-)

  * Send your wish to either <Christophe.Troestler@umh.ac.be> or to me.

It's really not that difficult to add further drivers. Just follow
the numerous examples of already implemented functions. In the case of
difficulties, don't hesitate to ask questions!

Markus Mottl
