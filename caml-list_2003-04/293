I can't comment on JServ vs FastCGI, but you've got
the wrong end of the stick with this one.  JServ, now
superseded by JK

 
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-4.1-doc/jk2/index.html

is basically another protocol for Apache to talk to an
external application server.  The reason you'd use it
is that the Jakarta Apache people are writing and
maintaining it, and they are active and numerous.

HTH,
Noel
