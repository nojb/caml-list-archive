The problem is the following :

when you compile ml files into obj, a C file is created, with the =
necessary
byte code (compilation of the ml). It also defines function such as =
startup
for initializing your byte code into the gc.

If you have several ml files, you should do the following :
compile .ml into cmo.
join all the cmo with -linkall compiler options into a .obj.

use the resulting .obj (unique) for linking your dll.

This should work.

Objet : [Caml-list] C++ embedded ocaml and shared libraries


Hi

I'm trying to embed some ocaml code into a C shared library with C =
code.=20
I can produce a static library that does what I want, but I really need =
to
get a shared library and all attempts I've made so far have failed.

Basically I'm trying to compile 2 ml source files into objects and then =
put
these together with objects from C code, which call out to the caml =
code,
into the shared library. However the library creation fails telling me =
there
are multiply defined symbols (eg caml_startup) in the objects produced =
from
the 2 ml source files.

Can anybody give me a hint (or even better an example) as to how to do =
this.
The only examples I can find on the web relating to embedding ocaml in =
C and
then creating a shared library involve 1 ml file and 1 C file and in =
this
instance I don't get the multiple symbol problem.

Any help appreciated

thanks

Ian
