Yep.  Checked that before posting.  It does mean you can't run your ocaml 
code through the C preprocessor- although I have no clue why you'd want to 
do that.

If I'm working alone, this works.  If I'm working with other people, or on 
other people's code, this may not be an option.

If we had single-line comments, and the proposal was to add multi-line 
comments, I'd feel the same way.

And Larry Wall is maybe not the best person to be taking style tips from 
for Ocaml.  If Perl is the archtype of post-modern programming languages, 
than Ocaml must the the paragon of modern programming languages ("I am the 
very model of a modern language paradigm...").  And I think there are 
advantages to "modern" (in the Wall sense) languages.  But I am not here 
to praise Larry Wall, but to bury him.

Actually, personally I think ## is ugly, in that it looks entirely unlike 
Ocaml's current comment-start sequence of (*.  At least with C++, /* and 
// are similiar *visually*.
