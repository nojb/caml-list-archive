Actually this is not an answer to the original question: it was about
changing the linking/path for an already built library.
My point was just that, unfortunately you cannot go into dll???.so to
modify it afterwards individually.

But ocamlmklib also builds lib???.a, which contains exactly the same
objects as dll???.so. So you can also act in this case by re-building
dll???.so from lib???.a, if you know enough about your system's
linker. (Currently when you compile C files with ocamlc, this produces
PIC objets, so that lib???.a shall contain only PIC objects, but this may
change in the future.)

If you want to set the runpath at build time with ocamlmklib, you can
already do it with the -rpath option. LD_RUN_PATH may be an
alternative on some systems.

Cheers,
