I believe "properly structuring the configuration and build" should
suffice to get ocamlopt to cross-compile, however this is probably not
trivial.

Christian Gillot did a cross-compiler for the ARM, see
        http://www.neo-rousseaux.org/cgillot/en/ocamlhacks.html
but he didn't detail the build process...
