Hi, 

I have a callback function which i would like to reschedule itself into 
the event queue that called it.
In order to be able to refer to the function within the body (ie, pass 
'clock_tick' as argument to sched#sched_in), the only think i could think 
of was to make it recursive, even though it isn't (because the 
sched#sched_in call returns immediately). 

Is this a perversion of the 'let rec' construct? Is there a better way to 
get around it? Thanks.

hdf


let rec clock_tick() = (
  ... 
  do stuff
  ...

  sched#sched_in ~handler:clock_tick ~t:1.0;
)
