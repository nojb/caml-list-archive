Hello all,

I'm willing to put some time into maintaining such a thing.  I also work
actively on the SWIG project's Ocaml module.

Perhaps it will be possible to use ocamlfind as the basis for a coherent
(in the global sense) module set.  It's also feasible (disk space allowing)
to provide the whole archive ocamldoc tree available as HTML.  That would
make it easy to find out if an archive does what you want before downloading
it, and what the dependencies are.
