Yes, this all looks very nice, and even will be usefull for me, but i ask:
Why it isn't built in?
I mean: is there any reason (performance propably) for treating some 
constructinons diffrently.
There is global "let ident = expr " and local "let ident = expr in"
There is global "type ident = typedef" and no local pair.

Local modules are fine, but they are not so user friendly.
