Yes, I'm looking for is a light-weight, auto-balancing data-structure.
It does not necessarily need to be a tree.  It does not necessarily
need to be functional.  So far I have experimented with specialized
code, maps, treaps and splay-trees.  I still haven't found the Silver
Bullet or Holy Grail.  I'll summarize my findings later this month.

To re-iterate, I'm looking for a general purpose data-structure that
can collect large amounts of data, perform and prepare it for input to
specialized algorithms.  This typically means adding lots of elements
and lists of elements and then removing (controlled mapping) of those
elements preferably in random order.
