Thanks for the clear explanation. The remaining quid is to better define
the concept of "trusted people" :)

Here at university of Bologna we are used to give "guest" accounts to
people that accept to subscribe an "assumption of responsibilities" (I
hope this is a correct english translation) for action performed with
their guest account. Do you use a similar approach at INRIA?

No, it seems a reasonable given that "trusted people" are enough to
maintain the project.

Cheers.
