You/We should talk about the hows of an open editable hump (wiki
vs. maintained projects with fixed admins etc) first, the holy
OS wars can wait, no ? And After all, we should leave the decision
which OS to deploy to the INRIA. So we should get to the content
(still leaving out package systems (pkgsrc! ports! rpm! deb!))
management, and how THAT should happen. Getting lost in holy wars
doesn't add to productivity.


I myself favour a Wiki based systems with restrictions based on
the uploading file(s) part, i.e. only a project creator (he who
scribeth the application/library) should be able to alter the
file, documentation, other cruft required / added should be
editable by anyone, especially with comments or examples of use,
adding/maintaining links to related libs/software etc., and have
one big-bad-admin who watches the wiki and takes care no /.-jokers
delete pages of things they don't like :)
