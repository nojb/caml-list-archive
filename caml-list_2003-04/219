 Nice? May be. But impossible. E.g., for Oracle you have to use
prepared statements with variables substitution, when in
Postgres there is no need to mess with this stuff - performance
is good enough if you create a new statement for every request.

 Postgres have asyncronous messages. OCI don't. Other database
interfaces could be even more different...

 I have no problems in using two quite different APIs in a
mid-layer - Oracle and Postgres. And I don't think I'll ever will
try to use any kind of generic interface. I ate this shit with
JDBC, and I don't want it any more...
