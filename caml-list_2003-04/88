Hi

I'm trying to embed some ocaml code into a C shared library with C code. 
I can produce a static library that does what I want, but I really need to
get a shared library and all attempts I've made so far have failed.

Basically I'm trying to compile 2 ml source files into objects and then put
these together with objects from C code, which call out to the caml code,
into the shared library. However the library creation fails telling me there
are multiply defined symbols (eg caml_startup) in the objects produced from
the 2 ml source files.

Can anybody give me a hint (or even better an example) as to how to do this.
The only examples I can find on the web relating to embedding ocaml in C and
then creating a shared library involve 1 ml file and 1 C file and in this
instance I don't get the multiple symbol problem.

Any help appreciated

thanks

Ian
