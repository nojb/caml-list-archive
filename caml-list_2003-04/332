There's a workaround.  I wish I knew enough emacs lisp to fix
caml-mode itself.

I find that when the indentation gets confused below a comment, I can
go up to the line before the comment, hit tab (which is bound to
caml-indent-command), and then come back to the line I'm working on.
Then indentation will work properly.

I tried to come up with a minimal example that exhibits the problem
but couldn't.  If anyone wants to see the source file that exibits the
problem, let me know, and I'll send it off-list.
