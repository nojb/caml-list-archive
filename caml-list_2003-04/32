Hello, 

Even if i am not from the inria, i agree with ocamlfind and odoc. It is two
great tools which simplify a lot ocaml developpement ( personnaly i need
to compile myself some source to produce ocaml documentation ). 

If it is possible, followinf should be mentioned in a document like
"requirement for a software to enter the archive" :
 - use and provide ocamlfind and META
 - can produce ocamldoc documentation
