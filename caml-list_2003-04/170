This is slightly off-topic, but:

In the case of dynamic WWW pages, it is often the case that the same
script or program actually contains code written in several languages:
HTML, SQL, OCaml/PHP/Perl, XML...

For integration, a mechanism of quotation/antiquotations (à la Camlp4) is
nice.

Are there any text editors that are aware of such mixed programs?

Another alternative for HTML would be to have a regular HTML page, perhaps
edited with HTML generation tools (FrontPage, Quanta+...), with special
tags indicating special actions.

For instance: a table output from a bibliographic database would look like
<table><tbody>
<foreach item=entry><td><param name=author></td>
<td><param name=title></td></foreach>
</tbody></table>

It would only be a matter of parsing this regular HTML page with a SGML
parser such as OCamlNet, replacing <foreach>...</foreach> by iteration and
<param> tags by iteration variables.

Has there been something done around that kind of things?
