But that a) requires you to put it in scope at the top of each file, and 
more importantly b) means you can't use = anywhere, doesn't it?  That seems 
kinda strong for the very specific check, and the abstract type thing 
(which was going to be my suggestion as well, but I forgot you could do it 
with Obj all in caml!) is both localized and only catches the ones you care 
about.
