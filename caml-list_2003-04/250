No, it's not.  Only 32-bit PPC is currently supported.

You'll get the same problem with the asm code generated by ocamlopt.
And I'm afraid that if you compile everything in 32-bit mode, you'll
end up with a 32-bit program that can only access the low 4G of memory.

Currently, your only options are to use an Alpha or an Itanium.
