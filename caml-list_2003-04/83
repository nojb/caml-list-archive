I was thinking about setting up a kind of "wiki humps", even before this
discussion, since I'm developing a tool to quickly develop wikis
(with more structure than just pages, that is "elements" with various
attributes, editable or not depending on who's connected and so on).

This way, each contributor updates information about his contribs.

The "wiki humps" would basically contain the same information as
the current humps, but could then be enhanced to handle a repository
of files.

Upload of OCamldoc-generated documentation could also be supported 
to give an overview of each library's interface, and search through 
all interfaces... Just an idea.
