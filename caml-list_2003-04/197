Let's see ...

* Tk has a limited selection of widgets. From what you said of your
  project, it may well have all you need, but it is lacking a few things
  that people seem to expect to find in "modern" GUI toolkits: spin
  buttons, paned windows, tabbed notebooks, tree displays ...

* Last time I checked (several months ago), GTK was considered to be
  less-than-production-quality on Windows and MacOS, whereas Tk has been
  in use on those platforms for a long time.

* (My impression is that) GTK has good Unicode support. Tk has had issues
  with i18n for some time. The latest versions may be up to par, but I'm
  not sure. Probably either would be fine for Western European
  languages; the problems I have heard of were mostly related to CJKV.

* If you need to use raster graphics, you should be aware that Tk only
  has built-in support for GIF and PBM/PGM/PPM/PNM file formats. I'm not
  sure, but I would assume that GTK supports JPEG, PNG, and other modern
  formats.

Hope that helps a bit.
