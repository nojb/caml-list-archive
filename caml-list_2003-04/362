Start with, I think you meant [| 6; 3; 5; 7; 8 |].  Notice the semicolons.  
I say this only because I've been caught on this several times before :-}.

I thought ints were always unboxed.  They fit into a word.  That's why 
they're 31 bits, not 32 bits- the low bit is a tag so the GC can 
differentiate pointers from ints.
