1) This extension won't broke existing source code. Currently, we can't u=
se=20
'##' anywhere in Ocaml.

2) This is programming-style extension. I.e. if you don't like don't use =
it.

For example, Larry Wall see no reason for multi-line comments. He argued =
that=20
single-line comments are much easier to read (See Perl6 design documents)=
=2E

Again, this extension is purely stylish.
