The prototype top-level is almost two years old. It's only for playing in the 
top level, you can't use the module system. Still, it's pretty cool. Having 
all of those features in a future Caml will be a major leap for ML. It doesn't 
just satisfy the simple desire for overloading + and print and all that, but 
allows you to write some pretty wild functions in a  type safe manner!

I suspect so, since safe value IO is a very high priority, and my understanding 
is that once that is in that generics is not a huge addition.  

The big question is: when? I guess we'll know when it happens. This is one of 
my most desired language enhancements too.

Not that I know of.
