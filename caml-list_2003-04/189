No, that's by design AFAIK. I'm no longer using begin-end, because I like 
punctuation to be light on the eye.

You seem to have missed the difference between ( ... ) and { ... }, the
message you answered used the first form.

There's a big problem with introducing { ... } as synonymous for begin-end:
constructs like  { a = b }  become ambiguous and only the type-checker can
lift the ambiguity.
