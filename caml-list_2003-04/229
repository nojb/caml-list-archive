Hello,

I have a question with regard to memory management and using the
Dynlink module.

Is there some way to "unload" the code once you are done using it?  It
seems like a reference is kept to the loaded unit, thus it never gets
garbagecollected.  The Dynlink module does not seem to have any
functions which can be called to brake this reference.  Any trick to
brake this reference and make the loaded code garbage collected would
be appreciated.


Kindest regards,

Hans Ole Rafaelsen
