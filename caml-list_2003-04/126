Ever been on a coding standards committee?  I have.  Loads of fun.  
Seriously, coding standards are a really good idea- when they can be 
enforced.  But there are lots of situations where they can't be.  One 
obvious example is open source.

The language architects version of planting vines.  On the other hand, 
this complaint can be fixed simply by changing the keystroke combination, 
to say (| or (/ (the second being the obvious reference to C++'s /* and 
//).
