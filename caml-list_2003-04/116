How is it possible that different instances of a ocamlyacc parser applied to a 
complete, closed file spoil each other's reading, but _when I fork the 
process and have the parent Unix.wait for the child_ everything gets OK?? 

The only solution springing to my mind is that ocamlyacc is not quite 
reentrant! 
What should I do then?
