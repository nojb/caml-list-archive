The usual way to make a child widget change size along with its parent
is to use the 'expand' and 'fill' arguments to 'pack', e.g.:

  pack [c] ~expand:`Yes ~fill:`Both;

It's a bit more complex with Grid, but you can still do it; I suppose
there's a way to do it with Place, too, but I never use Place, so I
can't tell you how.

Or is there some reason that won't work for you?
