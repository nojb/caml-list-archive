ocaml (as opposed to ocamlc) recognizes this as comment, but only at the
first line of a file.

Neither [*] nor #! are accepted by ocamlc as operator names.

I personally would find single line comments useful for turning various
debugging (single line) calls on/off, e.g.:

  f ();
  (* dbg "f done"; *)
  let i = g () in
  dbg "g done, %d" i;
  h ()

But I don't care much, just need to write vim macro :-)
