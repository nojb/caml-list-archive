Sure. What you are doing here

    !groups.(!q) := ar;

is trying to assign an array ref as the *value* of a ref. In other
words, you're trying to replace something like:

    [|"Phred","Sue"|]

with

    { contents = [|"Karla","Hans"|] }

which is obviously a different type ( string array ref instead of string
array). I think what you want to do is
    
    !groups.(!q) <- ar;

The revised version is replacing an array element (which is a ref) with
a new ref.
