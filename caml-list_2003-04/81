Hi All,

Thank you everybody for being interested at maintaining a standalone
set of Caml software for the communauty.

I'm afraid I will not be able to set up the thing and answer to
everybody before the end of my vacations (during the full next
week). I will tell you more the week after!

INRIA is a strange and complex house: we may have a machine inside
INRIA with all the corresponding facilities (no power failures, good
connectivity, full automatic backup), while maintaining this machine
outside the INRIA firewall (so, there is no way for you to connect
from this machine to a machine inside the INRIA network (even if it is
50 cm away from the machine you are logged in!)). By the way, there is
no ``Joe Random Ocaml Developer'' here: we will give accounts to
selected people only (trusted people I would say).

I was thinking of something like that, experimenting with a machine
outside our firewall and running a strong and secure OS (FreeBSD ?) to
have a very low maintenance cost.

Do you think this would be a reasonable solution ? Are there problems
I do not imagine ?

All the best,

Pierre Weis
