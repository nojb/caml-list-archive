I'm trying to create a binding to sqlite.  It seems to work most of the
time, except occasionally it makes the ocaml GC segv.

If anyone has time to glance at this binding, I would really appreciate
it, perhaps just another pair of eyes might find the problem.
Otherwise, if I can't find anything wrong with the binding, I might have
to go try and figure out if sqlite is steping on the ocaml heap somehow.

Since the file is lengthy, I've put it on my web server:

<http://www.davidb.org/sqlite/sqlite-stub.c>
<http://www.davidb.org/sqlite/sqlite.ml>

I can mail the files to anyone who requests them.

Once I make these bindings work, I can release them :-)

Thanks,
Dave
