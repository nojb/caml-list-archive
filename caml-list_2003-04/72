There is a precedent: http://starship.python.net, where all the club 
members have a login. Originally you had to pay for this and the fee 
went to support the Python development, but now it just retains the 
existing logins.

Of course, some templates may be worked out to support a consistent 
style of package entries on the main page, like those Hump has now.
