        Objective Caml version 3.06

# let (--) =3D (+) ;;
val ( -- ) : int -> int -> int =3D <fun>
# let (%%) =3D (+) ;;
val ( %% ) : int -> int -> int =3D <fun>
# let (##) =3D (+) ;;
Syntax error

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

We must find a sequence that can't be used as a binary operator.

P.S.
=09I have nothing against '--', '%%' or whatever. I just want to see easi=

typed single-line comment in Ocaml.
