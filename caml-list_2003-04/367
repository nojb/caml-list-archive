In the "Interfacing with C" section of the manual:

---
18.3.3     Arrays

Arrays of integers and pointers are represented like tuples, that is, as 
pointers to blocks tagged 0. They are accessed with the Field macro for 
reading and the modify function for writing.

Arrays of floating-point numbers (type float array) have a special, 
unboxed, more efficient representation. These arrays are represented by 
pointers to blocks with tag Double_array_tag. They should be accessed 
with the Double_field and Store_double_field macros.
---

So it looks like the standard ocaml 31 bit integers arrays are unboxed, 
as are floats arrays.
