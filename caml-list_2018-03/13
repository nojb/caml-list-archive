Subject: [Caml-list] 1st call for papers: Trends in Functional Programming,
 11-13 june 2018, Chalmers Campus Johanneberg, Gothenburg

                     ======== TFP 2018 ===========
                          
           19th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
                            11-13 June, 2018
                      Chalmers Campus Johanneberg, Gothenburg
            http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~myreen/tfp2018/index.html

The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see
below at scope).

Please be aware that TFP uses two distinct rounds of submissions (see
below at submission details).

TFP 2018 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming
events. TFP 2018 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take
place on June 14.


== SCOPE ==

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes.
As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the
following five article categories. High-quality articles are solicited in
any of these categories:

Research Articles:
     Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
Position Articles:
     On what new trends should or should not be
Project Articles:
     Descriptions of recently started new projects
Evaluation Articles:
     What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
Overview Articles:
     Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject.

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication to
any other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:
theoretical, implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of
functional programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope
of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

     Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
     Functional programming in the cloud
     High performance functional computing
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
     Dependently typed functional programming
     Validation and verification of functional programs
     Debugging and profiling for functional languages
     Functional programming in different application areas:
     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
     systems, global computing, grids, etc.
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages
     Novel memory management techniques
     Program analysis and transformation techniques
     Empirical performance studies
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
     (Embedded) domain specific languages
     New implementation strategies
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, please
contact the TFP 2018 program chairs, Michał Pałka and Magnus Myreen.


== Best Paper Awards ==

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper
accepted for the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging
that students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student
paper is one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of
students, the students are listed as first authors, and a student would present
the paper. A prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best
paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive both prizes.


== Paper Submissions ==

We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. The link to the submission page is:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2018

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally reviewed
either before or after the Symposium.


== Pre-symposium formal review ==

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted before
an early deadline and receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for
both presentation and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been
rejected in this process may still be accepted for presentation at the symposium,
but will not be considered for the post-symposium formal review.


== Post-symposium formal review ==

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance for
presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit
revised papers based on the feedback receive at the symposium. A post-symposium
refereeing process will then select a subset of these articles for formal publication.


== Paper categories ==

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as extended
abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must
clearly indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project,
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors are research
students, and whether the main author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all
authors are students will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members
shortly after the symposium has taken place.


== Format ==

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more
information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site.
