LOGIC & LEARNING SCHOOL
July 1-6, 2018 (immediately before FLoC 2018)
Oxford, UK

**The early bird registration deadline is April 15.**

The Logic & Learning School is an opportunity to learn from, and
interact with, the world's experts leading recent progress in
understanding the relationships between logic and learning. These
experts come from both academia and some of the leading industrial
research labs (Amazon Research and DeepMind).

In the last few decades, logic has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for understanding complex systems. It has turned out to be
instrumental in formal methods such as program verification, reasoning
about hardware, reasoning about real-time systems and, more recently,
probabilistic systems. Machine learning has recently had spectacular
successes in fields such as image recognition, game playing, and many
areas that involve the extraction of information from large datasets.
The use of statistical approaches yields practical solutions to
problems that seemed out of reach just a few years ago. The
understanding of why these approaches are so successful has lagged
behind the empirical successes. Using logic as the foundation to
understand machine learning to obtain the best of both worlds is a
major challenge.

The programme of the Logic & Learning School consists of eleven
lectures of three hours each, starting with five introductory courses
on computational and statistical learning theory, reinforcement
learning, Bayesian inference, and automata learning and six advanced
courses on exciting and recent developments relating logic and
learning. The lectures target an audience of logicians and computer
scientists broadly construed and do not assume any knowledge on
machine learning. Accordingly, the School represents a perfect
opportunity to learn for both students and working researchers. The
School will take place in St Anne's College in the centre of Oxford,
an ideal learning environment with accommodation and lunches provided
on site. The lectures will be from Sunday 1 July in the morning to
Friday 6 July in the afternoon, which is the week before the main
activities of FLoC.

The Summer School on Foundations of Programming and Software Systems
(FoPSS) was jointly created by ETAPS, SIGLOG, SIGPLAN and EATCS. It is
additionally sponsored by the Department of Computer Science at
Oxford.

Registration

The summer school is a residential course held at St Anne's College,
Oxford. The registration fee includes bed & breakfast accommodation
for 6 days (1-6th July 2018), buffet lunches and evening meals. There
will be a banquet on 4th July at St Johns College.

Arrivals are on 30th June 2018 and departures on 6th July. As the
number of rooms available at St Anne's is very limited, early
registration is strongly advised to avoid disappointment.

Registration fees are:

Early bird     =C2=A3750      15 April, 2018
Late           =C2=A3850      15 May, 2018

The summer school is perfectly aligned for students who want to attend
the four-yearly Federated Logic Conference (FLOC) taking place in
Oxford after the summer school.
FLOC will feature a number of AI-related events, including a public
lecture by Stuart Russell at the Sheldonian Theatre
(http://www.floc2018.org/speaker/stuart-russell/
