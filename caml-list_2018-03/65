TAMIS is an Inria cybersecurity research team located in Rennes, in wonderf=
ul Brittany, France.

Systems security requires both formal and engineering techniques to assess =
or even secure systems. Modernsystems are networked, use virtual machines t=
o improve security and handle multiple applications concurrently on the sam=
e hardware, which is often enhanced to with hardware security modules. The =
resulting complexity is typically far beyond what formal verification techn=
iques can manage. On the other hand, merely applying engineering techniques=
 to build secure systems has consistently resulted in deployments riddled w=
ith significant vulnerabilities.

TAMIS=E2=80=99 central goal is thus to demonstrably narrow the gap between =
the vulnerabilities found using formal verification and the issues found us=
ing systems engineering. Type theory is a representative examplewhere forma=
l verification and software engineering are combined, as in type theory for=
mal methods are used to formally prove the absence of certain classes of bu=
gs. However, it is not the case that the entire system is shown to be forma=
lly correct with respect to a morecomprehensive specification, which requir=
es software engineering effort to handle classes of bugs not captured by th=
e type system.


TAMIS thus aim at creating tool chains that combine statistical model check=
ing, abstract interpretation, supervisedexecution and manual annotations to=
 efficiently check interesting security properties of realistic systems tha=
t were previously not efficiently checkable.

TAMIS have established a strong connection with industry and with internati=
onal teams recognized in this area, with numerous research contracts both w=
ith EU and industry.

=3D=3D=3D=3D
The work occurs in the context of the TeamPlay (Time, Energy and security A=
nalysis for Multi/Many-core heterogeneous PLAtforms) research project that =
is funded from early 2018 till end 2020 by the European Union.

This project federates 6 academic and 5 industrial partners from 7 European=
 countries and aims to develop new, formally-motivated, techniques that wil=
l allow execution time, energy usage, security, and other important non-fun=
ctional properties of parallel software to be treated effectively, and as f=
irst- class citizens. We will build this into a toolbox for developing high=
ly parallel software for low-energy systems, as required by the internet of=
 things, cyber-physical systems etc. The TeamPlay approach will allow progr=
ams to reflect directly on their own time, energy consumption, security, et=
c., as well as enabling the developer to reason about both the functional a=
nd the non-functional properties of their software at the source code level.

Our success will ensure significant progress on a pressing problem of major=
 industrial importance: how to effectively manage energy consumption for pa=
rallel systems while maintaining the right balance with other important sof=
tware metrics, including time, security etc.

The project brings together leading industrial and academic experts in para=
llelism, energy modeling/ transparency, worst-case execution time analysis,=
 non-functional property analysis, compilation, security, and task coordina=
tion.

Results will be evaluated using industrial use cases taken from the compute=
r vision, satellites, flying drones, medical and cyber security domains.

Within TeamPlay, Inria and TAMIS lead and coordinate the whole project, whi=
le being also in charge of the research aspects more specifically related t=
o security.
