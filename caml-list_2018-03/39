                   University of Massachusetts Lowell, MA, USA

### Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2018 will be a venue for researchers to present
and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe
results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.

Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:

- language concepts
- type systems, type checking, type inferencing
- compilation techniques
- staged compilation
- run-time function specialization
- run-time code generation
- partial evaluation
- (abstract) interpretation
- metaprogramming
- generic programming
- automatic program generation
- array processing
- concurrent/parallel programming
- concurrent/parallel program execution
- embedded systems
- web applications
- (embedded) domain specific languages
- security
- novel memory management techniques
- run-time profiling performance measurements
- debugging and tracing
- virtual/abstract machine architectures
- validation, verification of functional programs
- tools and programming techniques
- (industrial) applications


### Submissions and peer-review

Differently from previous editions of IFL, IFL 2018 solicits two kinds of
submissions:

* Regular papers (12 pages including references)
* Draft papers for presentations ('weak' limit between 8 and 15 pages)

Regular papers will undergo a rigorous review by the program committee, and
will
be evaluated according to their correctness, novelty, originality,
relevance,
significance, and clarity. A set of regular papers will be conditionally
accepted for publication. Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be
provided with committee reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions.
Regular papers not accepted for publication will be considered as draft
papers,
at the request of the author.

Draft papers will be screened to make sure that they are within the scope of
IFL, and will be accepted for presentation or rejected accordingly.

Prior to the symposium:
  Authors of conditionally accepted papers and accepted presentations will
  submit a pre-proceedings version of their work that will appear in the
draft
  proceedings distributed at the symposium. The draft proceedings does not
  constitute a formal publication.

  We require that at least one of the authors present the work at IFL 2018.

After the symposium:

  Authors of conditionally accepted papers will submit a revised versions of
  their paper for the formal post-proceedings.
  The program committee will assess whether the mandatory revisions have
been
  adequately addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final
  accept/reject status of the paper.
  Our interest is to ultimately accept all conditionally accepted papers.
If you
  are an author of a conditionally accepted paper, please make sure that you
  address all the concerns of the reviewers.


  Authors of accepted presentations will be given the opportunity to
incorporate
  the feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to
submit a
  revised full article for the formal post-proceedings.
  The program committee will evaluate these submissions according to their
  correctness, novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity,
and
  will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or rejected.


### Publication

The formal proceedings will appear in the International Conference
Proceedings
Series of the ACM Digital Library.

At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other
venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:


         http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

### Peter Landin Prize

symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program
committee
based on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize
carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.

<br>The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively =
engaged<br>in the implementation and application of functional and function=
-based<br>programming languages. IFL 2018 will be a venue for researchers t=
o present and<br>discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publ=
ication-ripe results<br>related to the implementation and application of fu=
nctional languages and<br>function-based programming.<br><br>Topics of inte=
rest to IFL include, but are not limited to:<br><br>- language concepts<br>=
- type systems, type checking, type inferencing<br>- compilation techniques=
<br>- staged compilation<br>- run-time function specialization<br>- run-tim=
e code generation<br>- partial evaluation<br>- (abstract) interpretation<br=
>- metaprogramming<br>- generic programming<br>- automatic program generati=
on<br>- array processing<br>- concurrent/parallel programming<br>- concurre=
nt/parallel program execution<br>- embedded systems<br>- web applications<b=
r>- (embedded) domain specific languages<br>- security<br>- novel memory ma=
nagement techniques<br>- run-time profiling performance measurements<br>- d=
ebugging and tracing<br>- virtual/abstract machine architectures<br>- valid=
ation, verification of functional programs<br>- tools and programming techn=
iques<br>- (industrial) applications<br><br><br>### Submissions and peer-re=
view<br><br>Differently from previous editions of IFL, IFL 2018 solicits tw=
o kinds of<br>submissions:<br><br>* Regular papers (12 pages including refe=
rences)<br>* Draft papers for presentations (&#39;weak&#39; limit between 8=
 and 15 pages)<br><br>Regular papers will undergo a rigorous review by the =
program committee, and will<br>be evaluated according to their correctness,=
 novelty, originality, relevance,<br>significance, and clarity. A set of re=
gular papers will be conditionally<br>accepted for publication. Authors of =
conditionally accepted papers will be<br>provided with committee reviews al=
ong with a set of mandatory revisions.<br>Regular papers not accepted for p=
ublication will be considered as draft papers,<br>at the request of the aut=
hor.<br><br>Draft papers will be screened to make sure that they are within=
 the scope of<br>IFL, and will be accepted for presentation or rejected acc=
ordingly.<br><br>Prior to the symposium:<br>=C2=A0 Authors of conditionally=
 accepted papers and accepted presentations will<br>=C2=A0 submit a pre-pro=
ceedings version of their work that will appear in the draft<br>=C2=A0 proc=
eedings distributed at the symposium. The draft proceedings does not<br>=C2=
=A0 constitute a formal publication.<br>=C2=A0 <br>=C2=A0 We require that a=
t least one of the authors present the work at IFL 2018. <br><br>After the =
symposium:<br><br>=C2=A0 Authors of conditionally accepted papers will subm=
it a revised versions of<br>=C2=A0 their paper for the formal post-proceedi=
ngs.<br>=C2=A0 The program committee will assess whether the mandatory revi=
sions have been<br>=C2=A0 adequately addressed by the authors and thereby d=
etermines the final<br>=C2=A0 accept/reject status of the paper.<br>=C2=A0 =
Our interest is to ultimately accept all conditionally accepted papers. If =
you<br>=C2=A0 are an author of a conditionally accepted paper, please make =
sure that you<br>=C2=A0 address all the concerns of the reviewers.<br>=C2=
=A0 <br><br>=C2=A0 Authors of accepted presentations will be given the oppo=
rtunity to incorporate<br>=C2=A0 the feedback from discussions at the sympo=
sium and will be invited to submit a<br>=C2=A0 revised full article for the=
 formal post-proceedings. <br>=C2=A0 The program committee will evaluate th=
ese submissions according to their<br>=C2=A0 correctness, novelty, original=
ity, relevance, significance, and clarity, and<br>=C2=A0 will thereby deter=
mine whether the paper is accepted or rejected.<br>=C2=A0 <br><br>### Publi=
cation<br><br>The formal proceedings will appear in the International Confe=
rence Proceedings<br>Series of the ACM Digital Library.<br><br>At no time m=
