### About PACMPL

Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL <https://pacmpl.acm=
.org/>) is a Gold Open Access journal publishing research on all aspects of=
 programming languages, from design to implementation and from mathematical=
 formalisms to empirical studies. Each issue of the journal is devoted to a=
 particular subject area within programming languages and will be announced=
 through publicized Calls for Papers, like this one.

### Scope

[PACMPL](https://pacmpl.acm.org/) issue ICFP 2018 seeks original papers on =
the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on a=
ll topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, and fr=
om abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encour=
age functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperativ=
e languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency, or parallelism=
. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * *Language Design*: concurrency, parallelism, and distribution; modules;=
 components and composition; metaprogramming; type systems; interoperabilit=
y; domain-specific languages; and relations to imperative, object-oriented,=
 or logic programming.

  * *Implementation*: abstract machines; virtual machines; interpretation; =
compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; garbage collection and=
 memory management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfac=
es to foreign functions, services, components, or low-level machine resourc=
es.

  * *Software-Development Techniques*: algorithms and data structures; desi=
gn patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof assistants; deb=
ugging; testing; tracing; profiling.

  * *Foundations*: formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type theor=
y; monads; continuations; control; state; effects; program verification; de=
pendent types.

  * *Analysis and Transformation*: control-flow; data-flow; abstract interp=
retation; partial evaluation; program calculation.

  * *Applications*: symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial in=
telligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; h=
ardware design; databases; XML processing; scientific and numerical computi=
ng; graphical user interfaces; multimedia and 3D graphics programming; scri=
pting; system administration; security.

  * *Education*: teaching introductory programming; parallel programming; m=
athematical proof; algebra.

Submissions will be evaluated according to their relevance, correctness, si=
gnificance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its co=
ntributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what h=
as been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it wi=
th previous work. The technical content should be accessible to a broad aud=
ience.

PACMPL issue ICFP 2018 also welcomes submissions in two separate categories=
 &mdash; Functional Pearls and Experience Reports &mdash; that must be mark=
ed as such at the time of submission and that need not report original rese=
arch results.  Detailed guidelines on both categories are given at the end =
of this call.

Please contact the principal editor if you have questions or are concerned =
about the appropriateness of a topic.

### Preparation of submissions

**Deadline**: The deadline for submissions is Friday, March 16, 2018, Anywh=
ere on Earth (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth>).  This dea=
dline will be strictly enforced.

**Formatting**: Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and w=
hite on US Letter sized paper, and interpretable by common PDF tools. All s=
ubmissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template that is available (in bo=
th LaTeX and Word formats) from <https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/s=
ubmissions>.  For authors using LaTeX, a lighter-weight package, including =
only the essential files, is available from <http://sigplan.org/Resources/A=
uthor/#acmart-format>.

There is a limit of 27 pages for a full paper or 14 pages for an Experience=
 Report; in either case, the bibliography will not be counted against these=
 limits. These page limits have been chosen to allow essentially the same a=
mount of content with the new single-column format as was possible with the=
 two-column format used in past ICFP conferences. Submissions that exceed t=
he page limits or, for other reasons, do not meet the requirements for form=
atting, will be summarily rejected.

See also PACMPL's Information and Guidelines for Authors at <https://pacmpl=
.acm.org/authors.cfm>.

**Submission**: Submissions will be accepted at <https://icfp18.hotcrp.com/>

Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submi=
ssion deadline using the same web interface.

**Author Response Period**: Authors will have a 72-hour period, starting at=
 14:00 UTC on Wednesday, May 2, 2018, to read reviews and respond to them.

**Supplementary Materials**: Authors have the option to attach supplementar=
y material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose =
not to look at it. The material should be uploaded at submission time, as a=
 single pdf or a tarball, not via a URL. This supplementary material may or=
 may not be anonymized; if not anonymized, it will only be revealed to revi=
ewers after they have submitted their review of the paper and learned the i=
dentity of the author(s).

**Authorship Policies**: All submissions are expected to comply with the AC=
M Policies for Authorship that are detailed at <https://www.acm.org/publica=
tions/authors/information-for-authors>.

**Republication Policies**: Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republ=
ication policy, as explained on the web at <http://www.sigplan.org/Resource=
s/Policies/Republication>.

**Resubmitted Papers**: Authors who submit a revised version of a paper tha=
t has previously been rejected by another conference have the option to att=
ach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), expla=
ining how they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submiss=
ion. If a reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous su=
bmission and wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the pr=
incipal editor will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/=
her previous review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies =
of the previous reviews.

### Review Process

This section outlines the two-stage process with lightweight double-blind r=
eviewing that will be used to select papers for PACMPL issue ICFP 2018.  We=
 anticipate that there will be a need to clarify and expand on this process=
, and we will maintain a list of frequently asked questions and answers on =
the conference website to address common concerns.
=20
**PACMPL issue ICFP 2018 will employ a two-stage review process.**  The fir=
st stage in the review process will assess submitted papers using the crite=
ria stated above and will allow for feedback and input on initial reviews t=
hrough the author response period mentioned previously. At the review meeti=
ng, a set of papers will be conditionally accepted and all other papers wil=
l be rejected.  Authors will be notified of these decisions on May 18, 2018.

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with committee re=
views (just as in previous conferences) along with a set of mandatory revis=
ions. After five weeks (June 22, 2018), the authors will provide a second s=
ubmission. The second and final reviewing phase assesses whether the mandat=
ory revisions have been adequately addressed by the authors and thereby det=
ermines the final accept/reject status of the paper. The intent and expecta=
tion is that the mandatory revisions can be addressed within five weeks and=
 hence that conditionally accepted papers will in general be accepted in th=
e second phase.

The second submission should clearly identify how the mandatory revisions w=
ere addressed. To that end, the second submission must be accompanied by a =
cover letter mapping each mandatory revision request to specific parts of t=
he paper. The cover letter will facilitate a quick second review, allowing =
for confirmation of final acceptance within two weeks. Conversely, the abse=
nce of a cover letter will be grounds for the paper=E2=80=99s rejection.

**PACMPL issue ICFP 2018 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing p=
rocess.** To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

  1. **author names and institutions must be omitted**, and
  2. **references to authors' own related work should be in the third perso=
n** (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on =
the work of ...").

The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial jud=
gement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to =
discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the nam=
e of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing th=
e paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be=
 omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to dissemina=
te their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For=
 instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks=
 on their research ideas.

### Information for Authors of Accepted Papers

* As a condition of acceptance, final versions of all papers must adhere to=
 the new ACM Small format. The page limits for final versions of papers wil=
l be increased to ensure that authors have space to respond to reviewer com=
ments and mandatory revisions.

* Authors of accepted submissions will be required to agree to one of the t=
hree ACM licensing options: open access on payment of a fee (**recommended*=
*, and SIGPLAN can cover the cost as described next); copyright transfer to=
 ACM; or retaining copyright but granting ACM exclusive publication rights.=
  Further information about ACM author rights is available from <http://aut=
hors.acm.org>.

* PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. It will be archived in ACM=E2=80=99=
s Digital Library, but no membership or fee is required for access. Gold Op=
en Access has been made possible by generous funding through ACM SIGPLAN, w=
hich will cover all open access costs in the event authors cannot. Authors =
who can cover the costs may do so by paying an Article Processing Charge (A=
PC). PACMPL, SIGPLAN, and ACM Headquarters are committed to exploring route=
s to making Gold Open Access publication both affordable and sustainable.

* ACM offers authors a range of copyright options, one of which is Creative=
 Commons CC-BY publication; this is the option recommended by the PACMPL ed=
itorial board. A reasoned argument in favour of this option can be found in=
 the article [Why CC-BY?](https://oaspa.org/why-cc-by/) published by OASPA,=
 the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association.

* We intend that the papers will be freely available for download from the =
ACM Digital Library in perpetuity via the OpenTOC mechanism.

* ACM Author-Izer is a unique service that enables ACM authors to generate =
and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for vi=
sitors to download the definitive version of their articles from the ACM Di=
gital Library at no charge. Downloads through Author-Izer links are capture=
d in official ACM statistics, improving the accuracy of usage and impact me=
asurements. Consistently linking to the definitive version of an ACM articl=
e should reduce user confusion over article versioning. After an article ha=
s been published and assigned to the appropriate ACM Author Profile pages, =
authors should visit <http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-servi=
ce> to learn how to create links for free downloads from the ACM DL.

* At least one author of each accepted submissions will be expected to atte=
nd and present their paper at the conference.  The schedule for presentatio=
ns will be determined and shared with authors after the full program has be=
en selected.  Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the p=
resenter consents.

* The official publication date is the date the papers are made available i=
n the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to *two weeks prior* to the =
first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the dead=
line for any patent filings related to published work.

### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase of the=
 review process will be encouraged (but not required) to submit supporting =
materials for Artifact Evaluation. These items will then be reviewed by an =
Artifact Evaluation Committee, separate from the paper Review Committee, wh=
ose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the a=
ssociated paper. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process suc=
cessfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves.=
 Authors of accepted papers will be encouraged to make the supporting mater=
ials publicly available upon publication of the papers, for example, by inc=
luding them as "source materials" in the ACM Digital Library.  An additiona=
l seal will mark papers whose artifacts are made available, as outlined in =
the ACM guidelines for artifact badging.

Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and will not influence th=
e final decision regarding paper acceptance.

Further information about the motivations and expectations for Artifact Eva=
luation can be found at <https://icfp18.sigplan.org/track/icfp-2018-Artifac=
ts>.

### Special categories of papers

In addition to research papers, PACMPL issue ICFP solicits two kinds of pap=
ers that do not require original research contributions: Functional Pearls,=
 which are full papers, and Experience Reports, which are limited to half t=
he length of a full paper. Authors submitting such papers should consider t=
he following guidelines.

#### Functional Pearls

A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to functiona=
l programming. Examples include, but are not limited to:

  * a new and thought-provoking way of looking at an old idea

  * an instructive example of program calculation or proof

While pearls often demonstrate an idea through the development of a short p=
rogram, there is no requirement or expectation that they do so. Thus, they =
encompass the notions of theoretical and educational pearls.

Functional Pearls are valued as highly and judged as rigorously as ordinary=
 papers, but using somewhat different criteria. In particular, a pearl is n=
ot required to report original research, but, it should be concise, instruc=
tive, and entertaining. A pearl is likely to be rejected if its readers get=
 bored, if the material gets too complicated, if too much specialized knowl=
edge is needed, or if the writing is inelegant. The key to writing a good p=
earl is polishing.

A submission that is intended to be treated as a pearl must be marked as su=
ch on the submission web page, and should contain the words "Functional Pea=
rl" somewhere in its title or subtitle. These steps will alert reviewers to=
 use the appropriate evaluation criteria. Pearls will be combined with ordi=
nary papers, however, for the purpose of computing the conference's accepta=
nce rate.

#### Experience Reports

The purpose of an Experience Report is to help create a body of published, =
refereed, citable evidence that functional programming really works &mdash;=
 or to describe what obstacles prevent it from working.

Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:

  * insights gained from real-world projects using functional programming

  * comparison of functional programming with conventional programming in t=
he context of an industrial project or a university curriculum

  * project-management, business, or legal issues encountered when using fu=
nctional programming in a real-world project

  * curricular issues encountered when using functional programming in educ=
ation

  * real-world constraints that created special challenges for an implement=
ation of a functional language or for functional programming in general

An Experience Report is distinguished from a normal PACMPL issue ICFP paper=
 by its title, by its length, and by the criteria used to evaluate it.

  * Both in the papers and in any citations, the title of each accepted Exp=
erience Report must begin with the words "Experience Report" followed by a =
colon. The acceptance rate for Experience Reports will be computed and repo=
rted separately from the rate for ordinary papers.
=20=20
  * Experience Report submissions can be at most 12 pages long, excluding b=
ibliography.

  * Each accepted Experience Report will be presented at the conference, bu=
t depending on the number of Experience Reports and regular papers accepted=
, authors of Experience reports may be asked to give shorter talks.
=20=20
  * Because the purpose of Experience Reports is to enable our community to=
 accumulate a body of evidence about the efficacy of functional programming=
, an acceptable Experience Report need not add to the body of knowledge of =
the functional-programming community by presenting novel results or conclus=
ions. It is sufficient if the Report states a clear thesis and provides sup=
porting evidence. The thesis must be relevant to ICFP, but it need not be n=
ovel.

The review committee will accept or reject Experience Reports based on whet=
her they judge the evidence to be convincing. Anecdotal evidence will be ac=
ceptable provided it is well argued and the author explains what efforts we=
re made to gather as much evidence as possible. Typically, more convincing =
evidence is obtained from papers which show how functional programming was =
used than from papers which only say that functional programming was used. =
The most convincing evidence often includes comparisons of situations befor=
e and after the introduction or discontinuation of functional programming. =
Evidence drawn from a single person's experience may be sufficient, but mor=
e weight will be given to evidence drawn from the experience of groups of p=
eople.

An Experience Report should be short and to the point: it should make a cla=
im about how well functional programming worked on a particular project and=
 why, and produce evidence to substantiate this claim. If functional progra=
mming worked in this case in the same ways it has worked for others, the pa=
per need only summarize the results &mdash; the main part of the paper shou=
ld discuss how well it worked and in what context. Most readers will not wa=
nt to know all the details of the project and its implementation, but the p=
aper should characterize the project and its context well enough so that re=
aders can judge to what degree this experience is relevant to their own pro=
jects. The paper should take care to highlight any unusual aspects of the p=
roject. Specifics about the project are more valuable than generalities abo=
ut functional programming; for example, it is more valuable to say that the=
 team delivered its software a month ahead of schedule than it is to say th=
at functional programming made the team more productive.

If the paper not only describes experience but also presents new technical =
results, or if the experience refutes cherished beliefs of the functional-p=
rogramming community, it may be better off submitted it as a full paper, wh=
ich will be judged by the usual criteria of novelty, originality, and relev=
ance. The principal editor will be happy to advise on any concerns about wh=
ich category to submit to.
