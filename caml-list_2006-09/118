My fault. I'm used to autoconf scripts, and setting the environment
variable 'CPPFLAGS' (C pre processor flags) will pass additional
flags to the C compiler. This doesn't seem to be an autoconf build
though, sorry.

What I said about code generation and the default setting of your
machine's host compiler remains true :)

It did not find an 64bit env because your compiler by default
doesn't offer a 64bit env :)

Good luck ...
