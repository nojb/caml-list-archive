I picked up an old Ultra 5 the other day. Ocaml seems to work on it out 
of the box in the limited amount of use I've put it to so far, except 
for ocamlopt, which didn't build, dying trying to compile sparc.S with 
register-related errors. I'll try that patch tomorrow when I have time, 
see how it works outside of Solaris - I'm running NetBSD/sparc64 3.0.1.
