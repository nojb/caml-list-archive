   Yes, but if I remember correctly it's you that request for these files
   to be installed?

Sure, but I didn't knew about the library, when I filed the bug
report. 

   So in order to be consistent either one do not expose at all the
   content of a library or one install all components (.cmo, .cmi, .cmx,
   .o). I tend to prefer the first one.

OK, Jacques clarified this, you need to install the .cmi .cmx
together with the library. .cmo and .o are in the library.

   Yes but it's a choice made by the library designer.

The library designer can hardly forsee all the possible usages of
the modules in his library. Therefore, in my opinion, one should
install all .cmi .cmo .cmx .o and have the libraries available
for convenience. The additional space needed is negligible (less
than 1M for both gramlib and plexer). Cases where users needed a
uncleaned ocaml source directory to compile certain features of
an application would then belong to the past.

Hendrik
