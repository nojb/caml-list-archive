No problems at all with OCaml (including native code compilation) on
the ARM. I am already running OCaml on a Sharp Zaurus, which is a
Linux-based PDA device with an Intel Xscale processor.

Everything compiled and built straight out of the box - it works like
a dream. Of course WinCE is a whole different kettle of fish.

Regards
Neil
