Any pointer to where to look in the code to write such a tool, or some
alternative hack?

That's bad, we were hoping to extract the information statically,
without having to run the executable. As above, any pointer?

The rationale for all of this is that we are trying to come up with a
mechanism for automatically compute (tight) dependencies among debian
packages on the basis of the information stored inside bytecode
executables and objects.

Many thanks for your answer.
