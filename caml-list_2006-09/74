Well, I'm still confused.  Consider that a bunch of the standard
libraries use Pervasives, but I can see that the standard library
is not compiled with -thread.  So clearly we are meant to use the
standard library compiled without -thread, with threads.cm[x]a.

So, I still don't understand when I can combine code compiled
without -thread with code compiled with -thread.
