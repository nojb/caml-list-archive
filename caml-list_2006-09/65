Oh wait, I'm sorry. Yes, there is good reason: it uses a different
version of Pervasives internals.

Depending on when linking is done for each part, you may end up with
conflicting implementations of Pervasives in your final program: so
[IO] operations that can block will block whole program instead of
running thread blocking, and another thread running instead.

So maybe if it uses no IO, and no threading functions, it might be
okay -- there are no guarantees when you do these sorts of things (:
