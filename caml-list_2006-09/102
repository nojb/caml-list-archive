The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation=20

Affiliated with ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of
Programming Languages (POPL), 2007.=20
=20
=20
 Scope

The role of types and proofs in all aspects of language design, compiler
construction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent
years. Type systems, type analyses, and formal deduction have led to new
concepts in compilation techniques for modern programming languages,
verification of safety and security properties of programs, program
transformation and optimization, and many other areas. In light of this
expanding role of types, the ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language
Design and Implementation (TLDI'07) follows five previous International
Workshops on types in compilation and language design(TIC'97, TIC'98,
TIC'00, and TLDI'03 and TLDI'05), with the hope of bringing together
researchers to share new ideas and results in this area.=20

Submissions for this event are invited on all interactions of types with
language design, implementation, and programming methodology. This
includes both practical applications and theoretical aspects. TLDI'07
specifically encourages papers from a broad field of programming
language and compiler researchers, including those working in
object-oriented, dynamically-typed, late-binding, systems programming,
and mobile-code paradigms, as well as traditional fully-static type
systems. Topics of interest include:

Typed intermediate languages and type-directed compilation=20
Type-based language support for safety and security=20
Types for interoperability=20
Type systems for system programming languages=20
Type-based program analysis, transformation, and optimization=20
Dependent types and type-based proof assistants=20
Types for security protocols, concurrency, and distributed computing=20
Type inference and type reconstruction=20
Type based specifications of data structures and program invariants=20
Type-based memory management=20
Proof-carrying code and certifying compilation

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list; papers on novel utilizations
of type information are welcome. Authors concerned about the suitability
of a topic are encouraged to inquire via electronic mail to the program
chair prior to submission.=20

We solicit submissions on original research not published or submitted
for publication elsewhere. Technical summaries, in English and not to
exceed 10 pages ACM format, should be submitted via the Web submission
form by Sunday, October 1, 2006 5PM Pacific Daylight Savings Time. See
what this means in your time zone.=20

Web submission form: https://www.softconf.com/starts/tldi07/=20

Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) is strongly preferred for all
submissions. Authors should be sure to use full font inclusion to ensure
portability. All papers must be formatted for US Letter (8.5"x11")
paper. Postscript (PS) format submissions will also be accepted,
provided that they preview and print properly using Ghostscript with
standard fonts.=20
