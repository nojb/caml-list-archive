George,

Neither 3.09.3 nor the current cvs HEAD compiled OOTB under Cygwin with
full fuctionality.  I've made some changes that enabled dynamic loading,
etc, for the currently released package.  I also had a more extensive set
of changes that allowed a more seamless integration with Cygwin, but those
apparently broke the one major user of O'Caml under Cygwin (namely
Unison), and I had no chance to investigate that.  I don't have much time
to work on it right now, but I can certainly send you the patch I used.
Please let me know if you succeed in adapting it for cvs HEAD.
