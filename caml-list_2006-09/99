Hello,

It seems Moore's law is taking us in the direction of more cores per
microprocessor with less effort placed on exploring ILP.  With the
advent of multi-core processors, and their inevitable ubiquity, are
there any plans, considerations, or ideas for a concurrent garbage
collector in Ocaml?

To my knowledge, Caml Light had a concurrent garbage collector under
development by Xavier Leroy but was abandoned due to significant
technical challenges.  Prior to that, there appears to have been some
academic research regarding concurrent GC (Doligez, Leroy).

Thanks,
Jim
