Yes, but if I remember correctly it's you that request for these files
to be installed?

So in order to be consistent either one do not expose at all the
content of a library or one install all components (.cmo, .cmi, .cmx,
.o). I tend to prefer the first one.

Yes not se easy, documentation job...

Yes it's artificial, you can also use -linkall.

Yes but it's a choice made by the library designer.
