It is reliable.

Yes, these are saved in the bytecode executable, section "CRCS",
but there are no tools in the distrib that will list this info for you.

Run the executable with OCAMLRUNPARAM=v=256, this will print debug
messages during shared library loading, including names and
locations of these libraries.
