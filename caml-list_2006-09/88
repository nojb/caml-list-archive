I hope this posting is appropriate for the email list.  I got some
advice on the #ocaml IRC channel that it would be fine :)

Galois is seeking a full-time candidate for software development and
systems integration in the field of high assurance computing.  A
successful candidate should have a good understanding of the
inner workings of databases, good development skills in a number of
languages, including at least one functional language (preferably
Haskell), and web development.  The candidate should have excellent
Linux and Unix skills.  If the candidate does not know Haskell, they
should be good at learning new programming languages, and can
reasonably expect to be fluent in Haskell within a few months.

Tasks:
 * Database analysis
 * Python and PHP web development
 * Learning and adapting Linux-related technologies including Xen,
   SELinux, and Knoppix
 * Creating or modifying Debian packages
 * Haskell development

Knowledge:
 * Databases implementation internals
 * Web development, Services-Oriented Architectures
 * Fluent in Haskell or other functional languages
 * Grounding in computer security
 * XML
 * Linux and Unix

Nice-to-have:
 * Extreme Programming (XP) development experience
 * Experience deploying software products
 * Open source software development experience
 * Ability to get US security clearance

Education:
 * Masters degree or equivilent experience

Please respond with a resume and a cover letter explaining your fit to
jobs@galois.com.  Feel free to forward to interested parties.
