The O'Caml VM is fairly easy to port.

A minimal libc should be enough (excluding Unix module & Threading).
The rest will require a bit of work, but likely not too much. I have
the VM running in a freestanding environment (with vmthreads, without
Unix module), so definitely portable ;-)

As for ocamlopt, I wouldn't know.
