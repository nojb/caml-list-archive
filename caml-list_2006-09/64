In current compiler version, all the -thread option does is add the
include directory for threads to the include path automatically, and
set -nopervasives I think (so that it uses the version provided by the
thread library)..

Although, depending on the behaviour of compiler internals isn't
always a good thing ;-)

Maybe (for example, the standard library doesn't have a special
compiled version for thread mode) -- just IO I'd be concerned about
wrt runtime behaviour.

Most likely yes. But again, you're depending on compiler internals.

Without official comment from the ocaml team, expect upgrading to
newer ocaml releases to break things. Otherwise, should work for now.
