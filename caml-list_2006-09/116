I doubt setting gcc-Flags make sense, if this is not a flag,
that the ./configure-script inthe sources-directory accepts.

I hope there is such an 64-Bit-option in the configure-script,
if not, I think such flags could yield problems.

At least theconfigure-script did not find out that the machine
is a 64-Bit's machine. So at least the config-script could be
changed. (Or there is an 64-Bit-option, which I didn't checked,
because I thought, it will find it out by itself.
