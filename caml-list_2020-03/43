/*NOTE ABOUT COVID-19: We will follow advice from the ICLP2020 //
//organizers on the situation, and we will revise our workshop //
//timeline and other procedures accordingly if needed.*/

ICLP 2020, the 36th International Conference on Logic Programming,
will be held at the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy, from
September 18 to September 24, 2020.

The ICLP conference series has a long standing tradition of hosting
a rich set of co-located workshops. ICLP workshops provide a unique
opportunity for the presentation and discussion of work that can be
preliminary in nature, novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide
and interested audience.

Co-located workshops also provide an opportunity for presenting
specialized topics and opportunities for intensive discussions and
project collaboration. The topics of the workshops co-located with
ICLP 2020 can cover any areas related to logic programming (e.g.,
theory, implementation, environments, language issues, alternative
paradigms, applications), including cross-disciplinary areas. However,
any relevant workshop proposal will be considered.

The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizers,
but ample time should be allowed for general discussion. Workshops can
vary in length, but the optimal duration will be half a day or a full
day.

Workshop Proposal:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Those interested in organizing a workshop at ICLP 2020 are invited to
submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and about
two pages in length. They should contain:

 =A0* The title of the workshop.
 =A0* A brief technical description of the topics covered by the workshop.
 =A0* A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.

Proposals are expected in text or PDF format. All proposals should be
submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by April 13, 2020.

Reviewing Process:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Each submitted proposal will be reviewed by the Workshop, Program and
General Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and that fit the
goals and scope of ICLP will be selected. The decision will be
notified by email to the responsible organizer by April 27, 2020.

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the
number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every
accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting
room. The workshops and the conference organizers will collaborate in
establishing a uniform approach to produce proficient and accessible
proceedings for the workshops.
