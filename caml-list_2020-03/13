CALL FOR PAPERS
17th Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
(KR2020)
12-18 September 2020, Rhodes, Greece
https://kr2020.inf.unibz.it/

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and
lively
field of research.  In KR a fundamental assumption is that an agent's
knowledge
is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for processing
by
dedicated reasoning engines.  This assumption, that much of what an
agent deals
with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern intelligent systems.
Consequently, KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various
areas in
AI, including automated planning and natural language understanding, and
to
fields beyond AI, including databases, verification, software
engineering, and
robotics.  In recent years, KR has contributed also to new and emerging
fields,
including the semantic web, computational biology, cyber security, and
the
development of software agents.

The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely in-depth
presentation
of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation
and
computational management of knowledge.

SCOPE

We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR that
clearly
contribute to the formal foundations of relevant problems or show the
applicability of results to implemented or implementable systems.  We
also
welcome papers from other areas that show clear use of, or contributions
to,
the principles or practice of KR.  We also encourage "reports from the
field"
of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Applications of KR
- Argumentation
- Belief revision and update, belief merging, information fusion
- Commonsense reasoning
- Computational aspects of knowledge representation
- Concept formation, similarity-based reasoning
- Contextual reasoning
- Decision making
- Description logics
- Explanation finding, diagnosis, causal reasoning, abduction
- Geometric, spatial, and temporal reasoning
- Inconsistency- and exception tolerant reasoning, paraconsistent logics
- KR and autonomous agents and multi-agent systems
- KR and cognitive robotics
- KR and cyber security
- KR and education
- KR and game theory
- KR and machine learning, inductive logic programming, knowledge
acquisition
- KR and natural language processing and understanding
- KR and the Web, Semantic Web
- Knowledge graphs, virtual knowledge graphs, and open linked data
- Knowledge representation languages
- Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic
programming
- Modeling and reasoning about preferences
- Multi- and order-sorted representations and reasoning
- Nonmonotonic logics, default logics, conditional logics
- Ontology formalisms and models
- Ontology-based data access, integration, and exchange
- Philosophical foundations of KR
- Qualitative reasoning, reasoning about physical systems
- Reasoning about actions and change, action languages
- Reasoning about knowledge, beliefs, and other mental attitudes
- Uncertainty, vagueness, many-valued and fuzzy logics

KR2020 will also feature Workshops and Tutorials, solicited by means of
an open
call, and a Doctoral Consortium.

TRACKS

In addition to the main conference track, KR2020 will host the following
tracks
and sessions:

* Applications and Systems Track
* Recent Published Research Track
* Special Session: KR and Machine Learning 
* Special Session: KR and Robotics
* Special Session: Women in KR

AUTHORS GUIDELINES

All submissions must be written in English and in AAAI style. Papers
must be
submitted in PDF format, through the EasyChair conference system:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2020 .

For the main conference track and additional tracks/sessions (except for
the
Recent Published Research track), we invite

- Full papers of up to 9 pages, including abstract, figures, and
appendices
  (if any), but excluding references and acknowledgements.
- Short papers of up to 4 pages, excluding references and
acknowledgements.

Both full and short papers must describe original, previously
unpublished
research, and must not simultaneously be submitted for publication
elsewhere.
These restrictions do not apply to previously accepted workshop papers
with a
limited audience and/or without archival proceedings, and to papers
uploaded at
public repositories (e.g., arXiv).

The accepted full papers and short papers will be published in the
KR2020
proceedings.

Recent Published Research Track, Workshops and Tutorials, and Doctoral
Consortium will have different submission guidelines, which will be
announced
separately.
