Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.09.1

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the anniversary of the first spacewalk,
conducted by Alexei Leonov, by announcing the release of OCaml version 
4.09.1 .
This is mainly a bug-fix release, with a handful of configuration fixes and
a GC fix backported from 4.10.0 . See the list of changes below for more 
details.

It is (or soon will be) available as a set of OPAM switches,
and as a source download here:

   https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.09.1.tar.gz

Happy hacking,

— Florian Angeletti, for the OCaml team.
