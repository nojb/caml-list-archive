setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and concepts for the future,
optionally recorded in formal proceedings. Submissions are currently
being accepted on a rolling basis.

The rolling call will close on Wed 1 Apr, 2020.
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-Workshops

## PACMPL Issue OOPSLA

Papers may target any stage of software development, including
requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation,
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance,
and reuse of software systems.  Contributions may include the
development of new tools (such as language front-ends, program
analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as methodologies,
design processes, and code organization approaches), new principles
(such as formalisms, proofs, models, and paradigms), and new
evaluations (such as experiments, corpora analyses, user studies, and
surveys).

Submissions due: Wed 15 Apr, 2020
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-oopsla

## Onward! Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on
everything to do with programming and software: including processes,
methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more
radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas
that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of
thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and
software engineering research.

Submissions due: Thu 23 Apr, 2020
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-Onward-papers


## Onward! Essays

Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing
about topics important to the software community. An essay can be long
or short.  An essay can be an exploration of the topic and its impact,
or a story about the circumstances of its creation; it can present a
personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader in an
act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep
analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps the one the
author took to reach an understanding of the topic. The subject
area=E2=80=94software, programming, and programming languages=E2=80=94shoul=
d be
interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to
human endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological,
historical, or anthropological underpinnings.

Submissions due: Thu 23 April, 2020
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-Onward-Essays

Experience (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners
interested in techniques and tools for code generation, language
implementation, and metaprogramming.  GPCE seeks conceptual,
theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of
interest, which include but are not limited to (i) program
transformation, staging, macro systems, preprocessors, program
synthesis, and code-recommendation systems, (ii) domain-specific
languages, language embedding, language design, and language
workbenches, (iii) feature-oriented programming, domain engineering,
and feature interactions, (iv) applications and properties of code
generation, language implementation, and product-line development.

Abstracts due: Sun 21 Jun, 2020

https://conf.researchr.org/home/gpce-2020

## Software Language Engineering (SLE)

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the discipline of engineering
languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It
abstracts from the differences between programming languages,
modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the
engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the
establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the
best results. SLE 2020 solicits high quality contributions in areas
ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools,
techniques, and frameworks in the domain of software language
engineering.

Abstracts due: Sun 21 Jun, 2020
Submissions due: Sun 28 Jun, 2020
https://conf.researchr.org/home/sle-2020


## Static Analysis Symposium

Static analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program
verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding,
and software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served
as the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and
application advances in the area.

Abstracts due: Wed 22 Apr, 2020
Submissions due: Fri 24 Apr, 2020
https://conf.researchr.org/home/sas-2020

## Rebase

Rebase is a series of high-quality talks that highlight the challenges
that are on the forefront of both research and practice across the SPLASH
community's broad spectrum of domains and techniques. We invite the
community to propose speakers (including themselves) through our call for
contributions.

https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-rebase


## SPLASH-E

SPLASH-E is a symposium, started in 2013, for software and languages
(SE/PL) researchers with activities and interests around computing
education. Some build pedagogically-oriented languages or tools; some think
about pedagogic challenges around SE/PL courses; some bring computing to
non-CS communities; some pursue human studies and educational research.

At SPLASH-E, we share our educational ideas and challenges centred in
software/languages, as well as our best ideas for advancing such work.
SPLASH-E strives to bring together researchers and those with educational
interests that arise from software ideas or concerns.

Submissions due: Fri 10 Jul, 2020
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-SPLASH-E

## Posters

The SPLASH Poster track provides an excellent forum for authors to
present their recent or ongoing projects in an interactive setting,
and receive feedback from the community. We invite submissions
covering any aspect of programming, systems, languages and
applications. The goal of the poster session is to encourage and
facilitate small groups of individuals interested in a technical area
to gather and interact at any desired level of detail.  The poster
session is held early in the conference to promote continued
discussion among interested parties.
