I've been using RPM quite a bit at work and I've been creating a lot of new
packges and it occurred to me that it might it easier for new ocaml users to use
some of the more popular ocaml libraries if they were available in RPM format.
So, I'd like to offer to help any authors of such libraries to package their
libraries in RPM form.  Please just let me know if you're interested.

Second, is anyone working on ocaml-gd bindings?  If not, I might take a stab at
some.

P.S.:  I've uploaded a new version of my ocamldap bindings to the link database.
They're still pretty unsophisticated, but add/modify/delete work now.
