Yes. Recent discussions show that many ocaml'ers would be interested
in contributing to a web application architecture for OCaml.

Before creating the project, we need:
- to find a name
- to define the general shape of the architecture, the motivation
  and the aim of the project, and its organisation

I propose to continue discussions on a specific mailing-list:
web-caml@quatramaran.ens.fr that I just created.
To subscribe, just send a mail to majordomo@quatramaran.ens.fr
with body "subscribe web-caml".

If we create the project on Sourceforge, the list will move.
The first technical discussions will be about the architecture;
people interested in such discussions are welcome even if they
don't want to code a single line.

Hope to see you there !
