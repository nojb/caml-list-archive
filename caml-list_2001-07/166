I don't understand, however, the argument about the order of evaluation
in _this_ case, that is of h::(make_tail args). The value of `h' is
supposed to be computed to this point, and whatever side effects are
present in `make_tail', they cannot influence the result of ::, which is
context-independent. The only difference might be the exceptions, which
can appear in `make_tail' and propagate somewhere, but the result will
not be returned anyway (the call to :: is supposed to be the _last_), so
it doesn't matter if :: is prepared to accept it or not.

Or to introduce a special version of ::, say :!:, which ensures that the
call to make_tail is really the last.
