AFAIK it is available as beta now, but I don't use it.

Note that the cdk doesn't offer any new libraries; it is merely a
compilation of existing libraries and tools in a single package, the
kind that seems to make business folks happy.

Oliver> Is this (cdk) the end of Perl? ;-)

Maybe, but not for technical reasons; there have been hardly any
technical reasons to use Perl for a long time, if only because of
Python.  Rather, it is for social reasons - see above.
