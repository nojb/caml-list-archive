Thanks Alain,

This is great. I had thought about suggesting the creation of a project
and so much as intimated towards such in one of my messages, but thought
it would be presumptuous of me to do so, as I am still only working
through the docs. :)

I also think it was a good idea to delay posting of messages 'til
Monday, giving all time to subscribe.
By the way, what time do the doors open on Monday? :)

Upon visiting your website here are a couple of other architectures you
might add for visiting.

ACS, Arsdigita Community System
High performance reasonably complete web toolkit. Modules for many
things.
Originally written in Tcl and SQL for Oracle and AolServer.
The Tcl version is probably somewhat FPish in that it was written by
Scheme advocates from MIT.
The new Java version is probably going OO.
It is GPL'ed.
http://www.arsdigita.com/products
A port to PostgreSQL is OpenACS is at:
http://www.openacs.org

Another servlet oriented webkit is Webware for Python.
http://webware.sourceforge.net

Personally I'm for simple elegant solutions.
As simple as possible anyway.
Like the XP (eXtreme Programming) people like to say: Do the simplest
thing that works.

Woohoo!!!
