I would love to see your mod_ocaml code.
I don't know how much I will be able contribute as I am learning.
However it would be a good learning opportunity for both OCaml and the
Apache API.

A quality mod_ocaml would potentially help OCaml gain mindshare in the
web development arena. Since OCaml is a good general language, that use
could spill over.

A good architecture first, then performance.
It would be nice to have either in this module or loadable from this
module a module for a pool of database handles. That way we could have
persistent connections to the database.

Just some thoughts.

Thanks for you input (both of you).
I look forward to seeing your code.
Email it to me or send me a link.

Thanks.
