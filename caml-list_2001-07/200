You might want to look at scsh[1] (my standard suggestion for this
list, it seems). The construct you implemented also exists in scsh,
under the name "let-match" (see page 134 of the scsh manual [2]). Many
other constructs are supported, like "if-match" (similar to let-match
but with a clause to be evaluated when the regular expression does not
match), "match-cond" (tries several regular expressions until one
matches) and so on.

Also very interesting in scsh is the sexp-based notation for regular
expressions (pages 112-... of [2]).
