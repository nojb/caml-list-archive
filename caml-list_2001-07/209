Hello,

I'd like to announce the availability of a new library that allows you to
conveniently and efficiently manipulate maps of partially ordered elements
(i.e. also lattice structures) in a purely functional way. Such structures
are often needed in various areas of computer science and artificial
intelligence (e.g. data-mining, databases, software engineering, etc.).

The distribution also contains an example that can render partial orders
in form of Hasse-diagrams using AT&T's dot-utility. Please read the
distributed README for more details. Here is the link (distribution
"POMAP"):

Enjoy!

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
