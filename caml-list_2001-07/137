Subject: [Caml-list] Will Ocaml use a  4-way SMP box without splitting the program into separate processes?

As I understand it, Ocaml has one master lock for handling threading.

Doesn't this mean that a process can never use more than one processor?

And if that is true, following Xavier Leroy idea "Using
separate processes for the HTTP server/servlet container and for the
servlets (but not starting a new servlet process on each request like
CGI does)" is the only scalable way to go.

Because, I don't think a solution that doesn't use a SMP-machine effectively
is a good solution.

What have I misunderstood?
