Only working GNU "make" is necessary, if you do not plan to build
ocaml COM objects, packed as DLL. In the latter case you will also need
"bash" to run camlidldll script. Both "make" and "bash" are available as a
part of free Cygwin environment (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin). If you
only need GNU make, you can forget about Cygwin and grab native Win32 GNU
make from
ftp://ftp.nanotech.wisc.edu/pub/khan/gnu-win32/mingw32/ports/make-3.77-mingw32.zip

Absolutely no problem bulding camlidl in the very similar environment
(WinNT 4.0 instead Win2000). Be sure that "make" is in you path and follow
readme instructions.

Hope to hear from you soon,
