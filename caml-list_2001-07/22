Hello, I'm just new to OCaml. I'm writing a program wich uses a lot of
16 bits operations, and writes them to a buffer. For writing into the
buffer, it is needed for the data to be in 16 bits, not in 32 bits.
Exactly, the program is like a sound synthesizer, so data cannot be send
to sound card in 32 bits.
My problem with OCaml is: how can I manage 16 bits data, and make
operations with it? I had not seen any type in Ocaml with 16bits lenght
(int is 32 bits in my machine). This will frustate my project if I do
not find a solution, so I will use C if there is no other solution...
but I would not like to do if I can avoid it, because I like very much
Ocaml.

I'm hopping your answers. Thanks.
