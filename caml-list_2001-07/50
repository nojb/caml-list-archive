I just read the Ruby site info, and I am puzzled about why one would use
Ruby instead of Smalltalk?

On another topic...

I find it interesting that you percieve Lisp as more popular. I, personally,
find Lisp to be the ultimate modeling clay language, and OCaml the ultimate
production code language -- where I can be assured of no nasty surprises
after six months of use.

There seems to be a general consensus forming that Lisp is very effective
for many problems, but expertise requires on the order of 5 - 10 years of
experience.

But the Lisp users also bemoan lack of popularity. I think it requires a
special personality of user to appreciate multiple languages and enjoy each
of them.
