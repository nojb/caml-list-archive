Does building a functorized module cost anything at all ? I have a
program with a lot of high-level modules that depend on a small set of
interdependent modules parametrized by one common module. Should the
high-level modules get the (already-built) core modules as
``parameters'' from the main module, or should they reconstruct them
by getting only the common module from their parent ? i.e. does functor
application cost anything (time ? memory ?).
