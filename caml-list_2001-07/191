Yes, even since we moved camlcvs from an 8-year old SunOS 4 Sparcstation
(horribly slow, but surprisingly reliable) to a 4-year old PC running the
latest FreeBSD, we've had kernel lock-outs every week or so...  There
is something wrong in the SCSI subsystem (hardware? driver?), but God
knows what exactly.  camlcvs will eventually move to a third platform
in a few weeks; in the meantime, thanks for your patience :-)
