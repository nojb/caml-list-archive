I've seen Ensemble, but it seems much more oriented toward peer-to-peer
group communication than toward the type of client-server model I'm hoping
that a high-level asynchronous library would make easier to implement.  If
Ensemble does provide the necessary tools for writing standard TCP network
servers, then by all means, someone correct me, because it'd be great to be
able to integrate servers and group communication in the same package (and
it could make some of the stuff I hope to implement go much more easily :))
