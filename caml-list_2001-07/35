To save you the effort of creating 100 RPMs for all the OCaml-libraries
out there, it might be more economical to integrate automated generation
of RPMs into the CDK-distribution. As it seems, there are currently only
binaries in tar.{gz,bz2} format available. What do the CDK-maintainers
think? Such a contribution would surely be very helpful for Linux-users
who don't want to build things from source.
