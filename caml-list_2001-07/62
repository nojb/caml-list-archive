I think this would not be a so hard problem: we would just have to
abandon this mailing list to pseudo-programmers and start a new
Caml mailing list on another INRIA's machine!

Anyway, such a flood would be great for our group and INRIA, even if
it is not that interesting for ``real'' Caml programmers and
implementors as you mentioned it...

Hey dear, don't run after the pseudo-programmers crowds like that! If
you want to get good examples of elementary Caml code, there is a
(presumably) much more relevant adress available:

http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/Examples/oc/basics/eng.html

In addition, you would help us if you can add something or criticize
this set of examples when helping your friend to learn Caml !

You're right; however, we would be glad if people would have a look to
our well connected WEB site to find information about Caml, instead of
trying desesperately to connect to Doug Bagley's one ...

Hope this will happen exactly as you describe it :)

We have ambiguous feelings on this point: we need outside visibility
to enforce our inside-INRIA visibility and funding; on the other hand
we are not equipped to face flood and need calm to implement hard
stuff such as generic functions and mu-rule ...
