Hello,

while looking for OCaml program-ressources/libraries,
I found a pdf, describing "cdk".
I have not found the cdk via links on the OCaml-Homepage,
but via google directly to this pdf.

Is the cdk (OCaml development kit) a "planned for the future"
and it was an accident, to find it via google?
The date of the dfocument was very new (MAy 2001)
and it seems to be not ready (Preface without text).

When will it be official available? (Or ist now?)

It looks very interesting; such a big library seems
to give massive power for the OCaml-programmer.

Is this (cdk) the end of Perl? ;-)

Ciao,
   Oliver
