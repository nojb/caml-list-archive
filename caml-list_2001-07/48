Yo Chris,

You may be making the mistake of confusing the average poster on /. 
with the average reader.  You can tell this by noticing that the 
moderaters actually do a pretty good job.  Set your filters high and 
you *can* see something useful.  And the good stuff *does* tend to 
consistently get modded up.

Not to be too presumptuous, but I hadn't posted on slashdot for many 
many months and then for some reason I posted four messages in the 
last couple of days.  They all got a good reception.

   <http://slashdot.org/users.pl?op=userinfo&nick=brucehoult>

I mean, cruise over to that ICFP thread and set your filter to 3.

   <http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/07/05/1413224&threshold=3>

There are twelve messages.  Now, OK, six of those are attempts at 
humour, but the other six are all worth reading.  Well, three of them 
are -- the others are *my* three posts, which got modded up to 3, 3, 
and 4.

I also threw one bombshell into the discussion on nuclear rockets 
being developed by NASA.  That one got immediately modded up to 5.
