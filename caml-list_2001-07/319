This is summer clearance here at INRIA, so I figured I could just as
well release version 1.02 of CamlIDL, the C/Caml stub code generator
and COM binding for Caml.  Available from the usual place:

                  http://caml.inria.fr/camlidl/

The list of changes is included below.

Enjoy,

- Xavier Leroy

CamlIDL 1.02:
-------------

* Added support for the "long long", "hyper int" and "__int64" types
  (64-bit C integers)
* Added support for "const" modifier on pointer types
* Support for [unique] attribute on big arrays, turned into option types
  in the Caml interface
* Generated C code should now compile cleanly with a C++ compiler
* Print source location for most warnings
* Error location was sometimes way off; this is now fixed
* Fixed incorrect code generated for the types HRESULT_int and HRESULT_bool
* Fixed refcount management bug causing early deallocation of interfaces
  implemented in Caml.
