Hello,

I am new to OCaml and Functional programming in general. I am building a
website and would like to know if OCaml is being used for web development.

OCaml has some very intriguing benefits and I am in the process of learning.

I am also considering Erlang for web development.
With Erlang it is a pretty clear path for web development.

I haven't read into that part of the Erlang documentation but has anyone used
OCaml to write any extensions for Erlang?

It would seem to be an interesting combination. Maybe it's just me. :)
Instead of dropping into C drop into OCaml. :)

Any help or pointers greatly appreciated.
