No idea why I was specifically addressed for this, but since you ask...

That's too deep for me, I'm just an American. 

When I first started programming seriously with lots of other people
reading and modifying programs that I wrote, people would argue a lot
about non-issues like where to put the braces. My basic rule is that 
I'd like the programs to look as though they'd been written by one person, 
with a consistent style. I can basically adapt to anything and in two 
weeks or so a new style will seem normal. I note that the new guidelines 
Pierre mentions say much the same thing 

  Choose a generally accepted style of indentation, then use it
  systematically throughout the whole application. 

It seems that the Caml community mostly indents by two spaces, so if 
you'd like to be a good neighbor you should do so as well. No one will 
shun you if you refuse and use four spaces, and your code will still 
be readable. Well, OK, I'll shun you, but probably noone else :-).

Its wise to invest some time reading the compiler sources. I wish I had
done so earlier.

PS: It would be useful to have the programming guidelines extended to
    cover programming with classes and modules.
