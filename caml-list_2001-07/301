How does one contribute to the CDK? I have a couple of packages
that I'd like to make available (including one miraculously 
simple implementation of balanced binary trees[*]), and I'm 
curious what to email where and how I should document it.


[*] Randomized treaps. This is the only balanced tree structure 
I've seen for which I can remember how to write a deletion function 
off the top of my head, without any complex case analysis.
