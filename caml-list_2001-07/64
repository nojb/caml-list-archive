Yes.  I didn't write the code, but I'm sure that's the reason.
A list of pairs will use two two-word cells per list element,
whereas a bucketlist will use one three-word cell; as well as reducing
the amount of memory allocated, it also avoids an indirection.

P.S. We happen to use the same kind of trick in the Mercury standard library,
for lists of tokens in the Mercury lexer:

   % This "fat list" representation is more efficient than a list of pairs.
   :- type token_list      --->    token_cons(token, token_context, token_list)
                           ;       token_nil.

But note that we at least document why we do it! ;-)
