Jeremy,
  If you're interested in writing TCP based servers, than Ensemble
won't be much help to you. The standard OCaml Unix library is quite
sufficient for these purposes. Ensemble comes into its own when you
want to write fault-tolerant group-communication style servers. 
  
  All the best, 
	Ohad.
