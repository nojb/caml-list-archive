[I just noticed this thread has been on caml-announce.  I've switched it over.  Perhaps the reply-to header on caml-announce should be set to caml-list?]

You're kidding, right?  A syntax decision on an important feature that has no backwards compatibility restrictions and will be with us forever is being made because you don't want to type 4 more characters?  Dude, look into dabbrev-expand or bind a key to (insert "typecase") or something.  

This is exactly how languages get to the point where a newcomer decides to start learning it and quickly says, "what the hell were they thinking?"  Sometimes over and over again.

SML's had it since, what, 1970?

Then do that instead.  I'm fine with not having to type it at all, but then make that the official syntax and don't make case a reserved word.  Yes, I guarantee having it in there is going to be confusing to new people.  Please, either remove it, or change it to typecase (or whatever), before it's too late.
