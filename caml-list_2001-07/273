Hi, all. I'm thinking of developing a client-server application using
O'Caml. The choices at this point seem to be CORBA (through C) or SOAP, both
of which would entail quite a bit of work to use in O'Caml, I think. But
looking around yesterday, I came across Ensemble, from Cornell, which seems
like an excellent framework for all manner of network programming, including
client-server. But checking through the Ensemble CVS logs, it doesn't seem
that the code's been touched in nearly 2 years. Does this mean that it's
reached a state of perfection or of total disuse? Is anyone out there using
Ensemble for large-scale (say, > 500 clients) applications? Will anyone
argue for or against it vis-a-vis CORBA or SOAP? Broadly, my requirements
are to run that many clients with some decent security, possibly involving a
3rd party VPN solution but preferably with (at least some aspects of)
security integrated right into the networking code (e.g. CORBA/SSL, SOAP
over HTTPS). And the servers would be some flavor of UNIX, so no DCOM (as
far as I know). Particularly appealing about Ensemble is the possibility of
later adding more peer-to-peer style messaging between clients in a part of
the application separate from the client-server part. Thank you for your
thoughts.

Best,
Aaron Roth
