                              BABEL 2001

                   First workshop on multi-language
                 infrastructure and interoperability.

                           Part of PLI 2001

                 Firenze, Italy. 8th September 2001.

           http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/babel01.htm

                Preliminary programme now available at
         http://research.microsoft.com/~nick/babel01prog.htm



AIMS AND SCOPE

Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in multi-language
tools and intermediate languages, and in interoperability between
programs and components written in different programming
languages. Shared infrastructure such as code generators, analysis
tools and garbage collectors can greatly ease the task of producing a
high-quality implementation of a new programming language, whilst
being able to interoperate easily with code written in existing
languages is essential for such an implementation to be useful in
practice.  This workshop aims to bring together researchers and
developers working on multi-language integration.=20
