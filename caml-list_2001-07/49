Hello,

out of curiousity: how are things developing with the Caml-consortium? It
would be interesting to know e.g. how many partners have participated
and (if you are allowed to tell us) what kind of participation this is
(e.g. whether they prefer software transfer, etc.) and what kind of
general goals they have in mind by supporting further development. If
this form of cooperation works well in practice, it might act as a model
for other projects...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
