I am using the native Win32 port of OCaml, not Cygwin.  I plan to work in the 
native Win32 environment (since I don't have a Linux box), and I am using the 
wxWindows library with Visual C++ for GUI front-end coding.

Since camlidl is at least in part a Windows-oriented utility, my expectation 
was that I would not have to make it from a bash console.  I simply don't have 
much experience with bash.  Any pointers?

Thanks,

Kyle Pierce
