Hello,

One of my first experiments with OCaml has been to try and build the camlidl 
utility (version 1.01) to help me build a library with OCaml and then call it 
from a C++ executable.  I'm in a Windows 2000 environment, but no COM features 
are needed, I just want the glue code for integrating with C/C++.

However, I am having a terrible time getting camlidl built.  I have GNU make 
and the cygwin utilities installed, as suggested in the readme file.  I cannot 
get beyond the various problems I'm having with this.  Would I have to actually 
do the build entirely within the cygwin environment, using bash?  Or what?  I 
would be grateful for any suggestions.

Alternatively, has anyone built a native code camlidl.exe that you would be 
willing to share?  Or for that matter, a bytecode version?

Thanks,

Kyle Pierce
