Just my $0.02:

camlidl let you call C functions from caml, automatically generating all
necessary interface code (main caml program, C library). It also supports
COM ABI under Win32/Unix -- you can have main C/C++ program (or any other
COM-compatible application), and call caml component for any service.

Rigth now I am trying to use caml for some part of large Win32 project,
most of which is being developing using MSVC. Camlidl does its job,
although some non-fixed bugs are still there.

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
