This is about right, but you need to be very careful about
bootstrapping issues.  What should work is:
- start with pristine OCaml sources
- do "make world"
- perform your changes
- do "make all"  (NOT "make world")
- do "make bootstrap" to make sure everything is OK.

This said, there is absolutely no need to change the system to get
access to new C primitives: the -custom mode or the -make-runtime and
-use-runtime options to ocamlc provide much simpler ways of doing it.

Indeed, I would advise against adding your stuff to Pervasives and the
standard runtime system: it's going to be much harder for you to track
OCaml changes and for others to use your code.
