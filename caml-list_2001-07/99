We also implemented a regular expression module for Unison, as the
standard one (Str) was unusably slow.  It has a similar interface to
the one by Claude Marché, but it is more complete: it support almost
all Posix extended regular expression (only collating sequences are
missing), filename globbing, case insensitive matching, and boolean
operations (union, intersection and difference) on regular expression.
Both implementation have the disavantage of not supporting submatches,
though.  It would be interesting to compare their perfomances.

The sources are a stand-alone subset (files src/rx.ml and src/rx.mli)
of the sources of Unison (available from
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/index.html).
