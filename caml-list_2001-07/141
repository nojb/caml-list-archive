Hi Alexander,

> Do you develop direct bindings of wxWindows to OCaml, or develop the 
application layer you need directly in VC++ and call it from OCaml?

If I had some experience with developing direct bindings the way they did with 
WxPython (for example), I might attempt to do something similar with OCaml.  I 
am not very happy with Tcl/Tk and I couldn't even get that working with OCaml 
anyway.

I have a more modest solution, however: to write the whole front end in VC++ 
using wxWindows, and call my OCaml code from that front end.  I am not 
especially interested in handling GUI events from OCaml anyway.  But if it were 
not too hard to create something like a wxOCaml, I would use it for sure.  Of 
course, one hurdle would be to get the interface to C/C++ working, which is 
what camlidl seems to be good for.

Kyle
