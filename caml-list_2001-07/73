There's a reversible String.escaped function, and I think it would be
nice to have its inverse function built in the String module.

Also I'd like to see those horrible functions returning parameters in
global variables be eradicated, such as those that can be found in the Str
(regular expression) module. Is there a complete, typeful regular
expression package entirely written in Ocaml ?

Many people on this list are talking lighthearted about functions such
as Obj.magic. These functions are pure evil. It makes me sorry to see
that my favorite language has an unsafe and ugly type casting
function. Modules using such features should be flagged as
``evil'', and the use of these functions should not be publicly
advocated.

PS. What is the purpose of the "uses unsafe features" flag in .cmo
files ?  (it can be seen in the output of the "objinfo" program in the
tools/ directory of the compiler). I've made a test program using
unsafe features such as Obj and Array.unsafe_get but the flag wasn't
set.
