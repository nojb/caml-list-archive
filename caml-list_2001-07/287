Aaron,
      I'm the Ensemble maintainer, so I can give you some answers. Ensmeble
has been released in its version 1.00
 about a year ago by Cornell, and it is very stable. Work is now focused
mainly on stabilizing, cleanup, porting to new OSes, etc.
Actually, I'm finishing up a new distribution these days.

     If you are interested in writing ML code, then Ensemble is a good
choice. Security is integrated into the group-communication aspect
of the system, and not to the TCP style connections. However, this could be
added if you'll ask.

    IF you pick up the system, you can send me mail with any questions,

     All the best,
         Ohad.

Subject:  [Caml-list] Ensemble (English sense)




Hi, all. I'm thinking of developing a client-server application using
O'Caml. The choices at this point seem to be CORBA (through C) or SOAP,
both
of which would entail quite a bit of work to use in O'Caml, I think. But
looking around yesterday, I came across Ensemble, from Cornell, which seems
like an excellent framework for all manner of network programming,
including
client-server. But checking through the Ensemble CVS logs, it doesn't seem
that the code's been touched in nearly 2 years. Does this mean that it's
reached a state of perfection or of total disuse? Is anyone out there using
Ensemble for large-scale (say, > 500 clients) applications? Will anyone
argue for or against it vis-a-vis CORBA or SOAP? Broadly, my requirements
are to run that many clients with some decent security, possibly involving
a
3rd party VPN solution but preferably with (at least some aspects of)
security integrated right into the networking code (e.g. CORBA/SSL, SOAP
over HTTPS). And the servers would be some flavor of UNIX, so no DCOM (as
far as I know). Particularly appealing about Ensemble is the possibility of
later adding more peer-to-peer style messaging between clients in a part of
the application separate from the client-server part. Thank you for your
thoughts.

Best,
Aaron Roth
