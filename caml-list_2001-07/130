As usual, never trust statistics that you haven't faked yourself...

Such things can be pretty language and compiler dependent. At least
what concerns Patricia trees, I can assert that they really perform
very well in OCaml. This is obviously not true for red-black trees:
on my simple tests with random numbers, insertion took longer than with
balanced binary trees, and lookup also didn't seem competitive. Anyway,
I don't claim that my statistics are faked better than his... ;)
