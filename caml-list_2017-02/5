Thanks Gabriel for your quick reply.

This seems amusing indeed, but does not quite work for me. Running 
ocamlbuild
once fails, complaining that A.ml does not exist (whereas A.cppo.ml exists).
If I immediately run ocamlbuild again, the build succeeds.

I think I would prefer to use a slightly less amusing approach and just find
out, ahead of time, what the dependencies are. In the rule that transforms
%.cppo.ml to %.ml, could I just read the source file, looking #include
patterns, and ask that the included files be built first?
