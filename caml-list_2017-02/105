Hmmm... perhaps I could test this bug by decreasing my stack size
limit on my computer?

The example given seems to show a problem with the file
meta/q_MLast.ml which indeed contains a statement EXTEND which
generates a rather long OCaml expression. Strange that this problem
does not occur with ocaml_src/meta/q_MLast.ml which is a pretty
printed version of the same file (for Camlp5 cold stard).

I could try to split this EXTEND into several parts to make OCaml
not having to use so much memory?

BTW, how to show one's stack size limit (Linux) and change it?
