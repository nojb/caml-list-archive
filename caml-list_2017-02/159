Compose is a conference for typed functional programmers, focused
specifically on Haskell, OCaml, F#, SML, and related technologies. It will
be held in New York on Thursday and Friday, May 18-19, 2017. Registration
will be open shortly.

http://www.composeconference.org/2017

To get a sense of Compose, you can check out the great talks from past
conferences: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0pEknZxL7Q1j0Ok8qImWdQ

Below is our call for presentations. We recognize the deadline is tight, so
feel free to submit proposals and ideas on the less-polished side.

http://www.composeconference.org/2017/cfp/

***

The audience for Compose is Haskell, OCaml, F#, or SML developers who are
looking to increase their skills or learn new technologies and libraries.
Presentations should be aimed at teaching or introducing new ideas or
tools. We are also interested in presentations aiming at taking complex
concepts, such as program derivation, and putting them into productive use.
However proposals on anything that you suspect our audience may find
interesting are welcome. The following are some of the types of talks we
would welcome:

Library/Tool Talks =E2=80=94 Exploring the uses of a powerful toolkit or li=
brary,
be it for parsing, testing, data access and analysis, or anything else.

Production Systems =E2=80=94 Experience reports on deploying functional tec=
hniques
in real systems; insights revealed, mistakes made, lessons learned.

Theory made Practical =E2=80=94 Just because it=E2=80=99s locked away in pa=
pers doesn=E2=80=99t
mean it=E2=80=99s hard! Accessible lectures on classic results and why they=
 matter
to us today. Such talks can include simply introducing the principles of a
field of research so as to help the audience read up on it in the future;
from abstract machines to program derivation to branch-and-bound
algorithms, the sky=E2=80=99s the limit.

We also welcome proposals for more formal tutorials. Tutorials should be
aimed at a smaller audience of beginner-to-novice understanding, and
ideally include hands-on exercises.

The due date for submissions is March 23, 2017. We will send out notice of
acceptance by March 30th. We prefer that submissions be via the EasyChair
website (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcompose2017). Please
suggest a title, and describe the topic you intend to speak on. Talks can
be either 30 or 45 minutes, please indicate how much time you would
prefer to take.

Additional information may be included on both your expertise and the
interesting elements of your topic, going on what might be included in a
public abstract. Furthermore, if your abstract doesn't feel "final"=E2=80=
=94don't
worry! We'll work with you to polish it up. If you want to discuss your
proposal(s) before submitting, or to further nail down what you intend to
speak on, please feel free to contact us at info@composeconference.org.
We're happy to work with you, even if you are a new or inexperienced
speaker, to help your talk be great.

***

Diversity

We would like to put an emphasis on soliciting a diverse set of speakers -
anything you can do to distribute information about this CFP and encourage
submissions from under-represented groups would be greatly appreciated. We
welcome your contributions and encourage you to apply!

Best,
Gershom
