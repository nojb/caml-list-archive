For the third time, I am proud to invite all OCaml enthusiasts to join
us at OCaml Meeting 2010 in Paris.

This year event takes place in Paris on Friday 16th April 2010.
Subscription is opened and will be closed on Friday 2nd April 2010.

Presentations include:

* Enforcing Type-Safe Linking using Inter-Package Relationships for
* OCaml Debian packages
* The Ocamlviz visualization toolkit
* Cluster computing in Ocaml
* Ocaml in a web startup
* React, functional reactive programming for OCaml
* OASIS, a Cabal like system for OCaml
* OPA, same web, but with types and lambda

As last year, participants are invited to give a talk on what they are
doing with OCaml. You can submit a description of your talk on the wiki
or contact me.

The meeting is sponsored by INRIA, the Caml Consortium and OCamlCore.
Inscription is free but the number of participants is limited.

The day after OCaml Meeting, Mehdi Dogguy from PPS helps me to organize
an informal day where OCaml teams can meet to work. We will have 2
classrooms, each can host 45 persons. There will be an internet access
and a blackboard in each room. Inscription is free.

Volunteers willing to help before/during these events can contact me
directly. We are particularly looking for a video team. You can also
forward this invitation to any groups that can be interested in (Haskell
user group, CUFP mailing list...)

For people who need further information, you can contact me (see
wiki.cocan.org for contact details).

Hope to see a lot of you 
Regards 
Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of the OCaml Meeting organization team.
