Doctoral and PhD Workshop
4th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems 
(DEBS 10)
July 11-15, 2010 - Cambridge, United Kingdom
http://www.debs.org/2010

DEBS 2010 will host a one-day Doctoral/PhD Workshop to be held in 
Cambridge, United Kingdom on July 11, 2010. The aim of the workshop is 
to provide feedback to PhD students working on topics related to 
event-based systems, complex event processing and publish/subscribe 
systems. To attend, PhD students are invited to submit a short paper 
describing their PhD work.

IMPORTANT DATES:
PhD workshop submission: May 24, 2010
Author notification: June 21,2010

GOALS AND SCOPE: The second DEBS PhD workshop is a forum for PhD 
students working in the broad areas of event-based systems, complex 
event processing and publish/subscribe systems. The goal of the 
workshop is to support students in their PhD project by providing a 
venue to present (preliminary) work, by stimulating feedback from 
experienced researchers and by facilitating interactions among PhD 
students.

We encourage students who are somewhere in the middle of their 
research to submit to this workshop to get feedback on their overall 
thesis work. They should be more or less clear about the problem that 
they want to target and have take preliminary steps towards the 
solution. In addition, we invite students who are at the beginning of 
their PhD work and would like to receive feedback on their initial 
research ideas, maybe before submitting a first workshop or conference 
paper.

Paper presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, with 25 additional 
minutes for discussion. This event will be a workshop in the true 
meaning of the word, with a focus on discussion and interaction. 
Additional social events for all participants will allow for further 
interaction.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES: Papers should describe the problem addressed as 
part of the PhD work, explain its importance, discuss shortcomings of 
existing solutions and give some indication of steps towards a 
solution. There should be enough substance to encourage discussion at 
the workshop, but the work does not need to be complete. Please also 
include a thesis outline and a summary of further planned work.

Submitted papers should have 3-6 pages for PhD students part-way 
through their PhD and 1 page for beginning PhD students. All papers 
should be formatted according to the same rules as regular DEBS 
papers. Submissions must be single-author with the name of the 
supervisor mentioned. Authors should submit their papers in PDF format 
through the DEBS EasyChair conference management system 
(https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=debs10>, clearly indicating 
the type of paper. No copyrighted proceedings will be published (so 
future publication of the work in conferences/journals is not 
precluded), but accepted submissions will be made available 
electronically to all participants.

Important: We will not accept submissions that are typical conference 
paper submissions without explicit focus on the PhD work.

STRUCTURE: The Program Committee for this workshop consists mainly of 
distinguished researchers who are prominent in the field of 
event-based systems or who have obtained their own PhDs not too long 
ago. Members of the Program Committee will attend the PhD workshop to 
encourage and help, answer questions and give feedback. The PhD 
workshop will provide a friendly and supportive atmosphere for PhD 
students. There will be time to get to know other students and 
researcher from a range of countries and backgrounds and to have fun 
as well as to work.
