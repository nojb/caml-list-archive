Third Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
25 September 2010,  Baltimore, USA
A satellite workshop of ICFP 2010

PRESENTATION
The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is 
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a 
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on 
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in 
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of 
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable 
power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is the 
paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical insights 
manifest in programs and in programming language design: 
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation 
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow, to 
name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to 
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006. 
Selected papers were published as a special issue of the Journal of 
Functional Programming (volume 19, issue 3-4).
The second MSFP workshop was held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP 
2008.

SUBMISSIONS
Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted 
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Programme 
Committee members, barring the co-chairs, may (and indeed are encouraged 
to) contribute. Accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by one 
of the authors.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.

We are using the EasyChair software to manage submissions.
To submit a paper, please log in at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=msfp2010

The workshop proceedings will be published by ACM.

TIMELINE:
Submission of abstracts: 9 April
Submission of papers: 16 April
Notification: 28 May
Final versions due: 25 June
Workshop: 25 September
