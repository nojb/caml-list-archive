This restriction is placed there due to a clause in the contract I 
originally developed this code under for a commercial company - I was 
paid for writing it, and in exchange we have shared copyright.

I cannot remove it without their permission. I can't imagine any 
circumstances under which I would add such a clause myself. Since the 
contract under which it was developed has ended, there is no way that 
they could induce me to add to the list of companies in that clause, and 
I would not do so.

I'm not happy with the situation, but I hope the above reassures.

Cheers,
