The danger of this on the other hand is that starting a mjor GC cycle
will most likely eat even more memory at first.

A signal would probably not be so helpfull. I was thinking more about a
memory preassure value. For example the kernel could provide a variable
in the vdso block saying:

0-100: You should shrink your memory usage to that many % of current
100+:  You could grow your memory to that many % of current

The kernel could consider the processes memory use, amount used for
caching in the process, other processes, general caching and the number
of hits to the pages to get a fair value for each process. and so on.

There could also be a SIGFREE signal to tell processes they must clean
up now or face the OOM killer but that would be secondary for me. I
don't ever want to see the OOM killer anyway.
