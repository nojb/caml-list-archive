Hello caml list.

I'm suffering "out of memory" problem.
My program makes large graphs, but I didn't expect they need so much =
memory like that.
(I'm not sure there is the infinite loop or not..)

Can't I use "ocamlrun -v" for my program such that it use foreign =
language interface with C.
If I couldn't, can you give me a good debugging methodology?
It's very difficult to find out that error because of using foreign =
language interface..

I'm waiting for your cool answer.

Best,
