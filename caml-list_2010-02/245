That seemed a little heavy for the first day of having it but I've
bookmarked the link for the future!

I had the same experience with 3.11.2 - the error message from configure
could be better, but that won't matter once it's fixed in 3.12.0 (as you
say).

Enabling the SDK repository allowed me to install bash, make, gcc,
libc6-dev, tcl8.5-dev, tk8.5-dev and libx11-dev.

(aside, which probably demonstrates my ignorance more than a bug/problem in
anything: I've never used aptitude before - I was amused that installing gcc
doesn't automatically upgrade glibc to the dev version as you end up with a
C compiler which can't link. Couldn't quite imagine a situation where that's
handy but hey ho!)

OCaml 3.12.0+dev17 compiles out of the box (using -prefix /opt/maemo) -
ocamlbrowser works (i.e. labltk) and ocamlopt is fine. The reference run of
a command line app of mine takes 5 mins 20 sec (impressive as it takes 31
seconds on my Intel P8600 laptop and used to take about 4:30 on the machine
on which it was originally developed).
