       Dear list,
 I'm writing some code that needs to be able to cope nicely with memory =
exhaustion. That is, it should be able to detect at some point if it is =
getting close to exhausting memory, and take the necessary course of =
action (e.g. bailing out nicely). I'm wondering what's the best way of =
doing this. I've been thinking about installing a [Gc.alarm] and =
checking [Gc.free_words], [Gc.free_blocks], [Gc.largest_free] just after =
each major cycle, but I'm wondering if it's the best technique.

Any suggestion?

Thanks in advance,
 David
