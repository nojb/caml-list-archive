I am not sure that the licence requires you to make it a patch, if the syntax of your grammar is sufficiently different. 
(for instance, to port it to ANTLR/PCCTS). But I am not a lawyer.

If you intend to make a free software of your parser, perhaps the easiest way would be to ask kindly the Ocaml team?

My feeling is that your understanding of Ocaml's licence is too restrictive, especially if you play the free software 
game. But I am not a lawyer!

And a language syntax is not described by a yacc grammar, but by a human readable document. AFAIK, the Ocaml reference 
manual is not covered by QPL.

Regards.
