hello !

i would like to use the polymorhpic hash function on strings. But i would
like to know what is the probability of a collision between two hashes.

my first question is about the range of the Hashtbl.hash function: what is
its range ? ( string -> [1..N] ?)

the second question is : can i assume that the result is a uniform
distribution over [1..N] ? (for 10=E2=81=B6 words which is an estimation of=
 the
english vocabulary size)

the third one is : is it possible to predict which will be the collision ? =
I
mean collisions are between words which are very 'similar' (for ex: "boy"
and "boys") or are completely unpredictable.

thanks !
