If you include your OCaml includes in an 'extern C' block like this:

extern "C" {
#include <caml/mlvalues.h>
/* other OCaml includes */
}

then the C++ compiler should have the right symbol names so that it can
look things up in the runtime.  The headers do not have extern C
declarations in them, but they are able to be imported cleanly in an
extern "C" block.
