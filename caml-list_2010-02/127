I don't believe anyone is working on porting OCaml to LLVM.

The nearest work is probably my own HLVM project which reached a major=20
milestone recently and is now capable of high-performance parallel=20
programming:

various features from OCaml (e.g. polymorphic recursion) in order to provid=
e=20
easily-obtained, predictable and high performance.
