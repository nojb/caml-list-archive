I have a translator from a Pascal-like trading language written in OCaml =
and I need the output to run as a DLL embedded in a trading platform.=20

I'm thinking of generating bytecode and have the user pass the path to =
the bytecode file to the DLL during initialization.=20

I don't want to load source code into my runtime since I want to do a =
lot of error checking on it to make sure the runtime experience is =
smooth. I don't want to ship ocamlc, etc. since I want to have a single =
executable. I'm not sure if embedding OCaml (and thus a license!) is =
needed to generate OCaml bytecode in my scenario, so the bytecode I'm =
talking about is my bytecode.

I understand that a bit of C will be required to wrap the OCaml runtime =
in a DLL. I would prefer to stay with OCaml for the whole project which =
prompts my question...=20

Has anyone used OCaml to write a virtual machine?

How big is the OCaml runtime when bundled as a DLL or shared library?

	Thanks, Joel
