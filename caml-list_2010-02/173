Basil,

I agree that my reading might well be too restrictive. Indeed, if  
anyone who understands these matters well can clarify, I'd appreciate  
it.

Regarding the issue of syntax -- true in principle, but the fact of  
the matter is that I started with the yacc grammar, not the reference  
manual.  As an earlier thread on this list discussed [1], the manual  
is more of a guideline, then a specification. :-)

Cheers,
Yitzhak
