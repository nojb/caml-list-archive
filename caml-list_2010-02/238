I understand that :
- you want to generate some bytecode (with your own bytecode specs)
from the Pascal-like language
- interprete this bytecode with a VM written in OCaml
but actually I don't quite understand your question :-/

> Has anyone used OCaml to write a virtual machine?

Some people (including some colleagues of mine (and me), actually)
have used OCaml to write an OCaml virtual machine.
(I've heard someone say (indirectly) that we were not the first).
It is an interesting exercise... for people who prefer writing in
OCaml rather than in C.
It's also interesting to run an OCaml VM in an OCaml VM ... in an
OCaml VM, the last one being in OCaml compiled with ocamlopt or in C
(or in Java [Cadmium] or in JavaScript [O'Browser], though we haven't
tried), and all the previous one being in OCaml compiled with ocamlc.

> How big is the OCaml runtime when bundled as a DLL or shared library?

Sorry I've no idea for this question.
