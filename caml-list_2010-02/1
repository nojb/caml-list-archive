                        Call for papers
              20th International Symposium on
      Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                        LOPSTR 2010

   http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/conferences/lopstr2010/
           Hagenberg, Austria, July 23-25, 2010
                 (co-located with PPDP 2010)

=========================================================================

Objectives:

The  aim  of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and  promote international
research  and collaboration  on logic-based program  development.  LOPSTR
is  open  to  contributions in  logic-based  program  development  in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR  has a reputation for  being a lively, friendly
forum for presenting and discussing work in  progress. Formal proceedings
are produced only after the  symposium, so  authors  can  incorporate the
feedback in the published papers.

The  20th International Symposium on  Logic-based Program  Synthesis  and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2010) will be held in Hagenberg, Austria; previous
symposia were held in Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice, London,  Verona,
Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,  Leuven,  Stockholm,
Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and  Manchester.  LOPSTR 2010 will be co-
located  with  PPDP 2010 (12th  International  ACM  SIGPLAN  Symposium on
Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).


Topics:

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based  program development,
all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-
the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing applications in
these areas are especially welcome.  Contributions  are  welcome  on  all
aspects of logic-based program development,  including,  but not  limited
to:

specification                         synthesis
verification                          transformation
analysis                              optimisation
specialization                        inversion
composition                           program/model manipulation
certification                         security
transformational techniques in SE     applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspect of the  above  topics  from  a new
perspective. Application papers, that describe experience with industrial
applications, are also welcome.  Papers must describe original  work,  be
written and presented in English, and must not substantially overlap with
papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a
journal  or a conference  with  refereed  proceedings.  Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may
be submitted.

Following  past  editions,  publication  of  the  formal  post-conference
proceedings in the Springer series  Lecture  Notes  in  Computer  Science
(LNCS) is envisaged.


IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

Paper/extended abstract submission:   March 25, 2010
Notification (for pre-proceedings):   May 15, 2010
Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings):   June 15, 2010
Symposium:                            July 23-25, 2010

Submissions can either be (short) extended  abstracts  or  (full)  papers
whose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages, respectively.  Submissions
must be  formatted  in  the  Springer  LNCS  style (excluding well-marked
appendices not intended for publication).  Referees are not  required  to
read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them.
Short papers may describe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.

Both short and  full  papers  can  be  accepted  for  presentation at the
symposium and will then appear  in the LOPSTR 2010  pre-proceedings. Full
papers can also be immediately accepted  for publication  in  the  formal
proceedings published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. In addition,
after the symposium, the programme committee will select further short or
full  papers  presented  in  LOPSTR  2010  to  be  considered  for formal
publication. These authors will be invited to revise and/or extend  their
submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then
after  another  round of  reviewing,  these  revised  papers can also  be
published in the formal post-proceedings.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission page
   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2010
They should be in PDF format and interpretable by Acrobat Reader.
