Hi Folks,

Get the demo here:

http://www.coherentpdf.com/proview.html

The back-end is all code shared with the open-source CamlPDF and our 
other commercial products. We wrote a C interface, and then compiled it 
up with objective C for the interface.

There will be a new release of CamlPDF in a few weeks, with some new 
functionality and a new introductory manual, making it easier for people 
to get into its somewhat complicated API.

Thanks to the list for your continuing answers to my questions.

Cheers,
