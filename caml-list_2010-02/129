Hi there,

I have a few questions relating to using Ocaml with objective-c for anyone who programs on a Mac. I am aware that there aren't any real bindings between ocaml and objective-c/cocoa, so I am investigating rolling my own. So:

1) Does anyone have experience in interfacing ocaml and objc? Is it difficult?
2) Does anyone have a small example project that does mix these two languages? I have looked at unison, but it is too big for me to get my head around. I am thinking more on the scale of the ubiquitous Currency Converter...
3) Does anyone who is mixing these languages use Xcode to do so? If so, what steps do you need to go through to set that up?

A big thanks to anyone who can answer (some of) these questions. I am trying to decide whether to use haskell or ocaml for my next cocoa application, as these are the two languages I am most comfortable. I have recently found an excellent description of how to do this using haskell (http://tscheff.blogspot.com/2010/02/currync-converter-using-haskell-with.html) and was wondering if there were such resources for ocaml.

Thanks,
Andrew
