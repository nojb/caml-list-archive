Hi,

My project would really benefit from some simple camlp4 syntax
extensions, however, I am put off by the lack of a reference manual
for it.

At the moment I am tempted to go for camlp5 instead - not least
because I was able to work through it's manual and get some examples
working a while back.

The reality is I would prefer to use camlp4 as it appears to the
official ocaml supported way, but can't see how to get into it as a
beginner due to the lack of documentation (and that appears to have
been the case for quite some time now).  What should one do?

Cheers,
Andy
