Workshop description

CICLOPS is a series of colloquia on the implementation of constraint
logic programming. Logic and Constraint programming is an important
declarative programming paradigm. The features offered by this
paradigm such as rule-basedness, pattern matching, automated
backtracking, recursion, tabling, and constraint solving have been
proved convenient for many programming tasks. Recent improvements in
implementation technologies combined with advances in hardware and
systems software have made logic and constraint programming a viable
choice for many real-world problems.

CICLOPS'10 continues a tradition of successful workshops on
Implementations of Logic Programming Systems, previously held with in
Budapest (1993) and Ithaca (1994), the Compulog Net workshops on
Parallelism and Implementation Technologies held in Madrid (1993 and
1994), Utrecht (1995) and Bonn (1996), the Workshop on Parallelism and
Implementation Technology for (Constraint) Logic Programming Languages
held in Port Jefferson (1997), Manchester (1998), Las Cruces (1999),
and London (2000), and more recently the Colloquium on Implementation
of Constraint and LOgic Programming Systems in Paphos (Cyprus, 2001),
Copenhagen (2002), Mumbai (2003), Saint Malo (France, 2004), Sitges
(Spain, 2005), Seattle (U.S.A., 2006), Porto (Portugal, 2007), Udine
(Italy, 2008), and Pasadena (U.S.A, 2009).

WLPE is a series of workshops on practical logic-based software
development methods and tools. Software plays a crucial role in modern
society. While software keeps on growing in size and complexity, it is
more than ever required to be delivered on time, free of error and
meeting the most stringent efficiency requirements. Thus more demands
are placed on the software developer, and consequently, the need for
methods and tools that support the programmer in every aspect of the
software development process is widely recognized. Logic plays a
fundamental role in analysis, verification and optimization in all
programming languages, not only in those based directly on logic. The
use of logic-based techniques in software development is a very active
area in computing; emerging programming paradigms and growing
complexity of the properties to be verified pose new challenges for
the community, while emerging reasoning techniques can be exploited.

WLPE'10 continues the series of successful international workshops on
logic programming environments held in Ohio, USA (1989), Eilat, Israel
(1990), Paris, France (1991), Washington D.C., USA (1992), Vancouver,
Canada (1993), Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy (1994), Portland, USA
(1995), Leuven, Belgium (1997), Las Cruces, USA (1999), Paphos, Cyprus
(2001), Copenhagen, Denmark (2002), Mumbai, India (2003), Saint Malo,
France (2004), Sitges (Barcelona), Spain (2005), Seattle, USA (2006),
Porto, Portugal (2007) and Udine, Italy (2008). More information about
the series of WLPE workshops can be found at
http://www.cs.usask.ca/projects/envlop/WLPE/

CICLOPS-WLPE 2010 aims at bringing together, in an informal setting,
people involved in research in the design and implementation of logic
and constraint programming languages and systems and on logic-based
methods and tools which support program development and analysis. In
addition to papers describing more conceptual and theoretical work,
papers describing the implementation of, and experience with, such
tools will be welcome.


Topics:

     * Abstract machines and compilation techniques
     * Compile-time analysis and its application to code generation
     * Memory management, indexing, and garbage collection issues
     * Profiling tools and performance evaluation
     * Implementation of concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems
     * Extensions such as tabling, constraints, probabilistic reasoning, =
and learning
     * New features such as ASP and coinduction
     * Object-oriented and module systems
     * Integration with other systems such as CP, SAT, LP/MLP, and =
Database systems
     * Experiences from using systems in real-life applications
     * Static and dynamic analysis
     * Debugging and testing
     * Program verification and validation,
     * Code generation from specifications,
     * Termination analysis,
     * Constraints
     * Rewriting
     * Profiling and performance analysis,
     * Type and mode analysis,
     * Module systems,
     * Optimization tools,
     * Program understanding,
     * Refactoring
     * Logical meta-languages

Authors who are interested in taking part in the workshop, but are
unsure if their work falls within its scope, are invited to contact
the organizers and will be given suitable advice.
