IANAL!

What *exactly* do you mean by port? A line-by-line conversion of
parsing/parser.mly to a your new parser generator's syntax or a brand new
file which exactly parses the same grammar as parsing/parser.mly?

If you're doing a line-by-line conversion then that might reasonably be
regarded as derivative but if you produce a brand new source file for your
new parser generator for the OCaml language then I would not expect that to
be covered by any aspect of OCaml's licence because the licence covers the
source code of Inria's OCaml (i.e. Copyright) and not the idea of the OCaml
language (i.e. Patent). I have no idea whether the OCaml grammar is
patented, though I'd be surprised if it were as you would have expected
Microsoft to have steered clear when developing F#.

If you're using it as a demo, then I expect you'll find that the benevolent
OCaml team may well be happy to exempt the licence for that use anyway!

HTH,
