I think it is an error, but since there is only one possibility in the
case of Some, maybe it is not important (i.e. you can distingish between
the two variant None | Some just looking at the fact there are block or
not).

Yes. At least this is what I understand from section "18.3.4 Concrete
types" of the OCaml manual. As a matter of fact, I never had problems
following this convention before.
