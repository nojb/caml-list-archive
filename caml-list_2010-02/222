Hello,

I represent a company called SPS Solutions, a company that does what's 
known as advanced search engine placement. We reach a Network of   
nearly 36,000,000 people who are largely US based. Our Network is entirely 
opt-in, and the users on our Network allow us to present them with a 
preferred choice whenever they are looking for anything on the major 
search engines. (GOOGLE, YAHOO, BING and thirteen others)

I seek one source to send the users on our Network, from the major search 
engines, for security systems in Pierre and surrounding markets.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience. I will be in the office
daily from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Pacific time.
 
Best regards,
 
 

Robert Sexton
Director of Business Development, SPS Solutions
