 CALCULEMUS 2010 - Deadline Extension and Final Call for Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------

17th Symposium on the Integration of
Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning

CNAM, Paris, France, July 6-7, 2010

http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/calculemus/

*************************************
 >>>> DEADLINE EXTENSION <<<<

 Abstract submission: March 12, 2010
 Submission deadline: March 15, 2010
*************************************

Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of computer
algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the interactive
theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated theorem provers
(ATP).

Currently, symbolic computation is divided into several (more or less)
independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised
reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge
management, theory exploration, etc.) The main concern of the Calculemus
community is to bring these developments together in order to facilitate the
theory, design, and implementation of integrated systems for computer
mathematics that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer scientists
and engineers in their every day business.

We seek original research papers for the upcoming Calculemus meeting, which
will be held jointly with AISC 2010 and MKM 2010 (confederated in the
Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics, CICM 2010) in Paris (France).

Topics of Interest
==================

The scope of Calculemus covers all aspects of the interplay of mechanised
reasoning and computer algebra, including cross-fertilisation between those two
research areas, as well as the development of integrated systems that transcend
both computer algebra and theorem proving. Potential topics of interest
include:

  * Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)
  * Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)
  * Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and
    mechanised reasoning
  * Representation of mathematics in computer algebra
  * Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP
  * Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving
  * Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction
  * Mathematical computation in PA and ATP
  * Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for computer
    mathematics
  * Infrastructure for mathematical services
  * Theory exploration techniques

Papers on other topics closely related to the above research areas will also be
welcomed for consideration.

Submission
==========

Theoretical and applied research papers on all topics within the scope of the
symposium are invited. Submitted papers must be in English and must not exceed
15 pages for full papers and we suggest 10 pages for emerging trends extended
abstracts (the upper limit is 20 pages, authors must provide at least a title
and 200 word abstract). The title page should contain the title, author(s) with
affiliation(s), e-mail address(es), listing of keywords and abstract. The
program committee will subject all full papers submitted to a peer review.
Emerging trends papers will be lightly reviewed. Results must be unpublished.

Papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the requirements
of the Springer's LNAI series (the corresponding style files can be downloaded
from http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html and are the same for LNCS
and LNAI).

The web page for electronic submission is:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calculemus2010

Proceedings
===========

The proceedings of full papers of the conference will be published as a volume
in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by
Springer-Verlag. In addition to the formal proceedings published by Springer,
we will provide links to online versions of the published papers from the
conference website.

Extended abstracts on emerging trends will be published as a technical report
of CEDRIC (CNAM/ENSIIE) and will be electronically available. These papers are
expected to be describing work in progress.
