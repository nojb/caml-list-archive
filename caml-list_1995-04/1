A beta release of Caml Light 0.7 for the 80386 PC is now available by
anonymous FTP from the usual location:

        host:      ftp.inria.fr
        directory: lang/caml-light/Release7beta
        files:     cl7beta3pcbin.zip, cl7beta3pcsrc.zip

This release incorporates all novelties from Caml Light 0.7 beta 2.
Changes specific to the PC version are:

* The 8086 PC version has been discontinued. We're in 1995.
* camlc -custom and camlmktop have been implemented.
* The DOS extender and graphic drivers has been upgraded to DJGPP 1.12m4.

As usual, it would help a lot if brave users could give it a thorough
try. In particular, we've been unable to test it on PCs without
floating-point hardware (problems with floating-point emulation under
Windows have been reported with releae 0.6; we don't know if the new
DOS extender fixes them).

As usual, bug reports should be addressed to caml-light@pauillac.inria.fr.
