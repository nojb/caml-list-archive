I'm getting the following error 

The method point has type 'a -> 'b but is expected to have type
  x:int -> y:int -> unit

for this code :

method point p0 =
 etc..

The error makes sense, as in, I know that it is colliding with a
method defined in the drawable class.

However I am inheriting the class using :

  inherit GDraw.drawable ?colormap w as drawable

It seems to me that the method I am defining, self#point, and the
method in drawable, i.e. drawable#point, are distinct and therefore
I should not be seeing this error message ?

Can someone enlighten me ?


Thanks



Brian
