I have been using Ocaml for some time (but I'm a vi user and
my code is literate programmed so Tuareg wouldn't help).
And I STILL get caught by this problem regularly .. I suspect
it takes even longer to find once you have experience,
since you just don't expect that bug anymore (but it happens
occasionally anyway).

The best way to find this problem is post your code
to this list -- with experience you'll find the bug immediately
after pressing the Send button :)
