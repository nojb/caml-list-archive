PAPP 2005 - Second International Workshop on
Practical Aspects of High-level Parallel Programming
http://papp2005.free.fr

part of=20

The International Conference on Computational Science=20
May 22-25, 2005, Atlanta, USA =20

AIMS AND SCOPE

Computational Science applications are more and more complex to
develop and require more and more computing power. Parallel and grid
computing are solutions to the increasing need for computing
power. High level languages offer a high degree of abstraction which
ease the development of complex systems. Being based on formal
semantics, it is even possible to certify the correctness of critical
parts of the applications.

Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages,
such as Haskell and ML, or parallel logic and constraint programming,
parallel execution of declarative programs such SQL queries, etc. have
produced methods and tools that improve the price/performance ratio of
parallel software, and broaden the range of target applications.

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level
programming languages and tools (performance predictors working on
high-level parallel/grid source code, visualisations of abstract
behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors, high-level GRID resource
managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.), applications in all
fields of computational science, benchmarks and experiments. Research
on high-level grid programming is particularly relevant.

The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the
development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing
and computational science researchers who are potential users of these
languages and tools.

TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

* high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for parallel
  and grid computing

* high-level parallel languages design, implementation and
  optimisation

* functional, logic, constraint programming for parallel, distributed
  and grid computing systems

* algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high level parallel libraries

* generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic
  skeletons, patterns and high level parallel libraries

* applications in all fields of high-performance computing (using
  high-level tools)

* benchmarks, experiments using such languages and tools

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag LNCS series, as part of the ICCS proceedings.

Papers (PDF file) should be sent together with a short abstract in
plain text to loulergue at univ-paris12.fr with subject "[PAPP2005
Workshop] Submission" no later than 20 december 2004. We invite you to
submit a full paper of 8 pages (A4), describing new and original
results. The submitted paper must be formatted according to the rule
of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submission implies the
willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the
paper. An early email with your intention to submit a paper would be
greatly appreciated (especially if you have doubts about the relevance
of your paper).

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop and extended and
revised versions will be published in a special issue of Parallel and
Distributed Computing Practices, provided revisions suggested by the
referees are made.
