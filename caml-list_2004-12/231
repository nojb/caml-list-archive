I haven't tried Bitkeeper [0], but I do use another commercial source 
control system at work, Perforce. Perforce at about US$500/seat
compares very poorly incomparison to Arch. Perforce does however 
play nicely with windows.

[0] Because I supplied two patches and a feature enhancement to GNU Arch
    I am not able to use Bitkeeper. The license for Bitkeeper disallows
    its use by anyone who has worked on a competing source control 
    system.

" ... new TV ad for Microsoft's Internet Explorer e-mail program which
uses the musical theme of the "Confutatis Maledictis" from Mozart's
Requiem. "Where do you want to go today?" is the cheery line on the
screen, while the chorus sings "Confutatis maledictis, flammis acribus
addictis,". This translates to "The damned and accursed are convicted
to the flames of hell."
