Main problem seems to be :

 The repository is converted from the bkcvs mirror, and is updated once a day.
 As a result, it doesn't contain any information about file renames.

Seems like a shame to me to go through CVS here, since you loose one of the
important features. And well, what we really need is to get access to any
arbitrary kernel bk trees, not only whichever one was used here.
