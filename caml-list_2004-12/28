In my experience, all serious projects have to deal with more than one 
kind of source language: besides OCaml there could be TeX for 
documentation, Troff for manual pages, input for special-purpose code 
generators like Burg, and so on. A build system must be able to deal 
with all of them. Therefore your proposal would not eliminate the need 
for a general build tool outside of OCaml,
