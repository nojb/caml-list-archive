As far as I can see, what you call libgtkgl2.0 happens to be what
others call gtkglarea-1.99, i.e. the gtk2-ized version of gtkglarea.
It seems that we are a few here experiencing problems with this
version and very recent versions of gtk2 (in my case, gtk-2.4.13).
So maybe you are not using the same version of gtk, or the debian
people have already solved the problem, or actually the cause is
different altogether (hard to guess).
