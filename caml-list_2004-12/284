Alex,

Coming into this thread a little late and being somebody who has commit 
rights to the Subversion source code, I'll try to make a couple unbiased 
comments on some of the statements made in this thread :)

The Subversion code is stable and production ready.  There were issues 
with the initial versions of Subversion and I had my share of locked 
repositories, but probably like early versions of every version control 
system, they have been resolved.  Also, the Subversion team eats their 
own dog food.

At this "Discriminating Software Company", we moved from CVS to 
Subversion one year ago and our Subversion repositories now contain 5.4 
Gbytes of code, documentation, Squeak binaries, PDFs, etc.  We haven't 
lost any data.

 From a company's point of view, other things you get that I don't 
believe the other mentioned open-source VCS' have are professional 
support and native Windows clients.  In our team, we have people 
creating documentation (Word documents, PDFs) for the code we write and 
we use TortoiseSVN, a Windows Explorer shell integration which makes it 
easy for non-coders to use a VCS while keeping a familiar interface, in 
this case just Windows itself.

Regarding merging, unlike CVS, Subversion has changesets, so merging is 
simply picking the changeset(s) you want from one path and applying it 
to another:

     % svn merge -r 2345:2347 branch/latest_changes branch/stable

You may want to check these URLs and I'll leave the propaganda at that :)
