darcs is a great tool. 1.0.1 was just released. For your purposes 
you'll be interested in the "setprefs test" sub-command, which allows 
you to define a process to execute before some darcs commands--see the 
docs for details.

I use EMACS and Tuareg Mode for my O'Caml programming, so I also use 
darcsum.el to integrate EMACS and darcs. I find this quite nice.

If all of this is too much, consider GNU Arch in its tla incarnation, 
which does version file flags on POSIX filesystems, and also has very 
good EMACS integration in the form of XTLA.

Best regards,
