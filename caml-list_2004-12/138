It is probably better to say "from the outside it is pure, and inside
it appears impure, relative to its boundary" (thus stressing the point
that your apparent impurity is only a "view" <wink>).

I think the problem is that we are using "pure" twofold here:

a) As an (absolute) property of the language
b) As the property of code (which is relative to its environment)

As you can obviously emulate impurity in a pure language (see State
monad), and code pure in a impure language, it is not much of a
surprise that b) can differ from a).

Cheers,
Michael
