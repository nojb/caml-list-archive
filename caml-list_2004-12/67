Well, API changes wouldn't affect me personally, but I'm sure they would 
be painful for people who are actually using that API. If I were in your 
position I would try to find out about the user base before assuming 
that the changes will upset the whole world. After all:

   * LablGTK2 is fairly new
   * OCaml hasn't quite hit the big time yet
   * Not everybody uses OpenGL
   * On Linux at least (which I believe is the most popular platform for
     OCaml), OpenGL support is not very mature, so that programs
     depending on it often fail to compile.

So it could well be that few if any developers have yet seriously used 
LablGTK2 with OpenGL.
