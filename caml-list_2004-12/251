Well, arch and subversion are different kind of system. subversion is a good
cvs replacement, while arch aims more at the bitkeeper category. I tried to
setup an arch repo for the parted project almost a year ago, and utterly
failed, since it was so complex to setup, and needed some kind of black magic
knowledge and hand intervention to setup right, but then this has hopefully
been fixed since then. That said, there is no real support for tagging in
arch, which is what makes subversion preferable for the debian-like usage,
where we tag each released version. The fact that each tag is indeed a branch
in subversion may be confusing though, and imposes some dicipline on the user.
