I'm using GNU Arch for large amounts of C, C++, Python, Ocmal, plain 
text and LateX.

I think Arch is the best thing since sliced bread. The ony problem is
it doesn't like ms windows. It stores files in a really deep directory
structure and its really easy to run into the limit of how long
a pathname can be on windows.

If you are Unix only Arch is well worth a look. Its a bit difficult
to set up and get the hang of, but if you are not on windows, its
well worth it.
