Is there a reason why you don't use the official Cygwin "ocaml" package?
I had no problem running ocamlopt on Cygwin (in fact, the whole package
was built using ocamlopt).  FWIW, the Cygwin packages sources contain some
modifications to the build scripts that let them use Cygwin's binutils,
etc.  (BTW, which sources *did* you use?)

Looks like a library path problem.  Try adding appropriate -L flags...

You need to modify it to use "gcc -mno-cygwin", which build MinGW
executables (yes, even under Cygwin -- install the gcc-mingw package).
There's also a MinGW-only version of gcc/binutils -- see
<http://mingw.org/>.

Same as above -- you need MinGW binutils.

I'd first try removing your self-built OCaml and installing the Cygwin
"ocaml" package.  It should also pull in all the necessary Cygwin packages
(e.g., gcc, binutils).  If there are still problems with your build after
that, please report it as a bug to the main Cygwin list (<cygwin at cygwin
dot com>).
