We have had good success with subversion, which has the added advantage of
being very very user friendly, and an almost immediate proficiency in it if
one has CVS knowledge. We are using it for the debian/ocaml package repository
(not upstream source, just the packages and the debian dir), and also for
larger projects, like the new debian-installer source repository, and the new
debian kernel packages (altough we don't keep the whole kernel source tree
there, just the debian patches).

Friendly,
