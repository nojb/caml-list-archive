Notice that this is not really true, look at the debian lablgtk2 package, it
builds against lablgl, and everything works fine.

Well, at least the GL examples work with lablgtk2. Lablgtk2 uses the
libgtkgl2.0-dev package instead of the older gtkglarea ones though, but it
seems to be the same stuff : 

$ dpkg -s libgtkgl2.0-dev
Package: libgtkgl2.0-dev
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: libdevel
Installed-Size: 112
Maintainer: Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>
Architecture: powerpc
Source: gtkgl2
Version: 1.99.0-2
Provides: gtkgl-dev
Depends: libgtkgl2.0-1 (= 1.99.0-2), libgtk2.0-dev
Conflicts: gtkgl-dev
Description: Gimp Toolkit OpenGL area widget include files and static library
 A GTK widget for use with Mesa, an unlicensed OpenGL clone.  A Mesa
 development package is also required.

And the copyright mentions :

This package was debianized by Drake Diedrich <Drake.Diedrich@anu.edu.au> on
Thu, 24 Sep 1998 16:47:45 +1000.

It was originally downloaded from
   http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~kenelson/gtk-glarea/
Version 1:0.6 was downloaded from
   http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea/download/

So this seems to be the same repackaged and/or renamed gtkglarea, not sure
though.
