There seems to be some agreement on the fact the "Configuration 
Management Tool of Choice for Discriminating Software Company" is Arch. 
Our project seems complicated enough to seriously consider moving to arch.

We have currently reimplemented our project's storage as a 
non-denumerable set of darcs repositories, distributed in a 
discontinuous manner over our company's network. I envision a 
significant risk of complexity explosion, because darcs only supports 
branches as duplicate repositories, which sounds like a nightmare. 
However, darcs is about as much as would fit in before Christmas. Maybe 
Santa Claus will put a working arch repository under my Christmas tree...
