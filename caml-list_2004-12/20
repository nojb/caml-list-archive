Hi All,

I'm developing an operating system, and I want to write as much of it
as possible in OCaml. I had hoped to use the ocamlopt compiler, and
have it target i586-elf, like my gcc (3.4.1) cross-compiler. I'm using
newlib with my cross-compiler, so I have a C library available.

However, I'm lost at how to get OCaml into the mix. Anyone able to
offer some suggestions of the sorts of things I could try?

Currently I have a single .ml file that will hopefully start all the
major tasks, and a couple of supporting C files, and I'm trying to
jump into OCaml from my main function in C-land.

Regards,

Jonathan Roewen
