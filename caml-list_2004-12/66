Well, I suppose it would be me...

The reason I stuck with gtkglarea-1.99: laziness of course, but also
because it seems much closer to the needs of most people than
gtkglext. gtkglext contains much more functions, and makes it more
complex to do simple things.

Now, it seems that the gtk people have botched something, and gtkglarea
have stopped working. If this is not solved soon, I suppose lablgtk2
will have to move to gtkglext, and emulate gtkglarea on top of it (you
don't want API changes, do you?)

That's life.
