If you're talking about Software Configuration Management, then in my (not 
so?) humble opinion there is no better freeware tool than Aegis 
(aegis.sourceforge.net) at the moment. I've been using Aegis to manage a  
1.5MLOC project with 8 developers and it worked really well. But of course 
your mileage may vary.

Groetjes,
Peter.
