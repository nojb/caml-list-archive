Well, what OS are you running on it ? It is not as easy, as you need a true
ppc64 userland. which is right now provided only by a few linux distributions.
I may have some interest in doing this, but not before next year (first i need
a ppc64 debian kernel and glibc for it to work, i already have a biarch
compiler).

Friendly,
