I looked at subversion before deciding on Arch. The main downside
I saw to subversion was that merging across branches was as painful
as wil CVS. Arch on the other hand has two powerful merging 
methods and there is a thrid one on the way. This allows me to
run a couple of parallel developement branches, share those that
need to be with other external developers and merge acorss the
branches pretty much at will. 

I have not seen another source contol system which handles
branches as nicely as Arch.
