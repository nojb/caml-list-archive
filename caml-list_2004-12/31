I was trying to compile LablGTK2 with GTKGlArea support, and I 
discovered that I don't have the gtkglarea library. My Linux 
distribution (Arch) doesn't provide the library for GTK2 ... and on 
further investigation it appears that the gtkglarea project has 
vanished. Both the Freshmeat project page and the developer's home page 
(at some university in Finland, it appears) are gone.

So what's going to happen with this? Will LablGTK2 have an alternate way 
to support OpenGL--or is there reason to believe that gtkglarea will return?

Thanks for any info.
