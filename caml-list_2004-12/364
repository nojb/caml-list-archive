Wow. Maybe I misunderstand, but are you really saying there's nothing to 
worry about?

Now, it seems to me that you contribute a great deal to OCaml, and even 
if that weren't the case, you're still a volunteer developer. So of 
course you are under no obligation to add any requested features to your 
software, and I don't wish to suggest otherwise. But the above rationale 
seems horribly short-sighted. The problem is not so much that LablGTK 
depends on a *broken* package, as that it depends on an *unmaintained* 
one. That being the case:

   1) at some point in the not-too-distant future, gtkglarea will likely
      become unusable due to incompatible changes in GTK itself.

   2) already, at least some Linux distributions are lacking a gtkglarea2
      package. Thus, lablgtk with OpenGL support can't be provided as a
      package for those distributions.

Please don't be satisfied, just because the packages happen to build on 
your system today.
