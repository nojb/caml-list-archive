Could you explain exactly what you are trying to do?
The dlls in stublibs are only intended to be dynamically loaded by an
ocaml application. The reason bundles are used rather than dynamic
libraries is that the API for bundles is simpler, and that their
explicit intent (plugins) seems close enough to the use of dlls in
ocaml.
Note that a bundle can depend on dynamic libraries, so this should not
induce other limitations.
