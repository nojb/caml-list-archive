But you could also make an object with all the methods, and caching
the information it retrieves from the database. This way you have no
efficiency problem.
Andrej's point was that it is generally enough to collect all common
information in one object, and you have not so much to move around
after that. I think this is reasonable.
If this is not the case, then it may mean that you really need to add
information dynamically to your environment. In that case an approach
like the one I suggested with records might provide more flexibility.
