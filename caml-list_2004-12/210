Hi, I am getting an exception Out_of_memory. The manual tells me
this is raised by the garbage collector when there is
insufficient memory to complete the computation. Is there any way
to find out what is causing this; what is gobbling up memory too
fast for the GC? Perhaps there is a way to get and analyze a core
file or a way to catch the exception and dump the heap and
garbage collector state. Any suggestions? I am using a C library,
but carefully followed the rules of;
http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual032.html
Though I suspect the C library is responsible.

Thanks

Lex
