Howdy,

I have a question regarding the use of -pack and any way I can patch my 
way around not having it on my OS.

I am trying to get Ocamlgraph to work under Mac OSX and I am running 
into problems with the -pack flag to ocamlc et al.  The problem is that 
-pack is not supported due to the lack of obj_copy on my OS.  So I was 
wondering is there a standard way of hacking around this deficiency?  
Could I create the packed cmo manually in some way?  I suspect that 
this will not work in all but the simplest of cases at the moment.

On another front what is  objcopy needed for in this context and could 
it be duplicated using alternative tools for mach-o object files?

Thanks,
-Eric
