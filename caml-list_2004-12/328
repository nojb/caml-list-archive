The "as drawable" doesn't mean that the methods are distinct: you can
still call all inherited methods from the outside, and even through
self.
This only allows you to access the old definition of a method, if you
want to extend it incrementally.

method point ~x ~y =
  ...  drawable#point ~x ~y ...
