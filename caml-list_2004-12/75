Well :

$ dpkg -l | grep libgtk2.0-0
ii  libgtk2.0-0    2.4.13-1       The GTK+ graphical user interface library

But we have probably not rebuilded lablgtk or gtkglarea with it recently, let
me check ...

gtkgl2 (1.99.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

...

So, maybe there is a build problem, let me check and rebuild it locally to be
sure.

What exactly are the problems ? During the build of libgtkgl2, or during the
build of lablgl ? 

Friendly,

Sven Luther
