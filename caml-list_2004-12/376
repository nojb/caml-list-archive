Yes.

Then something will have to be done about it at that time.
But this has been the situation for already a few years, and
gtkglarea2 is still working, so this doesn't seem a big concern.
Note also that the great thing about free software is that anybody is
allowed to fix a problem when it arises.

You just have to create a gtkglarea2 package together with the
lablgtk2 package. Not a big deal. Much less work than writing an
interface for gtkglext and all the compatibility bindings (the
compatibility bindings are the painful part.)

I'm satisfied that the situation is not as bad as I feared.
Note that some configurations breaking with gtk is not an unusual
event. For instance, the GtkTree widget was unusable in 2.4.0, but
fortunately this was promptly fixed.

I know some people think that programmers should just adapt to the new
APIs, but this can mean lots of work when they are structured
differently, this is why keeping compatibility is important.
