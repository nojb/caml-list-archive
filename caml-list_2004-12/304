Your problem seems to be specific to the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
whereas this mailing list is for discussion about the OCaml language. A
more suited mailing list is debian-ocaml-maint@lists.debian.org (Cc-ed),
please follow-up to that mailing list.

Anyway ...

This line _is_ enough, tuareg mode is not strictly necessary to use
ocaml.  Still, you can avoid the second step by simply telling your
students to execude "apt-get install ocaml tuareg".

I'm not an expert Emacs user, but this issue is definitely related to
the tuareg-mode debian package.  You can get in touch with that package
maintainer and/or file a whishlist bug report against it in order to
automate the emacs configuration.

Ralf (or someone else of the debian ocaml maintainer with Emacs skill),
could you please comment on this and other emacs related needs which
could possibly by automated on tuareg-mode installation?

Cheers.
