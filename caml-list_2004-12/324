Hi,

I am currently developping a small piece of software that uses
both OCaml and C (for openGL). The main loop is in C and I use
callback to call a Caml function that processes the key that
was pressed and returns the new state of a matrix.

Everything worked fine until I added a subfunction that simply
merges two int lists. The program then hanged each time a key
was pressed, without even executing the "print_string" I had
set everywhere. After hittinh ^C, gdb tells me that it was
currently executing caml_oldify_local_roots. Replacing the
merging function with 'fun () -> ()' solves the thing but I
need it.
I tried to rewrite it in an iterative way and it works fine
until it tries to make a minor GC (forcing it with Gc.minor()
makes it also hang).

Compiling in native code changed nothing, unfortunately, and
google found no useful advices...

I can post my code if necessary.

Thanks in advance for any help/insight=0A=0AAcc=E9dez au courrier =E9lect=
