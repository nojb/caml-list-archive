Unfortunately, I'm afraid we are still pretty far from that.
Supposing we could describe all the properties we need in Coq
(probably possible, but far from easy), a very long and harduous
proof is waiting.
If there is a breakthrough, I would be most happy to check everything,
as I know there are bugs in the compiler. I just discovered a stupid
unsoundness today.
