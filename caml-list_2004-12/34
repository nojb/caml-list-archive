Right, I noticed that, but it's not a drop-in replacement. Do you have 
plans to support gtkglext, or does someone else need to take 
responsibility for that?

By the way, the reason I'm concerned about this is that I'm creating a 
LablGTK2 package for Arch Linux. For the time being, it will be built 
without OpenGL support, but I think it's a feature that many users would 
like to have.

Best regards,
Matt
