Actually, pipes perform quite well on Linux....

Use Bigarray-s for that. They can mmap files (on Unix & Linux) and are
already in Ocaml 3.08

You might also use IPC shared memory segments, but there is no support
in Ocaml for these (shmget & related system calls), so you'll probably
need to code the C stub (for the Ocaml binding) yourself.

Maybe you'll need JoCaml... (but I don't know if it is dead or not -
it was designed for coding cooperative programs communicating thru
channels).
