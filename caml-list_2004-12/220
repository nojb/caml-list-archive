What is wrong with the solution to the executable bit problem suggested
in the Darcs FAQ?

Include a line in the makefile that sets the executable bit for any
scripts that should be executable. If you wanted to be more "make-like"
you could even copy the script, and then set the executable bit in the
copy.


DISCLAIMER: I have never used Darcs or subversion, so may be missing
something.
