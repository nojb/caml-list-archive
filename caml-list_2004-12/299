Huh? I'm really confused. Two people think the documentation
is correct for the behaviour.

I do not -- Saying

	string x is matched by regexp r

means to me the same as

	x is a member of the regular set of strings r denotes

and with that interpretation there is no possible doubt that
the documentation is wrong and should say 

	matches a prefix of the argument string

in order to describe the behaviour.
