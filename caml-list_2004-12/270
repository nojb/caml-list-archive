Hmm... this looks like it shows two subtrees hold the same reference but 
it does not to me look like it proves the structure is shared, only that 
references work as expected.

Perhaps I can use

type 'a sceneGraph = Leaf of 'a | IntNode of 'a * 'a sceneGraph list | 
SharedNode of 'a sceneGraph ref

to achieve what I want.
