It really does sound as though you're edging from "version control"  
into "configuration management." If that's the case, you may want to  
look at Arch and its surrounding tools. In particular, the  
documentation at  
<http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/tutorial/multi-tree- 
projects.html>, "Multi-tree Projects and Configuration Management,"  
might be helpful to you.

Yaron Minsky pointed out that raw command-line tla can be a bit  
painful, and my experience reflects that as well. OTOH, tla is very  
granular, by which I mean that it's a relatively simple matter to  
concoct aliases that combine tla commands/options into useful  
aggregates. And I have to say that XTLA in EMACS is pretty wonderful.

Oooooh, yes, you do have a lot of complex, interrelated stuff to keep  
track of. Please consider Arch.
