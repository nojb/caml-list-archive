IIRC it needs to be in %LIB%, not %PATH%.

Which problems?

And did you try simply installing the binary package available through
Cygwin's setup.exe, before you moved on to attempting a manual build? It

I've never used the MinGW version of OCaml, but at a guess, it might
possibly be expecting to find the MinGW version of gcc rather than the
Cygwin version.
