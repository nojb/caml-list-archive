I do have a true ppc64 userland... (64bit kernel, gcc, linker, libraries;
"configure" rightly sees a 64-bit architecture...)
I'd like to have a 64bit ocamlopt to run my programs that would greatly
benefit from fast large integer arithmetic.
By the way, it would be great to also have a BigNum library that uses the
Altivec/VMX capabilities of the 970FX... another project...

I also have another ppc computer with a 64bit kernel and a mixed
32bit/64bit userland (SUSE).
ocamlopt compiles in 32bit on this computer
("configure" says it's a 32bit architecture (which is good... since
with SUSE linux, gcc is by default 32bit) and I did
./configure -host powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu because
it doesn't know what is powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu for ocamlopt)
and it works well... (3.08.2, not 3.08.1, I guess that's part
of the bug fixes)
