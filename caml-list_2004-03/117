OcamlConf 0.1 is ready.

Significant changes have occured in that it uses an applicative Map rather than
a Hashtbl to store the configured values, and in general the interactive
"./configure" portion has been improved a lot (as opposed to the Makefile
generation).

I've thrown together a web-page, and real releases.  The DARCS inclined can
still get the latest at http://kefka.frap.net:8080/~kenn/repos/ocamlconf if I've
configured my new firewall correctly - they are tagged as "0.1"

Direct URLs to tars:
http://kenn.frap.net/ocamlconf/ocamlconf-0.1.tar.bz2
http://kenn.frap.net/ocamlconf/ocamlconf-0.1.tar.gz

>From the web page:
Features:

    * Simple "./configure; make; make install" operation.
    * MakeMake module for outputting your makefile based on specifications
    * Conf module for prompting the user for compile-time options, as well as
    * locating libraries (usually via findlib)
    * Util module with some useful shell and string functions

How Good is the Generated Makefile?

    * Makefile is about as simple as a hand-written one.
    * Contains a 'normal' and a '.opt' target for each program or library
    * Typical targets for: install, install-opt, uninstall, clean, distclean,
      doc, all, opt, tar, gzip, bzip2
