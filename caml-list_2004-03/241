That may have been me.  I had a conversation with Gerd about it, or 
something a lot like it, and we never did figure it out.

Sometime later, I tried it on a different machine and it worked.  My

in /opt/godi, and was unwilling to be in /usr/local/godi.

Apologies to all for not passing that along
