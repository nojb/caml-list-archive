I think the Unix module could be regarded as incomplete.

The tactic I have taken with this problem is to regard the Unix library=20=

in the Ocaml distribution as the property of INRIA.  It has what it=20
has, and it will get what INRIA decides is missing when the INRIA team=20=

decides to put it there.

I found the support for socket options to be lacking.  I wanted IPv6=20
support.  I'll probably want all manner of other things eventually,=20
e.g. multicast, raw sockets, routing sockets, etcetera.  The way to get=20=

this is to write a drop-in replacement for the features of the Unix=20
library you need updated.

I released my code for extending socket support in Unix with my Cf=20
library, which you can find on the Hump.  (It only builds on Mac OS X=20
and probably other BSD-like platforms, because I used the sa_len field=20=

in socket address structures.  That should be easily fixed in my next=20
release in a couple months.)
