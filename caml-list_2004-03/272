All these projects you mention are much larger, and there are stronger
interests involved that want to push the whole group into certain
directions. In the short term, we will certainly not face these
problems. In the long run, however, it might turn out that we will need
some formalism. I think it is not a good idea to think about it _now_,
because nobody has here enough experience to say which kind of formalism
would be a good one.

So I think this discussion has no real basis.

On the one hand, we have this situation already. For example, both
ocamlnet and camomile implement aspects of Unicode, but with different
intentions (ocamlnet targets at network protocols, camomile at
applications). There are also a lot of incompatible database interfaces.
Of course, it would be nice to have some cleanup here.

On the other hand, it is problematic to enforce cooperation. If GODI
tried to do that, it might happen that GODI loses overall acceptance.

So I would suggest to support any such cooperation, but not to try to
make pressure. In my opinion, the first goal of GODI is to get accepted
by distributing software that already exists, no matter whether there
are parallel solution to the same area. It may happen over time that the
need for selection arises, but let us see how this can be handled.

GODI is more comparable to a Linux distribution than to Linux.

IMO, the normal principles apply that everybody would expect:

- Communicate the changes you are doing

- Respect the work of others

- Don't put in a selfish way your own interests over those of the whole
  group

You see, these are principles, and by nature, they are quite vague. This
is why I prefer the term "good practise", because it is better to see by
example how general norms are applied to real matters. I am not afraid
of different views on these matters and maybe conflicts that may arise,
because I feel myself able to remind people of general principles that
should be respected, and believe that people can act in a reasonable
way.
