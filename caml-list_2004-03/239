I hope we don't need such a committee. First we should try to seek a
consensus. I suppose this will almost always be successful, and over
time we will have a situation where the voices of some people will have
more weight than the voices of others, simply because they are naturally
respected.

So I would suggest to postpone such a committee until it is really
needed, when everything else failed.

GODI currently has packages which are comparable with modules. Every
package has a maintainer. Initially, the maintainer is the person who
adds the package to the repository.

Technically, I don't plan any sort of access control, i.e. everybody
with an account can change everything. Of course, it is bad practise to
change the package maintained by somebody else without notification.

I simply believe that a good practise of cooperation is better than
formal rules.

It is currently unclear for me whether we should have releases at all.
GODI has the ability to update every package separately, so what is a
release?

Of course, for the outer world a formal release is something valuable.

We definitely need a process to determine when each package is ready for
release. We'll see how to do that.

There is now a mailing list, see the separate announcement.

I think we will see whether we need formal rules or not. This depends a
lot of parameters that are currently uncertain, e.g. the number of
developers.

I guess they have their own internal process which is incompatible with
such a structure.
