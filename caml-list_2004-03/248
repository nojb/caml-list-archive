I think it's an embarrassment.  It's an unmaintained site that hasn't 
updated since 2002.  It's actually worse than no site at all, because it 
contains links to dead projects (e.g. the Caml Development Kit and the 
OCaml IRC Server, which doesn't even exist anymore).  As you point out, 
the news items haven't been updated since 2002, which strongly gives the 
impression that Caml is completely dead.  Worst of all, it uses the word 
'hacker', which to most managers means 'criminal that tries to attack my 
servers'.  Whoever created this site would be doing the Caml community a 
great service by taking it off the web.  The caml.inria.fr site is ugly, 
but at least it's correct and up to date.
