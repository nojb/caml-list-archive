Telling management that we need to hire a compiler expert won't
persuade them to allow ocaml.

I and other programmers tried to convince the company to use
ClearCase.  It would have made some of our work a lot easier.
We were told no, because conventional wisdom says ClearCase
needs a dedicated system administrator and they didn't want to
hire another person.  Real costs win over hypothetical savings.
