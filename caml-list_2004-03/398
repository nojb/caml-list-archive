Hi all,

Announcing ocamlconf-0.2; new in this release:

* A slightly different API (with radically improved backend) for specifying
  targets, with more options for libraries and less for scripts.
* Better makefile, with doc targets for each format known to ocamldoc, and
  generally better management of "make all" vs "make opt"
* Finer control over what is installed with findlib, and under what package name
* Many bug-fixes for combined C/ocaml libraries.

Description of ocamlconf:

	Ocamlconf is a build helper for ocaml programs.  It takes a 'configure.ml'
and creates a 'configure' script.  This script prompts for compile time toggles
and variable settings, and outputs an automatically-generated makefile.

Features:
* Simple "./configure; make; make install" operation.
* MakeMake module for outputting your makefile based on specifications
* Conf module for prompting the user for compile-time options, as well as
  locating libraries (usually via findlib)
* Util module with some useful shell and string functions

How Good is the Generated Makefile?
* Makefile is about as simple as a hand-written one.
* Contains a 'normal' and a '.opt' target for each program or library
* Typical targets for: install, install-opt, uninstall, clean, distclean, doc,
* all, opt, byte, tar, gzip, bzip2
