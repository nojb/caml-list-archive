First question

Is there a lablgtk list ?  I found a link to one, sent e-mail to what
I assume was the subscription adress and did not hear anything back.

If I'm in the right place I have a couple of what are probably easy
questions :

The following

  let w = GWindow.window ~title:title () in
      ...
      area#event#add [`BUTTON_PRESS];
      w#event#connect#button_press ~callback: ...

will connect the window w to a button press event.

How do I disconnect it ?!  I can't seem to find an example anywhere
(except for widgets, but it seems to be different for windows).

Does anyone know where I can find example code which uses the usual
widget suspects (menus, etc..) with an opengl area.

The examples in the lablgtk and lablgl dir's don't seem to provide
such an example.  The opengl examples only use opengl and vice versa.

Thanks !

Brian
