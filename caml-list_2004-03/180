Point 1 => same problem as with Linux about ten years ago

Point 2 => really not running on that platform?

Point 3 => The INRIA-cathedral will help to prevent this problem
           in the sense of "we do not allow any hacker to make
           changes in the core language"

IMHO OCaml is some decades in the future... what you can do with
OCaml right now (the language, not necessarily the additional 
libraries and the programs you can find as free-software) is
much, much more powerful than what you can do in other languages.

I was astouned how powerful the language is, compared to
Perl. If I prefer OCaml to Perl, even if Perl has more libraries
and modules (via CPAN), becaus eof the power of the language,
then this is MY decision. An d I think I have reasons for this decision.

When "the other people" don't decide to use Ocaml, so that is not
my problem. Yes, it would be nice to use that language on a job,
not only in own provate projects. But I don't think that the
bazaar-method will change one of the above prejudices.

It's not a matter of the developing method, it's a matter of
hype, of marketing and many prejudices, as you also can see
on the topic of fuzzy logic.
It's bad, stupid, silly.... and functional programming....
...most people think that "functional programming" is what
imperative non-OO languages provide: They have problems
with the name "functional".
Often people think: C++ is object-oriented and C is functional.
So when you mention a functional language, people often say
it's old stuff, because you don't mention OOP.

You can't stop ignorance and prejudice with a different developing
method!
