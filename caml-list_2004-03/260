Matt,

   Thank you! I was away for a bit. You are not being
grandiose at all. When I started the discussion about
"Unix completeness", I was tactfully (maybe not so
tactfully) asking why OCaml is not like Linux??!! Your
metaphor is exactly where I was going. I really want
to see to a functional language make it into the
mainstream (i.e. I have programmed in imperative
languages all of my 28 year career ... nothing has
changed). After looking at various FPL code bases, I
really believe taht OCaml has a shot assuming we all
take the challenge seriously (I have been in American
industry for 26 years ... which sadly is far too
pragmatic and conservative to change).

Regards, Vasili
