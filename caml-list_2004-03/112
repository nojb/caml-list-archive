I have left the entire text here quoted to point out the difference in
subjects.

Sure, handling *text* is a really, really complex beast in today's
world. I end up fighting with those problems almost daily. You are
preaching to the choir.

But - there's nothing ambiguous about slurping an entire file into a
string. And there's nothing complex about doing that portably.

Encodings, byte-order-marks, combining characters, text printing and
all that do not enter into it. The \r\n <-> \n translation issue is
the first portability hurdle, since it affects plain byte input and
output, regardless of implications for text. String as an array of
characters is a really complex beast to handle. String as an array of
bytes is trivial to handle.

And the encoding issues do not suddenly make 'md5sum' any less
portable. Or 'rsync'. Or 'wget'. But the \r\n <-> \n issue does.
