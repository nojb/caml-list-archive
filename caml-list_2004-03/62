Thanks to anybody who gave me references for my problem (on this ML or
privately).

The JH's TP examples are a great ressource but I find the organisation
of the source code a bit unusual and it makes it hard to use it directly
as a library... Anyway it is full of good implementation ideas and I
might write my own lib based on those ideas.

The Coq standard lib seems to be another interesting reference and I
will have a deeper look inside to work out which part refer to FOL and
which parts refers to other weird logics I have never heard about :o)

I will also think about whether or not de Bruijn indices can help in
designing data structures for variable bindings in Horn Clauses.

thanks again,
Olivier
