Well, that's sort of free software plus extra problems.  I have to go
and make a patch against the original and release the patch.

If it's OK to release the original + patch, why not just make the
compiler GPL, then I and the end users don't have to go through all
the extra patching hassle?

I'm not convinced either that a CVS repository would be within the
license terms.  INRIA may not mind, but that's a different issue.
