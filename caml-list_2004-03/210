Alex, ...

I am not entirely sure, but since i distribute the patched ocaml in
debian, and there has been no problem with that, i think there is some
horrible confusion going on here.

The named 'inria copyright' used for caml-light and earlier versions of
ocaml did indeed restrict redistribution in other form than pristine
source and patches. But this has been solved since many years now, and
in particular the introduction of the QPL was part of that change.

This is the main reason for debian not distributing caml-light, which
still use the old problematic licence, as do caml-light derivative like
moscow-ML, but this doesn't apply to Ocaml.

Naturally, if you were meaning something else, please explain.

Noting is stopping you from doing that, Please read the QPL and LGPL
before making such uninformed claims.
