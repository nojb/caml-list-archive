Hi Eric,

    You have made a good point. Is there a way though
so that there is one unix.cma (I would still suggest
posix.cma because we should really IMO speak in terms
of POSIX API vs Win32 API) library that is built from
several binaries like socket, process, (p)thread? In
this way, the end-user would like against one library
not N libraries (I agree with your point about link
hassles). I guess i questioning current granularity of
unix.mli. This is, of course, somewhat of a judgemnet
call, but one doesn't want to have all of the source
in the kitchen sink. I.e. source module division vs 
link library division. (Sorry ... perhaps I didn't say
in an eloquent way .. hope everybody gets my point).

Regards, Vasili
