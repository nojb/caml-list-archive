You can achieve this by using the -pack option when creating libraries.
Sure it has still some problems, but it is the way to go to solve this
problem.

What is really missing is support for more than one OCAMLLIBDIR, in
order to be able to easily separate the libraries installed by your
package manager (/usr/lib/ocaml/3.07 for debian), by the one installed
locally by the sysadmin (/usr/local/lib/ocaml/3.07 for debian), and the
user specific ones (less important though, but still usefull).
