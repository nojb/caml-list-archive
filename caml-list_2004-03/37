It could be done with a bit less ambition:
  
  let ast = parse_with_camlp4 infile in
  let ast_diffs = edit_ast_with_gui ast in
  output_diffs outfile ast_diffs

That way the user has explicit control over the differences, as with the
Token Replace Patch idea at

That's good but I would prefer to use OCaml and avoid makefiles
altogether, similar to how Python's distutils just uses Python.  Then we
could have more sophisticated build rules with fixed points etc. (as
John Max Skaller described in a post a while back.)
