Ok, i missed the part about source modifications only being allowed as
separate patches. This is ok though.

Well, the debian package, apart from being a pristine upstream +
patch format, also now comes in a form where the debian patch only adds
the debian directory, and has a set of patches in debian/patches,
conveniently applied and unapplied by dpatch. Very nice.

You could use a revision system, like CVS or more modern subversion or
arch, and maintain a pristine upstream branch, and easily generate the
patch in question. No difficulties there.

Yeah, i know, GODI is nice, but i prefer native support as what we
provide for debian, but then, i guess you are using an inferior OS
anyway, so ... :))

But still free software. I would be more concerned about rights to
modify the documentation, but everyone its priority.
