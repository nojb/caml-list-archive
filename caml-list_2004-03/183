Suppose we find a bug in ocaml that impacts our product.
Whose job is it to fix the bug?  Neither "a network of
hackers" nor "some academic researchers in France, if they
have the time" is an acceptable answer.  We pay a company
to provide us with an embedded Linux environment including
cross-compilation tools.  While in reality ocaml will be
more reliable than g++ due to the vast difference in
complexity, that doesn't overcome the fear.

Consider points 2 and 3 as axioms.  They were dictated to
me by management and were not subject to debate.  As long
as there is a shadow of a doubt about support, ocaml won't
be used where I work.

The library system is troublesome -- non-core libraries need
other libraries, which need other libraries, and so on -- but
in this case it didn't make a difference.
