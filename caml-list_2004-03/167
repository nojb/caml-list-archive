I probably don't qualify, as I use OCaml only very rarely, however, I do have 
an opinion regarding your mail:

Oh, I do think that it would help a lot, as people know CPAN, now how it 
works, know what to expect. It becomes one's own risk to use a library, yet 
there is an easy way to access and one easy way to tell people where to get 
it from. This makes it especially more simple for people who are surrounded 
by FP haters ;-) , and who are forced to give out slick installation packages 
if they want their OCaml stuff to be used.

The same, it can be a goal to say: "we want this on CPAN, so anyone can 
install it easily".

Cheers,
Wolfgang
