This kind of move is great indeed.  Actually, I am considering moving
away Camomile from Sourceforge.  Souceforge is unreachable from here
more than half a time, which impedes a development.  I have purchased
a hosting service already, but it is really cheap one and does not
provide CVS and so on.

I will also welcome donation of hosting specific to Camomile.  If you
are interested, please contact to me.
