Hi Sven,

    There is one guy, Georgi (I don't know how to say
in French only on Russian), who IMO did a very nice
job on IPV6. I personally want this stuff folded into
the OCAML source. That is why I started this thread,
i.e. to light a fire under somebody. Georgi did this
last year(!!), but still not in OCaml source base!

Regards, Vasili
