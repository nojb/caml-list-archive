It seems that you both also miss the -pre_open and -stdlib switches in
the compiler.

A pre_open switch would take care of 2 modules called Dbi without modifying
them:

(* wrapper1.ml *)

module DbiVendor1 = Dbi

====

(* wrapper2.ml *)

module DbiVendor2 = Dbi

===

ocamlc -c -I path_to_vendor1 wrapper1.ml -I path_to_vendor2 wrapper2.ml ...

===

A stdlib switch is what Sven is asking above.

Both switches, along with pack, is all we need to create our custom
packaging/namespace management systems independently of INRIA. What do you
think?

These switches would also be policy-neutral, so that nobody is _forced_ to
use GODI, debian packages or any other middleware if they do not fit their
environment, but still allow people to use external libraries without fear
of namespace clashes.
