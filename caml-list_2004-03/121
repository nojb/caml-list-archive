The former problem is solved by Asmdynlink module. It last worked at
3.02 I believe, but there is hope that someone could resurrect it.

The latter problem I have an unfinished patch to fix. You may browse
the list archives to know more or ask me directly.

Finishing the patch has been greatly delayed due to me being busy on
switching jobs and such - but I have not forgotten it and will get
around to it again.
