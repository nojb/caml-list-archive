OK, this is interesting and I think we should do it.  It requires
coordination because we have a metric ton of code here which uses the
current access method, and that would have to all be changed.  I'll
see if I can schedule some time to do this with my manager.  I also
want to be more sure about exactly how the code is going to work, so
I'll probably want to build a few prototypes and share them with you -
I'm still not 100% sure I understand how the `Null stuff works.

We use lots of odd PostgreSQL types, eg. IP addresses ... but
generally insert and select these as strings and do any conversion
necessary ourselves.  Getting the basics working is most important.

Jeremy:

It looks like we have a chance to get ocamldbi accepted as the
standard DBI interface for OCaml, if we schedule some time to make a
few changes.  I guess we're looking at 1-2 days work tops.  What do
you think?

Rich.
