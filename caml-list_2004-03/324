Isn't enough to have a (closed) object type annotation for "an_object"?
In this way you would now exactly the signature of the object to which
you want to delegate without having to enumerate all of them.

I find Alex idea really cool, delegation is a widely used technique in
OO programming but at the same time is painful to use because you have
to write the pattern:

  method foo = delegate#foo
  method bar = delegate#bar
  ...

Having to write

  delegate foo to delegate
  delegate bar to delegate
  ...

is not a big improvement, whereas writing

  class type delegate_type =
    object
      method foo: ...
      method bar: ...
      ...
    end

  delegate delegate_type to an_object

would really be an improvement.

Cheers.
