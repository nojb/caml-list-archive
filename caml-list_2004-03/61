Greetings,

This is to announce that we have released the first external version of 
a project we've been working on for quite a while. 
	Remote Middleware Daemon is a high level identity management 
library focused on services and access control, and exposed via both 
xdr-rpc, and xml-rpc. It is written entirely in Objective Caml, except for 
the trivial xmlrpc interface, which is in perl.

Much more information can be found at
