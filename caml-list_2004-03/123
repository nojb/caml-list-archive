The former problem is no big deal, since the Caml team made the VM so 
efficient that for most practical purposes bytecode is good enough. I 
can live with it until Xavier will release Dynlink for native code.

I am aware of your patch. However, before using it in production code I 
would have to see it adopted by Inria in the CVS or official releases. 
Otherwise, I would risk breaking compatibility of my code with future 
releases of Ocaml.

I look forward to seeing dynamic unlinking of code (bytecode or native) 
in OCaml. Hopefully, your patch will help in this direction.
