      The Second International Workshop on
  Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT-2004)
http://centria=2Edi=2Efct=2Eunl=2Ept/~jleite/dalt04/index=2Ehtm


                 to be held at the
  The Third International Joint Conference on Autonomous
Agents & Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2004) New York, USA
                July 19th, 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------


----------
Overview:
----------

Building multi-agent systems still calls for models and
technologies that ensure system predictability, enable feature
discovery and verification, and accommodate flexibility=2E
Declarative approaches offer to satisfy precisely these properties
of large-scale multi-agent systems=2E Recent advances in the area of
computational logics provide a strong foundation for declarative
languages and technologies=2E Equipped with such strong foundation,
declarative approaches can enable agents to reason about their
interactions and their environment and hence not only establish
the required tasks but also handle exceptions that arise in many
systems=2E

However, a great effort still has to be done to make formal
methods and declarative technologies available to the broader
agent community, and to apply theoretical results to enable
practical implementation of agent systems=2E  Accordingly,
Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT) workshop aims
at bringing together (1) researchers working on formal methods for
agent and multi-agent systems design, (2) engineers interested in
exploiting the potentials of declarative approaches for
specification of agent-based systems, and (3) practitioners
exploring the technology issues arising from a declarative
representation of systems=2E


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 Declarative agent communication and coordination languages
 Declarative approaches to the engineering of agent systems
 Experimental studies of declarative technologies
 Industrial and commercial experiences with declarative agent technologies=

 Formal methods for the specification and verification of agent systems
 Computational logics in multi-agent systems
 Argumentation and dialectical systems
 Declarative description of contracts and negotiation issues
 Lessons learned from the design and implementation of agent systems
 Declarative paradigms for the combination of heterogeneous agents
 Constraints and agent systems
 Declarative policies and security in MAS
 Knowledge-based and knowledge-intensive MAS
 Modeling of agent rationality

Post-proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume of
the Lecture Notes on Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series=2E
