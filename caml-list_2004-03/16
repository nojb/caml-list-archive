Hi all,

Please forgive the anonymous mail headers, it's merely
an anti-spam tactic.

We love OCaml and respect the team.  We track
OCaml too.

Here is a list of items raised by *others* not us that
may justify a 3.0.8 release,



Consolidation with ECaml

Name collisions

"GCaml work to resume at 3.0.8" - ?
http://pauillac.inria.fr/bin/wilma_hiliter/caml-list/200402/msg00073.html




One other point, is that our techies know OCaml
rocks, but our managers think only Java and C++.
They basically get their opinion from scannning OCaml
web pages.  That's why "dead" looking web pages are
a sort of problem for us anyway.  Our HQ is so bad to us
that they won't let us use a "non-official" release.
They require formal internal evaluations use 3.0.7
when we pitch Ocaml on a project.

Keep up the wonderful work- and thank you.

Jim
