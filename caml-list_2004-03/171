After quite a long hiatus when we weren't distributing packages for
mod_caml (instead everyone was chasing the CVS version), I'm pleased
to announce the availability of stable packages for the latest
OCamlDBI and mod_caml.

http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/modcaml/

http://www.merjis.com/developers/

What has changed:

Christophe Troestler and myself split the database layer out of
mod_caml into a separate package called OCamlDBI.  This offers a
simple method for accessing a variety of databases through an API
which will be familiar to Perl DBI users.  There are some source-level
changes required - this will be the last time such changes will be
needed.

mod_caml has also been reorganized to split out the Template and
escaping libraries, so that they could be used in other programs.  No
source-level changes should be required.

As usual, many bugs have been fixed and many features have been added.

Both mod_caml and OCamlDBI are used daily on customer-facing websites
for serious production use, validating the appropriateness of OCaml in
these situations.

Rich.
