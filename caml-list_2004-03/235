Wow, sweet. That is an idea I thought of, just out of idle curiosity
really, but I don't have the time (or necessarily the ability!) to pull
it off successfully!

If you haven't already, you might like to try the same method that
Julian Seward used for Valgrind, which is just to stop after N blocks
(and revert to the regular bytecode interpreter, if that's possible). You
can then use a binary search to locate the block which is failing.

Also Valgrind itself might be useful, of course. It does work in the
presence of self-modifying code, IM(H)E.

Cheers,

Julian
