Yes, that's the point.
"The community" is discussing since years that their software
should be part of the OCaml distri but is not orgenized enough
to set up such a website.

Not able to do that, but interested in hacking in the core
of OCaml?!

Please, don't let such people hacking around in the core...!


So, first results in what we need (another unix-lib, maybe
an additional Unix2-lib, which can be added to Unix-lib
and the other stuff we need...).

BTW.: Such additions like Hashtbl.fold are much more qualified
      for going into the Caml-Lib than (the relatively easy to achieve)
      calls to some Unix-API-calls.
      And this Hashtbl.fold was added some vesions ago...
      ... so it was better to add this than wasting time in
      adding Unix-API-stuff.
      This  can be done by external additional unix2-lib developpers.

Ciao,
   Oliver
