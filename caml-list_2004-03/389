Hi,

see at http://contfrac.sourceforge.net (unfortunately, I don't know
how to use CVS, so you will have to download the 9ko compressed
file as a whole).

It performs exact arithmetic on real numbers by using continued fraction.
The purpose is similar to creal and surreal, but algorithms are deeply
different. I implement Gosper's algorithm for computing operations between
continued fractions. Many functions are provided, including support for
algebraic numbers of arbitrary degree (of course, exp, log, tan, sin, cos,
atan, sqrt, etc. are included).

Though my initial purpose was not to implement an efficient and quick module
(I was rather interested by the theoretical aspects of the thing), some
very quick and empirical comparisons with CREAL make me think that my
module is quicker for the superficial tests I tried.

This is an alpha release; it is undocumented, except that the .mli file
is understandable and commented.

Some little changes since the announce on fr.comp.lang.caml:
  - licence now is MIT (rather than GNU)
  - a few functions added (mainly conversion functions:
    conversions from/to continued fractions can be done with many
    types (including now streams, objects having a "next" method, lists,
    etc.)
  - a support for converting continued fractions to convergents has been
    added (a ratio_from_cf function, and a class for building successive
    convergents).

Cordially,
