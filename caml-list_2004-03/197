Again, as the debian maintainer of the ocaml package, i have to agree
here. I package mostly the pure ocaml distribution, with a serie of
patches, applied as needed, but always either picked up from CVS or
discussed with upstream.

The time i choose to apply a random patch, like the early ocaml -i
support one, i had the bad surprise of breaking .cmi generation
compatibiliy between the native and byte code compilers, which was a
cold water shower for me (err, bad french translation, i suppose you
don't say that in english). Anyway, since then i refrained from applying
random external patches.

Now, what would really make my day would be for the ocaml team to decide
to go the professional way, and to maintain both a development CVS
branch, and a stable bugfix CVS branch, which would avoid having to get
some random brokeness when one want to get serious bug fixes. Sorry
Xavier, i know i told you that many times already, and you told me that
your devel model was yours to choose, but i couldn't resist a gentle
proding :). I also don't believe this will be so much of a cost over the
current model, and maybe even be less expensive in the long run.

Friendly,

Sven Luther
