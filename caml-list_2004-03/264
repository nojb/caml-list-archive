Hi Sven,

    Here is Gregoire aka Georgi ipv6 code (oops ...
maybe he is not Georgi but instead Henri) ... anyway I
read it and I like what he did:

1) it seems to be complete albeit seems to be minus
ipv4. Question: how to transition from ipv4 to ipv6?
Or how to have ipv4 and ipv6 namespaces?

2) After I read this code then I think it makes sense
to split unix.mli/unix.ml into socket.mli/socket.ml,
time.mli/time.ml, etc. as Gregoire Henry has done.

Regards, Vasili
