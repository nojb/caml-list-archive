Thanks to everyone who sent me suggestions both on and off the list.  
It turned out that my problem was the small size of the interpreter's 
runtime stack.  By increasing the size of the stack I was able to get 
everything to run the same in both configurations.

Thanks again,
-Eric

P.S. I thought I had tried this fix before asking the list but 
apparently setting the value of OCAML->RUM<-PARAM does not alter the 
behavior of sober programs ;-)
