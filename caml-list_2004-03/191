CPAN is much more than an automatic-installation tool.  The social organization
of the perl namespaces is by far the most important aspect of CPAN.  The module
to automatically install dependencies etc is just a minor convenience next to
the over-arching organizational structure.  My comments with regards to
namespacing and modules are focused on how to present a wide range of extended
libraries in a hierarchy that seems "standard" to someone browsing the archives,
to inspire confidence in the completeness and authoritativeness of the archive.
GODI doesn't (and doesn't intend to, so that's fine) solve this issue, but
clearly the auto-installer on top of such an organization is ready.
