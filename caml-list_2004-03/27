Thanks John... your message prompted me to try another version.  I couldn't 
find a plain 3.07 (as it's been replaced by 3.07+2 on the website), but I 
downloaded and installed 3.06.  My demo program compiled with 3.06 this also 
displays the correct output.  (Correct as in the bug doesn't happen.)  So it 
seems that 3.06 and 3.07 work correctly, but 3.07+2 doesn't, for me at 
least. 

Perhaps someone on the list with 3.07+2 installed can compile my demo 
program and let me know what happens.  This will tell me if this is a bug 
introduced in 3.07+2 (or 3.07+1) or if it's a bug that just affects me.  
(Maybe I broke my O'Caml install somehow, although I don't really see how.) 

Regards,
Nick
