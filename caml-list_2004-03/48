The Fourth International Workshop on Reduction Strategies in
Rewriting and Programming (WRS'04) will be held on June, 2, 2003,
in Aachen, Germany, as a part of the Federated Conference on
Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming (RDP'04).

IMPORTANT DATES:

    March 17, 2004  Deadline for electronic submission of papers
    April 14, 2004  Notification of acceptance of papers
    May    2, 2004  Deadline for final versions of accepted papers
    June   2, 2004  Workshop

TOPICS include, but are not restricted to:

    * theoretical foundations for the definition 
      and semantic description of reduction strategies
    * strategies in different frameworks (term rewriting, graph
      rewriting, infinitary rewriting, lambda calculi, higher
      order rewriting, conditional rewriting, rewriting with
      built-ins, narrowing, constraint solving, etc.)  and their
      application in (equational, functional, functional-logic)
      programming (languages)
    * properties of reduction strategies / computations under
      strategies (e.g., completeness, computability, decidability,
      complexity, optimality, (hyper-)normalization, cofinality,
      fairness, perpetuality, context-freeness, neededness,
      laziness, eagerness, strictness)
    * interrelations, combinations and applications of reduction
      under different strategies (e.g., evaluation mechanisms in
      programming languages, equivalence conditions for
      fundamental properties like termination and confluence,
      applications in modularity analysis, connections between
      strategies of different frameworks, etc.)
    * program analysis and other semantics-based optimization
      techniques dealing with reduction strategies
    * rewrite systems / tools / implementations with flexible /
      programmable strategies as essential concept / ingredient
    * specification of reduction strategies in (real) languages
    * tutorials and systems related to evaluation strategies

INVITED TALKS will be given by:

    *  Olivier Danvy (University of Aarhus, Denmark),
       Normalization by Evaluation
    *  Jan Willem Klop (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands),
       Reduction Cycles

PROGRAM COMMITTEE:

    Sergio Antoy      Portland (USA) (co-chair)
    Roberto Di Cosmo  Paris VII (France)
    Juergen Giesl     Aachen (Germany)
    Bernhard Gramlich Wien (Austria)
    Salvador Lucas    Valencia (Spain)
    Aart Middeldorp   Innsbruck (Austria)
    Jaco van de Pol   Amsterdam (The Netherlands)
    Pierre Rety       Orleans (France)
    Amr Sabry         Bloomington (USA)
    Yoshihito Toyama  Sendai (Japan) (co-chair)

SUBMISSIONS:

    We solicit papers on all aspects of reduction strategies in
    rewriting and programming. Submissions should describe unpublished
    work, except for survey papers which are explicitly welcome,
    too. Submissions should not exceed 10 pages (however, survey
    papers may be longer) and be sent in PostScript or PDF format to
    the PC co-chairs at wrs04@redstar.cs.pdx.edu by March 17,
    2004. The use of the style file available from the RDP workshop
    style page is encouraged. The call-for papers is also available in
    PDF format.

    Submissions should include the title, authors' names,
    affiliations, addresses, and e-mail. Selection of papers by
    the PC will be based on originality, significance, and
    correctness. Final versions will be due by May 2, 2004.

PUBLICATION:

    Accepted papers will be included in the preliminary workshop
    proceedings that will be available at the workshop. The final
    workshop proceedings will be published in Elsevier's
    Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS)
    series.

For further questions please contact the program co-chairs:
Sergio Antoy and Yoshihito Toyama at wrs04@redstar.cs.pdx.edu.
