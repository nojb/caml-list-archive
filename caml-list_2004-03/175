I agree. And, let me add, Inria can get quite a bit of resources, 
financial and human, by delegating to the community. We are willing to 
participate, and like us a lot of others.

Xavier, what you guys must do is not pontificate but define once and for 
all the official role of the community in relation to Inria and to the 
Caml team. Hey, after all we are as eager as you guys to see Ocaml grow 
and thrive. But the effort cannot start from the community. It must be 
backed by authoritative leaders, M. Xavier Leroy being a reasonable 
candidate. Take advantage of the opportunity of tapping the community's 
time and work for the benefit of Ocaml as a whole: research project, 
industrial product, free-software community. See what Mozilla has been 
to Netscape.
