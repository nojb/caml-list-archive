This is also my point: We need some organization. Of course, as we don't
have namespaces in ocaml, so this aspect does not apply (and it would be
nonsense to implement namespaces only to have something people can talk
about). But there are lots of other aspects, e.g. which libraries are
missing, how accessibility of software can be ensured, etc.
