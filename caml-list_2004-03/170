There is a significant barrier to entry that is mostly independent of
the development model.  Here's what my boss told me when I suggested
using ocaml in a commercial product:

1. Nobody else knows the language.
2. It doesn't run on our platform.
3. It will break and we can't get support.

An open or closed development model will not by itself change the
perceptions that prevent me from using ocaml at work.  The only way I
could have overcome objections 2 and 3 would have been to show a way
to get contract support, as is available for operating system
components and commercial compilers.

Perl was so popular that it became an OS component.  gcc was so
popular that companies were willing to invest the money to turn
it into a commercial product.
