            Announcement and Call for Papers for the

                 16th International Workshop on
   Implementation and Application of Functional Languages (IFL'04)
          September 8th -- 10th, 2004, Luebeck, Germany
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Scope and Topics
----------------

The IFL workshops form a tradition that has lasted for over a
decade. The aim of these workshops is to bring together researchers
actively engaged in the implementation and application of functional
and function-based programming languages. They provide an open forum
for researchers who wish to present and discuss new ideas and
concepts, work in progress, preliminary results, etc. related
primarily but not exclusively to the implementation and application of
functional languages.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to
    - language concepts
    - type checking
    - compilation techniques
    - (abstract) interpretation
    - automatic program generation
    - (abstract) machine architectures
    - formal aspects
    - array processing
    - concurrent/parallel programming 
    - concurrent/parallel program execution
    - heap management
    - runtime profiling 
    - performance measurements
    - debugging and tracing
    - verification
    - tools and programming techniques

Papers on applications demonstrating the suitability of novel ideas in
any of the above areas and contributions on related theoretical work
are also welcome. The change of the workshop name adding the term 
"application" is to reflect the broader scope IFL has gained over recent 
years.


Contributions
-------------

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in
the draft proceedings (published as a technical report of the
Institute of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics of the
University of Kiel) and to give presentations at the workshop.  All
contributions must be written in English, conform to the
Springer-Verlag LNCS series format (see:
http://www.springer.de/comp/authors/index.html) and not exceed 16
pages.  Papers must be submitted by August 20th as postscript or pdf
files through the workshop web page at
http://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de/ifl04/index.htm.

Following the IFL tradition since 1996, we intend to publish a
high-quality subset of contributions in the Springer-Verlag Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. All participants who gave a
presentation at the workshop are invited to submit a revised version
of their paper for the post-workshop proceedings. They will be
refereed by the program committee according to normal conference
standards.
