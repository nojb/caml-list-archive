I broadly agree with Matt's analysis of the situation.  Here are some
observations of my own.

(1) Perl gets along quite nicely with a loosely defined and broadly
distributed standard library.  However what Perl has which OCaml does
not is a central repository (CPAN) where you can find all those
libraries.  I don't just mean find pointers to the libraries (the
Humps), but I mean a place where you can get the actual source.

The need for a CPAN for OCaml has been extensively discussed on this
list already, so I won't go into that much further, except to say that
my company would be prepared to fund a [virtual] server and put a
little time into developing this repository.

(2) The QPL license for the compiler itself is a Problem.  I'm
interested to know why the compiler isn't licensed under the GPL, or,
if the commercial interests are so great, under a dual GPL-and-
commercial license similar to (I think) Qt on Unix.

If OCaml was licensed under the GPL then we could consider setting up
a public CVS to create experimental versions of the compiler.  I'd
like to see a load of things going in - GCaml, regexps, ## for single
line comments, # operator for module types, fix for printf FAQ bug,
custom printf operator, ...

Rich.
