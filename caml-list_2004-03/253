that's what I was doing before I started down this road.  I am actually concatinating the strings
to make a larger hash of string words... (representing a hierarchical name type thing) 
SO I am actually copying strings all over the place... I am also reading a new set of data from a
file that has information that I need to cross reference...

So that's why I am trying to centralize strings.  That way I can create integer indexes into a
dictionary and save memory by not carrying around large numbers of strings that are really
duplicates.

thanks though
