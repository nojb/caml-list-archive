I guess you mean David's Advanced Revision Control System.  I had never
heard of this before your post.  There is no Debian package for this,
though it looks like a useful program.  

I wonder if Darcs could be modified to explicitly keep track of changes
to the ASTs of OCaml source files...

Could it output an OCaml script instead of a makefile?  It would
probably be easier to read, debug, and modify.

Thank you!
