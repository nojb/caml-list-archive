Hi Henri,

Sorry for not responding at that time, but I had preciously kept
your original Email and I intended to recontact you at some point.

This document was originally written by Xavier Leroy for a course he taught
at the École Normale Supérieure years ago.  I translated them from
Caml-Light to OCaml last year since I've been using them myself for a course
I taught at École Polytechnique.  I am currently revising them and adding
some new material while I am repeating the course this year.

I have no doubt that there is a potential audience for this book that is
much broader than just a the few students in my class.  This could
encourage people who already know OCaml but who are new to system
programming to learn system programming more smoothly; conversely, they
could also show hackers who are new to OCaml that they can still do their
favorite system hasks in OCaml while taking advantage of high-level
programming. And, as you mention, this could complement the documentation of
the Unix library.

So, translating these notes into English would certainly be profitable to
the community. 

If you are still willing to do the translation after I finished the
revision, we can continue discussing it privately.

Best wishes,

    Didier
