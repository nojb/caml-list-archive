Hello,

   A few days I brought up the issue of the
completeness of the "unix" library. Thank you for many
replies. We all know that OCaml (or ML for that
matter) has module system. Based on what I have seen
of other people's efforts that have not made it into
OCaml, I would like to suggest that unix.mli be broken
up into something like:

1) socket.mli

2) process.mli

3) pthreads.mli

4) ???

E.g. Georgi's (sorry I only remember Russian way)
implementation of ipv6 (ivp4?) socket api was split
out into socket6.mli. This makes a lot of sense for me
from a maintenance viewpoint. Also while I greatly
respect the original work on the Unix library, it is
somewhat confusing to see all "unix" (POSIX)
functionality in one .mli. I am throwing this out for
comments.

Kind regards, Vasili
