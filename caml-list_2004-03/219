Sven, I am aware of the QPL.

You do realize that it is an inconvenience to maintain the stock Ocaml 
tree and the patch, or tree of patches. It is not impossibile, but it is 
an inconvenience. I have a number of patches to the stock ocaml--minor 
stuff--which would be easier to maintain if I were allowed to distribute 
the modified source as opposed to source-and-patches.

Since my company is under-staffed at present, I do not have time to 
spare for distributing patches. So we just keep our patched core for 
internal use and wait until there will be a coordinated effort to which 
we can contribute.

This thread seems to indicate that the only viable proposal for creating 
a community project around Ocaml is Gerd's GODI. I'm glad that Xavier 
gave Gerd some informal backing. However, managing GODI is going to be 
troublesome (not impossibile, just troublesome) until the licensing will 
allow GODI to incorporate in its codebase any patches which the GODI 
maintainer/team will consider appropriate.

I am expressing the need for the community project to make only 
additions, but actually modifications to the core project. I have no 
trouble with QPL 3.b, which is probably what INRIA cares most about. I 
am simply stating that QPL 2 is an unnecessary hassle for everyone.
