This is probably the largest Confluence release to date.  The major=20
features include an open source license, executable simulation=20
models, automatic HTML documentation, and a new standard library.


** Open Source License

Starting with Confluence 0.9, the compiler is now released under the=20
GNU General Public License and the standard libraries are covered=20
with the GNU Lesser General Public License.


** Executable Simulation Models

The Confluence compiler now returns executable models providing bit=20
and cycle accuracy with high simulation performance.

The executable simulation models are controlled by a simple command=20
and query language, making it easy to connect Confluence to any=20
verification environment or programming language (SystemC, Java,=20
Python, OCaml, etc.).  Because the simulation kernels run optimized=20
native code, even a Perl test-bench will yield performance on par=20
with compiled HDL simulation.

Another added benefit of executable simulation models is IP design=20
firms can deliver precise evaluation models that are ready to run and=20
nearly impossible to reverse engineer.


** Automatic HTML Documentation

Confluence 0.9 also introduces cfdoc: a tool for generating HTML=20
documentation from Confluence source code comments.  Similar to=20
javadoc, cfdoc scans a source directory tree extracting comments from=20
*.cf files.  Currently the HTML is not the most attractive, but the=20
formatting and capabilities of cfdoc will continue to improve.

Here's a shot of the standard library:

  http://www.launchbird.com/lib/


** New Standard Library (base.cf)

The new standard library has been built from the ground up with more=20
organization and clearer naming conventions to provide a robust=20
foundation for Confluence designers.

Aside from base.cf, the libraries have reserved space for higher-level=20
components for DSP, communication, on-chip busing, processors,=20
cryptography, and other categories.  Hopefully the open source=20
community will start elaborating on these areas.


** Download

Confluence 0.9 source code and binary distributions are available at:

  http://www.launchbird.com/download.html


** Background

Confluence is a declarative functional programming language for the=20
design and verification of synchronous reactive systems including=20
digital logic, hard-real-time software, and hardware-software=20
co-design.

=46rom one source, Confluence generates:

  - Verilog and VHDL netlists (synthesis, simulation)
  - Cycle accurate C models   (software, simulation)
  - NuSMV models              (formal verification)
  - XML netlists              (custom back-end tooling)
  - Executable Models         (open verification)

Tom
