And what makes all that you've said really bad is that www.ocaml.org is 
the first site I found. And I've found
it referenced in lots of other places. I still claim that the current 
www.ocaml.org site HAS the right idea,
and has a decent format. It isn't perfect, but what is. If some of the 
links to dead end projects were cleaned
off it, and the news items were updated, it would be a very good site.
