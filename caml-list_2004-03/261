Yes. As a veteran of many committees (though in a very different context
than this), I can testify that the structure and process of an
organization can far too easily become an occupation in itself. If you
have to decide how to form a committee, well that leads (backward) to
the need to decide how to decide ... and surely one of the reasons Open
Source has been so successful is that formal organization has been kept
to a minimum, making it very easy for motivated people to get involved.
