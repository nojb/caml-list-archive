Hi,

Here is my grain of salt about this issue.

Interested people please go ahead!  Why not have two (or more)
machines that are mirror of each other?  Also, one could reuse the
Savanah software so as to provide development support, forums,
documentation,... -- the list of available Caml packages could
automatically be computed from the projects.  Moreover dependencies
with other project could conveniently be generated from META (or
other) files and be rendered on-line as links.

I agree with Markus here.  Not only coming with the standard
distribution would make it the de facto standard but, what is more
important, INRIA developers probably know more than anybody else about
the various portability issues.  Indeed I am not sure how well GODI or
findlib work on M$ Win32 for example.  Also, one needs to cooperate
with Debian (or Redhat,...) packagers -- they have some experience and
it would be good that the package system integrates well with their
efforts.  Finally, there should exist some minimal Makefile or such so
that when one library binds to C/Fortran/... code, it is "easy" to do
cross platform compilation.  Lots of us I believe only have access to
few of the platforms that OCaml supports ; tools and guidelines would
be very helpful.

My 2¢,
ChriS
