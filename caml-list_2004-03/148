what's about ....

let file_ch = (open_in input_file) in
let read_lines =
    let read_new_line n =
        try Some (input_line file_ch)
        with End_of_file -> None
    in
        Stream.from read_new_line
in
let rec get_line () = 
    match Stream.next read_lines with
    |s when Str.string_match (Str.regexp "^[\n\t ]+$") s 0 -> get_line ()
    |s -> s
in
