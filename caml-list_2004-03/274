Hello,

  The reason I mention these two names is because we
started to "OCaml's Cathedral and Bazaar" metaphor on
this thread. I am not saying these guy are panacea. I
am merely saying that OCaml seems to be somewhat
directionless and there are a lot of loose ends, e.g.
existing code that has not been incorporated into the
mainstream. On the other hand, there are also a lot of
very talented people working on/using OCaml. I would
sincerely like to see OCaml get more into industry.

Regards, Vasili
