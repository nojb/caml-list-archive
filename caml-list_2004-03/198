Well, nothing is stopping you from paying a programmer to fix the bug,
and have it integrated in the upstream release. In fact, i do believe
the Ocaml Consortium was set up for just that, and have access to the
ocaml code under other licencing i think. So, contribute to it, help
paying programmer to fix bugs and furthermore develop the part of ocaml
you feel are important, in other word, put your money were your mouth
is.

Well, i never noticed such troubles in debian :)) But then, it is your
fault if you did chose an inferior OS :))
