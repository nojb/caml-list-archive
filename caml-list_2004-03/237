This is a lot more complicated than the cygwin port:

- GODI uses a number of C programs that must be ported to Windows. 
- godi_console contains code that runs only under Unix, although this
  code is already separated into special modules, for easier porting.
- In addition to the problems already solved for Cygwin, and the 
  different OS primitives, more Windows peculiarities must be taken
  into account, e.g. the different filenames ("\" as separator, drive
  letters), no symlinks, etc.

A full port to MinGW is a lot of work! However, it is also possible to
do a "half port", that means that the mentioned C programs and
godi_console are taken from the Cygwin port as binaries. Of course, the
ocaml core and all libraries would be for MinGW. This means that GODI
itself still requires the Cygwin DLL to run, but that it would be
possible to generate pure Windows executables. This "half port" should
be quite simple (any volunteers?).
