Hi

In a program  I need to read the input data from a file and I have=20
written several options. I want to obtain the string of characters from=20=

a text file and I don't know what is the better option. Among others, I=20=

have written the following:

First option:

let leer_file fl =3D
      let form =3D ref "" in
      let arch =3D open_in fl in
      let long =3D in_channel_length arch in
      form :=3D String.create (long-1);
      really_input arch (!form) 0 (long-1);
      close_in arch;
      !form;;

Second:

let rec unir c ac =3D unir ac^(Char.escaped c);;

let leer2 fl =3D
      let form =3D ref "" in
      let c =3D ref '-' in
      let arch =3D open_in fl in
      (try
        (while true do (c :=3D input_char arch); (if !c !=3D '\n' then =
(form=20
:=3D unir !c !form) else ()) done)
      with End_of_file -> close_in arch);
      !form;;

I also have a parser to convert the string, could I to improve these=20
functions merging them with the parser in some way?

Thanks for your help
