Please help to distribute.

Sixth International Conference on 
Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM 2004), 

November 8-12, 2004, Seattle,USA

http://research.microsoft.com/conferences/ICFEM2004

Important Dates: 
   Submission of paper:        15th May 2004 
   Notification of acceptance: 1st July 2004 
   Final copy for Proceedings: 1st August 2004
   Conference:                 8-12 November, 2004

Tutorials, Workshops:
   Submission of Proposals: 1 June 2004 
   Acceptance notification: 30 June 2004 

Formal engineering methods are changing the way that systems are 
developed. With language and tool support, these methods are being 
used for semi-automatic code generation, and for the automatic 
abstraction and checking of implementations. In the future, they 
will be used at every stage of development: requirements, 
specification, design, implementation, testing, and documentation.

ICFEM 2004 aims to bring together those interested in the 
application of formal engineering methods to computer systems. 
Researchers and practitioners, from industry, academia, and government, 
are encouraged to attend, and to help advance the state of the art. 
We are interested in work that has been incorporated into real 
production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring 
practical, tangible benefit.

Any submissions whose content is relevant to the field of formal 
engineering methods will be considered, but submissions whose subject 
matter is related to one of the following themes will be 
particularly welcome:

  * applications in 
      o model-based development and code generation
      o testing and test-case generation
      o real-time, hybrid, and critical systems
      o service-based architectures
  * techniques for 
      o verification and validation 
      o model checking 
      o theorem proving 
      o automatic abstraction and refinement 
  * links with 
      o object modelling and the model-driven architecture 
      o development methodologies 
      o tool environments 
      o emerging technologies 

Since ICFEM addresses a heterogeneous audience, potential authors are 
strongly encouraged to make their ideas as accessible as possible. 
In addition, reports of case studies should have a conceptual message, 
theory papers should have a clear link to application, and papers 
describing tools should include an account of practical results. 
The ICFEM 2004 Program Committee selects original technical papers 
for publication in the proceedings of the conference to be published 
by Springer in its Lecturer Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
