(Sorry about the grandiose title. I have nothing suitably profound to
 say ... just couldn't think of a better way to express the subject.)

I wonder if it is possible to persuade INRIA to do anything.

I have no inside information on the process at INRIA, but my impression
from reading this list over the past year or so is:

 1) The OCaml team at INRIA care about the community, but there are too
    few of them to meet all our needs, and I suppose their work is also
    subject to institutional pressures that we are only vaguely aware
    of. Maybe they are struggling to keep enough resources for OCaml
    work.

 2) INRIA as an institution finds it convenient to release OCaml as open
    source, but doesn't really care about the community. They benignly
    neglect everything that doesn't relate to their research goals.

 3) OCaml-as-project (i.e. I'm talking about how OCaml is developed, not
    what it is) is a fragile enterprise. E.g., one developer leaves, and 
    the future of Camlp4 becomes uncertain. Not good.

I'm not saying you should give up hope just yet, but maybe it's time to
consider alternatives.

What if there were an "OCaml Community Library Project"--a group outside
INRIA that would take responsibility for extending and perhaps partially
replacing the standard library--maybe a bit like the current ExtLib
project, only more extensive (BTW, why are there two ExtLibs?? One of
you change the name, please! Thank you.). Maybe if that project showed
itself to be responsible, credible, reliable, etc. etc., after a while
it could become the de facto standard library.

The idealistic scenario is a division of labor wherein INRIA continues
to develop the parts of OCaml that are interesting to them, while other
parts (of more interest to those of us working to create practical
and/or commercial software) would be taken over by the community.

I can't say whether this idea is feasible, or whether INRIA would be
willing to go along with it, but maybe it's something to consider.
