It already does this, sorry about being so terrible about the details!  (I kind
of thought of that as an implementation detail, but now I see it was important
to tell people).  'configure' is a sh script, and 'configure.mlc' is the ml
file.  I used a funny suffix so it wouldn't conflict with configure.ml -
probably I should just invent a name like configure_out.ml

The sh script is a little bare, because it has only been used on 3 or 4 systems,
and it doesn't really have to do much.

Sure; I didn't do this because I didn't want to deceive anyone about that they
were getting :-)  Now that I see the level of interest, I'll package it up into
a release.

Meanwhile, there is a tarball of the ocamlconf directory:
