Falls over laughing... no comparison! I found 3 bugs in 
Ocaml compiler. The first one took a while to convince the team
there really was a bug .. several versions were unusable.
But once convinced, the fix in one day. Two other bugs
fixed in several hours.

Experience with MS: a complex application using Borland C++
had to be converted to MS due to some moron accountant
manager idiot. MSVC++ couldn't handle it due to both serious
bugs and size limitations.

Yes, the company was VERY BIG player with MS contract support
and ISO quality assurance procedures (falls over laughing again)
yes the MS representative was on site quickly enough to
examine the problem.

What did he do? Report the bug (which we already knew) to the
MSVC++ compiler team in Redmond. That's it. Even the representative
got no feedback from them, let alone a fix. AFAIK the problem
was never fixed .. I didn't hang around long enough to find out
the eventual outcome .. it seems doubtful the accountant got
fired though :D
