I don't understand. You wrote :

  have the time" is an acceptable answer.  We pay a company
  to provide us with an embedded Linux environment including
  cross-compilation tools.  While in reality ocaml will be
  more reliable than g++ due to the vast difference in
  complexity, that doesn't overcome the fear.

So, how is that different participating in the Ocaml Consortium, and
thus making sure someone is paid to do the things you need ? Or is payng
for one thing ok, but not for the other ?
