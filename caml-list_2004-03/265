Perhaps a (T)Wiki?  One of the TWiki core developers is in fact very
interested in OCaml and might be persuaded to set something up, but it
would obviously have to be part of / closely associated with the
ocaml.org domain.

BTW, two things about ocaml.org:

(1) Who owns it?  It doesn't look like it's associated with INRIA
in any way (registered to someone in .AU).

(2) Do you think we could set up the v-hosting correctly so that
http://ocaml.org would do the right thing.  This is very
unprofessional and confusing.
