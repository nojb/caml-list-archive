After taking the time to modify the compiler, it's probably not too hard
to write a little script that automates the process of applying a patch,
something like this:

#/bin/sh
wget -c http://mallorn.ucdavis.edu/~ijtrotts/software/ocaml-install.sh
bash ./ocaml-install.sh   # Get GODI and run it.
cd $wherever_the_ocaml_source_is/..
wget -c http://www.foo.com/my_patch
patch -p0 < my_patch
cd $wherever_the_ocaml_source_is
./configure && make world && make opt && make install

Anyway, in the case when you want to have more than one set of changes
to the compiler, patches would be more convenient than getting source
tarballs, extracting patches yourself, and then applying them.
