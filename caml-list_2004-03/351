Hello,


I once have asked here for a library, that
can be used to parse html-files and write
cgi-scripts more easily.

There was a library, or a set of libraries that are
useful for that work.

I've looked in my mail-folders, but didn't find
anything about it (maybe I have removed that old stuff).

Which lib to use for that purpose?

Ciao,
   Oliver
