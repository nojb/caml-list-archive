Hello,

In our project, we would like to produce statically linked binaries for
the Windows platform (in native code).

We have tried to use -static option under cygwin environment but it does
not seems to work, the cygwin1.dll is still required (I don't have done
the work so I don't know the details).

>From an old post, it seems that this is not possible with cygwin:
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2001-12/msg00254.html


Has anybody already produced fully statically linked OCaml binaries
under Windows? Any advice how we could do that? Do you think that using
MinGW instead of Cygwin would solve this issue?


Yours,
d.
