I'd like to be able to do two different things:

1. Write web applications in OCaml via a browser plug-in (like Java or WPF).

2. Write cross-platform GUI applications in OCaml via the JVM or the CLR.

What is the easiest way to achieve this?

My objective is to compete commercially with Java and C# programmers by 
writing applications.

For example, I'd like to take our Mathematica notebook:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/CWT/

translate the Mathematica into OCaml, implement a GUI and compile the OCaml to 
JVM or .NET to get an application, or something I could host to implement the 
same functionality in the browser.

Are there any OCaml tools to help me do this?

A retargetted compiler (like OCamIL) or OCaml bytecode interpreter written in 
Java/C# is fine provided it allows me to call library functions from 
Java/.NET. For example, I'd like to be able to use Swing or Windows Forms.
