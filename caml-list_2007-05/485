Heck no, I'd demand they eradicate Windows entirely,
it has no place in institutions of any kind.

One sensible government has already banned closed
source software in all departments (Peru).

There really is NO excuse for publically funded institutions
to continue to waste taxpayer money on insecure operating
environments which don't meet the most basic principles 
or western democracy, namely open government. Since it
is software that implements most decisions of the legislature,
the software should be open to public scrutiny, and
the principle should descend to other institutions which
are expected to be accountable.

Universities should take the lead, because in the event
of a problem they have inhouse resources -- namely students --
who can fix them.
