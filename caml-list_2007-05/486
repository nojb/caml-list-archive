Now that I'm thinking about it, it's probably the route I'm going to go 
for my presentation on Test Driven Development with OCaml  for Agile 
2007 -- I don't have a Mac or a Linux laptop kicking around (former is 
too expensive, latter won't get wireless working for me), but I 
definitely want to be in Linux for development.

So, if you're willing to wait until the early Augustish timeframe, I 
might have just such a LiveCD to share.
