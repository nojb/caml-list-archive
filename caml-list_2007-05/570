This is what we did for a a few examples of using JoCaml,
the soon-to-be-released extension of OCaml for concurrent programming.

Fork/Exec is an easy way to get simultaneous execution.

JoCaml is not released yet, (I am writting the doc
and web site at the moment).

The much incomplete web site is at
<http://jocaml.inria.fr>

One example of fork under jocaml control
<http://jocaml.inria.fr/manual/concurrent.html#htoc25>

The example may not meet all your concerns (speed I guess),
but you can replace the shell in the example by somme
C or Ocaml program that computes something and refine the control
to collect results.


Hope it helps.
