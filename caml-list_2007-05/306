I wonder if anyone has thought about or developed a domain-specific
language in OCaml for handling the processing of binary structures?

I was thinking of writing something to make system calls into the Xen
hypervisor.  The main problem is that the hypervisor takes & returns
binary structures which have very precise size / alignment
requirements, bitfields, etc. (and the requirements change with
versions of the hypervisor).  It sounds like the ideal use for a DSL
to describe the binary structure of each version of each call and
automatically build accessors.
