Any chance we could have something like in Haskell where you easily
define new infix names?

Speaking of Haskell and Revised, one of the things I like about Revised
over Ocaml syntax (that lots of people dislike it seems) is the
additional bracketing. Most of the syntactical annoyances I have with
Ocaml are usually connected with bracketing. Someone once quipped that
all problems with ML syntax can be fixed with some parentheses, and I
have to admit that quip makes sense. So I prefer Revised as an
alternative syntax over Python/Haskell influenced approaches.
