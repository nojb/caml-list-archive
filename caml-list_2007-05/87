The CVS version of the PPL (what will become PPL 0.10) has an OCaml
interface (in addition to C++, C, Prolog and Java interfaces).
This version is not formally released yet, but you can obtain it
by following the instructions at

     http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/Download/cvs#read-only-access

The OCaml interface has not been heavily tested yet, but we believe
it works OK.  In any case, we will provide all the assistance
you may need.

The same version of the PPL features also a Mixed Linear/Integer Programming
solver based on exact arithmetic.  You can access it from all the interfaces,
including the OCaml interface.
Hope this helps,
