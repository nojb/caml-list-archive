Perhaps I do not fully understand but:

I do not use 'eof' (end-of-stream pseudo token).
I get this for an unused token:

"Warning: the token WHENCE is unused."

and I should get the same for eof IMHO (but possibly 
suppressed message since it's not a user defined
token).

What i actually get is 145 end-of-stream conflicts .. 
but i get no conflicts on WHENCE.

That is, instead of treating the token set precisely as the
set of user tokens + eof, menhir is treating eof specially
and not consistently with other tokens.

There's no conflict: in every one of these states if 'eof'
turns up its a syntax error, exactly the same as if WHENCE
turns up. 

I'm not sure i fully understand the 'do we need lookahead'
issue: I would have thought: you need a fetch if your action is 
shift, and not if it is a reduce.
