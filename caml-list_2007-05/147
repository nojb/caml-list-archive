Hi Richard,

F# is a research language, with many of the same issues as other research l=
anguages (license, support, works poorly on some platforms). We never think=
 of it as a replacement for OCaml, though it makes a reasonable alternative=
 on Windows (less so on Linux). I guess as I researcher I think of both as =
stepping stones to other better and greater things. I want to see this clas=
s of languages live and flourish in many parts of the computing industry. B=
rian Hurt captured things well here.

There is a overlap between the two (e.g. with Jon's work), but there is als=
o a lot of synergy: I know OCaml is gaining traction in some financial comp=
anies, and I can't help think that the existence of F# helps this more than=
 it hinders it. For example, it helps people make stronger arguments to man=
agement: easier to recruit programmers, gives a way for Java and C# program=
mers to retrain in steps. Also, I think an OCaml/F# mix would make an excel=
lent university course, where each language alone would leave interesting i=
ssues unaddressed. Perhaps there is also scope for a dual-track conference =
on both languages.

We've always tried very hard to avoid overlap. For example, you'll notice w=
e don't announce F# releases on the OCaml list - this is out of respect for=
 the OCaml community. Jon operates in both worlds and has books and product=
s to sell, so will be naturally talking about and comparing both systems. I=
 think that's a good thing, and I know he intends his comparisons to be inf=
ormative rather than destructive.

F# is an independent implementation: it wasn't derived from an earlier vers=
ion of OCaml (we would have avoided zillions of bugs if we'd done that!). W=
e try to arrange the libraries to get a reasonable degree of compatibility =
with OCaml 3.08, but are imperfect. We also aim to support cross compilatio=
n, though not perfectly (local adjustments to code may be required, and mis=
sing features avoided). We do use OCaml to bootstrap F# for a variety of re=
asons, though we are moving away from that model.

Jon's assessment of performance under Mono hasn't been independently verifi=
ed. Any particular performance problem really comes down to a Mono v. .NET =
issue. Jon should isolate the issue out in a C# program and report it to th=
e Mono team: they will take it seriously. Other users of Mono do not report=
 catastrophic performance problems (or else no one would use it!)

We understand the current license doesn't meet the standards of the open so=
urce community. We have permission to release the source under a more permi=
ssive license quite similar to Iron Python, and plan to do that. However we=
 probably won't make a big song-and-dance about that, as the way we have th=
e project set up now (binary releases) is really ideal for us as a small te=
am. But emitting the source code under a permissive license now and then ma=
kes a lot of sense in order to address some of the issues you mention below=
.

Kind regards,
Don

... 10 to 30 times more slowly under Mono, according to your posting here:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2007/04/83072c819929adb7612a=
ecd5286c643d.en.html

Do Microsoft produce a free (as in speech) .Net framework with
equivalent performance which runs under Linux?  Will they continue to
make F# work with Mono?  or indeed do they support it right now?

The license, "Microsoft Research Shared Source License Agreement"
(http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp-license.txt) explicitly
prevents commercial redistribution of the F# sources, and that means
for example that it could never be part of a free operating system
like Debian or Fedora.

In practical, day to day terms I'd better hope that Microsoft Research
continue to produce and support new versions of F#.  If one day they
just abandoned it, or if they decided to drop support of Mono then I'd
be up a creek without a paddle (but with a lot of software which I'd
have to rewrite in another language).

So F# was a separate implementation?  I thought it was derived from an
older version of OCaml - but with the licensing issues above I'm not
about to download the source to check that.

Discussion moved to caml-list.  It's important to get any
misunderstandings about F# resolved.

Rich.
