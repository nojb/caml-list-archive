Dear list members,

I am finalising the port of bindlib to camlp4 3.10 and I have some minor 
comments:

- Thanks for the new possible keywords ... however, "^))" is considered 
as one keyword ... and "))" is not ... may be this could be improved ?
- I had some trouble that I solved with the change of type for 
$list:...$, the compilation lines to produce executable like camlp4orf 
with my own extension add and a few others I can not remember.
- I had to extend the match_case0 rule instead of expr LEVEL "expr1" 
because this level disapeared. (I had a rule with "match expr with bind 
f in e -> expr"
which I can not make work now, but anyway, extending match_case0 here is 
better.

Thanks for the work,
Christophe Raffalli
