Forget these words: I misunderstood your email,
because I did not read until end before I answered.
Sorry for the unnecessary traffic.

I thought you want to automatically *convert*
code to tailrec-code. Even if this would
also be a fine thing, it could block understanding,
as mentioned above.

But you only want to have warnings...
...that might be a good helper.
But it might also be annoying?
Such warnings should be off per default, IMHO.

Ciao,
