You don't say anything about your OS or graphics H/W, but as you 
appear to be running 64-bit Linux, I will go out on a limb and say you 
probably have graphics driver problems... ;)

Generally speaking, these have historically lagged [significantly] 
behind Windows drivers performance-wise, as they don't get nearly as 
much attention from the graphics chip manufacturers.
