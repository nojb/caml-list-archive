I've been having an off-list discussion with Joel about this.  The  
answer for anyone here who might be interested is that 1) the Cf_uri  
module uses it; and,  2) there's more source code in CVS that hasn't  
been packaged into any releases.  There's a MIME header parser, an  
XML framework, the beginnings of a SASL toolkit, etc.

None of it is documented.  It doesn't meet my standards for packaging  
into a release.  There are probably bugs I haven't found yet because  
I'm not testing enough of the code.  Side effects may vary.  Consult  
your doctor if you experience migraine headaches or severe abdominal  
pain.  Do not taunt happy fun ball.

The CVS component in SourceForge is /cvsroot/ocnae/src, in case  
anyone is interested.  Be advised that the latest release of OCaml  
broke the Cf_scan_parser module again.  I need to fix that.
