It is not true that this is equivalent.  For example, most Haskellers 
have learnt the hard way that $ and application are subtly different.  
The culprit, and the same is true here, is higher-rank polymorphism.  
With syntax-driven expansions, one can involve rank-2 functions in `` `` 
quotes, but in-language operators cannot do so (at least without 
suffering all sorts of other problems).

Whether this issue is important enough, that is a completely different 
question.  I personally am undecided on that point.
