Just a thought, but how about keeping the shared libraries in (eg)
your home directory or another writable place, and using
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH to cause them to be loaded into the process.  If this
works then at least you won't need to change how OCaml binaries get
built.

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/mylibs ./mywebapp

(or if using CGI, try a wrapper script or Apache SetEnv).
