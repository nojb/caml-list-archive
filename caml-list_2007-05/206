Hi Dmitry,

I shortly used this plugin and I was a little bit desapointed. Some points were 
quite difficult for me:
   - I didn't have a human readable outline, 
   - the syntax highlighting was not implemented very well (.mll and .mly files
     not supported),
   - there was no automatic compilation (am I wrong ?),
   - ...

I also noticed that the last release on sourceforge was 3 years old. I started to
look at the source code and tried to adapt it, but it asked too much work than
rewriting it from scratch. That's why ODT was born.

Does it answers to your question ?

Manu
