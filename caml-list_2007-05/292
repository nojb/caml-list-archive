Actually, the refactoring editor is not yet my first objective
(it is the second one). First, I have to implement a code
formatter to have a sound basis for a real OCaml IDE.

Soutaro has already told me he's working on a refactoring
tool. That's also why the refactoring tools are not my priority.
With his work, we then should look how we could integrate
this into ODT (and if it has a meaning).

By the way, I already have a parser for ml and mli files,
based on the ocamlc -dparsetree option. I also have a java
AST closed to the ocamlc compiler AST. It is accessible
via the sourceforge CVS server with anonymous connection.
The formatter should be available in few months (it's not
a full time job ;-))
