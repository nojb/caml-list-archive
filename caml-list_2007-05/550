Below is the Final Call for Papers for the 2007 Workshop on ML.

It's only a few weeks until the submission deadline (June 15), so
whether you are a designer, developer or user of ML, please consider
contributing a paper!

Note that this year, we are introducing a new paper category of
"work-in-progress reports".  These are intended as a way of informing
others in the ML community about the status of ML-related research or
implementation projects, as well as communicating insights gained from
such projects that do not quite constitute a full research paper. See
below for more details.

If you are interested in submitting a paper, but you are not sure
about what category it belongs in or if it would be appropriate for
the workshop, please contact me or Claudio Russo, the Workshop Organizer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                  The 2007 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

                        Friday, October 5, 2007
                           Freiburg, Germany

                To be held in conjunction with ICFP '07

             http://research.microsoft.com/~crusso/ml2007/

                   Submission web site (now open):
           https://www.softconf.com/starts/ml07/submit.html

                        FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS


GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP:

The ML family of programming languages, whose most popular dialects
are Standard ML and Objective Caml, has inspired a tremendous amount
of computer science research, both practical and theoretical. ML
continues to be employed successfully in applications ranging from
compilers and theorem provers to low-level systems software, web
applications and video games. The Workshop on ML aims to bring
together researchers, developers and users of ML to hear about and
discuss the latest work on the design, semantics, implementation and
application of ML and ML-like languages. Previous ML workshops have
been held in Orlando, Florida (1994), Baltimore, Maryland (1998),
Tallinn, Estonia (2005), and Portland, Oregon (2006).

The 2007 Workshop on ML will be held in conjunction with the 12th ACM
SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2007)
in Freiburg, Germany on Friday, October 5, 2007.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

This year, we are seeking paper submissions of two varieties:
*research papers* and *work-in-progress reports*.

*Research papers* must present original research that has not been
published elsewhere. We welcome research papers on any ML-related
topic, including (but not limited to):

 * applications
 * concurrent programming
 * formal semantics
 * language design
 * language formalization and mechanization
 * language implementation
 * programming environments
 * type systems

*Work-in-progress reports* need not present original research. Rather,
they are intended as a way of informing others in the ML community
about the status of ML-related research or implementation projects, as
well as communicating insights gained from such projects that do not
quite constitute a full research paper. As such, we expect that
work-in- progress reports will be shorter than research papers, and we
will not judge them to the same standard. If you have any questions
regarding the appropriate paper category for a potential submission or
its overall suitability for the workshop, please contact the program
chair.

All paper submissions must be at most 12 pages total length in the
standard ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference format:
        http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm
Authors of work-in-progress report submissions should designate their
papers as such by including the words "work in progress" or "status
report" in the title. Submissions authored by program committee
members are permitted, with the usual stipulation that they will be
judged to a higher standard.

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital Library.

Submissions are now being accepted electronically via START:

       https://www.softconf.com/starts/ml07/submit.html

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission deadline:        Friday, June 15, 2007
Notification of acceptance: Friday, July 13, 2007
Final revision due:         Friday, August 3, 2007
