Hi, Rich,

Thanks for your reply.

I'd like to use the Parma Polyhedra Library 
(http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/) to solve the convex-hull and widening 
problems. Does it work in ocaml? Or any other good tools for ocaml?

BTW, does ocaml work with the  
LP_solver(http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/) library? Or is there any 
good LP solver for ocaml?

Thanks
  Guan
