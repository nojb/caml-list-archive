PEPID=E2=84=A2 for BlackBerry=C2=AE User 2007 Wireless Leadership Award Win=

California Transplant Donor Network recognized for implementing PEPID
RN Critical Care

Evanston, Illinois =E2=80=93 May 4, 2007 =E2=80=93 PEPID, a leading develop=
er of
mobile medical information resources for healthcare, today announced
that the California Transplant Donor Network (CTDN) of Oakland,
California, is a recipient of the 2007 Wireless Leadership Awards. The
Award recognizes the donor network for "innovation and outstanding
results in wireless application." Transplant Coordinators from the
Network=E2=80=99s Clinical Services Department refer to PEPID=E2=84=A2 RN C=
ritical
Care Nursing Suite to help evaluate donors, check drug dosing and
avoid adverse drug interactions in the field. The Award will be
presented to the CTDN in a ceremony at the Wireless Enterprise
Symposium on May 9th in Orlando, Florida.

"We are thrilled that the California Transplant Donor Network is
receiving this prestigious honor for implementing our critical care
nursing product," says PEPID President John Wagner. "We are especially
gratified because the CTDN is such a richly deserving and worthwhile
organization. Congratulations to everyone at the California Transplant
Donor Network."

One of the largest organ procurement organizations in the United
States, the Network coordinates organ recovery and distribution for
160 hospitals in Northern California, Central California, and Nevada.
When a potential donor is identified in the Transplant Network's
service area, a transplant coordinator is sent to the hospital to
evaluate medical suitability and to work with the hospital staff to
provide appropriate care for the donor. Founded in 1987, the CTDN now
serves over 11 million people in 40 counties with an organ donation
rate that is typically higher than the national average.

The Network is a federally designated organ recovery organization and
has four departments dedicated to clinical, hospital, family and
community services. About ninety percent of its clinical staff is
equipped with BlackBerry devices.  PEPID for BlackBerry is implemented
as a back-end solution that is delivered to the field by Verizon
Wireless.=20

The 2007 Wireless Leadership Awards recognize innovation and
outstanding results in wireless deployments. These awards acknowledge
those BlackBerry users who have set the standard for business
excellence, unique solutions, ingenuity, and customer satisfaction
with wireless solutions in the public sector, private sector and with
valuable business impact.

More than 90 percent of Americans believe that organ, eye and tissue
donation is the right thing to do. Yet only 30 percent of those same
individuals have legally and properly recorded their decision to
donate. To learn more about organ donation in your state, go to
www.donatelife.net  for more information.
