Hi everyone, 

The new version of ODT has been released this morning. It is ready
for OCaml 3.10 and its new AST (e.g. virtual fields).

Everything is available on the ODT website: http://ocamldt.free.fr.
The "overview" page explains its current main features, and the 
"install notes" page details some requirements and incompatibilities
with older versions of OCaml.
Some screenshots are also available to show the GUI.

Please, don't hesitate to try ODT (for personal or professional use)
and forward this mail to anyone which could be interested in.

Thanks !

Manu
