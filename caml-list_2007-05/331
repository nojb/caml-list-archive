Dear All

I would like to know how to make ocaml with mostly static binaries.

My motivation is the following: I want to code some dynamic web site but =

my small hosting company provide only a very basic linux system. In=20
particular even the /usr/lib/libpcre.so is not available.

So I would like to develop an application which only has as dynamic=20
library the very common ones like libc.so libm.so libdl.so and no much mo=
re.

I know that the request is not very common, I am not familiar enough=20
with Ocaml linking of C libraries ...

BTW, those developing tools in Ocaml for Web might also consider this=20
small issue: some small web hosting companies (those costing a few euros =

or dollars each month) offer only very few shared libraries, and most of =

the libraries used by such Ocaml web applications should be statically=20
linked. It may sound strange, but it is true.

Oh, did I forgot to tell that I hate PHP?

Regards.
