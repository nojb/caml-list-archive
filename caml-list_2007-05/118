                       RDP'07 Student Travel Grants
		          Call for Applications

**********************************************************************

RDP'07 is the fourth edition of the International Conference on
Rewriting, Deduction and Programming, to be held June 25 to 29 in
Paris, France. Please consult the RDP'07 web page http://www.rdp07.org
for more information.

A limited number of travel grants is available for students who would
not otherwise have resources to attend RDP'07, and whose attendance
would benefit both the applicant and the conference.

The number of grants and the per-grant amount will be established on a
case by case basis, depending on the applicant's need and the total
amount of funds available for the program. Applicants should note that
a grant is limited, and that costs in excess of the grant will not be
reimbursed.

Grants will be awarded based on the evaluating committee's assessment
of the applicant's genuine financial need, the potential benefit to
the applicant's education, research, and career, and the potential
benefit to the conference or workshop. Among those applicants who
genuinely could not attend the conference without a grant, the
evaluating committee gives priority to (co-)authors of accepted
papers.

Applications should explain
- the current status of the applicant
- the kind of participation of the applicant in RDP
- a breakdown of the estimated amount needed

Applications should be send by May 20, midnight UT time zone, by email
to registration@rdp07.org. Applicants should have their supervisor
send a recommendation email to the same address and by the same
deadline. This letter should describe the student's work, the benefit
to that work of attending the conference, and an assessment of the
student's financial need.

Timeline:
- Sunday, May 20, midnight UT	Deadline for applications and recommendation
                                letters
- Thursday, May 24              Notification about acceptance or rejection
- Thursday, May 31              Deadline for RDP'07 registration
