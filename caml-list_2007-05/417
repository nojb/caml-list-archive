I didn't say the book is a bad one.
It was to expensive for me, so I asked a local university library to buy it.
So I could read it. Yes, I like the book also.
And it's ok to mention it. But if it's mentioned in nearly every mail,
then it's obssessive and might annoy the reader, who is here to read about
OCaml. Reading about OCaml in commercial applications is interesting for me,
but thies IMHO does not include books (as commercial products) about the language.

Nonsense.

It can be put on webpages with links to OCaml-references, and I think
it already is.

When I google with "books on OCaml" it's on the first result page and
one of the first links also.

So, it would be fine if these mail-based advertising pop-ups
could be abandoned. They are unnecessary and also annoying.

This is no option, because Jon's answers often are also well informing.
But the advertising is nevertheless annoying.
