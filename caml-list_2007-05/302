Folks,

This is just to remind you about the closing date for offers of talks at th=
e

        2007 Commercial Users of Functional Programming workshop
                http://cufp.galois.com/

The closing date is 1st June, in a couple of weeks.  The workshop itself is=
 on Oct 4, co-located with ICFP at Freiburg, Germany.

CUFP is a workshop for people who use functional programming (in some guise=
), because it's the best way to get the job done, rather than because it's =
a cool research topic.

It's a very informal workshop.  No papers, no proceedings -- just stand up =
and tell us how it is for you.  But you have to tell us in advance so we ca=
n plan the day.  Please get in touch with me or Kathleen Fisher (details at=
 the URL above).

You can also nominate someone else.  That's even easier.  (But ask them fir=
st.)

And plan to come, too!

Simon
