Dear David, dear all,

Okay, thanks a lot for this clarification.

Too bad :)

To me, the work done by ocamlmklib is not _that_ simplistic. Indeed, the
use of -verbose reveals that is calls commands like ar and ranlib, which
I'd prefer not tocall directly in the Makefile.
Also, I'd rather avoid depending on OCamlMakefile, to try to minimize
the dependencies and keep the compilationprocess assimple as possible.

I will have a look to this section, thanks !

Cheers,
Sébastien.
