Shalom, Nicolas.

  As for me, the lack of custom infix operators in revised syntax
is a feature that allows to keep code clean, without any
"=?=" or "<<+".  The code "(func arg1 arg2)" is imho much
more readable than "arg1 op arg2" because: 1. function name
usually says something about the meaning of the function, 2. you
don't need to remember operator's precedence and associativity
to understand the code.
