Of course. The congratulations were for you. The wish list was for OCaml
Devs.

I'm currently thinking about the best way to write the equivalent of
JavaFX for OCaml : both the user-interface and the "new features" (e.g.
list comprehension, SQL-ish selections from data structures, etc.). The
user-interface part doesn't look too difficult. I'll start to work on
it... well, if I ever get time.

Cheers,
 David
