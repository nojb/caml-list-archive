I thought I saw somewhere a project to use Ocaml as a Procedural 
Language in Postgresql (so that you can write triggers and stored 
procedures in Ocaml), but I can't find this project at the moment.  Does 
anyone know what happened to it, and wether the code is available 
anywhere?  Thanks.

Brian
