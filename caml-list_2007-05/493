Building a Knoppix disk with a custom selection of software and a page 
that boots whenever its loaded (to explain what you just did to your 
student's computer and where their Windows went) isn't too bad.  I'd 
suggest the "Knoppix Hacks" book from O'Reilly for help on this.

I'd be willing to do this as a moonlighting gig, if someone had some 
budget to burn.
