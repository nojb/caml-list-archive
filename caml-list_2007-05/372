Having had all links to ffconsultancy.com removed from Wikipedia (even my PhD 
thesis!), we discussed this at length in our company recently. Spammers and 
vandals are a major problem for Wikis. I think we dreamt up a good solution: 
replace the standard "type in these letters" with a Turing test.

I think the questions should be hard. Anyone contributing to an OCaml Wiki 
should know some OCaml.

The guy who put up a Wiki for SICP translations did this (albeit with trivial 
questions) and said that it worked very well.

Perhaps this is a case for mod_caml? :-)
