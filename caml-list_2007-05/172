                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                   COMPUTER AIDED VERIFICATION (CAV)
                     19th International Conference

                   July 3 - 7, 2007, Berlin, Germany

                       http://www.cav2007.org

		  Early registration deadline: May 25.

CAV 2007 is the 19th Computer-Aided Verification conference. It will be
held at the Park Inn Hotel, Alexanderplatz, Berlin, Germany, July 3-7, 2007. 
The conference will start with one day of tutorials (July 3rd), followed by 4
days of the main conference (July 4-7th). Seven affiliated workshops will be
held in the two days before and the day after CAV (July 1st-2nd and 
July 8th).You can find the preliminary program  for CAV 2007, links to 
affiliated workshops,  and information on how to register for CAV and the
workshops at the conference web site: http://www.cav2007.org

IMPORTANT: Early registration deadline is May 25.

The CAV'07 conference is the 19th in a series dedicated to the advancement
of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for
hardware and software systems. CAV considers it vital to continue its
leadership in hardware verification, and maintain its recent momentum in
software verification. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical
results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification
tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their
implementation. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A selection of papers
will be invited to a special issue of the International Journal on Formal
Methods and System Design.
