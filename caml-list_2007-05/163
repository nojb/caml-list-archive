6 kilometers per second (20,000 kilometers per hour) relative to
Cassini.
(The model is available as a free reference design with System
Generator.
Identify potential causes of the potential hazards. The model had to
represent a system that was not working as intended. The qualitative
aspect of hazard analysis involves determining the severity and
assessing the risk of each potential hazard identified during PHA.
Popken modeled the faulty receiver in MATLAB.
, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Nested functions provide a powerful alternative programming pattern that
enables you to create more robust, elegant, and memory-efficient MATLAB
applications.
m, which produces the GUI windows in Figure 1. The Simulink Model
Advisor enables you to check models for conditions and configuration
settings to produce efficient models and generated code. Wireless system
designs often feature FPGAs alongside DSPs.
The plots show the path deviation due to unwanted activation of the
subsystem at different vehicle speeds.
But this was not possible in the Huygens implementation because many
reconfigurable parameters, including the scaling factor, had been frozen
to reduce the complexity of the design. Performing such activities in a
real vehicle may involve risk to the driver and can increase costs due
to the needed additional vehicle safety devices.
The plots in Figure 3 show our validation results.
This article discussed the development of a simulation model for a
vehicle subsystem safety analysis.
Using tools from The MathWorks and third parties, we developed a
modeling and simulation method that supports a safety program for a
critical vehicle subsystem. , Diagnostic Development for an Electric
Power Steering System, SAE 2000 World Congress. Validation results for
the closed-loop simulation, comparing subsystem and actuator outputs
between the simulation model and the actual data for a given maneuver.
For those situations where standards or regulations do not exist, we
initially based our safety metrics on published safety studies and past
experience. For those situations where standards or regulations do not
exist, we initially based our safety metrics on published safety studies
and past experience. Closed-loop cosimulation model in Simulink.
Specifically, we focus on a receiver design for a 16-level quadrature
amplitude modulation (16-QAM) telemetry system.
Cassini would fly by Titan at a much higher altitude than was originally
planned. We tested the vehicle with average drivers to measure driver
response time, and used this time factor in the simulation model to
simulate the driver steering delay time. Example 4: cellfun and arrayfun
These functions can be used in combination if you need to perform
operations on each field of a structure and for each element of an
array.
Validation results for the vehicle simulation model. We associated the
DLL with a custom S-function, which we here refer to as the subsystem
software S-function.
m contains a second nested function, updateResultFig. The model
explained the cycle slips in the bit synchronizer and the resultant data
corruption. You can use nested functions to simplify program structures
and function interfaces because you can access variables from the
enclosing workspace without having to pass them in or out as arguments.
For presentation purposes, you may need a more user-friendly way of
storing and displaying the data. This capability provides a
straightforward method to verify hardware implementation and accelerate
simulations. Because our design is destined for an FPGA, it comprises
blocks from the System Generator Blockset. Consequently, nested
functions let you simplify the code and improve performance.
