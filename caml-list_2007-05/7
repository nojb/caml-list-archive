There's no other list so I think it's right.

Usually I don't need it because unless the viewport is specified by a =20=

third party library, this information is usually setup by you, hence =20
you can store it somewhere for yourself if needed.

> Is this unimplemented?

Yes it is unimplemented. I don't think it is worth implementing =20
because in general querying OpenGL state with glGet (e.g. to get the =20
current matrix) should be avoided, it is too slow [1]. It's faster to =20=

have a mirror of this information on your side.

Best,

Daniel
