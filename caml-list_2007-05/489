On my side, I've just started working on the (module) interfaces for
simplified, declarative, UI creation. Aims to be slightly more readable
and customisable than [what I've seen of] your work, Chris, but based
essentially on the same ideas.

If this module interface brings anything interesting, I'll be sure to
warn the list.

On the other hand, I'd be very interested in participating to the
development of a functional, cross-platform, GUI library that could be
deployed with OCaml.

Cheers,
 David
