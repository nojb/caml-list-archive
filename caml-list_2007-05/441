The OP wasn't doing that. He simply voiced a simple opinion
that Jon was overdoing it a bit pushing his book.

Well, yes, he probably was just a tad, but he has to make
a living, and who can complain about trying to do that
in a way that helps Ocaml?

O"Reilly wouldn't publish an English Ocaml book. Harrop took
a substantial risk with his time and money. Lets hope he sells
enough to get the print runs up and the price down a bit --
it's way out of reach of students.
