Regarding executables I think the symbolic link should not be put in =20
the directory in which ocamlbuild is invoked. Either put it in the =20
directory in which the target ml file is or do not create links at =20
all. In a case I have a directory layout conceptually similar to this :

> > ls */*
> src/a.ml                test/test.ml
> src/a.mli               testalt/test.ml

So each time I build one of the test executable with

> > ocamlbuild -I src test/test.native

or

> > ocamlbuild -I src testalt/test.native

it changes the symbolic link test.native in the root directory. =20
However I would like to have both executables at hand hence I'd =20
prefer the symbolic links to be respectively created in test and =20
testalt. It is annoying because I never remember which test I last =20
built when I invoke test.native and often end up with the wrong one.

But putting links in subdirectories means more work for ocamlbuild -=20
clean. Maybe the best alternative is to not create symbolic links at =20
all and force the user to hunt in _build or to use

> > ocamlbuild -quiet -I src test/test.native --
> > ocamlbuild -quiet -I src testalt/test.native --

to launch its executables. This avoids any symbolic link confusion.

I concur, there is something magic about it. But there are minor =20
points that annoy me at the moment  (e.g. by default the _log file =20
should be written in the _build/ directory, and apparently the emacs =20
mode was not updated to look for .annot files in the _build directory).

Best,

Daniel
