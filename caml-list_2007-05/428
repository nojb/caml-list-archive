I can confirm that: hundreds. This happens especially for mismatching
class types, because the compiler tries to break the mismatch down.

But beginners shouldn't use classes.

There is certainly a point. The length of type errors depends on your
programming style. A teacher can give hints how to make everything
easier to handle. (Although it is also a valid point in education to let
the students find their limits.)
