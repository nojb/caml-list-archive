Since forcing people to sign up with an email address, the wikis at
http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/ and http://cocan.org/ have been spam
free, although people who signed up have complained about getting
notified of all the changes[*] so perhaps that's another sort of spam.

You are right though that CAPTCHAs do not work.  Seriously.  Every
time I've looked at a case of Wiki spam, it's been done by a human
being presumably sitting in a sweat-shop in China or wherever.  Human
beings have no problem typing in CAPTCHAs.

Forcing them to learn OCaml in order to contribute is a good idea.  If
they did it, then even if we get spammed, at least we get more OCaml
coders ...
