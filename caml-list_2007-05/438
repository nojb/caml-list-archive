I also purchased Jon's book and I have to say that I am surprised that
not many other people are championing his efforts. I simply do not
understand why people seem offended that somebody would mention their
own work.

As an avid reader of this list, I have noted, just for the record, that
Dr Jon Harrop's (he earned the title so let's use it) contributions are
wholly positive and indeed extremely helpful.

He is obviously a very talented, open minded developer with an ambition
to succeed both intellectually and financially, but I would conclude
that the former ambition is more prevalent in his writings on this, and
on other lists that I have seen.

At the same time, I appreciate that people do have their own opinions and
while this is true, they should refrain from petty snipes at  
somebody who has invested a LOT of time and effort to produce something
that will help other developers achieve a broader playing field of
computer instruction.

Come on guys, if it is jealousy, or a desire for a world of ultra
altruism, Only those guilty know, but please lets evaluate our own
reasons to contribute to this fantastic mailing list and keep it
positive. You've only got one life (although my last point hasn't been
proven :-) )
