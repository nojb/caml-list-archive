hi,

I have classes which have many getter/setter methods. At the moment I
use two naming schemes intermixed: get_property / set_property and
property / set_property and I don't like that very much.
I would like to integrate one camlp4 extension which allows to define
the getter and setter methods for members, to be able to write:

obj#prob <- xxx;
print_endline obj#prob;

Is this a good idea to integrate camlp4 macros in my project? If
someone who might use my lib  also uses a camlp4 extension, can this
lead to trouble?

thanks
 Michael
