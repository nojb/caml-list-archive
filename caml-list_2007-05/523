I tried your program briefly and noticed (using a load monitor) that
it was constantly using CPU cycles even when it should be idle.  So I
ran it under "strace" and saw that it was continually reading data
from the connection to the X server.  This occurs inside a signal
action, probably triggered by a timer interrupt.

Compare that to a real Emacs process, which is almost always in a
blocking select() system call when idle.

I haven't looked at your source code, or the Graphics implementation,
but I conclude that you need to find a way to block, rather than poll,
for input events.
