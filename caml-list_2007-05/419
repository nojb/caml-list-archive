                    TYPES Summer School 2007

        Proofs of Programs and Formalisation of Mathematics

              August 19-31 2007, Bertinoro, Italy

            http://TypesSummerSchool07.cs.unibo.it

	>>>>>>>	DEADLINE FOR GRANTS: JUNE 4th <<<<<<<< 

During the last ten years major achievements have been made in using
computers for interactive proof developments to produce secure
software and to show interesting mathematical results. Recent major
results are, for instance, the complete formalisation of a proof of
the four colour theorem, and a formalisation of the prime number
theorem.

The summer school is a two weeks course for postgraduate students, 
researchers and industrials who want to learn about interactive proof 
development. The present school follows the format of previous TYPES 
summer school (in Baastad 1993, Giens 1999, Giens 2002 and Goteborg 2005).
There will be introductory and advanced lectures on lambda calculus, type
theory, logical frameworks, program extraction, proof carrying code,
formal topology and models, with relevant theoretical background.
Several talks will be devoted to applications.

During the two weeks, participants will get extensive opportunities to use 
and compare most ot the current tools for the automation of formal reasoning, 
comprising Agda, Coq, Epigram, Matita, Mizar and Isabelle/ Isar.

The school is organised by the TYPES working group "Types for Proofs
and Programs", which is a project in the IST (Information Society
Technologies) program of the European Union. Grants covering part 
of travel, fees and accommodation are available. Neither
participation nor grants are restricted to TYPES participants.

Grants
------
To apply for a grant you are required to send a recommendation letter 
and a CV or a similar short description of yourself. 
All information/documentation concerning grant applications must reach 
us by June 4.
Both the recommendation letter and the CV should be sent to 
typessummerschool@cs.unibo.it. Please use the subject: "grant application". 
The recommendation letter must be sent to us directly by the person that 
writes it. We will confirm by email each CV and recommendation letter we 
receive.
