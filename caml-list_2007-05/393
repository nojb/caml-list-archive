   Hi everyone,

 About six months ago, I sent a mail to this list asking for ideas and
suggestions regarding teaching OCaml. Well, the term is over, except for
a few students who're going to get a second chance at their exams, so I
guess now is the time for a bottom line.

 All in all, I consider this a success. In the following mails, I'll
detail the successes and problems me and my students have met during the
term.

= Program of the term =

* Lectures  (available in French from my webpage).
* Short exercices during lab courses (also available on my page).
* Short homework                     (also available on my page).
* Term-long project on a subject selected by the students.
-- Pacman          (complete success)
-- RSA Cryptography(success, despite ugly code)
-- Connect 4       (mostly success)
-- Sliding puzzle  (complete failure)
-- Sudoku          (complete failure)
-- Another Sudoku  (mostly success)
-- File explorer   (half-success).
* Day-long project on Othello/Reversi. I wrote the complete software,
gave them only the .mli and a pseudo-Makefile and 10 hours to
reimplement the modules of their choice.
-- Rules             (complete success)
-- Graphics-based UI (complete failure)
-- LablTk-based UI   (mostly failure)
-- AI                (mostly failure)
-- Board management  (complete success)
-- Utilities         (complete success)
-- Main program      (complete success).

Cheers,
 David
