Hi everyone,

Here is the first version of the ODT (OCaml Development Tools) project.
It aims to be like the JDT plugins, which is the most famous IDE for
Java applications development into Eclipse... but ODT is not yet so
advanced ;-)

Everything is available on the ODT website: http://ocamldt.free.fr.
The "overview" page explains its current main features, and the 
"install notes" page details some requirements and incompatibilities.
Some screenshots are also available to show the GUI.

Please, don't hesitate to try ODT (for personal or professional use)
and forward this mail to anyone which could be interested in.

Thanks !

Manu
