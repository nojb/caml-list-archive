Subject: Building a toplevel with threads

I'm currently trying to build a toplevel with thread support, but  
somehow the final executable is missing the Thread module. Findlib is  
out of question because dynamic loading is not supported on my  
platform (Intel OS X, OCaml 3.09.3).
So what would be the correct way to build a custom toplevel with  
support for threads? This is what I have so far:

ocamlmktop -thread -custom unix.cma threads.cma -o thtop

which gives:

# Thread.create;;
Unbound value Thread.create

I'm out of ideas.

PS: It seems to me like documentation on threading in ocaml is very  
sparse and somewhat outdated. Or maybe I just missed it?
