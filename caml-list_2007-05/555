Yes, it's easy.

Inside ocamldoc comments, there's various @-tags.  Are there any that
should have special handling (specially formatting what follows them?),
or just highlight them, or highlight the lines they're in?

There also seem to be stop comments.  I might as well highlight those,
but I don't think it's possible (or if possible, worth the complexity)
to try enabling and disabling ocamldoc highlighting in the right places
so that comments that won't appear in the documentation get a different
highlighting.  If someone is really interested, they're more than
welcome to give it a try.

How do you want the contents to look, same as they would outside the
literal, or the same style throughout (like strings)?
