I tried to find a full Lisp (or Scheme) parser in Ocaml, and did not 
immediately find one.  Is my Google-fu not up to the task?

Yes, I am aware that parsing s-expressions is trivial, but the full Lisp 
(or Scheme) grammar is somewhat more complicated, and I do not feel like 
reinventing the wheel.

Any technology that integrates well with Ocaml is fine, since in the end 
in-memory ASTs is going to be what we're really interested in.

Jacques

PS: Other than CIL for C, are there other programming languages for 
which I can just get an off-the-shelf (non-commercial) parser?
