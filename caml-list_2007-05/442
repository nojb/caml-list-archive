OK, so I had some time to kill this morning...

I counted 123 posts from Jon this year so far.  In those, not counting
his .signature (which is, as protocol demands, not more than 4 lines
long), he mentioned his book in 8.  Some of those are replies to posts
that essentially ask for pointers to books.  A few are more blatantly
self-serving, but even so, it doesn't seem excessive to me.
