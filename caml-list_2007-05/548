[This email is an update on recent efforts to get OCaml packages
included in the base Fedora distribution].

(1) Draft packaging guidelines for Fedora OCaml packages are published
here:

  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/OCaml
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=239004

It would be a great help if people could look at these and point out
any problems.  Reports should go (in order of preference) to: that
Bugzilla entry (but you will need to create an account), follow up
here, or email me directly.

(2) I've packaged up some things already:

  http://tinyurl.com/2rl4w6

This list was chosen fairly randomly, in order that I could get some
of my own code to run for testing purposes.  In the long run, I hope
we can package most things, but if you think there are important
packages that should be prioritised, please let me know.

(3) Would your school[*] / company / organisation be more inclined to
buy Red Hat Enterprise Linux licenses if it came with high quality
OCaml packages?  Having packages is nice, but having a business case
behind them is better.  Please mail me if so.

(4) Lastly, if you would like to join or follow the effort, you can
join the SIG here:
