I don't know anything about Smoke, but part of my secret plan behind
my O'Caml Reactive Toolkit project is to allow one to develop a pretty
GUI widget set using OpenGL (or Cairo or what-have-you) and have much
of the GUI functionality (such as layout management) already there.
Whether I get as far as implementing an OpenGL-based widget set in the
nine weeks I'm working with Jane St. Capital remains to be seen (I
sort of doubt it, given the amount of other work I'll have), but I'm
keeping that goal in mind as I design it so the infrastructure to
support it will be there.

(Re OpenGL reentrancy, in O'Caml RT multiple OpenGL contexts are
handled in such a way that they are invisible to the user.)

I've also been considering the possibility of writing the library in
such a way that it also compiles under F#, or compiles with a few
changes, but right now I don't know enough about F# to know whether
that's at all possible (especially since I make use of objects,
polymorphic variants, and private types for software engineering
purposes, and would like to avoid giving them up).
