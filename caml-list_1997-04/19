Subject: [English only, sorry] O'Labl hands off the standard library?
Sender: weis

Hi.  I'm quite intrigued by the polymorphic variant type system
extension in O'Labl and I would like to try it; but I thoroughly
dislike the other parts of O'Labl (labels and optionals).  Is there a
way to apply just parts of the Ocaml -> O'Labl patch to get just the
polymorphic variants and nothing else?  I realize that nothing forces
me to actually _use_ labels and optionals, except --- the standard
library gets labelized!  So, I'd be willing to have the entire compiler
patch applied, if only the library is left alone.  Please?

I fully support the President's proposal to test driver's license
applicants for drugs.  Any plan to reduce driving is worth a try.
