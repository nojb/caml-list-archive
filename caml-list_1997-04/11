Actually, the source is in LaTeX with custom macros.

The source plus all the translators is pretty complex and not too
clean. Besides, we figured that few, if any, users would actually need
the source of the documentation. Also, we'd rather no see modified
versions of the documentation disseminated here and there. But if you
have any legitimate use for the sources, let us (caml-light@inria.fr)
know and we'll work out something.
