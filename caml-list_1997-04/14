On IRIX, the "configure" script adds the "-32" option to the C compiler,
to make sure that the C parts of OCaml use the same ``old-style
32-bit'' calling conventions that the native-code generator uses.
(I develop on a Power Challenger Array, where the default calling
conventions are 64-bit, so it's necessary to override the default.)

It has been reported to me that the IRIX 5.3 C compiler does not
recognize the "-32" option.So, as a quick fix, I just disabled the
native-code compiler under IRIX 5.

You might try to hack the configure script and asmcomp/proc_mips.ml to
enable the native-code compiler for IRIX 5.3 and remove the "-32" option.
If it works, let me know and I'll merge the changes in the source
tree. There is no way I can test this myself, since all SGI machines I
have access to run IRIX 6.
