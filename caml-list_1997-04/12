Subject: Will the ocaml-1.05 native compiler work on IRIX5.3 ?
X-Mailer: VM 6.22 under Emacs 19.34.1

Sender: weis

I noticed that when I configured ocaml-1.05 on my IRIX5.3 system it
would not build the native code compiler, whereas ocaml-1.04 would.

Is it really the case that the native compiler is no longer supported
on IRIX5.3 or is this a bug in the configure script ?
