hi all,

I can't seem to make sense of this type error.  Sorry to air my
dirty laundry but I was hoping I could get some assistance with this
one, as I am stumped.

the code is merely:

(* turn an input channel into a list of strings *)
let string_list_of_chann chann =
  let rec slof_aux (ch: in_channel) (l: string list) = 
    try
      let readstr = input_line ch in
      slof_aux ch readstr::l
    with End_of_file -> l
  in slof_aux chann []

and the error is:

File "query.ml", line 11, characters 19-155:
This expression has type in_channel -> string list -> string list
but is here used with type in_channel -> string -> string
make: *** [all] Error 2


Is this a problem with relying on an exception to type a function?

thanks,
Lyn
