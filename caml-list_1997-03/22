  I don't know if you were using the lexing or parsing facilities, but you
should be aware that, although the data tables and peripheral utilities or in
O'Caml, the engines are actually written in C and are part of the run-time
system, so they are very fast, even as bytecode.  Also, I am pretty sure that
the Regexp library is based on GNU regexp, so it is also probably mostly
wrappers for C functions.
