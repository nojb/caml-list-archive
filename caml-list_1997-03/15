Subject: Objective Label Trilogy, version 1.04
Sender: weis

This is our pleasure to announce

	      The Objective Label Trilogy, version 1.04

		Objective Label / LablTk / LablBrowser


Objective Label is an extension of Objective Caml with labeled and
optional arguments, and polymorphic variants.

LablTk uses these extensions to provide an almost type safe interface
to Tcl/Tk, such that you can write application in a style very close
to Tk.

LablBrowser is a programming environment, allowing one to browse code,
both source and compiled, and navigate through it on the basis of
types and compiled interfaces. It also includes an editor, and a
language shell.

The combination of these three elements is a system

  * easy to program, thanks to the libraries and tools

  * producing more readable programs, thanks to labels

  * allowing preciser and lighter typing, thanks to variants


The port is complete: all the functionality and tools of Objective
Caml is available.

It is source compatible with O'Caml: any program or library written in 
O'Caml can be compiled without modification, and you may even add
labels to interfaces to your taste.


This release should work on any Unix/X windows based system, producing 
native code on architectures supported by Objective Caml.

It may also work on Windows NT, but this is not supported at this
time. A binary version, centered on LablBrowser, should be available
soon for Windows systems.


Changed from 1.03:

This release was a little bit late, because there were many changes to 
merge on both sides.

O'Labl:

* easier to install: no need to bootstrap.

* variant syntax is extended (types and matching), and they are now
  fully recursive. Powerful subtyping mechanism, similar to objects

* they are better compiled (optimized match compiler, and profits from
  the changes in the native code compiler)

* updated the manual :-)

LablTk41:

* now based on OCamlTk41. You will need Tcl/Tk 7.5/4.1 or 7.6/4.2.

* corrected some strange definitions

LablBrowser:

* changed completely the layout of the browser, which should be much
  easier to use

* many new browsing and navigation functions: you may now jump from
  interfaces to source code, etc...

* added a shell to run a toplevel
