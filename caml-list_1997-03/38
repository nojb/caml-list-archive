The recently released version 1.04 of Objective Caml contains a few
embarassing bugs, in particular in the type-checker and in the
native-code compiler.

A bug-fix release, version 1.05, is now available at the usual place:

        ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light

as complete sources, source diffs from 1.04, and Win32 binaries.
The list of changes is included below.

Several users have reported difficulties compiling Objective Caml with
gcc 2.7.2.1 on Intel platforms, e.g. Linux RedHat 4.1. We confirm this
is a gcc 2.7.2.1 bug, which generates amazingly wrong code on the
bytecode interpreter. The solution is to either downgrade to 2.7.2 or
upgrade to 2.7.2.2 -- both versions work all right.

Objective Caml 1.05:
--------------------

* Typing: fixed bugs causing spurious type errors.

* Native-code compiler: fixed instruction selection bug causing GC to
see ill-formed pointers; fixed callbacks to support invocation from a
main program in C.

* Standard library: fixed String.lowercase; Weak no longer crash on integers.

* Toplevel: multiple phrases without intermediate ";;" now really supported;
fixed value printing problems where the wrong printer was selected.

* Debugger: fixed printing problem with local references; revised
handling of checkpoints; various other small fixes.

* Macintosh port: fixed signed division problem in bytecomp/emitcode.ml
