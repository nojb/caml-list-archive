Subject: [Caml-list] [job offer] Post-doc/Software Engineer at OCamlPro


OCamlPro is a French company devoted to the promotion of the OCaml
language in the industry, as a way to make industrial software more
reliable. OCamlPro participates to the development of OCaml, and
develops its own tools and libraries, such as OPAM, ocp-build,
Typerex, etc. to facilitate the use of OCaml in big software
projects. OCamlPro is located in the Alan Turing building of INRIA
Saclay, at Ecole Polytechnique, south-west of Paris.

We are currently involved in the "Richelieu" project, a collaborative
R&D project to develop an LLVM-based optimizing JIT compiler for the
Scilab software, an open-source Matlab equivalent, in association with
INRIA, Scilab Enterprise and Univ Paris 6 (Lip6).

As part of this project, the French government is funding a two-year
R&D position at OCamlPro. For this position, we are looking for an
OCaml expert, with background in typing, software analysis and/or
compilation. The engineer will have to work in close collaboration
with other teams involved in the project, especially at INRIA, but
also in Scilab Enterprise and LIP6 (VMKit team).

Although this particular offer focuses on the Richelieu project, the
engineer will have the opportunity on the long term to work on other
projects in which OCamlPro is involved: improving the OCaml compiler,
developing new development tools for OCaml and helping OCamlPro
customers in their daily use of OCaml.

Please email your resume or C.V. and a description of some of your
best accomplishments to: contact@ocamlpro.com
