yes, the intention is always go integrate with ocaml.org. Maybe we can
sort out the problem of submitting changes programaticaly, i.e. repo
with tools that simplify the whole process.
The bottleneck I see that the changes needs to be "formally approved"
- the git repo merged, where it takes a bit more time and shifts the
responsibiltiy to another person.
I can see advantage of that but then doing small changes is more difficult.

the same theme and nice search box would be enough?

My answer would be as lightweight as possible, oddmuse is perl,
mediawiki is php.
Also these are wiki engines, so we probably don't need to hack on it.
They are fairly robust too.
So no need to worry that we need to get dirty with php :)
I also think ocsigen with ocsimore would be cool to have at some
point, it's a big deal for any language to have self hosting webserver
with dynamic pages.

We could have at least a static webpage generator like Stog, and keep
the content in the markup that can be pushed to ocaml.org.
It would be then easier to write any content and diff it.

Thanks,
