Subject: Re: [Caml-list] An easy tutorial to js_of_ocaml?

When I click "Reset" in the toplevel, the changes that were made to
the webpage are not reverted (I still see the moving square). This is
not what I would expect; I understand reverting this perfectly is
probably not easy or even possible, but some form of rollbacks that
allows to revert to a clean state if we didn't do anything really
crazy would be appreciated.
