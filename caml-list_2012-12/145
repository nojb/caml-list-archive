Check ocaml.org, there are tutorials, references, and book suggestions. I
bootstrapped myself with a tutorial, then read through language spec. Ocaml
is thankfully not a complicated language to get productive with.

Hello!<br>
<br>
Some years ago I was looking for adequate language for one open-source<br>
project to be done in free time and although I took a look at OCaml,<br>
somehow, I didn&#39;t like syntax and went playing with Haskell.<br>
<br>
Never really grokked monads and had feeling that despite nice syntax,<br>
some things are more complicated for pragmatic programming than they<br>
should be.<br>
<br>
I managed to scare enough few potential contributors and had to<br>
postpone the project for &#39;sometime in the future&#39;.<br>
<br>
Later, I was exploring D (v2), but it seems that the language is never<br>
finished, code breaks often from one version to another, poor GUI<br>
bindings support etc.<br>
<br>
Shortly thought about using Python+Cython, but dynamic language never<br>
sounded right for my project.<br>
<br>
In utter despair I went to evaluate Ada which seems as nice (a bit<br>
verbose) language, mature, actively developed, good ecosystem, but<br>
somehow I was missing lack of FP features.<br>
<br>
For a short time I took a look at Nimrod - nice &amp; interesting language,=
<br>
but very small community and lack of FP features.<br>
<br>
Then, I do not know exactly how, I got inspired to take a look at OCaml<br>
and in a very short time, I could see that there is a language with<br>
quite OK syntax, actively developed, not small community enabling me to<br>
use FP language with thinking too much about monads and category theory<br>
in order to do practical things.<br>
<br>
The remaining thing is to get hints how to proceed, iow.:<br>
<br>
a) Real World Ocaml is going to be released in Oct 2013, so I wonder is<br>
there any online/paperback book you can recommend? I&#39;m on Debian wheezy=
<br>
which means no 4.0 yet, but probably we&#39;ll try to take advantage of new=
<br>
features in due course of time<br>
<br>
b) it looks that Emacs is the best-supported editor for OCaml. How is<br>
support in Vim/Geany? What do you recommend?<br>
<br>
Now I wonder about Typerex which looks cool, but I was told on #ocaml<br>
that it&#39;s &quot;dead project&quot; and was recommended to use tuareg mo=
de?<br>
<br>
That&#39;s actually everything or most important...editor &amp; good book t=
o<br>
start with?<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Gour<br>
