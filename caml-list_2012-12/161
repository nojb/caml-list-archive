==================================================
2nd International Workshop on
Engineering Safety and Security Systems
March 18, 2013, Luxembourg
Co-located with ICST 2013 in Luxembourg, March 18-22, 2013

More information:
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/esss2013/
===================================================

Important dates
-----------------
* January 6th 2013: Submission deadline (extended)
* February 11th 2013: Notification of acceptance/rejection (extended)
* March 18th 2013: Workshop


Introduction of the Workshop
-----------------
The International Workshop on Engineering Safety and Security Systems
(ESSS) aims at contributing to the challenge of constructing reliable
and secure systems. The workshop covers areas such as formal
specification, (extended) type checking, model checking, program
analysis/transformation, model-based testing and model-driven software
construction. The workshop will bring together researchers and
industry R&D expertise together to exchange their knowledge, discuss
their research findings, and explore potential collaborations.


Theme of the Workshop
-----------------
The main theme of the workshop is methods and techniques for
constructing large reliable and secure systems. The goal of the
workshop is to establish a platform for the exchange of ideas,
discussion, cross-fertilization, inspiration, co-operation, and
dissemination. The topics of the workshop include, but are not
limited to:

-- methods, techniques and tools for system safety and security
-- methods, techniques and tools for analysis, certification, and
   debugging of complex safety and security systems
-- model-based and verification-based testing
-- emerging application domains such as cloud computing and
   cyber-physical systems
-- case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods
   for analyzing safety and security systems


Submissions guidelines
-----------------
Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Submissions
should be in made via the Easychair site:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esss2013.

Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style
of the IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Format (see
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html
).
Papers should not exceed 6 pages for full papers and 2 pages for short
papers, including figures, references, and appendices. All submissions
should be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the specified
format and length may be rejected immediately, without review.

All workshop papers will be published in the IEEE Digital Library in
the form of a post-proceedings. A pre-workshop version of the papers
will be available on the workshop website prior. Publication of
accepted articles requires the commitment of one of the authors to
register for the workshop and present the paper.
