The Caml mailing-list is not a social network to make friends and (+1)
other comments to confirm your agreement.

When I first read your question, I decided to answer it by pointing
you to an answer to a similar question on StackOverflow:
  http://stackoverflow.com/a/9358776/298143

I noticed that the ocaml.org page you were pointed to had much of the
same content (minus the subjective comments), and was therefore an
excellent reference. What need would there be to answer you if you are
already given a good list placed on an authoritative *and*
community-handled website? On the contrary, if people have something
to add, they would do more good submitting a patch to improve the
website rather than answering your question here and now, that will
end up lost in the mailing-list archives.

I'll be happy to answer your technical questions when you have some.
But please, a mailing list is not there to organize popularity
contests.
