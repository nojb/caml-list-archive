I usually use the following naming conventions when releasing open
source libraries: if it is derived from some other (usually C-)
library, e.g. "pcre", then I add the suffix "-ocaml" to the
distribution file name to avoid confusing binary packagers.  I would
then release e.g. "pcre-ocaml-3.42.tar.gz".  If the library is not
derived from anything else, then the findlib name will be used to name
the distribution.  Findlib names should never have an "ocaml" suffix
or prefix, because it's clear that a findlib package is for OCaml
only.  Since OPAM is an OCaml tool, I'd suggest dropping the "ocaml"
suffixes or prefixes from its package names, too.

That's a good question, which essentially boils down to how package
developers should specify configuring, building, installing, and
uninstalling packages.  I guess it would be healthy in the long term
to settle on a commonly used specification, possibly the Oasis format.
 One could then agree to always just call "configure" and "make" in
standardized ways under the assumption that these will behave as if
these scripts had been generated by Oasis (whether or not this is
actually the case).

I think findlib should be standard and implied as a dependency.  I
don't think people would be happy if forced to use libraries that
don't install with findlib.
