Indeed, but then dependent packages needs to be up-dated too!
We could have also virtual packages that could serve as a basis for
aliases when there is a strong reason to be compatible.
The good thing is that OPAM package definitions are detached from the
tarballs itself, so it's easy to up-date in a centralised way.

Hmm, wouldn't be just better for OPAM to track the diff of the
repository, then just remove the files?
Possibly, having an open door for unnistall would be good for packages
like Ocsigen which might want to remove the configuration from the
system or shutdown the server.

+1.

I'm also always convinced that ocamlfind should be taken into account
as an integral part of the system.
