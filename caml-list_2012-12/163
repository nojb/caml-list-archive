                           Aims and scope

Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions
to practical  issues.  Computing with graphs   handles the sharing  of
common subexpressions in a natural and seamless  way, and improves the
efficiency of  computations in space  and time.  Sharing is ubiquitous
in several research areas, for instance : the  modelling of first- and
higher-order  term rewriting by (acyclic  or  cyclic) graph rewriting,
the  modelling   of biological  or  chemical  abstract machines, the
implementation      techniques    of   programming languages: many
implementations of functional,  logic, object-oriented, concurrent and
mobile calculi are based on term graphs.  Term graphs are also used in
automated theorem proving and  symbolic computation systems working on
shared structures.

The aim of this workshop  is to bring  together researchers working in
different domains on term and graph transformation and to foster their
interaction, to provide a forum  for presenting new ideas and work in
progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in
term graph rewriting.

TERMGRAPH  2013  is   a   one-day satellite    event  of ETAPS   2013
<http://www.etaps.org/>, which  will take place  in Rome, Italy, from
March 16 to  March  24, 2013.   Previous   editions of the TERMGRAPH
workshop series    (http://www.termgraph.org.uk/) took place   in
Barcelona (2002), in Rome (2004), in Vienna (2006), in Braga (2007) in
York (2009) and in Saarbrücken (2011).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Topics of Interest

Topics of interest are open and include all aspects of term graphs and
sharing of common subexpressions  in rewriting, programming, automated
reasoning and symbolic computation. This  includes (but is not limited
to): term rewriting, graph transformation, graph-based implementations
of lambda-calculus, programming  languages, models of computation,
graph-based languages, semantics   and implementation  of programming
languages, compiler   construction,  pattern recognition, databases,
bioinformatics, and system descriptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Submissions and Publication

Authors are invited to submit either regular papers  (up to 15 pages),
or  position papers, system  descriptions, work  in progress, extended
abstracts (5-7 pages), via the EasyChair system, at URL

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=termgraph2013

Submissions should be   in PDF format,   using the EPTCS   style files
(http://style.eptcs.org/). The  Proceedings   will be published  in
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).
