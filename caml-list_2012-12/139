I can change this sentence if it scares you ;) Actually Ocsimore has been used 
for years at PPS without any problem. Every member of the laboratory has its 
own wiki for his personal pages and people like it. 
The part that is still not really user friendly is the administration 
interface. But a lot of work has been done in the past few months by the new 
maintainer Jacques-Pascal Deplaix and he plans to improve a few more things 
during the next weeks. I just don't want to call 1.0 something that is too 
difficult to install or that is badly documented.

I understand that you would prefer a wiki that is used on more than 2 Web 
sites, and that has commercial suport (or at least a large community) and I 
won't blame you for doing that choice. But Ocsimore is not going to die 
(because it's part of the Ocsigen project). And using Ocsimore on ocaml.org 
would be a good opportunity to support an OCaml project (may be OCaml Labs or 
the consortium could help if you need new features?). It would also be easier 
to find contributors amongst OCaml developers for creating customized 
extensions you may need ...

Why not giving it a try? We can install and configure it if you want.

Vincent
