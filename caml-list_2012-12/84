Subject: [Caml-list] integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2013): Last Call for
 Papers

LAST CALL FOR PAPERS

**********************************************************************
10th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2013)

June 10 - 14, 2013 - Turku, Finland
http://www.it.abo.fi/iFM2013/

**********************************************************************

IMPORTANT DATES
- Abstract Submission: January 10, 2013
- Paper submission: January 17, 2013
- Paper notification: March 11, 2013
- Final version paper: March 31, 2013


OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
Applying formal methods may involve modeling different aspects of a
system which are best expressed using different formalisms.
Correspondingly, different analysis techniques may be used to examine
different system views, different kinds of properties, or simply in
order to cope with the sheer complexity of the system.  The iFM
conference series seeks to further research into hybrid approaches to
formal modeling and analysis; i.e., the combination of (formal and
semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding modeling and
analysis, and covering all aspects from language design through
verification and analysis techniques to tools and their integration
into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
- Formal and semiformal modelling notations;=20
- Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice;=20
- Refinement;=20
- Theorem proving;=20
- Tools;=20
- Logics;=20
- Model checking;=20
- Model transformations;=20
- Semantics;=20
- Static Analysis;=20
- Type Systems;=20
- Verification;
- Case Studies;=20
- Experience reports=20

SPECIAL ISSUES
To celebrate the 10th edition of iFM, there will be special issues of
the Springer journals

- Formal Aspects of Computing=20
- Software and Systems Modeling=20

The best papers from iFM 2013 will be invited for these special
issues, complemented by an open call for papers, and undergo a
separate peer-review process according to the usual scientific
standards of these journals.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
iFM 2013 solicits high quality papers reporting research results
and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of method
integration.   The conference proceedings will be published in
Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All submissions
must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS
style files; we suggest to use the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls
class file, available in llncs2e.zip  and the typeinst.dem available
in typeinst.zip as a template for your contribution). Papers should
not exceed 15 pages in length.  Each paper will undergo a thorough
review process.  Submissions should be made using the iFM 2013
Easychair web site:

https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=3Difm2013

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors
must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one
author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the
early date, to be indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.
