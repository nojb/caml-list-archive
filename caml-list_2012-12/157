That was me being unusually grumpy, sorry.

Pick any of the first two books mentioned on ocaml.org (Introduction
to OCaml, Developping Applications with OCaml); the one that inspires
you best.

My first hand experience with the latter is that it's good, but
sometimes requires a bit thinking / independent work to digest, and my
second hand experience with the former is that it's also good. You
only read a beginner book from top to bottom once.

If you have suggestions for content that could be added or changed on
ocaml.org, for example to answer your question better, they are warmly
welcome. One can even directly send patches to
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org .
