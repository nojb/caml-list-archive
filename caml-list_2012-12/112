Of course you can do good stuff with a wiki! I was not arguing that a wiki
is not an adequate medium to build a website, but rather that we should not
duplicate our efforts. I think building a site of good quality and well
organised is a lot of work *whatever* the technology you're relying on (not
to mention, the time to get it accepted) The site ocaml.org is built with
templated HTML and stored on github, this is one possible technical choice
where contributions are easy to make if the procedure is documented
properly. Right now I see no compelling argument to start a wiki, and just
argued that we should first focus on the website. Maybe after some time
(and hopefully many contributions :o)!), it will become evident that we
need something else (maybe a wiki), but right now I find it risky to split
our efforts in several community projects. Sorry if my previous message was
not clear, and thanks for the pointer to the guidelines!

(not to mention that you have to know HTML basics). But with a proper docum=
