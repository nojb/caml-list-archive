For what it's worth, my opinion is also that we should focus our efforts on
the website, especially now that we have something that we can be proud of
(kudos to all those behind ocaml.org). As the development of the website
showed very well, it takes a really high amount of time and tenacious work
to do something useful *and* acknowledged. I think there is a limited
man-power in the community to advertise and document our favorite language,
let's not split it up but rather pour it into a single, high-quality and
carefully reviewed contents. I feel the best achievement of ocaml.org is to
exist as a central place where to add ocaml material, improving the
readability of ocaml as a whole, and the visibility of ocaml projects.
Pushing to a git repo is more difficult than adding stuff on a wiki, but we
nerds don't really care about that, right ;o)?

So yes, the only benefit I see for the wiki is to lower the barrier for
contributions. It is true (I tried this morning) that it is not
straightforward to contribute to the site for those who do not use opam and
git everyday (not to mention that you have to know HTML basics). But with a
proper documentation, using git to contribute the website is not so
difficult, and has lots of (editorial) benefits. Plus that way we help
people to learn those anyway useful technologies. Unless someone wants to
write it, I can have a try at writing a page "Contributing to ocaml.org" (I
couldn't see such a page on the website).
