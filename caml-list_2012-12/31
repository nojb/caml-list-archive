CiE13 CALL FOR PAPERS AND SPECIAL AWARDS:

                  CiE 2013: The Nature of Computation:
                     Logic, Algorithms, Applications

                              Milan, Italy

                           July  1 - 5, 2013

                     http://cie2013.disco.unimib.it

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission Deadline for LNCS:                   20 January 2013
Notification of authors:                        4 March 2013
Deadline for final revisions:                   1 April 2013


CiE 2013 is the ninth conference organised by CiE (Computability in
Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer
scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in new
developments in computability and their underlying significance for the
real world. Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005),
Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponte
Dalgada (2010), Sofia (2011) and Cambridge (2012).

The Nature of Computation is meant to emphasize the special focus of CIE13
on the unexpected and strong changes that studies on Nature have
brought in several areas of mathematics, biology, physics, and computer 
science. Starting from Alan Turing, research on Nature with a 
computational perspective has produced novel contributions, giving 
rise even to new disciplines.

AWARDS:

Springer-Verlag has graciously funded two awards that will be given during
the CiE 2013 Conference.

Best student paper:

This prize will be awarded for the best student paper presented at CiE
2013, as judged by the Program Committee. A prize of 500 euros will be
given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split
between more than one paper if there is a tie). In order to be considered,
a paper has to be submitted in the category 'Regular paper (eligible for
best student paper award)' on EasyChair. Papers are eligible if all of its
authors are full-time students at the time of submission.


Best paper on Natural Computing:

The prize consists of the  four volumes of the Handbook of Natural
Computing (see http://cie2013.disco.unimib.it/awards/).
This prize will be awarded to the best paper on Natural Computing
presented at CiE 2013, as judged by the Program Committee.
A paper is eligible if its main topic falls within the scope of Natural
Computing, roughly defined as the set of fields studied in the above
handbook. The Program Committee is the only judge of the  relevance  of a
paper within the Natural Computing scope. The authors of a paper eligible
for the award must indicate this in the submission notes.
