PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT
_______________________________________________________________________________________________

AIM AND SCOPE
Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European 
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL).
The conference is intended for computer scientists whose research 
activities involve logic, as well as for logicians working on
issues significant for computer science.

LOCATION
The 22nd EACSL Annual Conferences on Computer Science Logic will be held 
at Museo di Scienze Naturali in Torino from
Monday 2nd through Thursday 5th of September 2013.

LIST OF TOPICS OF INTEREST (NON EXHAUSTIVE)
automated deduction and interactive theorem proving, constructive 
mathematics and type theory, equational logic and term rewriting,
automata and games, game semantics, modal and temporal logic, model 
checking, decision procedures, logical aspects of computational
complexity, computational proof theory, bounded arithmetic and 
propositional proof complexity, logic programming and constraints, lambda
calculus and combinatory logic, domain theory, categorical logic and 
topological semantics, database theory, specification, extraction and
transformation of programs, logical aspects of quantum computing, 
logical foundations of programming paradigms, verification and program
analysis, linear logic,
higher-order logic, non-monotonic reasoning.
IMPORTANT DATES
Abstract submission: April, 1st 2013
Paper Submission: April, 8th 2013
Paper Notification: June, 10th 2013
Paper final version: July, 1st 2013
Conference: September, 2nd --- 5th 2013

SUBMISSION
Authors are invited to submit papers of not more than 15 pages in LIPIcs 
style presenting work not previously published.
Papers are to be submitted through Easychair. Submitted papers must be 
in English and must provide sufficient detail to allow the PC to assess
the merits of the paper. Full proofs may appear in a technical appendix 
which will be read at the reviewers' discretion. Authors are strongly
encouraged to include a well written introduction which is directed at 
all members
of the program committee.
The submission is in two stages. Abstract submissions are due before 
April 1st, 2013. Full paper submissions must be done before April 8th, 
2013.
Papers must not be submitted concurrently to another conference with 
refereed proceedings. The PC chair should be informed of closely related
work submitted to a conference or a journal by March 24th, 2013. Papers 
authored or co-authored by members of the Programme Committee are not 
allowed.

SATELLITE EVENTS
The 14th International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity 
(LCC'13) will be held on 6th of September 2013 as a satellite event of 
CSL'13.
An international summer school on “Linear logic and related topics” will 
be held from 28th through 31st of August 2013 as a satellite event of 
CSL'13.
Further details will appear on this page as soon as possible.
