Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Workshops: Conf. Intelligent Computer
 Mathematics (CICM 2013)

      CICM 2013 - Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
	    July 8-12, 2012 at the University of Bath, UK
		 http://www.cicm-conference.org/2013  

		     Call for Workshop Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater
opportunities  arise for  intelligent mathematical  computation. While
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we  are now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these
areas.

Workshop proposals for CICM  2013 are solicited. Both well-established
workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.

Please provide the following information:
 
   + Workshop title.
   + Names and affiliations of organizers.
   + Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.
   + Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).
   + If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference 
     affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, 
     please indicate so.

CICM  conference fees  will  be levied  on a  per-day  basis, so  that
workshop-only participation  is possible. The CICM  organizers plan to
make available a small amount towards partial reimbursement for travel
expenses of invited speakers. Also, CICM will take care of copying and
distributing  informal printed  proceedings for  workshops that  would
like this service, as well  as permanently archived open access online
proceedings with CEUR-WS.org.

All proposals should be sent via email to
               cicm-organizers@jacobs-university.de 
for consideration by the CICM 2013 organizers:

James Davenport (University of Bath, UK): Conference Chair
Jacques Carette (McMaster University, Canada): Program Chair
David Aspinall (University of Edinburgh, Scotland): MKM Track Chair
Christoph Lange (Univ of Birmingham, UK): System & Projects Track Chair
Petr Sojka (Masaryk University, CZ): DML Track Chair
Wolfgang Windsteiger (RISC, Austria): Calculemus Track Chair

Important dates:
  Deadline for proposal submissions:		       January 28, 2013
  Acceptance/rejection notification:		       February 8, 2013
  Workshop dates:					July 8-12, 2013
