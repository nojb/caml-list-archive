Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml wiki

Personally, I've got mixed feelings about wikis from experience with
previous projects, since they get out of date very rapidly indeed. They
do work well if someone's maintaining it, but if that's the case, why
not just push these tips and guides to the existing ocaml.org site?

I'm happy to run a wiki on the OCL infrastructure, but would strongly
prefer contributions to the ocaml.org Git repo with all this good stuff
instead!  If it really turns out we need a swanky wiki, that can be arranged
later...
