Subject: [Caml-list] SCP Special Issue on Invariant Generation - Second Call
 for Papers [2 months to go]

(Apologies if you receive multiple copies of this announcement)
------------------------------------------------------------
Science of Computer Programming
Special Issue on Invariant Generation
-- SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS --=20
------------------------------------------------------------

This special issue is devoted to the 4th international Workshop on
Invariant Generation (WING 2012)

http://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/wing2012/

which was held on June 30 2012 in Manchester as a satellite event of
IJCAR 2012. The scope of the workshop is the automation of extracting
and synthesising auxiliary properties of programs, in particular
providing, debugging, and verifying auxiliary invariant annotations.
This should be seen in a broad sense and relevant topics include (but
are not limited to) the following:

* Program analysis and verification
* Inductive assertion generation
* Inductive proofs for reasoning about loops
* Applications to assertion generation using:
- abstract interpretation,
- static analysis,
- model checking,
- theorem proving,
- theory formation,
- algebraic techniques
* Tools for inductive assertion generation and verification
* Alternative techniques for reasoning about loops

Submission to this special issue is completely open. We expect
original articles (typically not more than 30 pages) that present
high-quality contributions and must not be simultaneously submitted
for publication elsewhere. Submission of extended versions of
previously published papers is possible as long as the extension is
significant, i.e., the submission can be considered a new paper, the
previous paper is referenced, and the new material is clearly marked.

Submissions must comply with SCP's author guidelines

http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505623/authori=
nstructions

and be written in English. Submission is over the SCP website:

http://ees.elsevier.com/scico/default.asp

which you will have to register for if you do not have an account.
When submitting your paper please choose the article type "Special issue: W=
ING 2012".
