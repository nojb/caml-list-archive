Subject: [Caml-list] ocaml.org infrastructure list available

The ocaml.org machine infrastructure has been settling into place, and http=
://lists.ocaml.org is now available.

This runs GNU Mailman, and has a single "infrastructure" list at the moment=
. This list is where we can discuss setting up the other services such as t=
he continuous build regression testing and website, and integrating other s=
ervices such as .

If you are interested in helping out or simply following activities, please=
 join:
http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure

The server will be hosting more lists in the near future, which I will anno=
unce here. If you have a list you'd like to move to this server for your pr=
oject, please get in touch.  We can create private lists also if needed, al=
though publicly archived ones are preferred.

The look and feel of the lists installation is quite barebones at the momen=
t.  We'll improve the integration with www.ocaml.org once the rest is up an=
d running smoothly.
