programming. Contributions are sought in all areas of logic
programming including but not restricted to:

Theory: Semantic Foundations, Formalisms, Non- monotonic Reasoning,
      Knowledge Representation.

Implementation: Compilation, Virtual Machines, Parallelism.

Environments: Program Analysis, Transformation, Validation,
      Verification, Debugging, Pro- filing, Testing.

Language Issues: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher
      Order, Types, Modes, Assertions, Programming Techniques.

Related Paradigms: Inductive Logic Programming, Constraint Logic
      Programming, Answer- Set Programming, SAT-Checking

Applications: Databases, Data Integration and Federation, Software
      Engineering, Natural Language Processing, Web and Semantic Web,
      Agents, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinfor- matics.

In addition to the presentations of accepted papers, the technical
program will include invited talks, advanced tutorials, the doctoral
consortium, and several workshops.


SUBMISSION DETAILS

The four broad categories for submissions are as follows. Regular
papers, including: (1) tech- nical papers for describing technically
sound, innovative ideas that can advance the state of logic
programming; (2) application papers, where the emphasis will be on
their impact on the application domain; (3) system and tool papers,
where the emphasis will be on the novelty, practicality, usability and
availability of the systems and tools described.  Technical commu-
nications (4) aimed at describing recent developments, new projects,
and other materials that are not ready for publication as standard
papers.  All papers and technical communications will be presented
during the conference.  

All submissions must describe original, previously unpublished
research, and must not si- multaneously be submitted for publication
elsewhere. They must be written in English. Tech- nical papers,
application papers, and system and tool papers must not exceed 12
pages plus bibliography: however a new condensed TPLP format may be
used and the papers may include appendices beyond 12 pages. The limit
for technical communications is 10 pages. Submissions must be made in
the condensed TPLP format (http://www.iclp2013.org) via the Easychair
submission system, available at

   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp2013

PAPER PUBLICATION

All accepted papers will be published in the journal Theory and
Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge University Press
(CUP), in one or more special issues. In order to ensure the quality
of the final version, papers may be subject to more than one round of
refereeing (within the decision period). Accepted technical
communications will be published in the on- line abstract of the
special issue(s).  The program committee may also recommend standard
papers to be published as technical communications.

At the time of the conference CUP will make the web page for this(ese)
TPLP issue(s) available including volume and issue numbers, table of
contents, page numbers, and the papers themselves. All registered
attendants at the conference will get a password for on-line access to
this web page during the conference and indefinitely from then on
("lifetime access"), which can be used to read papers on line,
download them, or print them for personal use. Attendants will also
receive all the papers in a memory stick at the conference.

SPONSOR

The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming
(ALP).


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

The Association for Logic Programming has funds to assist financially
disadvantaged participants and, specially, students in order to be
able to attend the conference.


WORKSHOPS

The ICLP 2013 program will include several workshops, held before and
after the main confer- ence. They are perhaps the best places for the
presentation of preliminary work, undeveloped novel ideas, and new
open problems to a wide and interested audience with opportunities for
intensive discussions and project collaboration.


DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

The 8th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides
research students with the opportunity to present and discuss their
research directions, and to obtain feedback from both peers and
world-renown experts in the field. Accepted participants will receive
partial financial support to attend the event and the main conference.
The best paper and presentation from the DC will be given the
opportunity to present in a special session of the main ICLP
conference.

CONFERENCE VENUE

Istanbul is a city of unparalleled social and cultural richness.
Serving as the capital of two mighty empires for sixteen centuries,
Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) and Ottoman, and set squarely between two
continents, Istanbul has cultures and traditions that blend East with
West and Mediterranean with Anatolian.  Each civilization that has
made Istanbul its home has left its mark in sublime and splendid ways,
and the result a city that gives one the feeling of universal history
at every step.

Istanbul has always been a meeting place, a crosspoint and a
destination. With the Ataturk Istanbul International Airport, getting
to and from Istanbul has never been easier.  With a capacity of far
over 25 million travelers per year Istanbul is less than a three-hour
flight from most European cities.  Istanbul has a second airport
located on the Asian side of the city, Sabiha Gokcen International
Airport, which is an important arrival point especially for low- cost
airlines. Overall, Istanbul is served by more than 50 major airlines
to hundreds of cities around the world.
