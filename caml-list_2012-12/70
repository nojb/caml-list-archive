FORMAT OF THE CONFERENCE

The conference program will include presentation of invited papers, oral
presentations, and poster/demonstration sessions. Papers will be
presented in plenary or topic oriented sessions.One day of the  conference
will be dedicated to tutorials and workshops.  

Social events including a trip in the vicinity of Pilsen will allow
additional informal interactions. Details about the social event will be
available on the web page.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages formatted
in the LNCS style (see below). Those accepted will be presented either
orally or as posters. The decision on the presentation format will be
based upon the recommendation of three independent reviewers. The authors
are asked to submit their papers using the on-line submission form
accessible from the conference web site.

Papers submitted to TSD 2013 must not be under review by any other
conference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be
previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.

As the reviewing is blind, the paper should not include authors'
name and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that
reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991)
...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations, such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...". Papers that do not conform to the requirements
above are determined to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX (plain)
or LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final versions of
the papers that will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes. Authors
using a MS Word-compatible software for the final version must use the
LNCS template for MS Word and within the submit process ask the
Proceedings Editors to convert the paper to the LaTeX format. For this
service a service-and-license fee of CZK 1500 will be levied
automatically.

The paper format for the review has to be either the PDF or PostScript
file with all required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance,
speakers will receive further information on submitting their camera-ready
and electronic sources (for detailed instructions on the final paper
format see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).

Authors are also invited to present actual projects, a developed software
or interesting materials relevant to the topics of the conference.
Speakers who have prepared a demonstration should provide an abstract not
exceeding one page. The demonstration abstracts will not appear in the
conference proceedings.

full registration fee. In the case of uncertainty, feel free to contact
the organising committee for clarification. As in previous years, we will
do our best to ensure grants for the prospective TSD participants from
economically less powerful countries, especially the countries of the
former Soviet Union and its satellites. By now we are negotiating with our
partner supporting organisations about the form and amount of the grants.


LOCATION

The city of Plzen (Pilsen) is situated in Western Bohemia at the
confluence of four rivers. With its 170,000 inhabitants it is the fourth
largest city in the Czech Republic and an important industrial,
commercial, and administrative centre. It is also the capital of the
Pilsen Region. In addition, it has been selected as the European capital
of culture for 2015 by the Council of the European Union.

Pilsen is well-known for its brewing tradition. The trademark
Pilsner-Urquell has a good reputation all over the world thanks to the
traditional recipe, high quality hops and good groundwater. Beer lovers
will also appreciate a visit to the Brewery Museum or the Brewery itself.

Apart from its delicious beer, Pilsen hides lots of treasures in its core.
The city can boast the second largest synagogue in Europe. The dominant of
the old part of the city center is definitely the 13th-century Gothic
cathedral featuring the highest tower in Bohemia (102.34 m). It is
possible to go up  and admire the view of the city. Not far from the
cathedral is the splendid Renaissance Town Hall from 1558 and plenty of
pleasant cafes and pubs are situated on and around the main square.

There is also the beautiful Pilsen Historical Underground - under the city
center, a complex network of passageways and cellars can be found. They
are about 14 km long and visitors can see the most beautiful part of this
labyrinth during the tour. It is recommended to visit the City Zoological
Garden, having the second largest space for bears in Europe and keeping
several Komodo dragons, large lizards which exist only in a few zoos in
the world.

The University of West Bohemia in Pilsen provides a variety of courses for
both Czech and international students. It is the only institution of
higher education in this part of the country which prepares students for
careers in engineering (electrical and mechanical), science (computer
science, applied mathematics, physics, and mechanics), education (both
primary and secondary), economics, philosophy, politics, archeology,
anthropology, foreign languages, law and public administration, art and
design.

GETTING THERE

The city has access from the D5 motorway connecting Prague (Praha) with
Germany. Pilsen has very good bus and train connections with the capital
of Prague (it takes about 1 - 1.5 hour to get from Prague to Pilsen).
>From Vaclav Havel Airport Prague (PRG) you can reach Pilsen by frequent
public transport in 1.5 - 2 hours.

ACCOMMODATION

The organising committee has arranged accommodation for reasonable prices
in the angelo Hotel Pilsen, which is situated in the city center in
walking distance from the main railway station and opposite to the
historical entrance of the Pilsner Urquell Brewery. There are a lot of
restaurants in hotel neighbourhood offering specialities of national and
foreign cuisine. Student halls of residence will be also available at the
time of conference.
