CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, Rome

Tuesday January 22, 2013

Co-located with POPL 2013

PLMW web page: http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~gds/PLMW/index.html

After the resounding success of the first Programming Languages
Mentoring Workshop at POPL 2012, we proudly announce the 2nd SIGPLAN
Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), co-located with POPL
2013 and organised by Nate Foster, Philippa Gardner, Alan Schmitt,
Gareth Smith, Peter Thieman and Tobias Wrigstad.

The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate
students and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in
programming language research. This workshop will provide technical
sessions on cutting-edge research in programming languages, and
mentoring sessions on how to prepare for a research career. We will
bring together leaders in programming language research from academia
and industry to give talks on their research areas. The workshop will
engage students in a process of imagining how they might contribute to
our research community.

We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students
to attend PLMW. Since PLMW will be in Rome this year, we particularly
look forward to seeing Eastern European students at the workshop.

This workshop is part of the activities surrounding POPL, the
Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, and takes place the
day before the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make
the POPL conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that
participants will stay through the entire conference, and will also 
attend the POPL tutorials on Monday 21st January which are free to 
PLMW registered attendees. 

Through the generous donation of our sponsors, we are able to provide
scholarships to fund student participation. These scholarships will
cover reasonable expenses (airfare, hotel and registration fees) for
attendance at both the workshop and the POPL conference.

Students attending this year will get one year free student membership
of SIGPLAN

The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative
sources of funding  are welcome.

APPLICATION for PLMW scholarship: 

The scholarship application can be accessed from the workshop web site
(http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~gds/PLMW/index.html). The deadline for full
consideration of funding is 9th December, 2012. Selected participants
will be notified from Friday 14th December, and will need to register
for the workshop by December 24th.
