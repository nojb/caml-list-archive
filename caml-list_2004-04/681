ExtLib (the sf one at ocaml-lib.sf.net) does have some
STL like concepts. See below for more comments ..

Yeah, I've read that. There is some interesting
analysis, but the basis is flawed. The authors approached
the subject with a pre-conceived idea, that happens
to be invalid. 

They're basically hooked on 'generic' meaning
what templates do: bind in a macro like manner
by name. This isn't proper polymorphism.

It *is* what provides the functorially polymorphic
behaviour. Aka 'polyadic'. But there are better ways.

Err .. guests arriving .. more later :D
