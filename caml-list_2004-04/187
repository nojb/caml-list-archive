I am new to OCAML. I Just started learning. I need to convert the source 
code of an applicaton which runs in 4000 lines from C to OCAML. Can anyone 
help me how to get started? is there any good online resource which may help 
conveting the code? i s there  any tool available which does this?
Since it is a functional language, it is rather difficult to replace 
constructs like loops with recursive functions and assignments statements of 
structured programming language like 'C'.

Thanks,

Siddiqui.
