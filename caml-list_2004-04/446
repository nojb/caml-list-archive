This seems like a bad example, as you're just reinventing int list with it.

C pointers are something like ocaml references.

C: int *foo = &bar;
   *foo = 12;
   printf("%d", *foo);

Ocaml: let foo = ref bar in
        foo := 12;
	Printf.printf "%d" !foo
	
except that the value of bar won't be changed in the latter.

There's also the exit function, which does the same thing as C exit(), and
doesn't cause a message about an uncaught exception...

\r, \n and some other characters also count as whitespace. The C character
classification routines (isspace, isalpha, etc.) are part of extlib.
