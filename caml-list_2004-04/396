Hello--

There seem to be some problems with the Makefile for mod_caml 1.1.6. The
big one is this:

  mod_caml.so: mod_caml_c.o mod_caml.cmo apache_c.o wrappers.o $(ALL_CMOS)
      $(OCAMLC) -linkall -custom $(OCAMLCFLAGS) $(ALL_CMAS) $^ -o $@ \
            -cclib "-fPIC -shared $(OCAMLLIBS)"

Unless there is some really advanced wizardry going on, I don't see how
this could possibly work. Note also that there is no rule for building
apache_c.o.

Also, the following is problematic:

  OCAMLCINCS := -I $(PCRELIBDIR) -I $(DBILIBDIR) -I $(APACHEINCDIR)

Ocamlc complains that it doesn't know what to do with
/usr/include/apache-1.3.

Is there a straightforward solution to this, or should I try an earlier
version or wait for the next release (coming soon?)?
