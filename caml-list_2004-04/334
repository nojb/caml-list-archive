Hi:

I am evaluating Ocaml for the implementation language
to build Semantic Web-based services.

I would like to run the required Ocaml application on
a Real Time Operating System. I think Ocaml generates
an intermediate C code and compile it into binary code
or maybe directly into binary one.

We have so many real time OSs that support C language.
In this case, I don't know Ocaml can compile on Real
time OS. This issue is very critical for the project.

Have we tried to run Ocaml application on any real
time os?

Best Regards

Erol Akarsu
