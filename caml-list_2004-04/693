Please send me more details privately about the crash.  That may indeed
be a bug in my module.

You make a good point about method lookup, I will make that faster.
In order to make the accessors for structs available outside the object,
I would have to decorate some names in ugly, and possibly difficult to
remember ways.  I wonder if you (or other SWIG users) have any suggestions
which would eliminate that or make it easier.

The simplest way I considered was to have a repository of method names, as
I do with enum labels:

type methods_of_foo = [ `Constructor | `Foo | `foo | `_foo | `fOo ... 
                      | `operatorLessThanOrEqual ]

And then do the obvious thing in the method call function.  This means
that code written without camlp4 will be much uglier, and that you may
have to cast your method names.  The operators will also be uglified.

I could make member variable accessors different from the methods...
Would that be desirable?
