Hello,

I am moving from Python to OCaml and one of the things I miss is
Python's eval() call.  It takes a string representing a bit of Python
source code, evaluates it, and returns the result.  I would like to be
able to do similar things with OCaml.

I have observed that /usr/bin/ocaml, the interactive top-level, is
itself written in OCaml, which suggests that this should be possible.
Although I have tried to study the source for this, it seems extremely
complex and I can't figure out a way to do the simple evaluation
described above.

Can anyone help me out here?

Thanks,
John
