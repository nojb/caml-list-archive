To me, the simple reason is: the other is more popular and is likely to
remain so.

That does not mean yours is inferior, but it has a different audience.

That said, if it's such a big problem, you *both* could change names.

In your case, the sole reason I have never used your library is because
it is named Extlib.  If it were not, it would have been an installable
.deb by now, and I'd use it.  In at least this one case, the name is
preventing the library from becoming more popular.
