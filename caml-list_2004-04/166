It may still be good for it even if it wasn't designed for it.  At any
rate, it bothers me to write code in languages lacking OCaml's type
safety.  Maybe the solution is to graft Hindley-Milner type inference
onto Scheme or Python.  Some people at CMU did something like this with
R4RS Scheme, but I don't know if they released the code.

If I didn't know about OCaml I would say you are right, but OCaml is
robust and easy to modify (hence its complexity is not such a problem
for me), and easy on system resources (hence its code size is not such a
problem for me either).  So I would be very happy if I could use
OCaml to do experimental, bottom-up programming within a graphical
environment constructed in C.
