Conditional compilation... I've mulled this over a bit, anyone want to chat
about it?

I've seen using the C pre-processor, but that seems pretty crufty.  My approach
has been to conditionally include different source files with just the code that
has to change, but that sometimes makes a weird module layout.  Also, OCamlConf
has an untested ability to generate really short "config.ml", but this is pretty
ugly too.

Could MetaOCaml help? (I don't know exactly how much compile-time computation it
can do; never used it)
Any other ideas?
