Richard and Kenneth, are you refering to my post or Cezary's one?

In my specific case, I completely agree with Miller's point of view. The
only issue is that I'm using ocamldep to compile Gerd's ocamlrpcgen to
generate new ocaml source files to then reuse ocamldep to finally
compile my program. I cannot do that without two successive make
includes. That's said (1) I would much prefer a simpler solution and (2)
my Makefile is still a monolithic Makefile as per Miller suggestion.

Now, regarding Cezary issues, I though his main issue was that ocamldep
options where incompatible for different sub-directories. But maybe
ocamldep does not need that much options.

Yours,
d.
