Sven should say better what is possible but my idea is that GODI and
the Debian package system talk to each other.  So there should NOT be
two Pervasives modules.  If the GODI (Debian) package is installed,
the other Ocaml packages should make use of it.  If GODI wants to
recompile some Debian Package, either (1) delegate the task to the
Debian package manager (say there is a new version of the package
available or else use dpkg to download and build from source) or (2)
consider Debian packages as "on hold" and refuse the GODI operation.

That requires a correspondance between package names on the two sides
-- thus some dialog with the Debian maintainers -- but it is a good
idea not to have different names for a given package anyway...

My 2¢,
ChriS
