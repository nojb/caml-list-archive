There is an Ocaml module in SWIG (Author: A. Yerkes)
There is also a tool for generating wrappers from
MS-IDL (Author: X. Leroy).

However SWIG isn't very satisfactory.. I'm thinking of
writing an Ocaml program for building wrappers.
There is a C parser which perhaps can be used.
A preprocessor is needed. The SWIG back end model
just uses a class which should be easy.

Any interest in an Ocaml based SWIG like tool?
