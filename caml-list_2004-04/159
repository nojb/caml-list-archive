I'm afraid you haven't checked the OCaml docs before posting, because
some of these are already there.  More specifically:

> realpath()
> asctime()
> strftime()
> strptime()
> basename()
                is Filename.basename
> dirname()
                is Filename.dirname
> localtime()
                is Unix.localtime
> gmtime()
                is Unix.gmtime
> ulimit()
> getaddrinfo()
                is in the works, as part of IPv6 support
> The following flags for recv/recvfrom: 
>   MSG_WAITALL
>   MSG_TRUNC
>   MSG_ERRQUEUE
                the latter two aren't standard (not in SuSv2)
> The following formats for socket():
>   PF_INET6
                in the works as part of IPv6 support
> , PF_PACKET, PF_APPLETALK 
                not standard (not in SuSv2)
> recvmsg()
> mknod()
> mountpoint()
> ioctl()

Also note that ioctl cannot be supported in its full generality
because this function is not typeable.  Only special cases (with a
fixed second argument) can be expressed in OCaml.

Generally speaking, you have some valid points, but these get lost in
a lot of rather inflammatory comments.  I'd be more inclined to listen
to you if this wasn't the case.
