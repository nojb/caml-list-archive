Oh, cool, I'm not really hip to camlp4.

Well, right.  A build-time script, whether python, O'Caml, or whatever can
generate code (or generate another program to generate another program to
generate code), but that's no fun.  I'd much prefer a mini language that takes
valid O'Caml in and is guaranteed to spit valid O'Caml out.  I suspect camlp4 is
what I want.

If I really needed a code-generator I'm always free to use my configure script
to do it, that is just a relatively feature-bare and unsafe approach.
