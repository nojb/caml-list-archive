Hello Hendrik,

Thanks for your advice,

How long does it take to write a specific garbage
collector for OCAML for real time environment?
This is beyond my knowledge. Do you know anyone who
can guide me on this project?

But your idea of writing GC in Ocaml seems to me a
cool idea. Writing in OCAML should be more quicker
than low level C,

Actually, I may target on hard-real time systems also
in the future, 
If we can get a real-time Ocaml, it can change the
speed and quality of the product easily,

Thanks

Best Regards

Erol Akarsu
