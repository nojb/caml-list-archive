What is so unsatisfactory about SWIG that you would start a new effort
and avoid improving SWIG?  SWIG provides interop between a number of
different languages, and as such is valuable to the open source
community.  What do you find so objectionable that you would Balkanize
things further?

What kinds of wrappers are you interested in?  A lot of people want C++
wrappers.  People who are shopping for new languages are generally stuck
with C++ and want a migration path.  Also various industrial APIs will
remain C++ for the forseeable future.
