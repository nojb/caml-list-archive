Well, when doing chmod on the shel, I have in mind this is octal
numbers or the ascii ugo+/-wr.

But when looking in the Ocaml-Unix-Lib-documentation
I only saw the type "int", and when nothing else is mentioned,
int for me is decimal int.

Should be mentioned in the manual!

Information does not make sense when it is not
evaluated in the right context (environment).

Yes.

Until today I didn't use Ocaml's octal numbers, because I didn't
needed them.

But to mention this seemingly obvious thing in the reference manual
would be nice. very nice!
