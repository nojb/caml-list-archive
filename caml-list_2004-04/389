Oh, yes. That's why I made that facetious remark about CamlLoading the
standard library.

The above error was triggered by restarting Apache. However, I was in
fact not using the latest version (it was 1.0.6). I must confess I have
this semi-philosophical, semi-emotional resistance to *blindly*
upgrading things in the hope that it will fix the problem of the moment.
But if you think it will help I'll try it.

Almost true, but not quite: we are specifically admonished *not* to use
Stream module streams (e.g. Stream.of_string "abcde") with literal
streams ([< 'foo; 'bar >])--which limits the usefulness of the Stream
module. But it can be helpful for tasks that involve scanning a string
character-by-character.

Many thanks to all who responded. I'll report back after trying the
latest mod_caml.
