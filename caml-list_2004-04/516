Hello,

I try to build a cross-platform program that uses the
Dbm library. More specifically, I want to use a version
of DBM that allows for arbitrary size data (like GDBM,
unlike DBM).

On my RedHat station, it works fine as 'libndbm.a' is
linked to 'libdb2.a'. (One database file is created with
extension 'db'.)

But on a Solaris station, I got the Dbm_error("dbm_store failed"),
and from my experiments it seems that this occurs when
the data is over 1024 bytes. I don't know which library
is actually used. (2 database files are created with extension
'dir' and 'pag'.) However, I found the library 'libgdbm.a'
but I don't know how to force ocamlrun to link this
library instead of the default one.

My questions are:
1. How do I know which libraries are to be linked at execution
    time (by ocamlrun) ?
2. Can I specify a different library to be used, and how ?
    (possibly without recompiling the OCaml library Dbm)

Thanks for your help!

SÃ©bastien
