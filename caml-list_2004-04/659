That's not exactly what's happening, though your example makes it look
that way.

Okay, we can see the cause of the problem here: you are initializing an
array with Array.make, where the initial value includes a ref. The
resulting array will have unique members, *except* that each 'wnum'
field points to a single, shared ref value. That's the problem.

As you probably understand by now, what this is really doing is changing
all instances of the shared value stored in the 'wnum' field. Evidently 
that was the only field you tried to change, in which case it would
appear that all the elements of 'supvec' were being changed.

Here are three possible solutions:

  1. Make wnum a mutable field instead of a ref.

  2. Replace the array member instead of setting the ref:

       test_model.supvec.(0).words <- newvalue

     (but then I guess there's no point in 'wnum' being either a ref or
      a mutable field)

  3. Don't use Array.make to initialize the array. Instead, use a 
     recursive function that starts with an empty array, and adds new
     elements with Array.append.
