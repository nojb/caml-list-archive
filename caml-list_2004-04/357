Hi everyone,

I fixed up Mikhail Fedotov's nice SQLite[1] bindings for OCaml, and
after I sent him the patch he offered to let me maintain it.  So I have
integrated my patch (and a few other cleanups) and released a new version.

You can get it at
  http://neugierig.org/software/ocaml/sqlite/

Additionally, I have sent a patch to the ocamldbi developers, and
so hopefully SQLite support will be in the next release of ocamldbi.

[1] SQLite is a SQL engine available as a library.  It's good when you
need to use a database but don't want to require a MySQL (, etc.)
install.  See http://www.sqlite.org for details.
