Big delay... and then 

I was thinking about that statement... Is that really true ?  If I
only have maybe something like 5-10 threads running, why would it be
such a problem ?

I know almost nothing about the efficiency of posix threads.

Of course the other idea, is that I just run the program in the
virtual machine and use lightweight threads.

What does worry me is your comment about garbage collection and
threads.  Are ocaml threads not properly GC'ed ?
