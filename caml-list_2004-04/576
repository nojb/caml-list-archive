Got it.  We seem to be e-mailing past each other a bit here.

Anyway, I've been reading that thread and haven't really seen anyone
defending the standard library yet.  I found this message particularly
compelling:

http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200403/msg00166.html

And Xavier's reply:

http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200403/msg00171.html

Which, if I may boil several pages down into a few characters, seems to
say "We know it sucks, but don't have time to fix it quickly."  That
does not translate, in my mind, to "your complaints are invalid", which
is what you seem to be saying.  So I still don't understand where you're
coming from.

All of which, though, is somewhat beside the point.  How are we going to
*fix* it?
