I am a bit surprised by this.  What is the process by which OCaml
packages are added to Debian?  Are there any checks and balances?
Without in any way passing judgment on your particular effort, it
seems that a Debian developer with an OCaml agenda might have a
conflict of interest here, especially considering the scarce resource
that is the global OCaml module namespace.
