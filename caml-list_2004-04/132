	I've got a recent compiler built for SunOS 4.1.4 (sun4c).  That was a 
pretty big bonus for me.  It took a little hacking, but ocamlopt works.

	Unfortunately, I end up doing a lot of my professional work in 
platform independent languages like Java (a recent enough-to-be-useful 
version of which only runs on a few of my computers).
