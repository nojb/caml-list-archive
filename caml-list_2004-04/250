I have this annoying problem sometimes:

The files /usr/local/lib/ocaml/pervasives.cmi
and /usr/local/lib/ocaml/lablgtk2/gdk.cmi make inconsistent assumptions
over interface Pervasives

Of course the problem is that I installed a new version
of Ocaml from a CVS build, but didn't rebuild lablgtk2.

Obviously, just saying 'reinstall lablgtk2' isn't
an answer: it's in the standard distribution location,
the installation process should handle that automatically.

I was thinking: why not build the dependencies
into the compiled files, so if a compiled file is
out of date it can be rebuilt automatically?
Perhaps a switch would enable the autorebuild:
I wouldn't suggest doing it by default.

One would need to put the files depended on,
including the path to the compiler, along with
timestamps, and also put the command line used
for the compilation (possibly with absolute pathnames
replacing the ones actually typed in).

Also, when installing Ocaml, it would be interesting
to have a make target that rebuild any installed libraries,
since a user recompilation of a system library would
fail due to lack of permissions.

Does findlib already do this kind of thing?
