There's nothing to tweak: GODI is based on BSD ports, which already
provide for this. Usually a BSD distribution comes with a distfile
directory, which contains all the files needed by all the ports, at
least those for which the licensing allows redistribution.

But then you need a site with sufficient bandwidth to support
potentially a lot of downloads of different packages.
So step 2 is probably the most difficult one.

The point in the BSD approach is not to avoid distributing the full
sources, but to avoid making this a requirement. In particular the
mirroring may be slower than the distribution of the meta files, but
you still want to be able to use the latest version. Also this makes sure
that the packaging is made as patches to the distributed sources, so
that upgrading to a new version is easier.
(Gentoo's portage is just a reimplementation of BSD ports to linux.)
