I guess it is to suggest that you are going to enter a section where C=20=

calls may block. The names were given from the perpsective of what=20
happens between enter/leave.

In my opinion, what really doesn't help is that it is not documented=20
_at all_ in the the manual...

Using a library should not interfere with other part of the ocaml=20
system. Since glut has this (bad) idea of a loop that never returns=20
enter/leave_blocking_section should _always_ be used in the stubs so=20
that signal handlers (see Sys.signal) can be executed. Note that in=20
that case it is important that the callbacks from C into caml=20
reacquires the lock via leave_blocking_section and releases it after=20
(or a signal handler could be executing caml code concurrently with a=20
callback).

P.S. In your previous post is not clear to me what you are actually=20
measuring.=
