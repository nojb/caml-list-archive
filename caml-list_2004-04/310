Cool.  I forgot to mention type inference, which is mandatory.  I'm such a
nitpicker that the if/when/unless nonorthogonality already bugs me.  I like the
dropping of the "new" keyword.

On the .Net platform, SML.Net seems out of date, and F# seems relegated to the
role of research project, so I may actually refer my .Net buddies to this.
Another issue with F# is lack of integration into the visual studio; how does
nemerle stack up with regard to using a "typical" windows toolchain?

What about use with ASP.Net?  I don't really know how the backend of the ASP.Net
build process works, but if I could use Nemerle without having to convince
anyone in my office (in the files I have sole dominion over) that would be
great.
