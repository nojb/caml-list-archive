OK, but why should we eliminate a useful function because 1% of uses
of it will be slow?

Make a note in the docs (like that notes that are there already that say
"this function is not tail-recursive") and put it in for those that will
find it useful.

On another note, I really don't understand why hashtables permit
duplicate keys anyway; it just doesn't seem useful to me.  All my
Hashtbl code uses Hashtbl.replace....
