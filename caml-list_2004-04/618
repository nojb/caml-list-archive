Hello,

  I've written a small patch to Ocaml-3.07 to do some memory profiling
on running programs. The patch requires to recompile and install
Ocaml, and to recompile your program with it. It doesn't cost anything
during the execution of the program, it just requires a call to
"Gc.dump_heap" at some point to dump an image of the memory on disk
that will be used by the analyser, that will display the memory
retained (per root) and used (per type of data), at least when it can
identify them. It's just a 3-days work, thus it needs still to be
improved a lot, but I could find the bug I was looking for thanks to
it, so I think it is worth a first beta release...
