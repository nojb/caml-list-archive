I think you're wrong here. DirectX is not C++. DirectX is COM, and then is C
compatible. However it have C++ wrappers to ease the syntax. The main
difference I can see between OpenGL and DirectX is that DirectX is directly
including all card vendors extensions and is always up-to-date (or even in
advance) with the high-end hardware, MS is doing a lot of cooperation with
NVidia and others and is putting a lot of efforts into DirectX - very good
documentation quality , very few bugs... among either - because they
understand how much it's important to keep being THE OS for playing games
(and, by reaction, developping games...). DirectX let you also play a lot
with cards capabilities, so you can tune better your code for some specific
cards. On the other hand, OpenGL is a more abstract layer, made for a
general-usage of 3D, that does implements card extensions - such as shaders,
which are main stream now - as extensions of itself. The community process
of OpenGL have not been enough reactive in order to keep up with DirectX (as
you said : where's 2.0 ?).
