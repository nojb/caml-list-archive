This is off-topic. GODI does not use Makefiles to build software, it
just calls whatever build tool is used by the upstream author (well,
usually Makefiles, but other tools like Ocamake are possible). It uses
Makefiles to control the overall build process.

So I'am sorry, Ocamake isn't an alternative for that. The whole debate
"GODI vs. Ocamake" does not make any sense for me.
