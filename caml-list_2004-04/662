I see your point, tell me if I'm wrong :
You would like to add ExtLib IO's support to Camomile, without actually the
need for the user to install ExtLib in order to compile your library. You're
true about that, and that's a good idea. I'll try to think about adding some
OO wrappers on ExtLib IO, as well as conversion functions from/to ExtLib
input/outputs objects and records before next release.
