You're true about that, and other ExtLib people of course checked that there
was so other library with the same name when we started ( I did ). As this
time, Shawn's ExtLib was not registered not announced anywhere. However it
did a release on 6 Jul 2003, only on Gerd's "OCaml Link Database" and was
not featured on the mailing list. As this time we (sf.net extlib people)
were actively working at releasing the first version and several topics on
the caml list had already been announced what we were doing and how it will
be called :-)

That's for my 0.03 Eur :-)
