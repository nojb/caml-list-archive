Yes, I agree. Personally, I would like to see a carefully thought out 
interface to OpenGL, GLU etc. They are very stable and mature libraries which 
were superbly thought out but, unfortunately, suffer from a low-level API 
which sometimes ends up in a lot of "void *" raw data getting passed around 
and kept. I do not know of an existing, elegant interface to these libraries 
in any functional language and, IMHO, it would be a big but very worthwhile 
undertaking to create such an interface. I think this would make a good PhD 
for someone...

Cheers,
Jon.
