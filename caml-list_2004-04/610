I confirm that. Most of the users are synchronized with ExtLib CVS which is
far more up-to-date than the current release.
One of the main difference I see between the 2 ExtLibs :
- SF.net ExtLib is part of a community process, it accepts inputs and
contributions from everyone. Although I'm the main contributor and somehow
pushing the project up, I'm not alone and every addon is first openly
discussed on the mailling list.
- Shawn ExtLib is personnal project , so I would actually except Shawn to
rename its library, without caring about the "first-released" argument.

I have been actually thinking this for a while. The release will come soon.
