I see your perspective, and share it, since I upgrade constantly.  However, I'm
guessing it is the ease of upgrading that causes this, not any critical need for
constant update.  So I don't think it is a sound premise to include all of this
time in the comparison.

This risks getting off topic unless I mention GODI, the OCaml package manager.
I use CVS versions of OCaml and many other libraries, so I don't use it.  As a
consequence, I can't use my system's package management either.  It just means I
don't get a new OCaml CVS very regularly, but this has little impact on my
development speed or pleasure.
