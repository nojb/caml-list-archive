	I'm not so sure, there seems to be a lot here:

	http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html

	I've been wanting to look at Haskell a bit more as a serious 
development language.  There are a couple of problems, but it actually 
looks pretty good.

	I don't expect it to provide me the same kind of execution speeds (or 
compile speeds...ghc is really slow), but it does seem to have a more 
open development environment.

	I still think I'd rather use OCaml, though.
