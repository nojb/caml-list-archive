	I'm hoping to get darcs built so I can play with it soon.  The main 
point is decentralizing all of this stuff so people can work on new 
concepts without losing track of head-of-line (or anyone else's 
branch).

	My point is that arch was designed to solve problems like the above.  
darcs seems to have a lot in common with arch (but doesn't seem to have 
as mature of an implementation).  In a cathedral vs. bazaar 
conversation, it seems that making the bazaar possible with tools 
designed for a cathedral makes contributions more difficult, thus less 
likely.

	This is the second message regarding darcs I've received.  I was 
actually interested in darcs before finding arch, but had problems 
getting it built.  I'm interested in trying it again, but it's going to 
take something amazing to get me to switch the majority of my code.  :)
