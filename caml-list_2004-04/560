Yes, I am.  One contains C components, which is not what I'm trying to
do here.  It's a nice library, and one I'd like to see in Debian, but
unfortunately since it shares the same name as an existing one, it
can't.  You might consider this a public call for one of you to rename
your library, BTW.

My library does not conflict with anything else.  I am giong to look at
working with the extlib.sf.net folks, though.  At the surface, I'm
wanting to provide larger modules (such as the ConfigParser already
present, but perhaps also an IMAP client module, etc.) that seem not
quite what either ExtLib is all about.

But the fact that these libraries exist is, at its heart, a symptom of
the problems with the OCaml standard library.
