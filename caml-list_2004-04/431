Hi,
I started the conversion project after completely getting hold of ocaml but 
I still have some concerns like how we can manage pinters and pointer to 
pointers, some functions in C like exit(), isspace().
The project is to convert a tool used in text classification from C to 
Coaml.
Thanks,

Mohammad S Siddiqui
