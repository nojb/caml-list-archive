How can I "donate" some developers to the Caml team? I have asked Xavier 
personally, but he's probably very busy and might have missed my mail.

Essentially, since Ocaml is the "the language of choice for the 
discriminating" software company ;) we feel the need to participate 
actively in the development of the core compiler and runtime.

Please, let me know how this can be set up.

Alex
