That is interesting to note but, does it actually mean something?  (This
is not a rhetorical question; I really don't know.)  I always assumed
the libraries listed separately in the docs were just that way because I
had to explicitly list unix.cmxa or str.cmxa to link with them...

Yes.  That could make a lot of things easier.  As I've pointed out in
some of my other messages, the problem with Unix in particular is that
forking it will result in a painful compatibility choice for developers.
If Unix could be split off the core and allowed to evolve more rapidly,
that seems only a good thing to me.

I agree completely.  I read that message, and Xavier writes "the
preferred way to contribute to Caml is through independent libraries and
tools, not by aiming at getting your stuff in the core OCaml
distribution."  That fine if it adds something that does not already
exist in the core (database APIs, PCRE, configuration parsers to name a
few examples.)  But I don't think the suggestion really works for things
like Unix that are already there.

I guess one thing I need to do is split my activities into "extends
stdlib" and "separate module".
