What kind of business application? I suppose you have a web site? It is
not to steal your business. But I find the words "GPLed apps" and "on
top of OCaml" very interesting. As your busniess seems to work well, I
would be glad to speak about such a success story to other people (to
convince on both the free software & business front and OCaml as a
development language front).

Yours,
d.
