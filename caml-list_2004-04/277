There's a simple solution to this (works well for standalone build; I'm
not sure if GODI accommodates this practice, but I can't imagine it
would be difficult to make the necessary modifications): you can install
the library in the traditional way, but also make it a "virtual" Findlib
package--i.e. create a package directory, and place in it a META file
that points to the real installation directory. Then people can access
the package either in the traditional manner or through Findlib. All it
takes is a short META file and two or three lines added to the Makefile,
so it's easy to do manually, but should also be easy to automate.
