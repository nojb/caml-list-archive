True, this message [1] confirms it (point 6) and since callbacks are=20
not executed concurrently by glut there is no need to serialize them=20
with enter/leave_block_section(). Apparently [2]=20
enter/leave_blocking_section() are mainly used to allow the execution=20
of signal callbacks during execution of long running C code that=20
doesn't interact with caml code (this means that if I use the lablglut=20=

bindings, my signal callbacks will never be executed, so I think it=20
would be better to use enter/leave_blocking_section() in the bindings=20
as depicted in my previous message).

Regarding your problem, maybe glutMainLoop() is doing busy waiting. You=20=

can try to look into the code [3], glutMainLoop() is implemented in=20
file lib/glut/glut_event.c. However this wouldn't explain the fact that=20=

your program was running well in another version of your system.
