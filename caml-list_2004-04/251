Well, I'm writing real-time graphical programs in ocaml and, so far, I haven't 
had any problems with the GC. At one point I thought I had a serious problem 
with it, but it turned out that increasing the number of vertices in a 
display list over an unknown (to me, at least) theshold was resulting in a 4 
orders of magnitude drop in performance in the GL, nothing to do with ocaml 
or its GC.

Although the "vast majority of heavy computation" may be done on the graphics 
card, don't forget that the relatively easy computations done on the vastly 
slower CPU in serial are just as responsible for the overall speed.

Cheers,
Jon.
