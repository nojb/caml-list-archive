Xavier as a commercial guy I could not disagree more
strongly.  OCaml desperately needs more "core" developers.
A big problem I have selling OCaml to my company is that
only what, four people work on the core, and releases
are *very* slow.  There is CVS, but most programmers I
deal with don't want to mess with that, esp. on Windows.
They consider it too shaky and too bothersome.

Yes, OCaml also needs help in the external libs.
So what?  Don't turn down any help no matter where
it comes from or what it targets, provided it is well
qualified.  If they want to work on core, let them.
If someone offers you a free car, don't turn them down
because you wanted a free motorbike.

In fact it's very surprising that no third-party core
developers have joined to date, after all these years.
It's about time.  Look at how many folks work on Python
core for example.  All overseen by benevolent Guido.
And the Linux kernel has dozens, all overseen by Linus.
It works.

Aren't there bugs in the core that these guys could patch
and release to the public as prebuilds?  That would be a
nice start.  I hope you find a way to coordinate with them.
