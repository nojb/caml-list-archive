Hi Stefano,

I'm hardly a SQLite expert, nor is the caml-list really the place for me
to answer, but my first guess is this:

SQLite is file backed.  That means any SQL that modifies the database
will actually write out to the file system.  As I recall, there are ways
to change this behavior throughout SQLite (but I can't remember them
well enough to know whether ocaml-sqlite allows them-- I believe you
just need to execute some SQL code using a special PRAGMA statement?).

But more simply and importantly, SQLite only commits to the file when a
transaction is completed.  (There's an implicit transaction around every
INSERT / UPDATE, etc. if you don't specify a transaction yourself.)
I've seen significant performance increases by wrapping repeated
modifications of large datasets with transactions (by using the SQL
statements "BEGIN;" and "END;"), which allows the disk access to be
batched.  With those in place, my simple programs have seen orders of
magnitude increases in performance.
