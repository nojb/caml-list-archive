Dear All,

I coded and released ocamljitrun, a just in time translator of Ocaml
bytecode into machine code (on x86, and perhaps sparcv9 & PowerPC in
32 bits mode).

You need the latest Ocaml from CVS (ocaml 3.07 won't work).

You need the latest GNU lightning (from its CVS).

You can get it from the bazar-ocaml directory under CVS. In a couple
of hours, you should be able to get it there or at:
http://camlcvs.inria.fr/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/bazar-ocaml/ocamljitrun/

In particular, read the README file there.

(you need jitinterp.c cvs id $Id: jitinterp.c,v 1.6 2004/04/19
14:55:01 starynke Exp $)

It runs ocamlc & ocaml apparently ok, and many other tests. I feel it
is mature enough to be tried by others on x86 platform.

I didn't tested it on Sparcv9 or PowerPC (in 32 bits mode only), but
it might run on these, since GNU Lightning is portable on
x86+Sparc+PPC (in 32 bits mode).

Ocamlrunjit won't run on an AMD64 (i.e. an Opteron) in 64 bits mode.

It should be the case that ocamljitrun may be a plug-in replacement of
ocamlrun

Regards.
