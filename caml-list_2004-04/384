The 2004 Scheme Workshop will be held with ICFP this September in
Snowbird, Utah.  Plans for this one-day event include presentations
of technical and experience papers as well as panel discussions.
It should be a useful and fun day for anyone with an interest in Scheme
or functional programming languages.
 
Please take a moment to read the "call for papers" appended below and
consider submitting a paper.  The submission deadline is June 9, 2004.
 
See you in Utah,

 Workshop              September 22, 2004

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose

 The 2004 Scheme Workshop is a forum for discussing experience with
 and future development of the Scheme programming language.  The scope
 of the workshop includes all aspects of the design, implementation,
 theory, and application of Scheme.  We encourage everyone interested
 in Scheme to participate.

 The workshop has been accepted by the ICFP'04 workshop committee;
 formal approval by the SIGPLAN executive committee is pending.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope

 We invite submissions for both technical and experience papers.

 Topics of interest for Technical Papers include (but are not limited to):

  * Design
      Language critiques and extensions, concurrency and distribution,
      components and composition, language embedding, object systems,
      exception handling, syntactic abstraction, module systems and
      libraries, multiparadigm programming, scripting.
 
  * Implementation
      Compilers, interpreters, runtime systems, virtual machines, resource
      management, program analysis and transformation, partial evaluation,
      compile-time and run-time optimization, foreign function and operating
      system interfaces, embedded systems.

  * Development tools
      Profilers, tracers, debuggers, program development environments,
      program understanding tools, performance and conformance test suites.

  * Theory
      Formal semantics, correctness of analyses and transformations,
      lambda calculus, continuations.

 Topics of interest for Experience Papers include (but are not limited to): 

  * Applications
      Domain-specific languages, graphical user interfaces, web programming,
      network applications, multimedia programming, systems programming,
      symbolic computing, large systems, use of Scheme as a scripting language.

  * Practice and experience
      Experience with Scheme in education and industry.

  * Scheme pearls
      Elegant, instructive uses of Scheme.

 Following the model of ICFP 2004, experience papers need not necessarily
 report original research results; they may instead report practical
 experience that will be useful to others, re-usable programming idioms,
 or elegant new ways of approaching a problem.  The key criterion for such
 a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other practitioners
 can benefit.  It is not enough simply to describe a program!

 System Demonstrations.  Authors of both technical and experience
 papers are invited to describe, in an appendix, proposals for system
 demonstrations to be given during the workshop.

 Panel Discussions.  We also invite proposals for panel discussions
 on topics of interest to the Scheme community.  Authors of accepted
 proposals will give a brief presentation on the topic and then moderate
 the discussion that follows.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission guidelines

 Authors should submit a 100-200 word abstract and a full paper to the
 program chair via e-mail by the end of Wednesday, June 9, Universal
 Coordinated Time.  (The end of the day UTC corresponds to 8:00 PM EDT,
 6:00 PM MDT, and 5:00 PM PDT.)

 Papers must be submitted in either PDF format or as PostScript documents
 that are interpretable by Ghostscript.  Papers must be printable on US
 Letter sized paper.

 Submissions should be typeset in 10 point font on 12 point baseline in
 two columns 20pc (3.33in) wide and 54pc (9in) tall with a column gutter
 of 2pc (0.33in).  Submissions should be be no more than 15 pages including
 text, figures, and bibliography.  Authors wishing to supply additional
 material to the reviewers beyond the 15 page limit may do so in clearly
 marked appendices, on the understanding that reviewers are not required
 to read the appendices.  Suitable LaTeX class files may be downloaded from
 the workshop web site.  (This is not the standard ACM conference style;
 it is a larger format adopted by POPL'05 to be easier on reviewer's eyes.)

 We anticipate that experience papers will be shorter, generally around
 10 pages in length.

 Submitted papers must have content that has not previously been published
 in other conferences or refereed venues.  Simultaneous submission to
 other conferences or refereed venues is unacceptable.  Each paper should
 explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly
 identifying what has been accomplished, saying why it is significant,
 and comparing it with previous work.  Authors should strive to make the
 technical content of their papers understandable to a broad audience.

 Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will not be considered.
