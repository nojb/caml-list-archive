That's not necessarily a good thing.  For one, it leads to complexity.
What if you modify the parent array?  Would the iterator show the new or
original values?  What if you truncate the parent?  Would the iterator
produce fewer results than it originally promised?  And of course, you
can't so nicely use iterators in match clauses like you can lists.
