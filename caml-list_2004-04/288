You know, as kind of an outsider, I didn't know there was any other site
for ocaml.  I seriously thought that ocaml.org was the official one, and
after reading lots of docs can't recall any mention of
http://caml.inria.fr being for OCaml as well (since it just says caml in
the name, I assumed it was for caml light).  I'm sure it's mentioned
somewhere, but you didn't even mention it here in your e-mail, which
should show you that maybe the http://caml.inria.fr site isn't promoted
enough.  I mean, I had to figure it out from the mailing list address,
which means I might still be wrong :-)

Also,  when I went to check, there was a new news item matching the one
from the inria.fr site.  Did the guy just update it right now?

Anyway, just thought you might want a "newbie" perspective on why
www.ocaml.org may be more popular on google.  I'd suggest putting it in
your signature for this list at least, and at the top of all your
documents.
