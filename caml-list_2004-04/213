My GLU binding is more general than the one in the LablGL distro.  It's
in the LablGL CVS repository.  You might ask Jacques Garrigue for
access.

Shewchuck's program does constrained Delaunay triangulation, so it can
tesselate a large class of polygons.  In order to get triangle fans and
strips, you'd have to run a triangle strip generator on the output.
