Yeah, but C does have a standard library, so let's not overplay the
value of fragmentation.  Let's ask instead: is there any OCaml library
that right now, should uncontroversially be part of a standard?  If not,
a collection of 2 or 3 candidate libraries that should be groomed for
standard?  I liked Ben's comment about how the Linux people handle it,
this notion of an interim period of deciding what's adviseable to keep.
