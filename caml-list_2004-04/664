I noticed that the last message from Jun Furuse was from the University of 
Tokyo. Has he left INRIA? He'd talked on the list (last May) of resuming 
GCaml work once 3.0.7 was out. Does his leaving (if he has left) mean the 
GCaml is "officially" dead again?

Would be a pity as generics seem a very expressive addition to Caml....
