"No incompatible functionality" is easy to agree upon.

I don't easily swallow "no duplicate functionality," however.  Libraries
have to prove their worth in the field somehow.  I would rather see
various libraries compete by free market mechanism, until for a given
set of tasks, one is clearly 'de facto' better than another.  i.e. is
better maintained, is revved more frequently or usefully, etc.  If you
make some kind of a priori announcement on what the 'standard
functionality' is going to be, that's pretty much historical accident of
which committee people were awake and functioning at the time.  I would
rather see 2 different GUI libraries battle it out in the real world.
Or 2 different wrappers for the same GUI library battle it out.  I don't
trust design-by-committee.

That said, I don't think *gratuitous* duplication is adviseable.  I
don't want 2 different libraries with different words for exactly the
same functions.

It all depends on the granularity at which you define the word
'duplicate'.
