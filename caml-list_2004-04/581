I don't understand why my Extlib, which has, as far as I know, been around
in one form or another for a lot longer than the other one, and is far more
actively maintained and updated, is the one some people think should be
renamed.

Even if one or the other was renamed, you still couldn't use them together,
because they have some modules with the same names. And both have conflicts
with other libraries you might want to use (Camomile, for example). Insert
standard whine about needing namespace support.
