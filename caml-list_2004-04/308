What I meant was just that the packaging system should not try to
replace the native package system of the platform for non-ocaml
stuff. But it must of course handle stub libraries, and even
dependencies on external libraries. GODI makes some nice attempt at
that, through configuration pseudo-packages, that let it know how some
external libraries should be used.

This just happened to be the end of my mail, when I was writing it,
but then I added more stuff, and last was invalidated.
By the way, the full paragraph was clear enough:

  Last, we need support for windows, and for binary packages. I don't
  know who is going to do it, but these are requirements to make godi
  the standard.

OCamake is a useful tool, but its goal is simplifying the building of
individual programs or libraries. It has no support for packaging or
recompilation that I know of. I believe the two problems are
orthogonal.
