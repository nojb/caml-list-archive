I just went off and looked at findlib more carefully.  With v1.0 even=20
more than before, I don't think it would make sense to adapt it to=20
working with Mac OS X bundles and frameworks.  I now believe the right=20=

thing to do here is to develop a completely separate command driver for=20=

Mac OS X that handles this problem.  You probably want a support=20
library too=97=A0so you can communicate effectively with Cocoa and =
Carbon=20
applications via .plist files and such.

There are two related problems here and I want solutions to both=20
actually: 1) deploy dynamically linked libraries (C wrappers and=20
bytecode) inside Mac OS X frameworks/bundles; and 2) a nice Mac OS=20
X-friendly notion of Ocaml SDK distributions.  I can probably get 2) by=20=

working with Gerd to put the right defaults in place for Findlib and=20
GODI on Mac OS X.  Getting 1), on the other hand, I think will mean=20
going off into the weeds alone.

Big piles of work.  It's going to be a long time before I get around to=20=

doing it.  I got a day job, and I'm working on a whole other set of=20
problems in my spare time.  While I'm making wishes upon the stars, how=20=

qool would it be to have XCode integration?  Mmmmm.
