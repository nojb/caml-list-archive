Nope, that's not what I'm saying.  What I am saying is that you are
poking at OCaml.org, complaining that it doesn't target suits.  Well, it
doesn't *try* to target suits; it's targeting techies, so I don't see
the problem.  I think it's fine to also target suits, but if a single
site tries to reach everyone, it will wind up doing a poor job for any
one particular interest.

I don't think there's a real problem with aiming at the people that will
actually use it.  Granted, hackers only make up part of the OCaml
community; they may in fact be a minority compared to the scientists and
mathematicians using OCaml.  But I would suspect those audiences also
can find something of value on ocaml.org.

The point about the news freshness is indeed quite important; nobody
wants to use a language that is dying.

Well, we're verging on being off-topic here, but yes, I know Python is
more popular than OCaml.  Neither the tiobe.com nor search engines
produces a very reliable number, though; a valid survey would likely be
required to do that.
