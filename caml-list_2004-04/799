You might consider having the GUI in Python and the main OCaml program
be two different processes communicating thru pipes. You might even
consider using my GUIS program, which is a GUI GTK "server" listening
on an input pipe (which could be written by your Ocaml program)  for
Python commands and writing on an output pipe arbitrary textual stuff
(which have to be parsed by your Ocaml).

GUIS is available from http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/guisdoc.html 

(I intend to make a new release of GUIS in a few weeks - if you are
interested and/or want more features, it is the time to tell me).
