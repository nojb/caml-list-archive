I never said they were perfect.  I don't use them.  However, I don't know of
anything other than a custom-rolled Makefile that handles such things.  Are you
suggesting one?  If so, I'm very interested, and I may have missed it in your
previous messages.

I'm still convinced that writing one build tool to rule them all is a Bad Idea.
It is a fraction as much work to write a separate one for each language
(setup.py, Makefile.PL, autoconf, ocamlconf), and glue them together when needed
with a scripting language or Makefile.
