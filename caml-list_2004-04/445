This is essentially the goal of the GODIVA project (formerly GODOR) that
Owen Gunden and i are working on:  We're grafting a sensible specification
onto the frontend of GODI so that it's easier for developers to make
packages.  In the future, this specification could stay around if some
other underlying backend technology supplanted GODI, and all that would
require updating would be the backend of GODIVA.

A (very!) preliminary release of GODIVA is available as the GODI package
called godor.  In a few days, Owen and i will be packaging up a new release
incorporating the ideas from this paper:

    http://projects.phauna.org/godiva/papers/godiva.ps
    http://projects.phauna.org/godiva/papers/godiva.pdf

(And this time, "a few days" really means "a few days" -- we have a hard
(academic) deadline to meet!)

More information is available on the GODIVA website (but the paper is more
up-to-date):

William
