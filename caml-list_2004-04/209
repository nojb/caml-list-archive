OpenGL is not for 3D alone, a lot of it is also 2D and some 4D. If someone 
were to create a higher level, 3D only interface from ocaml to OpenGL then I 
could not use it in my (2D) work, for example.

Also, OpenGL has a very carefully thought out design which works very well.

Moreover, as OpenGL is available on a superset of the platforms for which 
Direct3D is available, what would be the advantage in using Direct3D as a 
back end rather than OpenGL?

Cheers,
Jon.
