But that is, frankly, not relevant.  Those of us who want something
standard and off-the-shelf don't care about someone doing their own
thing, and vice versa.  A standards effort doesn't exist for the lone
maverick who's intent on doing things his own way.

The people who are interested in a standard, who see that as a benefit,
should cooperate.
