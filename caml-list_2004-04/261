I know it isn't in the core, but it -- and many other packages --
do install themselves in the standard location.

I was hoping that there might be a sensible intermediate level of
support which worked 'automagically' for simple Ocaml-only 
algorithms and data structures libraries, which typically
don't require any special build procedures.

I agree, in general it isn't. 

However, consider turning this issue inside out.
What if you *specify* that it is sufficient?

For a wide class of libraries, it is enough.
So if the Ocaml standard library directory
is simply *deemed* to contain only such libraries,
the rebuilding can be automated.

This may mean, for example, that the rebuilding
would fail for some libraries, but the conclusion
should be that the library should not be put
in the standard location.

For example one may ask whether PCRE should go
in the standard location, since it may need to
be rebuilt if the underlying C libraries is rebuilt:
perhaps the build 'scans' the C headers looking
to see what flags are available and adds them
to the Ocaml source before compilation.

That kind of build process would not fit with the
simple autorebuild model .. so don't put PCRE in the
standard location.
