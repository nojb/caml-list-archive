Like others on this list, I contacted the site maintainer to no avail.
It is a sad thing indeed.  But maybe there is a way out.  See

$ whois ocaml.org
Domain ID:D27630749-LROR
Domain Name:OCAML.ORG
Created On:23-May-2000 01:50:28 UTC
Last Updated On:28-Oct-2003 19:34:16 UTC
Expiration Date:23-May-2004 01:50:28 UTC

The domain will be available in a little more than one month (if Mr J
Assange really lost interest, he will not renew it).  Maybe one should
consider buying it, or rather -- to avoid the same thing to happen
again -- it may be better that INRIA buys it and gives it back to the
community (some people were ready to give machines and maintenance
time as I understood it).

I think it would be great to take opportunity of such a site to also
build a central repository -- if possible connected to development
tools like those found on Savanah (http://savannah.gnu.org/).

P.S.  Maybe someone in AU should consider trying to join Mr J Assange
on the phone (+61.398188888)?
