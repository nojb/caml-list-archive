Given those results, I think a better question is if there's a
successful 3D API for a GC language out there somewhere.  By
'successful' I mean people have done some large stuff with it, not just
getting to the "hey guys I've got a wrapper" stage.  This I don't know.
All the 3D engines that have made real progress and are commercially
viable seem to be C++, but possibly I have restricted my attention,
having found Nebula.  In any event, 3D graphics guys are overwhelmingly
C++ performance tweakers.

I am surprised then that you said you hadn't seen hard numbers.  Those
benchmarks are hard numbers.
