Reasonable, but foreign libraries aren't going away.  Not until OCaml
has everything under its own roof, and that will be quite some time.  A
proper OCaml package system will have deal with foreign libraries
somehow, even if the support is half-assed.

I hope you only mean "last" as a way of listing things needed, i.e.
first, second, last.  If you mean these are your last priorities, I'd
never contribute to such a project.  I'm bloody fed up with GNU Make on
Windows for reasons I won't belabor here.

An OCaml-centric packaging tool should be written in OCaml.  Nobody's
switching to OCaml out of their love for C and C++!  If that means GODI
is unsuitable to task, that is unfortunate but reality is reality.
Other languages such as Python and Java have spawned their own build
tools.  There's a lot more to the world than Make.

So how is OCamake?  Is it not the obvious place to begin?
