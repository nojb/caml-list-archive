Aren't you forgetting that INRIA's goals aren't your goals?  I think it
would be best if we can figure out how to make "more commercial, more
pragmatic" contributions without invading INRIA's turf.  If we are more
considerate of what INRIA wants, if we can work with their concerns, we
might find them willing to declare "ok, let this be your area" on things
they aren't thinking too hard about right now.

Whereas my personal experience with Guido is he's damn inflexible when
he's made up his mind about something.  I don't have any experience with
him on the technology front, but for marketing, it was a debacle.  INRIA
is not Guido or Linus, it is not orchestration around a single
individual.  So consider yourself potentially thankful to be working
with an institution rather than a strong-willed individual.
