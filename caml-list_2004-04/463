What if your job is as a motorbike courier?

Even so, I think we should take Xaviers claim as a face value
commercial assertion we should trust. More developers may slow 
down development of the facilities WE want.

Python core design is largely stable. When it came
to upgrading it to Stackless Python the process fell
through. They got generators and a GC instead.

I do. Lets say the half the major changes in Python were due to me,
and the only way I could bring about these changes was to
build a proof of principle interpreter, Vyper, in Ocaml.

Thankfully some of the other lead developers had enough
functional programming experience to understand the
advantages of something like lexical scoping and
closures .. 

Similar comments might be made about C++: Bjarne is somewhat
more savvy then Guido, but not enough to have put his
weight behind basic functional stuff for C++, which would
have been the only way to influence a technically ignorant
committee in time.

It's kind of nice to have lead developers who are both
top class theoreticians and expert technologists as well.
So in my opinion when Xavier says there are enough people
working on the Ocaml core, we should probably take that
at face value: we're all here because we *share* the 
INRIA teams basic goals.
