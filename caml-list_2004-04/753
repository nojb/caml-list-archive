I can't claim empirical evidence, but I do know that UTF-8
input/output is increasingly important to me.  We've moved to a model
where all the websites we're doing (even for UK customers) are UTF-8
throughout.  PostgreSQL is UNICODE, webserver serves UTF-8 pages, all
strings manipulated inside the Caml code are really UTF-8 strings
(although we rarely deal with them as anything other than pure bytes).
The only time we convert to other encodings is for handling stupid
mail systems like Hotmail which cannot deal with UTF-8.
