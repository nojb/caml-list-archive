I am not interested in Free Software as in 'free beer', I am interested
as in 'free speech'.  And FWIW I'm on the MIT/BSD side of the debate.
If you're going to give it away, give it away completely.  If it's too
valuable to give away, don't.  I want my OCaml code to be commercially
useful for game development.  I'm only interested in Open Source as a
business model - where is the *profit* of the software commons?  I
think, it is in fixing stupid things that are a PITA for everyone over
and over again.  Like package management for instance.  I could care
less about FSF style idealism.  I want things to work on the platform
I'm stuck with for the forseeable future.

Things don't get ready by waiting around for others to act.  People who
want to get it ready, are what get it ready.
