Hi John,

You might want to take a look at MetaOCaml.  Instead of strings it uses
"Brackets" (written .<...>.) and uses ".!" for "eval".  Here's a simple
interactive session:

# let a = .< 1 + 2 >.;;
val a : int code = .<(1 + 2)>.
# let b = .< .~a + .~ a >.;;
val b : int code = .<((1 + 2) + (1 + 2))>.
# let c = .! a;;
val c : int = 3
# let d = .! b;;
val d : int = 6

Notice that the also type checks what goes inside the brackets (it doesn't
just say "code", it says "int code").

Walid.
