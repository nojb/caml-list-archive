Ranting against autoconf is off-topic and uninteresting.  I'm not talking about
autoconf, I'm talking about the paradigm of even having a "configure" phase to
the build.  I support it, and *don't* think it is a good idea to create your own
from scratch each time.  Thus, ocamlconf, a support library for writing
configure scripts in O'Caml.

By the way, "Make" works perfectly; it is a domain-specific programming language
with a clear specification that it meets.  It just doesn't do what you want it
to, so let's drop that rant as well, and try to be a bit more productive.
