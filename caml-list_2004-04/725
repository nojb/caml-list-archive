Of course, there are several erroneous assumptions (not necessarily
yours) that are going into this conversation:

1. That checking out HEAD from CVS will produce the latest development
   version of the software, or a version more recent than the latest
   "release";

2. That HEAD is where development occurs;

3. That HEAD is more volatile than a "release".

cvs does support tagging and branching and I'd think it not too unusual
to have a "main" branch and a development branch, and make new commits
on the main only when devel is ready to release.

It does, and is easy.
