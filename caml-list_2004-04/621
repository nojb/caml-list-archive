If Shawn is not willing to change the name of his library, and if it is
true that this library was publicly available and announced on the Humps,
the Caml list db, etc... before the other one, it is clear that it was a
mistake to re-use the name and it should be fixed as soon as possible.
Nobody has any authority to tell the extlib.sf.net developers what to do,
but if their project pretends to target the whole community and aims at
getting widely accepted, they'd better comply with basic social rules,
IMHO.
