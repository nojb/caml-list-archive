sorry, I meant omake instead of ocamake...

when omake were "announced", I found it really impressive :
<http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200311/msg00437.html>

however I run into problems because of my need for "-pack" support.
(the solution given by Aleksey Nogin was not enough for me)

since I had not enough time to go trough its not so small source code,
I decided to write a much simpler one by myself, with some ideas from
omake, but fitted to my needs...

I didn't checked back, but it seems to me that omake does not feature
"compilation command digests" :

if you change the makefile (switch a debug flag for some files...)
 - with omake/make... : make clean all
 - with YaM : ./YaM (compiles only affected files + link phases)

however the major improvements against omake are 
 - better native/bytecode interaction : no Makefile to edit in order to
switch,
 - fine -pack support
(but I tend  to believe I'm the only one finding -pack useful...)
