What it is about lablGL that means it can never be made to work?

That one is called camlgl, which seems to have been abandoned.

I already wrote a binding for GLU using CamlIDL, but I don't recommend
it since GLU relies so much on callbacks.  It would probably be better to
wrap Jonathan Shewchuck's Triangle code:
