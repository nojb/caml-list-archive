I'd second this. For about a year now, I've been using one of these 
extlibs, one which implements tail-recursive versions of the list 
operations, and never looked back. Recently I had to install another 
extlib because a package I need depends on it. This does not, of course, 
increase maintanability and all other -bilities you may imagine.

Thank you!

Alexander
