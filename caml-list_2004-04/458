OCaml could be back-ended to Giotto/Ptolemy, which outputs
compilable C code that executes in real time. The system
should be very compatible with OCaml because it is VM
based.  Actually I think there are two VMs, one is code
the other is scheduler, but the end result is C code if
you want it.

It would be COOL to run OCaml real-time!

(Sorry I am not an expert, send questions to them.)
