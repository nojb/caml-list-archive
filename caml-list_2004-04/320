You could look at Felix .. if you really are interested
in a new (pre-alpha) language. You won't find 'advanced safety',
heck, even Ocaml doesn't have "20 years old" safety
features like referential transparency ***

If you want high performance and ease of integration
with existing C/C++ code, you may be interest though.

The main theoretical constraint at the moment is that
polymorphism is compile time only.

***  Felix functions may not have side-effects,
however functions can depend on variables.
