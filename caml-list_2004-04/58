    ^^^ As a reminder the original post 'Completeness
of "Unix" run-time library' was my post! I like OCaml
very much BUT if people cannot "checkin" their
contributions, e.g. ipv6 socket code, then OCaml is
only a "science experiment"!! I am sorry for being
brutal but from a pragmatic viewpoint, this is true.
By definition a "community" has access to all good
resources. I frankly didn't know about unchecked-in
IPV6 socket code until I posted a notice about my ipv4
multicast code. Bottom line: there are a lot of
valuable contributions to OCaml that should be code
reviewed and if good checked-in! Alternative: C++,
i.e.  sh*t!
