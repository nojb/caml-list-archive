Perl is a scripting language, installing something means mostly to copy
the files at the right places. O'Caml sources must be compiled, and once
that has happened, there are strict dependencies on the environment
(e.g. if library X uses library Y the signature of Y must not change any
more). This is one of the key reasons why GODI uses a rather
heavy-weight packaging system, unlike CPAN. Of course, this makes it
more complicated to integrate it into already existing packaging
systems.

However, I can imagine we could have "GODI Light" that assumes there is
already a working O'Caml installation, and that only installs the
missing parts. This is not impossible. (Actually, I have a similar idea
on my TODO list, namely to allow the usage of a CVS OCaml version.)

The "-I +lib" syntax is supported for libraries that are used to be
installed this way. (This is currently achieved by symlinks. Not really
nice. Better would be a path where lib is searched, but this needs a
change in ocamlc.)
