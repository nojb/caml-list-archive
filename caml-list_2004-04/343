Because you are not compiling programs large enough and often enough for
this to become sheer hell?  I've read many a postmortem in GameDeveloper
magazine where excessive compile times are a major drain on
productivity.  Anecdotally, I've met too many happy Python programmers
to poo pooh the evasion of compile time.
