Let me expand on this a bit.  It is clear that people are unsatisfied
with the quality of the standard library and that others have been able
to provide useful features (*cough* IPv6 and other basic Unix calls) far
sooner than Inria has.  Why are you oppsed to this?

There are some things that will work fine with a system such as GODI
once it gets a little more mature.  My ConfigParser module, for
instance, has no need to be in the standard library (OTOH, there's no
need for it to be outside it either, but I don't care either way on that
if GODI continues improving.)

But what about the C Extlib's expanded support for sockets and IPv6?  I
can either use its support, or the standard Unix module.  If I choose
the standard Unix module, I have compatibility with other OCaml code
written by others, but I lack IPv6.  If I choose the C Extlib module,
all my I/O is tied to that module.=20

A plethora of mutually-incompatible modules that duplicate and extend
standard library features is in nobody's interest.  The result will be
an irrelevant standard library and a fragmented development community.
