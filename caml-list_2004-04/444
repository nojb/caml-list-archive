Yes, so it seems :D

Partly that is because many programming systems follow
the C model. Partly because of familiarity. And partly
because some of the underlying logic (dependencies etc)
is a genuine part of a building concept.

I'm not saying it isn't useful, rather that it isn't
useful enough these days. 

When I worked at the telco OT with C++ code base
of several million LOC, they didn't use make as such.
They used a custom general purpose tool called Makeit.
It used the same idea, but it also understood some
extra things:

(1) modules
(2) multiple platforms
(3) multiple target classes (standard, optimised, debugging)

and it could build the lot at once, or not, as you chose.
[It also knew about versioning, although I don't think that
part ever worked properly]

So for example you could have:

exes=A,B,C
platforms=Solaris,Linux
kinds=opt,debug
links=static,shlib

and it knew enough category theory to 'generate'
the product targets internally.
