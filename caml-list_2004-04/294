I think it is not possible to do it without the "MinGW/Cygwin Unix
lookalike stuff". There is a very simple reason: All library authors
provide Unix build scripts (i.e. Makefiles using standard Unix
commands). GODI just calls these scripts, so you need something like
Cygwin to interpret them.

The other question is which compiler is used as backend. I can imagine
to call MSVC, but there are limitations because of GODI's organization:
MSVC costs money. Don't forget that GODI is for free, and there isn't
any way to collect money for the necessary licenses. I must admit I
would also have problems to motivate myself for such a project.

When you look to other languages: There are often commercial interests
behind ports to Windows (e.g. ActiveState). I don't think the O'Caml
market is ready for such a thing.
