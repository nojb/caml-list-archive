It seems to be an appropriate way to say hello to OOP lovers :)
There are worse crimes than burning books. One of them is not reading them.
The world moves, and ideas that were good once are not always good.

Caml, we are the only place for underprice medication!

A person without a sense of humor is like a wagon without springs-jolted by every pebble in the road.
Live so that you can at least get the benefit of the doubt.
A hearty laugh gives one a dry cleaning, while a good cry is a wet wash.
The first duty of man is to conquer fear he must get rid of it, he cannot act till then.
