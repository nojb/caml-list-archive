Yes, that is really intersting tolook at it this way.

It could also mean that - if Extlib or something else - is mature
and ok for the OCaml-core-team then it could be added here too.

Why not developping external libraries in fast cycles and
- from time to time, when reviewed by the OCaml-team -
adding such libraries in a slower cycle into the Ocaml
distribution?

Similar to Linux's unstable-stable distinction, where one
might rather use the stable versions when working in an
production environment and the unstable when one wants
to try the newest feateures... it could be done with OCaml
in a similar way: Using the newest external libs, when
you want, or using the (lower update frequencies) not-so-external
libs, that come along with the distribution, but it will not
be updated as often as the versions/releases of the "external"
lib that was not released with the OCaml distribution?

So "external" libraries could come along with the OCaml-distribution,
but will not updated as often as the same libraries on the
public cvs.

This would be not "free access cvs VERSUS INRIA-Ocaml-distribution",
it would be "free assess cvs ALONG WITH INRIA-Ocaml-distribution".
