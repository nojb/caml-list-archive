As one recently interested in OCaml, I concur.  It took me awhile to
find caml.inria.fr and to realize that it was in fact the canonical
site.  From a marketing perspective, the ICFP and the Language Shootouts
are the reasons I became interested in OCaml, there are no other
reasons.  A number of other languages have the features, and some have
much better libraries, packages, and industrial provenness.  What OCaml
apparently has is performance.

The only thing I intensely dislike about the www.ocaml.org website is
the slogan, "The programming tool of choice for discriminating hackers."
This suggests that OCaml is a toy, used by exploratory geeks who don't
know the value of a dollar.  I prefer INRIA's utter blandness to
ocaml.org's championing of the hacker geek ethic.

Don't get me started on the Python Software Foundation's utter inability
to market anything.
