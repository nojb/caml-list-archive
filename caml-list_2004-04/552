When/where/why do you need such a function?

And why don't you define it yourself?

let id x = x

THIS does not seem to compicated or unconvenient to do it
by yourself.

But why do you want to have such a function?

I see no reason to have such a function.

If you for example call a function and give it as one parameter
a <something> why should you instead give it an
id <something> ?!

and why not give back then id ( id <something> )
or
id ( id ( id <something> ) )????

What would that be good for?


Why not saying  x  instead of (fun x -> x) ?????

Do you like function calls so much, that you
are doing as much as you can in your code?


Ciao,
   Oliver
