ok, now there are forklift, idl and swig. swig seems to be the only lib which 
can create an interface to a c++ lib. The IDL docu mentions c++ but only with 
com; or did I misunderstand something?
So to interface to a c++ lib I first have to create the relevant c-lib and 
then with idl or forklift the rest, or use swig from the beginning, or by 
hand, which seems much to type :-)

Has someone experiences interfacing to a c++ - lib?
