No good reason. ;)

I've just been looking at the assembler output from ocamlopt on this. I think 
that a mutable record field represents one fewer levels of indirection 
compared to a reference record field. On a contrived example, using mutable 
is twice as fast.

Comparing a mutable record field to a reference (not in a record), the latter 
comes out as slightly quicker in my timings. But I think this is 
insignificant as the assembler output seems to be identical.

Cheers,
Jon.
