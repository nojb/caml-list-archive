And that doesn't mean that having the function is useless.

Hell, Array.sub can be done entirely from pure OCaml.  Ditto for
String.sub.  That doesn't mean that having it in the standard library is
useless.

It's a lot easier to read code that says "keys hash" than a fold
incarnation.  Not to mention being easier to write, maintain, and learn.
