The primary motivation for much free software *is* FSF-style idealism.  It is
not reasonable to expect to reap the benefits of this idealism while
contradicting its values.

All I hear is "gimme, gimme" when non-free software developers ask for MIT/BSD
and LGPL licenses.  I am a non-free software developer myself, so don't think I
don't see from that perspective.

Well said.  It is telling that there is noone who wants to get it ready,
considering Windows' market share.
