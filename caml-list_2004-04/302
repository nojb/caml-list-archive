To you.  And I submit, you are a techie who thinks the word 'hacker' has
positive connotations.  Suits don't see it that way.  Not that I'm a
suit, but I know in their parlance 'hacker' == amatuer.  The less
technical people are, the more negative the word hacker becomes.  My
point is if you want to grow a language base, there are other
demographics to appeal to besides techies.

Sure.  A 2% market share can't be wrong.  ;-)  Beats OCaml by a mile
though.
