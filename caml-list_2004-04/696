I don't mind whether a standard library uses classes or functors, or 
both; what I care about is that different parts of it should be able to 
interact easily with each other.  Therefore I'm delighted to see the 
discussion currently going on about integrating I/O channels across 
ExtLib, Camomile and ocamlnet.

It seems to me that different styles are suited to different situations. 
  For example, I think most people, regardless of their preferred 
programming style, would agree that you made the right choice by using 
an object-oriented style for LablGTK.  Someone who wants a Caml 
interface to GTK will almost certainly be happy to adapt to the style 
you chose.

Moreover, the same issue exists (though perhaps to a lesser extent) in 
many popular languages.  C++, for example, supports object-oriented and 
generic styles.  Lisp supports functional and object-oriented styles. 
Python supports imperative, object-oriented and functional styles.

I'm sure that, with sufficient goodwill, discussions like the ones going 
on now can lead to solutions that most people will be satisfied with.

Perhaps eventually GODI could support that kind of information.
