Depending upon the algorithm and data structure, it could be in any one of 
the three.  The list data structure and sort really belong in the core 
libraries.  The matrix data structure and matrix invert really (IMHO) 
belong in the standard environment.  Priority search queues and polynomial 
factorization really belong in OPAN.
