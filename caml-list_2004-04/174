As far as I know, CDK isn't alive. Some times ago, I started the GODI
project to fill the gap, see http://www.ocaml-programming.de/godi. There
is already a working GODI distribution. There is already a lot of
infrastructure (mailing list, central repositories). The main error of
CDK was the missing capability of updating libraries; GODI avoids these
problems by using a packaging toolkit.

Except regexps and encryption, GODI does not have these libraries yet.
But this is only a problem of packaging them, and uploading them to the
GODI repository. Volunteers are welcome! Ask in the GODI mailing list if
you are interested (https://gps.dynxs.de/mailman/listinfo/godi-list).

Not when they are used for the compiler itself.

GODI does not enforce coherent documentation, but it is still a big step
forward, because all docs are in a single directory.
