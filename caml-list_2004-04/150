That's also my opinion: it's usually an indication of a bad choice
concerning datastructure if you need such list functions.

I absolutely agree with you!  But the point is: is this really so
important to have it in the _standard_ library?  You didn't mention the
word "standard" so I suppose you'd be perfectly happy if somebody wrote a
fully-featured library for this kind of functionality?  And you'd rather
like to see better "social tools" for making use of such contributions?
