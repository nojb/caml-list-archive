omake has the right behavior.  If the command changes, then the affected
targets are rebuilt.  It's actually an amazingly cool feature.  No more
wondering if my system is up to date after modifying the makefile!

I wonder if -pack support could be added by modifying OMakeroot.  One of
the things I like about omake is that it isn't ocaml-specific -- instead
it's a well thought-out general-purpose solution.  It's not complete yet,
but my experience with it has been quite good.
