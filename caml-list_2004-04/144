Where can I find those wrappers?

I know, and agree, and BTW have found OcamlDBI to have come a long way
in a very short time.  It is now a great tool for working with my
PostgreSQL server, and I appreciate the hard work that went into making
it that.  I know too that OcamlDBI supports OcamlODBC, but it is
unfortunately still limited by the OcamlODBC limitations.

I'm not trying to cast blame anywhere, I'm just saying that I think that
"Ocaml has a robust set of tools for real-world uses" is inaccurate.  To
be sure, databases are probably a small part of that vs. the string,
list, and POSIX problems.
