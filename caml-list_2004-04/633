I have created a new tarball for version 1.0.6 of the
Felix programming language here:

http://felix.sourceforge.net/download.html
http://felix.sourceforge.net/flx_1.0.6_src.tgz

and would appreciate if a few people would try to build it
on any Unix like platform to help iron out build bugs.
So far it has built on Linux and OSX, but there are
still likely to be some g++ and libc portability issues.
I have one report of a Cygwin build of an earlier version.

Requires: Python 1.5.2 or above,
Ocaml 3.07 or current CVS version, C++ compiler
(preferably recent g++).

Native code version should build if available,
bytecode is then optional. Bytecode should build
if native code compiler isn't available.

A native Windows port should be possible
but would require a considerable investment
of time and effort at this stage.

Brief description: Felix is an Algol like
strongly typed procedural programming language with a 
strong purely functional subsystem, including 
first class functions, pattern matching, variants, 
recursion, and (currently only) compile time 
parametric polymorphism.

A scripting harness is used to provide convenience
of rapid prototyping engines like Python, but the output
is fully compiled binary not bytecode. Version 1.0.6
now supports both dynamic loading and static linkage.

Felix uses arbitrary first class existing C/C++ 
types and functions as primitives and therefore
does not require any complex library bindings.

Cooperative multi-tasking is built into the system
allowing code to be written in a threaded style whilst
retaining the the high performance of an event-driven 
programming model.

The target market is: middleware applications,
existing C/C++ frameworks, systems which require
extensive binding to existing C/C++ libraries,
and those which require a high performance
event driven dispatching model. Numerical
programming may also benefit from the expanded
typing and seamless binding technology.
