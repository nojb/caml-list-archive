Yeah=97 that was such a huge roadblock to the popularity of the C=20
language.

As one of those guys who maintains a library that supplements the Ocaml=20=

standard library with additional stuff, e.g. IPv6 sockets, functional=20
deques, and continuation monads=97 I have to disagree.  (And no, I'm not=20=

at all bummed that nobody cares about my puny library.  If you like=20
Extlib, then keep using it.)

A vibrant community of people outside INRIA developing independent=20
[even mutually-incompatible] extensions to the distribution libraries=20
is in *everybody's* interest.  It serves as proof of the success of=20
Projet Cristal that the community of users of its language is growing. =20=

Contention among providers of foundation library code is to be=20
expected=97=A0even celebrated.  Better news still would be an open =
market,=20
holding a plethora of mutually incompatible *closed-source* library=20
modules.  That would be the *real* indication that INRIA has gotten its=20=

euros worth in research spending.

Vive la fragmentation!
