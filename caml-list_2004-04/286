Hi, 

Currently the first hit in google for "ocaml" is www.ocaml.org. This is a 
great site, but unfortunately has been dead for a while (only 1 news item 
in 18 months, and the maintainer is not answering any offers for help).

In large part, the purpose of such a site should be to convey that ocaml 
is a living, breathing animal. But the frozen newsfeed on the site 
will most definitely achieve the opposite effect (not to mention that having 
as "news" that ocaml has won some programming contest will give many 
newcomers the impression that this language is run by teenagers and has 
nothing "real" to show..).

So the point of this email is to suggest that people try not to link to 
this site, so that hopefully it regresses from the #1 google spot. Even 
better would be if we could get ocaml.org back to life, but sadly that is 
not in our control.

Henri
