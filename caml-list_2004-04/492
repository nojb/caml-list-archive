As I haven't seen my former post come back to me through the list, I
infer my mail client has consigned it into oblivion. If you have
actually received it, please, ignore this post.

I'll come to this in a second.

No problem :) I figured you must have been away and busy. I sent a mail
to the list to let the other Caml breeders in on this project and have
their feedback, too.

Ok, here's the essence of my project: we use ocaml to make a living. As
I have been asked by a fellow camler about my business, let me very
briefly say that we are a start-up developing GPLed business
applications with a set of domain specific tools/languages built on top
of Ocaml. There were three of us in October 2002; there are 12 of us
now, and we plan to grow consistently throughout 2004. This explains why
we feel very strongly about participating in the development of the
core. It's a sort of life insurance, you see. If we find a bug which is
critical to our process, what would we do if the Caml team does not have
time to solve it immediately? Besides, bug fixes are at best made
available in the CVS, which for other stuff might not be stable. In
conclusion, since there is no service level agreement between INRIA and
my company, I need to guarantee that we can stick our nose into the code
by ourselves if need be. The only way to achieve the competence to do
this is to consistently devote some development resources to the Ocaml
core, and thus develop an internal Caml-breeding team.

Since this project aims mainly at developing our competence on the Ocaml
core, it is sensible to acquire new resources in the form of interns to
be trained for a future Ocaml job in our company. I have one such person
whom I would like to use on the Caml core in the next several months. I
would also devote at least one other person at "runtime", say a few 
months from now, once che cooperation protocol with Inria will have been 
specified.

This is indeed not a problem. The Bazaar vs. Cathedral thread has 
essentially shown that the community effort will tend to condense around 
Gerd's GODI, which seems very promising.

There are also some major aspects of the core system which still require 
a good deal of effort: native code Dynlink, ocaml shared libraries, JIT 
compiler, code unlinking...

Now, you know better than I that industrial languages are developed by 
(too) many people. Camls are bred by the some of coolest hackers on the 
scene, but it's too small a team to handle everything. A few more 
herdsmen can only help, if adequately trained and guided. If you'll 
allow me, I'd like to staff specific projects within the core. I'll 
accept your priorities so long as you accept to put my requests 
somewhere on the TODO list. I am also willing to donate copyright to 
INRIA for all code included in the Ocaml standard distribution, so long 
as INRIA in willing to guarantee that Ocaml will remain free software. 
All I need is a little cooperation in terms of some supervision so as to 
achieve a cooperative development effort as opposed to a fork, which is 
unthinkable.
