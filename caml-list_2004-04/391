That is no different between the GPL and the BSD; if someone wanted a
non-BSD license from me, I'd have the same restriction.  Of course, the
difference lies in that somebody wanting to close the source to a
BSD-licensed work already has permission to do so, so it'd be less
likely to find them asking me.

But you have exaggerated it somewhat.  The "one other person" is correct
but "in any way" is, AFAIK, not.  The contribution must be significant
enough to be copyrightable.  That means that if I send you a diff that
corrects "5 + 6" to "5 + 7", you don't have anything to worry about.

There are some extensive threads on this topic in the debian-legal
archives should you wish to google for them.
