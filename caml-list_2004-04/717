Hello,
        I have tried it with the current CVS version 3.07+17 and the 
ocamldoc problem seems to be solved, the documentation is generated
correctly. However, the compiler (ocamlopt) seems to be broken for me - some
of my programs that worked fine under 3.07+2 started to run out of memory. 
Has anybody experienced anything similar? Have there been changes in
the garbage collection etc.?

I tried to choose other CVS versions but did not have much luck - some
of them exhibited the same problem, some did not compile at all.

Is there any list summarizing changes between different CVS versions
and what versions are recommended?

So, I confirm that your fix for ocamldoc works for my files, thank you
very much. But I will probably have to wait for the next official
version to take advantage of it.

Yours,
        Jan
