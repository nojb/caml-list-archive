Not sure exactly where this is going, but I do have ocaml code where n 
is  just a parameter, and the code works across n-dimensional arrays. 
Maybe you have something more general in mind since I am not familiar 
with FISh1.

Clean 2.0 can automatically handle your case (I believe). It can 
produce the different map's, each with a different type, automatically 
from one generic definition. Check it out!
