How about not writing a parser at all?  In Python, use ConfigParser, and
in OCaml, use, erm, ConfigParser! :-)  (See
http://quux.org/devel/missinglib)  BTW, the ConfigParser in missinglib
will shortly have string interpolation in the same manner as Python has.

Hmm... what makes that a problem for you?  (What specifically are you
trying to do that requires you to call OCaml from Python?)
