I certainly agree that the industry doesn't seem to care about safety.  And
their products reflect it, including my own.  (Don't tell my boss I said that
:-)

For me, the type safety and extremely powerful data structures and syntax of
OCaml are why I don't use Scheme, and so I take them as fairly defining traits.
Haskell is the only other major player in my book. 

C#?  I do like it better than Java, and I'm sure it will spread, but anything
without first-class functions (delegates are close, but syntactic abominations -
anonymous inner classes are even more awful) and parametric polymorphism is like
working in the stone age - its not like ML is new.
