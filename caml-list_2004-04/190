Ok ok, you finally forced me to butt in here before someone goes running
off on a disgusting wild goose chase.

I am a recent OCaml initiate, just barely learning it.  I'm mainly
interested in 3D graphics and AI and looking to OCaml as my C++
replacement.  My strategic plan is to create a binding to The Nebula
Device, an open source MIT-style licensed 3D engine.
http://nebuladevice.sourceforge.net.  TND has been used in several
commercial games, most notably Project Nomads.
http://www.project-nomads.de/.  The current version of TND hasn't been
commercially proven yet, however.  It is a "shader centric" 3D engine,
written on top of DirectX 9, but just now I believe it is being ported
to Linux and OpenGL.  I am not sure of the status on the OpenGL side of
things.

I haven't done anything about OCaml or the TND binding yet.  No time
right now.  But it is in my plans.  I'll only abandon the plan if OCaml
turns out to have some serious "deal breaking" weakness that I'm
currently unaware of.  I'm committed to TND, I just refuse to do C++ for
major development anymore.

Anyways, if you are not satisfied with straight OpenGL, ***PLEASE***,
for the love of God, don't run around making yet another 3D engine.
Contribute your efforts to an extant 3D engine.  Personally I think TND
is the most commercially viable candidate.  Of course I am biased, I'm
speaking from the standpoint of a Windows game developer.  If you have
other needs, like CAD or scientific visualization, maybe you will be led
towards other open source software systems.
