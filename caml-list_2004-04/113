 You really need OCaml with all its power as a DSL for a
configuration, or, may be, you'd like to implement a small DSL,
may be even Caml subset?

 Ok. If you're happy with a performance of the bytecode
interpreter - you can use such a feature (the easiest way is to
just create a custom runtime, see the documentation on how to
do it). But this is absolutely impossible for a native compilation.
