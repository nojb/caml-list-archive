If you are advocating splitting bits of the standard library into a
centrally-maintained community resource, that makes a lot of sense to
me.  If you are repeating the argument that "feh, task x can be
trivially done with less than 10 lines of code!", then I disagree
completely.  Which is it? :-)

I agree.

I have never asked that they do that, nor do I expect them to.  However,
we have a somewhat unfortunate situation.  INRIA does, for whatever
reason, maintain a large OCaml library -- probably the largest in
existance and certainly the most widely distributed.  This same library
is, in the opinion of some, lacking in features which INRIA has for
plenty of understandable reasons (lack of time, etc.) not implemented.

Now we are stuck.  If I were to write "John's unix" or "John's str",
they would be incompatible with the standard unix or str.  Code using
modules written for one could not just automatically use modules written
for another.  (I assume there are some exceptions here, but probably not
many.)

So I think there are three good ways to move forward:

1. INRIA devotes more resources to the library;

2. INRIA becomes much more active with accepting patches from people
   in the community and communicates better with the community;

3. INRIA splits off Unix (and perhaps others such as dbm, labltk, etc)
   for the community to maintain.  INRIA could, at their option,
   bundle snapshots of these community efforts with various OCaml
   releases to ensure no loss of functionality with a standard install.

What what do you say to the compatibility problems I've raised?

To be sure, there are yet technical obstacles, such as difficult
installation and build systems, but from the recent discussion on those,
I am accepting that they will be resolved.

I agree again.  Let the community do its thing.  But if they are to do
that, you must let them by not insisting on bundling dated software with
the standard distribution.

I have no problem with that CPAN-like approach.  Personally, I prefer
Python's approach, but CPAN works too :-)  Of course, there's nothing
stopping INRIA from taking compatibly-licensed stuff from the community
and bundling it with OCaml.

I'm not sure about CL, but I can heartily echo that sentiment with Java.
Regardless of the final outcome of the library, it should be
well-planned.

Please don't take my messages that way; I do not mean them like that at
all.  I understand completely how INRIA has constraints like everyone
else and am not complaining that they don't put more resources to it.

I do think the state of affairs is bad.  I think we need to fix it.  And
I think that INRIA has to be involved in that fix, even if their
involvement ends with saying "Here, have at it; this is no longer part
of OCaml" or "Here, have at it; we'll sync with your CVS when we make a
release" or something along those lines.  I'm not asking INRIA to solve
all the world's problems.  Just to decide whether or not they want to
:-)
