Rejoice that this error is caught rather than crashing randomly
later (as can happen with library upgrades in C or C++).

Sorry for nit-picking, but lablgtk2 is not part of the core OCaml
distribution, so there is no way installing the latter can
recompile the former.

But more generally you've just hit the reason why package management is
needed for OCaml.  Transitively rebuild and reinstall packages that
depend on an updated package is exactly the job of a package manager.

I don't think this is sufficient.  What if the corresponding source
file was erased after installation?  What if that source file is
generated?  You can need to download sources again, and do a full
rebuild of the package.  That's what a package manager can automate.

I doubt it.  This sounds more like the job of GODI (Gerd Stolpmann's
experimental package manager).
