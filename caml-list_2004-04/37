An example toplevel experience:
$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.07
 
# 3+4;;
- : int = 7
#

So what's the "-" at the begining of the line mean?  Originally I thought 
it meant that the input came from stdin, but I've been unable to change it 
to anything else.  Is it just "this line comes from the toplevel and not 
your code"?

It's bugging me now.
