A good reason, yes: it's generally useless.  There are no predefined S
and K combinators either :-)

Even if you define
        external identity: 'a -> 'a = "%identity"
references to "identity" will be compiled like "fun x -> x".
It's only direct applications of "identity", e.g. "identity 3", that
would be more efficient than with the definition
        let identity x = x
But I hope your programs don't contain calls like "identity x"...

Because Pervasives.ignore is very useful and commonly used to deal
with the "should have type unit" warning.
