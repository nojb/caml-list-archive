That's interesting but not the reason that I was attracted to it.

No, it suggests that OCaml is a real language that can be used to solve
real problems quickly, that it is not a "toy" language like BASIC, and
that it has some power wrt system-level programming.  Most of this is
true, though it is rather weak on the system-level programming side.

Both sites are functional.  The Humps at ocaml.org are quite valuable.
INRIA's page loads fast and I find what I want fast.  I fail to see any
problem there.

Why should they?  They're not a .com.  Python is doing quite well, I'd
say.
