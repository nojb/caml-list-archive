Hi all,
I'd like to use camlp4 to pretty print my files (pseudo-ocaml) in latex.
At the same times I'd like to recycle the same syntax that I use to
produce valid ocaml. The problem is that when I use something like
EXTEND
        str_item: [
		....

the type of this expansion should be str_item, but I actually want to
output a string (containing the latex source). This way I can replace
all <<str_item< ... expansion with sprintf "something" and spit latex
instead of ocaml... a solution would be to add printf before the
str_item expansion and output both ocaml (first) and latex, but this
looks like to me a bad hack... how can I do it ? I basically don't want
to parse my files but use the calmp4 parser to do the job and only add
few hooks for the pretty printing...

:-)
tnx,
p
