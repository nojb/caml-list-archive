Can I just jump in and say that there's already a model for this.

ExtUtils::MakeMaker

	- Written in Perl, generates Makefiles from simple Perl input
	  describing the package.  To see a typical Makefile.PL (Perl
	  input file) see [1]

CPAN (the module)

	- Examples the Perl input files, finds dependencies, downloads
	  them and compiles them.

CPAN (the global repository)

	- A big semi-self-organizing place where all packages can be
	  found.  This is important because CPAN (above) needs CPAN
	  (the global repository) to find packages.

dh-make-perl and equivalents

	- Automagically takes Perl source modules and turns them into
	  Debian binary packages.  Well, it's not completely automatic,
	  but I've heard reports that it is quite successful at producing
	  a "first cut".

Whether or not it's a good model, I leave you all to argue about, but
it's certainly a working model.  Certainly GODI is rather orthogonal
to this, seemingly inspired more by the *BSD packaging system rather
than anything from Perl.

Rich.
