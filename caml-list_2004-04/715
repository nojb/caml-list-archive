As Alain points out, GODI prefers Subversion for its own configuration
management.

This is quite difficult. The simple part is to download with cvs, but
then? As cvs software changes frequently, but the package makes
assumptions about the software, it is uncertain whether the build and/or
packaging will succeed. I mean, in general, without knowing the
software.

For the OCaml CVS version the plan is to keep it completely outside of
GODI, and to just make fake packages to fulfill the dependencies
(usually packages programmed in OCaml have a dependency on the ocaml
package), so one can create the rest of GODI without using its ocaml
packages.

I don't understand that. If fast turnaround is really important, isn't
it better to have a self-made script that controls the build process?
E.g. checks out everything needed, and compiles one part after the
other?

I think you want something that cannot be (easily) done with GODI. This
is a quite conservative project in the sense that a GODI package also
ensures some qualities, i.e. it can be built, one can delete it, one can
make a binary package from it, etc.

I don't believe that the majority of the community is interested in CVS
versions of any software. The advanced people are. And even these will
profit from GODI, because even if you use one or the other CVS version,
this is not true for the majority of libraries.
