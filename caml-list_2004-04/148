My "private library" defines:

val first : int -> 'a list -> 'a list

which returns the first n members of a list.  As for slicing the
middle from a list, I tend to think that the original poster should
probably be using a different, more suitable structure.  Perhaps an
Array if he wants random access.

Well, having a broad library helps to implement things.  For example,
LWP-like functionality [in perl4caml] makes writing scripts which
analyse websites an awful lot simpler.  Having functions which allow
me to convert from Y/M/D to ISO-standard years and weeks [which I have
written] makes writing business analysis functions more tractable.
Perl and Python have all this stuff, which makes it much easier to
implement these sorts of boring businessy programs.
