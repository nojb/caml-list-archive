In fact, I took a look at Felix pretty soon after starting up with OCaml.  I'm
surprised I forgot it.  In my eyes it is a lot like Nemerle that it is chock
full of good language features (including some lacking in OCaml), with a curly
brace syntax.  If I were in a C++ shop rather than a web shop I'd certainly be
lobbying for it.
