Fine... realize Arch is UNIX only, there will be no Windows version in
any forseeable future.  Also there are various Windows version control
systems that cost money.  One version control system vs. any / every
version control system is really a different scope of project.

Some developers I've talked to think Subversion is the future in open
source land though, for whatever reason.  I haven't done any actual CVS
work to know why Subversion might be better.

Downloading from CVS is easy enough, provided that you're not asked to
go through irritating security protocols.  I haven't figured out how to
grab GNU Make off of the Savannah website because they have some
security protocol activated.  In contrast, grabbing The Nebula Device
from Sourceforge is easy.  If you want to deploy stuff to people who are
interested in getting "real work" done, make sure it's easy to just get
and go.  If you are trying to convert people to your language, people
don't have time for elaborate CVS configuration rituals.

For simple downloading, the reliability of the repository site is more
important than the version control system employed.  Sourceforge often
has problems with anonymous CVS.
