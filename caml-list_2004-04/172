Not quite; the numbers 2 and 3 are not known in advance, but yes, I did
write a function to accomplish that anyway :-)

Is switching a whole thing back and forth between lists and arrays
really efficient?  Like I've said before, arrays aren't so useable in
the non-imperitive sense, and notably I don't think they can be used in
match like x::xs for lists -- which is very useful all over the place.
