Portable C++ is easy to write. The main reason for Java's
success, technically, is as simple as "garbage collection".
The main library reason was the standard GUI.

Portable graphics is impossible without a standard,
Java had it. And as we all know memory management in
C is a nightmare. C++ is vastly superior with
constructors/destructors but garbage collection is
hard to beat for easy memory management :D

However, the 'main' reason for Java's success wasn't
technical. I mean, that woeful crap still doesn't 
have any kind of serious polymorphism. C++ is vastly
superior as a language to Java.
