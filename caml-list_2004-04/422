Ah, I see.  Gentoo does both - defaulting to your SRC_URI only if the Gentoo
mirror downloads fail.  This is just a matter of someone choosing to do the
hosting, yes, and then very minor changes to GODI to check that location first,
before going to the "multiple small sites"?

Step 1: make sure the GODI maintainers are interested in this model
Step 2: get hosting
Step 3: tweak GODI

None of which is my bag :-)

I wholly agree.  But I don't have the experience to do it (I've made exactly one
RPM in my life, a few ebuilds, and no .debs).  Even though I don't know the
internals, I imagine it could be orthogonally accomplished.

Or someone could send a patch to OcamlConf (or OCamlMakefile) enabling it to
output debs :-)

Admittedly, OCamlConf just has a list of sources and a list of "other files to
copy into the findlib directory" and in order to make a nice package they'd have
to be separated into data, docs, etc.
