I suppose I should have said 'many of the features'.  I would note that
industry cares the least about advanced type safety.  C# .NET Managed
Code suffices for now.

OCaml seems to offer a combination that other languages lack in part:
1) garbage collected
2) performance.  Lotsa languages can't manage 1 + 2!
3) native compiled, byte compiled, or scripted
4) type safety
5) high level language primitives
6) functional or imperative
