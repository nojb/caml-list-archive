Yes, it's lablGL that I'm working with. It's excellent for the basic stuff 
(plotting triangles), but things quickly get quite hairy. Specifically, my 
program needs the GLU tesselator (the reimplementation of which in ocaml is 
prohibitively complicated). The problems with the interface provided by 
lablGL (which can never be made to work in its current state, BTW) are 
actually much more deep seated, and apply to lots of other parts of the 
library.

There is another OpenGL interface library, IIRC, which is very low-level. 
However, I don't like this approach as it is then easy for ocaml programs to 
crash the OS, and stability and safety are surely two of the most important 
advantages of ocaml.

I have gone some way to reimplementing the lablGL interface to the GLU 
tesselator but it is very difficult. Not to mention the other parts of the 
libraries which will need equivalent things done to them...

Cheers,
Jon.
