Directly into binary (using the "ocamlopt" compiler).

I have used ocaml for real-time (interactive) applications and it works 
extremely well. Many people have concerns about the garbage collector but I 
haven't even needed to tweak it to get it to work with my code.

However, it is not clear if you mean hard real-time (as in, if some code in 
your application decides to take more time than expected then the laser it is 
controlling might accidentally chop someone in half). If this is the case 
then ocaml is likely to be unsuitable and you'll be wanting to look for 
specialised tools and OSs.

Cheers,
Jon.
