John,

   You misunderstood my point. I was saying that if
OCaml and other nice declarative languages like it
don't stop being science projects then all we in
industry have for alternatives are terrible languages
like C++! I wasn't in anyway suggesting a process that
has been adopted for C++. Instead I was merely
suggesting (prodding) for everybody to get off the
dime and see code somehow make it through a gatekeeper
and into the mainstream. 

Regards, Vasili
