I could do with them! There are numerous such functions (and nice 
implementations, like "List.nth -1 l" fetching the last element, more 
powerful flatten etc.) which Mathematica has and which I miss.

Yes, what the hell are you talking about? ;-)

I wouldn't describe using multiple languages, multiple compilers, adding new 
source files, object files and writing code to transform ocaml's internal 
representations into those necessary for the language and back again as 
"really not that difficult". Quite the contrary, in fact, I have found it to 
be "quite difficult". I certainly wouldn't expect Jo User, whilst evaluating 
ocaml as yet another new language, to have to implement safe interfaces to 
common functions found in a language he/she already knows just to get a 
working program.

Yes, it is currently sufficeable.

Jon.
