This simply means that the library or module you are trying to load
does some unsafe stuff - typically it was compiled with the "-unsafe"
option to turn off bounds checking, or else it contains C code.

Try using the ocamlobjinfo (sometimes called objinfo) command to
display the internal structure of the library / module that you are
trying to load.

Can you post a test case where this fails?
