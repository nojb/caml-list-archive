because ocamldoc doesn't know about my camlp4-sh syntax ... do you
propose to hack ocamldoc to understand my syntax and then write ad-hoc
output functions ? I hope there's a better solution :-((

actually, my pretty print is not going to be just ocaml code + color in
latex, but a total rewrite of my rules/code in a human readable
format...

something like:

let or =
	let a = prem { A ; B ; X }
	and b = concl { A v B ; X }
in rule (a,b)

to

\frac{or}{A ; B ; X}{A v B ; X} 

... don't know if it's legitmate latex code ...

tnx for the feedback :-)
