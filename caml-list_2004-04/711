GCC can output its own XML tree.

(I wish this would get incorporated into the main branch.)

When I set up Forklift the way I have, I never envisioned C++ to be a grammar to base a wrapper generator on.  C++ does not expand the ABI of C.  Just the syntax.  I pictured writing a preprocessing front end to get C++ into a C library.  In the old days of C++, many libraries included these C headers as a matter of course.  (Eg: OpenInventor from SGI)  That transformation, unlike wrapper generation, _is_ well defined from only the information given in the header files.

This approach would place on equal grounds Oop styled C libs (eg: GTK) from Oop syntaxed C++ libs (eg: OpenInventor).
