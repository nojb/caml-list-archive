I've recently installed vim6, and would like to possibly return to vim after 
a
long period of time using emacs for my coding.  The main reason I switched 
to
emacs is because the indentation worked better (more naturally, requiring me 
to
press tab less often) and because I can run an ocaml toplevel as a 
subprocess in
emacs (which has kept me from troubleshooting an annoying terminal issue I'm
having.)

I've tried the new vim6 indent files, but it doesn't seem to apply the same
rules that emacs applies, which I'm both accustomed to, and which almost all 
the
source code I've seen is writte in.  Surely all the source code I've seen
written hasn't been written in emacs, so I assume there's some way to make 
vim
indent code like emacs does.  Does anyone know how to do so?

Thanks,
Jeremy
