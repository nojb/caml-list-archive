I just checked the manpage for install on my box, and it's true -- -c
copies the file, instead of the default behavior which is to remove the
original file after creating the target.

This is a FreeBSD 4.3 box.  I think it's a peculiarity of the BSD
"install", since it's not localized to MacOS X.

Are there any known workarounds with the current OcamlMakefile, or will
there be a new version released shortly that compensates for this?

Also, you mentioned in your other email that I need to make a "real
library" out of my py_string.ml{,i} files.  Here's the exact Makefile
I'm using for that set of modules:

------------------
OCAMLMAKEFILE = ../../OcamlMakefile

SOURCES = py_string.ml py_os.ml py_fnmatch.ml py_glob.ml py_time.ml 
py_socket.ml py_asyncore.ml py_asynchat.ml
RESULT = a.out
LIBS = unix pcre
LIBDIRS = ../../lib
INCDIRS = ../../lib
LIBINSTALL_FILES = *.mli *.cmi *.cma *.cmo *.cmx *.cmxa *.a *.o
OCAML_LIB_INSTALL = ../../lib

all:	byte-code-library native-code-library

-include $(OCAMLMAKEFILE)
------------------

What do I need to add to make it compile a real library?

Thanks,
Jeremy
