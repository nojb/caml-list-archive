Placing comments after the definition is standard O'Caml practice. It
would be a shame to lose this as most source code already follows this
convention.

I also don't understand the need for consistency between the .ml and .mli
files. The documentation effort for an implementation is a very different
task than for its interface.

I agree that this may make things more difficult, but the O'Caml community
has a long-standing tradition of compatibility with previous design
choices. Comments after definition in the .mli file is a choice that most
of us, including yourself, prefer anyways.
