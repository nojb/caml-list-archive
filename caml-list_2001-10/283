As i understood, we will be a full member (if we manage to pat 2000 euros), we will
send a representative to the meetings, and our opinion will be heard as well
asq others, i guess. If we manage to get lot of money, then we could even be
considered as 2 or more members i guess, not sure though.

That said, as we are not enough people yet i don't know, but we would need to
reach a sort of agreement on what we will propose or so on. Probably using a
(using ssh for security or so on) electronic vote or something, well, we could
use debian's vote handling code, or write something of our own, since i am not
really sure all that complicated condorcet stuff is really needed for us.

There will also be some initial paperwork involved, and pgp/gpg key exchange,
maybe some solution needs to be found for people not easily able to transfer
found to france and so on, but this can be discussed in the founding
conference, or whatever this will be called, and we can speak about it then.

I will try to make up a more formal announcement, both in french and english,
this week end.

Anyway, if we have not enough members interrested, it will not work, ...

Sven Luther
