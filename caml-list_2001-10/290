Dear all,

Let me first inform you that another french company is currently in
the "pipe" of becoming a member. I'll announce it more precisely when
the papers will be signed, but I think that we can reasonably consider
that we currently have 4 members in the Caml Consortium.

We need more, but we are on the right way :-)

About a non-profit organization such as an "Association loi 1901" as
proposed by Sven:

I confirm that there would be absolutely no problem, and we would be
very happy to have such an organization as a member.
