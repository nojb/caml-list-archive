Subject: [Caml-list] newbie - running graphics applications in WinNT

I'm experimenting with the "native" version of OCaml 3.02 on WinNT 4
(SP6).  I'm looking for help understanding how to run graphic
applications.

I'm able to run trivial examples from the oc.tar.gz distribution in
http://caml.inria.fr/Examples, but I can't figure out how to run the
included "graphics programs" such as colwheel.ml outside of
OCamlwin.exe.

I tried building an 'ocamlgraph' per the note in oc/eng.html, but that
fails with many errors like this:

   camlprim0.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _gr_clear_graph

Searching at http://pauillac.inria.fr/bin/wilma/caml-list I find the
suggestion to run this

	ocamlmktop -o ocamlgraph graphics.cma

That fails, reporting

	Error while linking e:/programs/ocaml/lib\graphics.cma(Graphics):
        The external function `gr_set_window_title' is not available

The "readme.win" file says that '"graph" works only under the toplevel
application'.  Does that mean I can't build an 'ocamlgraph' at all on
WinNT?  I really want to use ocaml to create some standalone graphical
applications that can run on Win32 machines; is that possible?

Or should I forget the "graphics library" and use Labltk instead, or
perhaps LablGL or LablGTK?
