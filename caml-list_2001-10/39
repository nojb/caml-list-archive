I think GTK for OS X exists though, so you could consider redoing your GUI in lablgtk if it isn't too complex.  lablgtk is a nice
API.

I'm still wishing they had finished GTK for OS 9.

>1. Are you porting to Mac OS 9 or Mac OS X ?

Does anybody have a good way to do builds on Mac OS 9?  Even ocaml's own build seems hairy.  Among other problems, the "domake"
script seems to cause everything to be rebuilt from scratch every time.  As a MPW newbie, the MPW tools just seem too bizzare to
me.  I don't want to learn another sort-of-compatable make program.  People writing both GNU make and MS nmake confuse me enough
already.

Has anybody tried "jam" "ftjam" or some other mac compatable make-like tool with ocaml (and perhaps related C code) projects with
success?
