And ocam plugin for mozilla would already be a nice thing, and maybe not so
difficult to obtain.

That and a serie of easy to understand examples to show how to use it ...

I know we have a caml written app that will probably rewritten in java or
something else in order to have it able to be accesed via web browsers, for
demonstration purpose. We (not i personnally though) tried with javacaml, but
as expected it was too slow, and don't tell me about the various way to use
html as user interface, we are speaking graphical stuff here.
