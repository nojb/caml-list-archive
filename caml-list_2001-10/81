I think you missed the point of Jerome's suggestion, which was (** ...
*) vs. (* ... **).  (Either that, or I missed his point...).  So my
variant was to show the difference at the start of each comment, where
it would be more immediate.

Anyway, we're not talking about a dozen markers, just two: one for
comments that precede items, and one for comments that follow them.
Admittedly my variant uses two more characters, and could be considered
more intrusive for that reason.

Dave.

Let me enter a plea here for *not* introducing a dozen different kinds
of
funny markers in comments.  One of the nice features of the original
proposal was that it doesn't uglify the source code very much -- please
let's keep that.

For the record, I like Jerome's idea of using just indentation to figure
out which comment goes with which declaration.
