That's exactly what the current system does.  I guess what you want is
that the finalisation function for a value is not called until the
finalisation functions of all values that depend on it have finished
execution.  There are two problems with that:

1. What happens to circular values (a circular value depends on
   itself, directly or indirectly).

2. How to implement it with reasonable efficiency.  I don't have a
   solution.
