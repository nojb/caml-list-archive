I am wondering if I understand caml. I am having trouble running =
examples. In reviewing some of info I see where Visual c++ is necessary =
for Caml. I have VC++ 5.0. I am not a c programmer, nor do I want to be. =
I was writing Java programs, wrote some Delphi and visual basic  =
programs, but they cost too much. I looked at Ruby also. I was learning =
Rebol and found a reference to Caml.=20

All this means that I was looking for a free or inexpensive development =
language. IS there something I can read to do a simple install and =
compile and run makefiles?
