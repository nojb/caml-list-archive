The good reasons to use OCaml cannot be "I love it" or "it's fun to program 
in OCaml" but that it makes me more productive (at least when I'm paid
for what I'm doing).

But even if you have a killer-app written in OCaml you will still have to explain 
to your manager (and even more your colleagues) why you would not have 
been able to write this app in C++ or Java (or why it would have been much
more effort to do it in another language). I think that because competing 
languages are advertised with buzzwords and their list of "advantages" 
OCaml should be advertised too. OCaml's features should be compared to 
other languages and statements made concerning other languages should 
objectively be analyzed and criticized. And if for a certain kind of application
another language is more suitable this should also be clearly stated. I think
this could help those who are looking for an alternative to the main stream
languages and those who have to argue in favour of using OCaml.

Good point.
