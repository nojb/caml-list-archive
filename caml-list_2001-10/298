Well, I've stopped working on MMM back in 1997; since then, our friends
Jun and Pierre have essentially maintained the source compatible with
the latest OCaml distribution. But I wouldn't recommend it for general
Web browsing these days. It's only HTTP 1.0/HTML 3.2, with terrible
table support. That was fine in 1996, but not today.

A Web browser written in OCaml already exists, although its development
seems to be frozen:

http://pauillac.inria.fr/mmm/

Unfortunately, no Win32 version is there, so I do not know how small,
fast
and robust it is (and compatible with current Internet standards, I
would
add myself).

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
