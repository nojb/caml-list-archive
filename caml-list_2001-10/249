It is certainly lower than we initially expected, but not all is
lost.  From our preliminary meetings, there are other companies (small
and big) that are interested, but not ready to sign in yet.  Remember
that the economic situation in the IT industry isn't so good right
now: many start-ups are literally strapped for cash, and large
companies tend to just "wait and see if it gets better"...
