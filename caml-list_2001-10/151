Care must be taken so that it doesn't degenerate into yet another GUI
toolkit. Personally, I think that being able to display an array of
pixels in a window is more than adequate for teaching and

Thanks, I'll try that.

I didn't notice that ! That's great, could you mention it in the
documentation ?

Thanks for the detailed reply. But what about the point number four,
namely that Bigarray syntax isn't handled by Camlp4 ?
