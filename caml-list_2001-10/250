Subject: [Caml-list] What's the proper way to release ocaml projects?

I have a few small libraries I've written in the process of writing an IRC bot.  I'd like to release the code to these libraries (and maybe even the IRC bot itself :)) but I'm a bit unclear about the best way to do so.

I've translated a few Python modules to varying degrees and written a tiny database more or less based on CDB ( http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html ).  What's the best way to make these available, and what preparation should I do to the makefiles/etc. to make these actual "packages" rather than simply bundles of code?

Thanks,
Jeremy
