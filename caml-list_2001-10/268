Hi,

If I were the only one (or one of three) to join the Consortium, paying
a not insignificant fee, and if INRIA decided to shut down OCaml shortly
after due to lack of financial support, I'd have lost both my money and
support for OCaml.  Sometimes I hate game theory... ;)

But a realistic scenario would probably be:

  Xavier and Daniel (to INRIA):

    We know you have shut down project Cristal, but we'd like to continue
    work on OCaml and CamlP4. What do you think?

  INRIA:   Hm, is five Euro per hour ok?

  Daniel:  That's just fine!

  Xavier:  Same for me!

  Xavier (whispering to Daniel):

    Phew, we are lucky! They could have asked for twice as much!

I hope I haven't inspired the management of INRIA to seek very alternative
forms of financing its business ;)

Regards,
Markus
