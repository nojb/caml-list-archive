You mean, anyone who normally, when writing programs, either puts the
comment before the thing being commented, or 

   val f : t  (* Comment for f *)
   val g : t' (* Comment for g *)

on the same line as the thing being commented? Yes, that's me. I
consistently either put the comment on the lines before or on the same
line as. If I ever need to put a comment after the thing being commented
I use big warnings in my source code listings, to indicate that I am
talking about what appears before (read: above) the line containing the
comment.

WARNING: I am not an OCaml programmer. I program in other languages and
only follow this maillist because I'd love to learn enough OCaml to use
to solve some of my problems.
