In the CDK, you will find a very small library "mmap" closed to what
you are talking about. The idea is to output the values in the file as
if they were in memory, so that the file can be directly mapped in
memory, and the values directly used by Ocaml. The library has not yet
being tested a lot. Of course, these values cannot be collected by the
garbage collector, nor should be mutable. However, there is a big
(unsolved yet) problem with compaction. Another problem is the size of
the pages bitmap used by the garbage collector, since the file might
be mapped very far from the main heap.
