If a donation scheme is the only option, I'd strongly encourage the
Consortium to consider lower minimum fees. I think that OCaml is used by
already numerous individuals, but not by too many industrial companies.
Many small contributions could outweigh few large ones!

A simple scheme that introduces a reasonably low minimum subscription fee
and weights votes in (online?) ballots depending on the donation sum could
be really an option. It may also be more democratic than just allowing
"full members" to vote. Separate treatment of donations of industrial
members and individuals could still be possible.

Would a minimum of 100 Euros for individuals be reasonable? This is
lower than the subscription rate of some province newspapers, but here
one gets the right to vote for OCaml - wouldn't this be a bargain? ;)

Markus Mottl
