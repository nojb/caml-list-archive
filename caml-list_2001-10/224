That number is embarassingly small. I've seen a number of posts here from
people at large companies. It is amazing that so few of these companies
are willing to join, and that relatively small companies like Artisan,
where I work, and FluxMedia, should be taking a leadership role.

Next time someone whines on the list about "O when can functional
programming languages be accepted in industry", I think my answer will be
something like, "When functional programmers quit whining and start
actually trying to make their favorite language successful". Some part of
that task for industrial programmers is joining the Consortium. Surely
there are more than three companies using OCaml?

Thanks for getting the ball rolling Michel, and hopefully some more
lurkers will change their status soon.
