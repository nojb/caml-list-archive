When I do a simple "gmake", it compiles all the files, and the directory
becomes filled with ".cmo" and ".cmx" files and so on.  After doing a
"make libinstall" and answering 'y' to the question it asks about
installation, the only things that remain in the directory are the .ml
files and the Makefile itself.  Somehow, given that Makefile, it's
removing all the files it installs.

I added py_string to the LIBS line in that Makefile, but it complained about
not being able to find "py_string.cma".
