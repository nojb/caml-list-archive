Personnaly, i would be very strongly against using indentation to define if
the stuff is before or after, after all, not everyone wants to indent things
the same way.

The (*< and (*> idea seems good and very intuitive. what is the reproch
against it you have ?

Another idea would be (but more cumbersome, and much less readable) :

(** comment before *)

(* comment after **)

or even (*< comment before **) and (** comment before >*)
(or maybe the other way around)

But still this is less handy when longer comments are used.
