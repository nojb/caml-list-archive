I have never seen this happen and I really can't imagine how this could
work. Could you please send me your Makefile? Maybe you have accidently
added a dependency on the "clean"-target or similar.

I had thought that "py_string" is a library (.cma-file). Maybe you have
only a .cmo-file there. You can either add "OCAMLLDFLAGS = py_string.cmo"
to your Makefile or make a real library out of "py_string". The last
alternative should definitely be preferred over the first one.
