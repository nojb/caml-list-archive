I see this as a minor problem.  After all, the only indentation levels
that are likely to matter for this application are zero and nonzero!

Still, I'm not all that opposed to Jerome's suggestion -- it's a little
heavier than the minimum, in my view, but not much.  (I'm glad we've had
so much discussion about it, though, because now people will think twice
before proposing *more* funny characters to go in comments... :-)
