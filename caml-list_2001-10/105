One important issue here is that author A may want to escape to LaTeX and
author B may want to escape to HTML. Are you suggesting that there
should be only one escape language or one escape sequence that brings you
to whatever language the author wants to use?

The latter may cause difficulties with code integration, but certainly
keeps the symbol count low.
