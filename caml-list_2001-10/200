Are you an Objective Caml aficionado?  Would you like to help bring
this language to a wider audience?

O'Reilly has published a book about Ocaml in French, _Développement
d'applications avec Objective Caml_; see
http://www.oreilly.fr/catalogue/ocaml.html
The book is also available on the web at
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/Livres/ora/DA-OCAML/index.html
In the summer of 2000, a group of volunteers began translating this
book into English.  Substantial progress has been made: more than 70%
of this 700-page book has been translated.

However, we need more volunteers to help complete the project.  So why
don't you:

-- help translate?  Please don't feel intimidated if you don't have an
   advanced degree in French literature.  This is not like translating
   the poetry of Baudelaire.  The subject matter is Objective Caml,
   which you know already, and there are no subtle literary nuances
   you have to worry about capturing.  I speak from experience:
   translating is fun and addictive.  It's instant gratification:
   every word you type is a translation accomplished!

-- help proofread?  All that is required is that you be a native
   speaker of American English, with an eye for typos and an ear for
   proper grammar and diction.  (You will have to be on the lookout
   for gallicisms: awkward constructions resulting from too literal
   translation.)  Indulge your desire to improve others!

If interested, please contact the translators' mailing list at
translators@pauillac.inria.fr
to lend a hand and demonstrate the power of cooperative effort.
