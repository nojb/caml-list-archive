I just tried the alpha release out of curiosity [it compiles without
problem on my Debian Linux x86 box BTW] and used it on some of my
code.  That triggered the following questions.

* Does the above means it is not possible anymore to use "parser"
  under the interactive system?

* Since camlp4 does not support the Bigarray notation (.{...}), does
  that imply that programs using parsers must not use it (or
  then--when possible--be divided into several sources that are
  compiled separately)?

P.S.  I am in the process of learning OCaml, so please excuse if the
above questions have obvious answers.
