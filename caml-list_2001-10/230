I think altruism and love for OCaml is a lot closer than very specific
selfish reasons. That's still not quite right, maybe idealism and civic
virtue come closer?

I can't speak for the other companies, but I think that's not an
inaccurate picture of where I work.

I'm not convinced that my, or anyone else's, behavior is entirely rational,
or at least that the objective function and even the decision variables aren't
somewhat arbitrary. So the model of a corporation as a purely money optimizing
entity is inaccurate. But I'll stop here, this list isn't the place for a
discussion of my world view; if you want that, join the Consortium and
I'll send you a private, copyrighted e-mail :-).

No doubt the process and goals of the Consortium can be tuned.

Thanks for your altruistic work on behalf of OCaml, Markus!
