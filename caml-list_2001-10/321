Most of the patches in the CDK are useful to improve the compilation
and distribution of the CDK (eg binary distribs independent of linux
distributions), and are not useful for other ocaml users. However,
some patches discussed on the mailing-list have been integrated and
can be used by users. For example:

14_yacc.patch is Thierry Bravier's ocamlyacc patch, to allow symbolic $
  variables in mly files.
13_scaml.patch is described on  http://algol.prosalg.no/~malc/scaml .
16_clink.patch is used to allow recursive modules in very simple
  cases (forward declaration of functions).
17_option.patch is a patch to allow optional values in modules 
  (from Alain Frisch).

As said by Xavier, these patches are not included in the standard
distribution for good reasons (either they need to be improved, or
better tested, or a better general solution is coming). They are
mainly in the CDK for beta-testing, and they will be kept until either
a big bug appears or a better replacement is found.
