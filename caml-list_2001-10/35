Hi Michael,

When time permits I plan to implement a .NET CLR compiler for Caml.
Initially I will implement only the core language, and perhaps
first-order modules, and then to assess things after that.  I will be
coding the implementation up from scratch rather than using the sources
for the existing OCaml compiler, but may leverage the backend of the
existing SML.NET compiler.

My first reason for doing this is because I have an existing OCaml code
base that I would like to make available as a .NET library. (See
http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx )  Plus I love Caml, and
would like to see it supported on .NET, and I'm interested in proving
that interoperability between functional languages is practical in .NET.

This implementation path would give object introspection capabilities
for free.  However it would no doubt be slower than the existing native
code Caml implementation: you don't get something for nothing.

I don't know of any other _active_ efforts to do a .NET compiler for
Caml.  SML.NET will, hopefully, be available publicly soon: email
nick@microsoft.com or crusso@microsoft.com for details.

Best wishes,
Don

Subject: [Caml-list] introspection & CLR ?

Hi,

I have two questions regarding OCAML's future:

1) are there plans to equip OCAML with object introspection?
2) what are the plans regarding OCAML & CLR?

Cheers.
