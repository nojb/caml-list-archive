This intimitating psychological effect is a good argument ;)

This surely depends on the number of membership requests. If only one
individual applies, this may be true, but average costs per request are
likely to be much lower if 100 do so. Why don't we run an opinion poll
on this to see whether enough people have interest? Yahoo Groups offers
such poll functionality for free, and it may come handy more than once
when INRIA wants to get mass feedback from OCaml-users...
