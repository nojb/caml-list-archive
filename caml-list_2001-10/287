If you want to contribute to ocaml, one possibility is to put your
libraries and patches in the CDK (Caml Development Kit). Maybe you
don't know, but the CDK is distributed with a patched version of the
ocaml compiler. As a consequence, the ocamlyacc patch for example can
be applied to the CDK ocaml compiler, and distributed in next
releases, so that it is possible to test whether a patch is really
useful or nor before complete integration in the original ocaml
compiler. I think the CDK can be seen as a complement to the
Consortium, since the consortium is used by corporates to contribute
(with money) to ocaml, while the CDK is used by programmers to
contribute (with code) ...
