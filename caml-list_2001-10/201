I'm trying to write a simple compiler using Objective Caml, and what I
can say is that it's been a far more pleasant experience than doing the
same thing in C and Yacc, and I've learned a fair bit of the language
this way.  However there's one small thing I've wanted to do because
it's needed in my compiler.  Say I have a group of functions like this.

emit_parm "ldc" offset;
emit "ind"

The value of this whole expression is the value of the emit application.
 What if I want the value of the entire expression to be the value of
the emit_parm application?  I can't interchange the order of these two
expressions obviously because the two function applications have side
effects (they generate the assembly language for my virtual machine
architecture) Is there a way to do this?  I've been able to work around
my ignorance of the existence of such a feature but I can't help but
feel that there *must* be a better way.

One way I've thought of is to create a reference, but I can't help but
feel that there's another way to do it.
