I'm not part of the Ocaml devel team, but as an "old" ocaml user, I would

Optimizations are welcome, if they don't complexify too much the compiler.

Look at the CVS version of ocaml, there are test directories I
think. Coq compilation is often used for evaluating optimizations.

Most current users look more interested in "symbolic" computations,
than in "numerical" applications. However, this might change if you
add such an optimization patch. But, if your patch degrades "symbolic"
performances, you MUST ADD AN OPTION to trigger it ONLY on numerical
applications.

Notice that, as discussed before on this mailing-list, I would welcome
such a patch in the CDK.

x86 optimization is better than nothing.

Finally, I would say it might be interesting to have an optional pass
in the compiler, where user-contributed optimizations might be added.
Then, there would be some space for an independant project, something
like ocaml-opts.sourceforge.net that would develop this pass.
