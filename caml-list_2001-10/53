Thanks!  That's a great site, no doubt a bit inspired by my constant 
questions
about makefiles and vim and all that :)

I did have a problem, however, downloading your vim/ directory.  It seems 
the
files in the syntax/ directory aren't available.  Maybe it would be easier, 
both
for you and for downloaders, to offer an occasional tarball snapshot of that
directory.

Thanks again for the help, and I'll certainly keep on eye on that page for 
any
additions.

Jeremy
