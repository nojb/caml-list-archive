hm. I just noticed that I actually made a small mistake in my example=
. It
should be:

(** My magical function *)
let magical =3D function
  | CaseA -> 0 (**< this is case 0 *)
  | CaseB -> 1 (**< this is case 1 *)
  | CaseC -> 2 (**< this is case 2 *)
  | _ -> raise Not_found (**< Too bad, so sad *)


with the added '*' in the after-comments. Funnily enough I like my mi=
staken
one better :)

PS.
  Though I've seen this reply to me email, I haven't seen my original
  email yet. Just thought I'd share the speed of processing on the li=
st
  from my vantage point.
