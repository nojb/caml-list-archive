No, I meant, anyone who writes comments before the thing that they refer
to *and* indented more than the thing that follows them.

My proposed rule

    if the comment is on a line by itself, 
    then if its indentation is the same as the following (non-comment) line
         then it goes with the following
         else it goes with the preceding
    else it goes with the line it's on.

handles your style just fine, I think.  The idea was to support all three
"natural" styles, i.e.

     (** comment for f *)
     val f : t

     val f : t   (** comment for f *)
     
     val f : t   
        (** comment for f *)
     
without the need for any funny markers.
