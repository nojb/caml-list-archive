Hello Daniel,

It seems that packaging OCaml + Camlp4 (synchronised 
versions) on a single distribution package source,
was an issue pointed at the list. Camlp4 is a nice
tool very close related to the language, and also
revised syntax it seems me to be better than standard
syntax (despite it's rather subjetive issue). I have
ported some apps to revised syntax and some programmers
that are learning the language (at my job) agreed that
it's more easy to read (so to learn). It would be nice
to have Camlp4 bundled and synchronised with all the
future versions of OCaml. Is it possible?. Even more,
I think that the syntax default model would be a choice
of the user when builing the compilers. I don't want
to start a 'syntax-war' it is only my personal taste,
besides having such powerfull tool, alternative syntaxs
could arise elsewhere ... who knows? (creativity never
stops!)

Best regards
Arturo Borquez
