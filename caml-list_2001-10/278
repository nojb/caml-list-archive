Just a 30 seconds dream : a small, fast and robust web
browser... Wouldn't you like to have a GC in Netscape ? Wouldn't you
like to use powerfull tools able to program a defensive parsing for
all the HTTP/Javascript garbage you can find out there ? Isn'it what
*every* people need ?

I can dream no other definitive killer app for Ocaml.
