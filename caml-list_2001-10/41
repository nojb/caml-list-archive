i'm trying to use camlp4 to extend ocaml so that i can write something
like:

	foo ident0 = <ident list>

or (my preference)

	let foo ident0 = <ident list>

where "foo" is a new keyword and <ident list> is a list of identifiers. 
i'd then like to:

(1) declare a value named ident0 in the current module, and

(2) wrap subsequent functional values matching those described in the
    identifier list with special code...

can you point me to any camlp4 code that does something which is [even
remotely] similar? or tell me why my thinking here is completely
off? (i've been an ocaml user for a short while, but am completely new
to camlp4...)

thanks much,

jdm
