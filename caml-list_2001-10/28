I'd agree that core dump is surprising, but if your multi-threaded
program does anything with a mutable value without the protection of a
mutex, then it is incorrect (i.e. its semantics is unspecified).  In
O'Caml, none of the operations is specified as atomic (except a few
things in the threads library), and you shouldn't assume that they are.
