Right, fair enough...

But I do indeed, because it is important to know about the chances that
more members are going to join and whether one can improve these chances.
Just to make sure there is no misunderstanding: I do think that some
kind of industrial (or even private) financial support is very important
for the future of OCaml and that a Consortium would be a good idea. The
question is only how to make the Consortium attractive to people.

Most likely, because some tireless heroes managed to convince them
(btw.: my congratulations for their great lobbying work!). After all,
the fees are not so high that companies couldn't afford them. The problem
is rather opportunity costs: why join this Consortium and not another?
Big companies usually have many alternative opportunities so we better
make sure that they stay with us and not go elsewhere...

I had expected that one might misunderstand my argument here. The word
"selfish" has a negative touch in most people's eyes: to me it basically
means "they think they will benefit from it". This does absolutely not
mean that they see a benefit in other members not having one. In fact,
they surely know that the benefit of the whole OCaml-community is
to some extent correlated to theirs. The question is how strong this
correlation is.

There is definitely a point where interest conflicts can arise, and then
a donation scheme may not be able to keep members. Nobody will join any
kind of interest group without having an interest in it. If INRIA were
a charity, a scheme that builds on donations would be fine, but this is
not the case here.

Also, I don't fear that any of my ramblings will prevent anybody who
is decided from joining the Consortium (I wouldn't write this much if I
didn't take this issue very serious). But some change (if it were legally
possible) to the current statutes of the Consortium might attract many
more members. This was my primary interest in this discussion.

The Consortium is definitely better than no consortium at all - no
objection against it as such! If I take a look around, consortia in
this field (languages, compilers) are usually formed to define industry
standards. Not being able to influence the latter to their favour can
be extremely costly for companies, which is a strong incentive for
joining. Unfortunately, OCaml doesn't seem to be widespread enough to
justify this. (At least at the moment ;)

Sure! This, however, requires that the Consortium consists of a
significant number of influential members. It's great for the popularity
of OCaml that Dassault-Aviation has joined, and I hope that they stay! It
certainly won't hurt to give them some more arguments why continuous
financial support is a good idea (=3D will benefit them, too). Moral
support alone will probably not be enough to make OCaml really popular...

I feared that this would be a major obstacle. The private and public
sectors are usually strictly separated (same here in Austria), which makes
it very difficult to combine their advantages (efficiency and sustained
long term investment). But maybe such an attempt would just foster their
combined disadvantages and create a myopic monster of inefficiency,
who knows? ;)

Anyway, sometimes I really wish that my analyses are wrong, and if not
in the case that concerns the OCaml-Consortium, where else?

Best regards,
Markus
