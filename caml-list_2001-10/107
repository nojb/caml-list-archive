This reminds me of a current gripe with the Tuareg mode (and I believe the
O'Caml mode that comes with the distribution has the same issue). If I
have a multi-line comment line this: 

 (* line 1
  * line 2
  * line 3 
  *)

and then hit M-q to refill the region I get:

 (* line 1 * line 2 * line 3 *)

In the C mode, refilling a similar comment produces

 /* line 1 line 2 line 3 */

and multiline comments maintain the '*' pattern appropriately on each
line. I have no idea how to implement Emacs modes, but does anyone have
any idea how difficult it would be to fix this? Editing documentation in
comments can be very tedious because of the need to manually refill
paragraphs.
