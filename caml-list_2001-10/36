One question:
knowing that
-you know and work with OCaml,
-you have used it for CLR linked stuff,
-OCaml is written in OCaml,
-You want to create an OCaml compatible compiler, or a .NET CLR
backend, whatever you want to call it,
I would intuitively think that it would be easiest and MUCH less work to
use some existing compiler code, et least for the parsing and typing, no ?
Or did I miss something ?

Best wishes,
