It actually isn't capable of correctly indenting OCaml-code. The reason
is simple: you'd need a complete parser and pretty-printer to do so. This
is an awful lot of work and slows down some operations considerably.

Currently, the indent file for OCaml does an approximate job: it
only considers the current and the last line to compute a suitable
shiftwidth. This works remarkably well in the majority of cases.

You can also program Vim (though not in Lisp). Considering the richness
of builtin functions in Emacs and the still large amount of Lisp-code
required to implement automatic indentation (~ 1500 LOCS), I wouldn't
dare to do the same for Vim. Anybody want to give it a go? ;)
