Well since noone answered I assume it's not :-(

Or maybe let me reword the question ...

Can you produce an ordinary Windows DLL with OCaml?
Can you use a function to that you got a pointer and whose C style 
header you know?
Can you access C style structures you got a pointer to from 
somewhere?

A related question :

Can you use COM objects with OCaml?
Can you create COM objects with OCaml? Can those objects be 
poolable?

( I do have MSVC 6.0 by hand if that's necessary.)

Thanks, Jenda

P.S.: I'm sorry but I don't have time to learn a language only 
because it looks nice. I have tasks to do.
I've used SML/NJ and Concurrent Clean while at university so I 
have enough background to learn the language quickly, but before I 
start I need to know if it's going to be useful for anything.
Sorry, maybe all this info is somewhere on the pages, but I did not 
find an ultimative answer yet.

There is a reason for living. There must be. I've seen it somewhere.
It's just that in the mess on my table ... and in my brain.
I can't find it.
