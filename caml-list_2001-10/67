   Institut f=FCr Informatik, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit=E4t M=FCnche=
n

=09     on the "Mobile Resource Guarantees" project
=09=09     http://www.lfcs.ed.ac.uk/mrg

=09=09    Closing date: 31 October 2001

The University of Edinburgh and LMU Munich are beginning a joint
project entitled "Mobile Resource Guarantees" (MRG) funded by the
European Commission under the Global Computing initiative.  The
project aims to build foundational and practical infrastructure for
endowing mobile code with independently verifiable certificates as to
its resource consumption.  These certificates take the form of
condensed formal proofs, generated from typing derivations in linear
type systems for describing resource bounds of high-level code.

A wide variety of technical work is involved, ranging from theory to
development of prototype implementations.  We seek applicants who are
willing and able to contribute to a team effort, with a strong
background in some combination of the following areas:

   program logic and proof systems, formal methods
   type systems and static analysis
   semantics of programming languages
   (concrete) computational complexity theory
   compilation techniques for functional and OO programs
   programming of embedded systems and/or smartcards

Alternatively, applicants may have a strong general CS background
and be willing to invest some time and energy to catch up on a new
and exciting topic.  A PhD or equivalent research background is
required.

The project is scheduled to start in January 2002 and run for three
years.  Two research positions are available in Edinburgh and two in
Munich.  In appointing to these positions, we will attempt to optimize
the mix of backgrounds and interests at each site and across the
project as a whole.  It is expected that appointments will be for
three years at one site or the other, but there may be scope for
shorter appointments as well as for slightly longer appointments
involving another closely related project, and also for appointments
for part of the time at each of the two sites.

Candidates should apply to either Edinburgh or Munich by 31 October
2001.  Applicants who are willing to work at either site should apply
to Edinburgh, and clearly indicate this willingness on their
application.  Applicants should send a CV, a statement of the
relevance of their background to the MRG project, and contact
information for 2-3 referees.  Applications to Edinburgh should quote
reference 310850 and be sent to Personnel Department, University of
Edinburgh, 9-16 Chambers Street, Edinburgh EH1 1HT (fax +44 131 650
6509, or apply on-line at www.jobs.ed.ac.uk).  Applications to Munich
should be sent to Professor Martin Hofmann, Institut f=FCr Informatik,
Oettingenstrasse 67, 80538 M=FCnchen, Germany (fax +49 89 2178 2238,
e-mail mhofmann@informatik.uni-muenchen.de).  Appointments in
Edinburgh will be on the AR1A scale, =A317451-26229 per annum.
Appointments in Munich will be on the BATIIa scale, 4000-6253DM per
month plus a supplement from 1034DM per month depending on family
circumstances.

Edinburgh, contact Don Sannella <dts@dcs.ed.ac.uk>, telephone
+44 131 650 5184.  In Munich, contact Martin Hofmann
<mhofmann@informatik.uni-muenchen.de>, telephone +49 89 2178 2144.

Edinburgh and Munich are both wonderful cities to live in, with a
dynamic cultural life as well as easy access to spectacular
countryside.
