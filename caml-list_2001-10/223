Well, it is not that the Consortium is willing to keep its plans
secret, but more that it is starting slowly. We have 3 members so far,
and we'd like to have a few more before the end of this year.

Anyway, the Consortium activities will start at the beginning of 2002,
and we should have our first formal meeting around December
2001/January 2002.

The Consortium Web pages

    http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/

have a new look (to be improved, of course, but better that before),
and all information will be available from there (members, actions,
and so on). Unless members disagree with me, the Consortium's
activities shall be public.
