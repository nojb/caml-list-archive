Yes, i have contacted them already, and they approve on it, as michel surely
did say in a message below. It seems they are only administratives reasons for
why they cannot start such a thing themselves.

It seems to be for administrative reasons, the processing fee and so on. The
association is the best way to solve this problem, and when i proposed it
here some time ago, michel told me it was a good idea, nobody else reacted
though, and it will not work if people are not interrested. Like said, i will
try to send a more formal mail about it this weekend, and i need at least 7
founding members to launch the thing. Right now, i have 3 offers, myself,
michel mauny, altough he cannot take a leading role from what i understood,
and georges mariano. That is not enough.

mmm, ok yes, this is another way of putting it, but it may not be compatible
with the consortium or association thingy.

Yes and no, it may be possible to get them done already if you manage to
convince the ocaml team that these stuff are needed and well proven and good
code. The same will also be true once we join the consortium, since you will
not be the only member there. Sure, you could always fork the code, but this
would not be a good thing.

Do you know what were the reasons for it ?

I will let them respond themselves here, ...
