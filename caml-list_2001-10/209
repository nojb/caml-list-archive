Subject: [Caml-list] Possible function to add to Hashtbl?

On the rare occasions I do find myself using the using multiple bindings of 
a
single key in a hashtbl, I also find myself needing a "remove_all" function,
which removes all the bindings to a particular key in a hashtbl.  Perhaps 
such a
function should be added to the module?

I'm sure there's a more efficient way to implement such a function in the
hashtbl module, but here's what I've been using thus far:

-----
let hashtbl_remove_all h key =
  for i=1 to List.length (Hashtbl.find_all h key) do
    Hashtbl.remove h key;
  done
