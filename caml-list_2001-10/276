Everybody claims that their language is the most productive one,
but not everbody can prove it. To be honest: it is much easier to
"prove" this for Java than for OCaml, because there are legions of more
Java-programmers with zillions of projects.  So Mr. J. can say: "Look
at the many cool things that have been done in Java!". Whether these
things were produced in a short time or how much effort was necessary
is usually not observable anyway.

The pure quantitative lack of significant OCaml-projects (on a
comparative scale) makes it difficult to argue, which places us into
the chicken-and-egg problem. So we better write code rather than lament
about the lack thereof...

Sure! But having a "constructive" proof of your claim is more convincing
than the claim alone. Especially for managers, who have a tough time
estimating the validity of your theoretical claims in fields they are
not experts in.

And some Java-guru would then "objectively" analyze things from his
point of view...

No, never say anything bad about your product. Never! We all know that
this is dishonest, but that's the way Java, Windows, VB, etc. have
conquered the market. There is good reason why I have switched to a
technical field from business... :(

If you want to do marketing, then do marketing, not science. You'll
have to play by the rules of psychology then rather than use technical
measures.

Markus Mottl

P.S.:  Even though it is much more effective, I don't want to do
       "marketing" for OCaml: I will still continue trying to convince
       by honest arguments.
