Right.  The string representation of the exception is computed in a
fixed-size buffer.  You can easily change the size of this buffer
(declaration of "struct stringbuf" in byterun/printexc.c).  Ideally,
the buffer would grow as needed...

That's a known open issue.  The C code that traps and display the
exception could call back into Caml to perform the flushing (and more
generally all "at_exit" processing), but some care must be taken if
some of this processing raises an exception itself :-)
