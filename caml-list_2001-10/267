That's not quite what I think, but it certainly also explains to some
extent why it is so difficult to gain more members for OCaml in general
and for the Consortium in particular.

Which is, I fear, most often a good idea... ;)

And it would be unwise to believe that it's only technical arguments
that are considered here. There simply must be economic incentives to
convince companies. To say it clearly: a manager who doesn't consider
the latter is a bad manager. We should really try to avoid our natural
mindset of enthusiastic technicians or scientists and put ourselves into
the role of a manager who is responsible for his investment decisions.

This does not work. I am sure that most of us have already tried such
strategies, but they do not convince, because all competing languages
use buzzwords and lists of "advantages". If you want to convince people,
write a killer-app in their respective field of interest, otherwise they
won't even listen.

Taking a look at companies that base their business on open source,
I wouldn't say that their strategy "sell services" was particularly
successful up to now. Mostly, because they overlooked that services have
a rather strong impact on costs and therefore on profit. Don't forget,
as soon as you demand fees for your products, you are liable for them
and no kind of licence will get you around this (at least not in the
countries I know).
