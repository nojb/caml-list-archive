I don't think you are necessarily doing anything "wrong", but you are
testing in a manner quite differently from me.

Some ideas:
- Our architectures are quite different, I'm using an old PII-450Mhz.
- I time the programs externally, you time them internally.
- I compile the ocaml source with:
  > ocamlopt -noassert -unsafe -ccopt -O3 ary.ml -o ary.run
  You apparently compiled with:  
  > ocamlopt -o aa_ml unix.cmxa aa.ml

The last one is probably what makes the most difference.

Cheers,
Doug
