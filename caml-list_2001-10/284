Not that I want to become embroiled in a discussion on the finer points of
propaganda---oops, `advocacy', but you can find such a buzzword list here:

  http://pauillac.inria.fr:80/caml/FAQ/general-eng.html

and here (for SML, but all the points still hold except the last two):

  http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/sml.html

Suitable for pointing your colleague to, if (s)he wants to know what (CA)ML is
all about.
