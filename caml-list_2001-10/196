Yes.  Currently, the graphics library is not available from
stand-alone Win32 executables, only from the toplevel GUI.

Not yet, but it will be soon.  A proper standalone implementation of
the Graphics library is in progress (by Jacob Navia) and should be
available in the next OCaml release.

That's another option.
