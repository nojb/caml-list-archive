My understanding of this is that this kind of thing would cost more in
paperwork than the real benefit to the consortium, that is why i was
contemplating creating a association in france to group several users
which would, once we are able to sum up the 2000 euros, become one member of
the consortium. I was aiming at a fee of around 50 Euros, this would need at
least 40 members, or for some of them to donate more, or other means of
raising founds.

Sadly, i have not had time to fully devote myself to fullfiling this in the
last month, but now that the subject has surfaced again on this list, it may
be the right time for that.

To create an "association loi 1901" here in strasbourg, we would need to define
the status, and have at least 7 founding members, as well as people willing to
take the administratives jobs like secretary and the financial aspect. It can
happen relatively quickly once we have enough members.

So, unless someone else would like to do the same, it would be nice if
interrested people send me a mail about this, (personal mail at :
luther@dpt-info.u-strasbg.fr), and once a first step of discution is reached,
we will hold a founding meeting, either trough IRC or something such, or
trough a mailing list i will create, the second solution would be maybeeasier
on non european persons.
