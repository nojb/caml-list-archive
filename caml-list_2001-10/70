Congratulations for this very nice piece of work.

A question about comment placement: isn't it a bit inconsistent to
expect comments for record fields to be placed *after* the record,
while the opposite convention is used for object fields?

I would consider it more consistent to always require the comment to
precede the element. The purpose of the current convention concerning
record fields and data constructors seems to be to encourage people
to write comments that fit on the remainder on the line, which is bad
practice anyway.
