Subject: [Caml-list] forward declaration/recursive modules patch by Frabrice?
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


I was cruising through the archives and came across this patch by
Frabrice for enabling recursive modules, at least for function
declarations.

http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/caml-list/1467.html

What's the status on this (the post is from June 1999)?  Since it
didn't get mentioned in any of the threads about module recursion, I'm
assuming it's not "approved of" or something?

Chris
