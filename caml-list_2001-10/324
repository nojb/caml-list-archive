That might be the show-stopper.  There is currently no CORBA binding
for OCaml (although this has been on our to-do list for quite a while).

CamlIDL is a COM binding, and while COM and CORBA have several points
in common, they are sufficiently different that CamlIDL won't help you
much here.

There is always the possibility of generating C++ communication stubs
using omniORB, then connect the Caml code to these stubs by hand.
This is feasible for a small number of CORBA interfaces and methods,
but doesn't scale up.

SunOS 5 (a.k.a. Solaris 2) is well supported and regularly tested.
OCaml used to run under SunOS 4 but hasn't been tested under this
environment in a while.
