You've bumped into a painful quirk of ocaml's object system: self's
type is not xyz, and must be handled with care.

(By the way, your program seemed strange, since you were using self
and abc before defining them, but I suppose it was a copy error, and I
corrected it.)

The general solution to this is to first define a class type:
  class type xyz_t = object ('self)
     method 
       btnNew : ...
       ...
     end

Then change the code in btnNew to
  new abc (self :> xyz_t)

Remark that making xyz_t exact may be a bit lengthy, but you may leave
out methods you don't need to call from abc.

Hope this helps,

Jacques Garrigue
