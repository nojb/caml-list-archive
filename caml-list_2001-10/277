It depends on your notion of "user friendliness": for the tasks it was
mainly aimed at, it seems to be doing an excellent job, IMHO.

I don't think this is true: when I pushed unison at our institute,
it was very quickly taken up by a quite significant number of staff,
both Unix and Windows users. Today it is already available on all of our
machines. It's the only kid in town that can really claim to efficiently,
reliably and securely synchronize both ways across multiple platforms.

Even though this hasn't made anybody switch to OCaml, people have at
least stopped giving me benign smiles when I mention it ;)
