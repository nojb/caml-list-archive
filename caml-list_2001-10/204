I recently built Ocaml 3.03 ALPHA under the latest Cygwin on Win2k, including
XFree86. The graphics library compiles without any problem, but if you
try to use it it, it will fail with an exception because graphics.ml does not
recognize Cygwin as a Unix-type system. This is easily fixed by patching
a definition in graphics.ml to read:

  let (open_graph, close_graph) =
    match Sys.os_type with
    | "Unix" | "Cywgin" -> (unix_open_graph, unix_close_graph)
    | ...

After that, I was able to create and use a graphics toplevel, and also to make
standalone (both bytecode and native) applications without any problems. Of
course, the graphics window shows up in the X server's window.
