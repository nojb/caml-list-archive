While on this subject, it would be very useful if a future roadmap for
Caml development (including any Consortium efforts) were available to look
at publicly.  This was discussed a little in the past and it seemed like
INRIA wanted to keep this information private. 

I can understand motivations to keep quiet about plans but I think it
would really help to open up this information. It may so happen that some
unexpected volunteers are willing to help achieve those goals. 

For example, I am currently working with Jerome to build a test suite for
the libre code. I'm not a big user of regular expressions myself but I
think this is a critical area where Caml could be improved. If I knew of
specific efforts that were being directed by the Consortium, I'd be
inclined to help in a similar fashion with them. Testing software is a
great way for me to learn how to use it.

P.S: Thanks also to Brian for suggesting I put together FORT in the first
place. It seems to be working pretty well in practice.
