There is such a debugging mode in the pushdown automaton used to
execute ocamlyacc parsers, but it is not easily accessible.

You need to build the "debug" version of the bytecode interpreter (cd
runtime ; make ocamlrund), then run your bytecode executable with
"ocamlrund -P myprog".

You then get a trace of shift and reduce actions; tokens read are also
printed, but in such a low-level format that it's nearly useless...

I agree this tracing facility should be made better at some point,
although printing tokens correctly is difficult in general.
