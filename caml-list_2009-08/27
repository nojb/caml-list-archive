How does this follow from Edgar's explanation? (below)

These expressions are semantically equivalent: the former merely =
(locally) aliases the name [l] to the result [!myref] before returning =
it. Aliasing a value is not the same as allocating memory. For example:

let a =3D "1" in
let b =3D a;;

Results in one allocation (a value containing the string "1") and one =
aliasing of the name [b] to represent the same value.

So, considering your example, observe:

let myref =3D ref [1; 2] in
let l =3D !myref in
l =3D=3D !myref;;

which is [true]. [l] and [!myref] are physically the same value - i.e. =
the [let l] expression did not result in an allocation.

Two problems: firstly, let l =3D !myref does not result in an allocation =
(because [l] is simply an alias for the contents of myref at the time of =
the [let]). Secondly, you cannot mess around with !myref - the content =
of a reference is immutable, it is only the reference itself which can =
be changed (notwithstanding 'a ref ref and so on). Once you said =
[List.iter myfun !myref], you pass the contents of [myref] to =
[List.iter] and [myfun] can do whatever it likes with the *reference* =
[myref] without affecting those contents at that point and so the =
processing of [List.iter].

Do you have an actual case which segfaults?
