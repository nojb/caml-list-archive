                     CALL FOR PAPERS :  UML&FM’2009
             2nd INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON UML&FORMAL METHODS
           http://www.artist-embedded.org/artist/UML-FM-2009.html

                Workshop held in conjunction with ICFEM 2009
                    The 11th International Conference on
                       Formal Engineering Methods

************************************************************************

                      Submission deadline: September 30th, 2009
                      -----------------------------------------


Many interest groups from a research perspective are in favour of the
creation of this workshop.

For more than a decade now, the two communities of UML and formal methods
have been working together to produce a simultaneously practical (via UML)
and rigorous (via formal methods) approach to software engineering.

UML is the de facto standard for modelling various aspects of software
systems in both industry and academia, despite the inconvenience that its
current specification is complex and its syntax imprecise.

The fact that the UML semantics is too informal have led many researchers
to formalize it with all kinds of existing formal languages, like OCL, Z,
B, CSP, VDM, Petri Nets, UPPAAL, HOL, Coq, PVS etc.

This first workshop will be open to various subjects as the main objective
is to encourage new initiatives of building bridges between informal,
semi-formal and formal notations.


Topics:
======

This workshop seeks contributions from researchers and practitioners
interested in all aspects of integrating UML and formal methods. To this
end, we solicit papers (no more than 6 pages long) related to, but not
limited to, the following principal topics:

·        Consistent specifications, model transformations (QVT technologies,
          transformation repositories). Transformations to make models more
          analyzable so as to make them executable.

·        Automation of traceability through transformations

·        Refinement techniques: developing detailed design from a UML
          abstract specification

·        Refinement of OCL specification as well

·        Formal reasoning on models for code generation

·        Technologies for compositional verification of models

·        Specification of a formal semantics for the UML.
          Giving an abstract syntax to UML diagrams

·        Formal validation and verification of software

·        Co-modeling methods formal/informal mapping techniques

·        End-to-end methodologies or software process
          engineering,correct-by-construction design providing and
          supporting tools for safety-critical embedded systems design


Workshop Format
===============
This full-day workshop will consist of an introduction of the topic by the
workshop organizers, presentations of accepted papers, and in depth
discussion of previously identified subjects emerging from the
submissions. A summary of the discussions will be made available.


Submission and Publication
==========================
To contribute, please send a position paper or a technical paper

to agusti[dot]canals[at]c-s[dot]fr with “ICFEM09 UML&FM Workshop” in the
title.

2 versions of the papers will be requested :

1/ Short versions : papers should not exceed 6 pages. Submitted
manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of the IEEE CS
Format. Preferably, submissions should be in PDF format.
First, the selected papers will be published online via in the IEEE Xpress
and distributed during the workshop as a Technical Report between
Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro and Telecom-ParisTech

2/ Then, after the workshop (the deadline is not already fixed), as
post-proceedings, all extended versions of accepted papers will be
published in the ISSE NASA journal (Innovations in Systems and Software
Engineering), first edition of 2010.
These papers should not exceed 8 pages. Submitted manuscripts should be in
English and formatted in the style of the ISSE Format. Preferably,
submissions should be in PDF format.
Please, follow the guidelines at the "For authors and editors" heading in
the ISSE website
(http://www.springer.com/computer/programming/journal/11334)
