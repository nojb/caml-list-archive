It does help - I'd not considered Camlp4MacroParser for the job,
thinking that optcomp would have a good way to do exactly what its name
says - optional compilation.

I'm starting to think that optcomp is just a mismatch for what I'm
trying to do, and I'm trying to use the wrong tool for the job.  That
said, I don't think it's the best solution (especially with already long
compile times for the project) to use both optcomp and
Camlp4MacroParser, so I guess I should figure out how to do
	#if ocaml_version < (3, 11)
in Camlp4MacroParser.  I guess autoconf might be of some help here,
although I don't see an easy way to to pass text from an
autoconf-created Makefile through ocamlbuild into only some files' [-pp]
commands.  I think myocamlbuild.ml might be the key, maybe autoconf can
produce it as well as Makefile.
