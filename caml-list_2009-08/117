Looks interresting also.

Thank you both for your advices.

This is also very interresting, and I already tried to install HLVM
once. But my free time, as well as the lack of freely available documentation
on this interresting project, force me to wait longer before jumping in.

I think OCaml's GC is well documented compared to the other parts of the system
(but probably this is because I ignore what everyone involved in writing a
compiler already know).
