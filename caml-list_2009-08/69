Subject: OCaml on Mips for IRIX n32 : why not 64bits ?

The question might look stupid, but I'm wondering why uintnat was
not chosen to be "long long" on this architecture.

Maybe the ARCH_SIXTYFOUR version of Ocaml was not ready at that time ?
Or is there a downside at using the full 64bits registers on this arch
that I'm unable to see ?
