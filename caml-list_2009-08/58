Well, it's not really a bug since the MIPs compiler was tailored for bigendians.
But if one want a MIPS compiler also for little endians this is something that
must be changed in mips/emit.ml (this, and a couple of other things).

For now I'm just experimenting. I will build an actual patch for people interrested
when/if I become confident with the result.

I just learnt that Debian is willing to create a mips64el distribution in addition to
their venerable mips and mipsel versions. OCaml native compiler would be fine to
have.  Anyway, I have many other things to debug (like dynamic sharing)  :)
