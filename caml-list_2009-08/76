               The Eleventh International Conference on
      Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation

                  Madrid, Spain, January 17-19, 2010
                     (Co-located with POPL 2010)

              http://software.imdea.org/events/vmcai10/
----------------------------------------------------------------------

VMCAI  provides  a  forum  for  researchers from  the  communities  of
Verification,    Model   Checking,   and    Abstract   Interpretation,
facilitating  interaction,  cross-fertilization,  and  advancement  of
hybrid methods. VMCAI'10 is co-located with the POPL'10 conference.

The  program of  VMCAI'10 will  consist of  invited  lectures, invited
tutorials,   refereed  research   papers,  and   tool  demonstrations.
Research contributions can report  new results as well as experimental
evaluations  and comparisons of  existing techniques.  Topics include,
but are not limited to:

 program verification         program certification
 model checking               debugging techniques
 abstract interpretation      abstract domains
 static analysis              type systems
 deductive methods            optimization

Submissions   can   address   any  programming   paradigm,   including
concurrent,    constraint,   functional,   imperative,    logic,   and
object-oriented programming.   Papers must describe  original work, be
written and  presented in English, and must  not substantially overlap
with  papers  that have  been  published  or  that are  simultaneously
submitted to a journal or  a conference with refereed proceedings. The
proceedings  will be  published by  Springer in  the Lecture  Notes in
Computer Science series.

The page limit for submissions  is 15 pages in Springer's LNCS format.
Additional material  may be placed in  an appendix, to be  read at the
