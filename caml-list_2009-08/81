	Hi !

Le lundi 17 ao=FBt 2009 15:02:10, Alexy Khrabrov a =E9crit :

I am very happy to see OCaml being adopted widely, and in particular when i=
t=20
come to reliability which is the case here. Otherwise, I don't see the poin=
t=20
in figthing with Haskell, but that's not the topic.

Well, you know, not all the people have the same background. A job interest=
 is=20
very different than a technical interest.

Hence, when discussing about jobs and this stuff, it can quickly show some =
huge=20
differences. For instance, I don't think that OCaml's maintainers at INRIA =
have=20
the same interests about the language than people in Janest. Nor the same=20
income.

Even more, some people contribute to OCaml in their spare time, which means=
=20
they don't get money from it, and probably don't want.

More over, although we are all here to discuss about the technical issues i=
n=20
OCaml, we don't all have the same ideas about external concerns, in particu=
lar=20
finance in my case.

However, even though my first message was probably a bit rude, I did not me=
an=20
to argue in this topic. I don't believe this is a place for that, and, all =
in=20
all, I wish all the best to other contributors to OCaml, although I do not=
=20
necessarily like the application themselves.

Hence, I would argue that a seperation in this topic would be a good thing =
to=20
avoid furstrating people that have different background but would otherwise=
=20
have very fruitful interactions in the pure field of technical concerns abo=
ut=20
OCaml.

I also think it's been enough on this topic, for the very reasons I've just=
=20
explained !


All the best,

Romain
