In no-thread context, it works great... (with pipe and console et al)

Indeed, I miss this case because I don't use thread in ocaml code.
However I don't see interaction between otherlibs/win32unix/select.c and
otherlibs/threads/unix.ml, so I am not sure where the bug comes from.

It also show that pipe/console is not available when you use select with
thread :( 

Something that can change is that we now use WinSock 2.0...
