I think the text above does hint at the range of things we work on in OCaml=
,
but if you want to get a better feel, there are a couple of good sources:
first, there's an article that Stephen Weeks and I wrote for JFP, which you
can find here:

   http://janestreet.com/technology/articles.php

Also, there's video of a talk I gave at CMU:

  http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=3Dnode/61

It's hard to be too precise in a short missive about the kind of things we
do in OCaml, because our use is so diverse.  One of the things that I think
speaks well for OCaml is that we have found it to be highly effective for s=
o
many different kinds of things --- whether we're writing admin tools or
research codes or automated trading systems, it is our tool of choice.

I believe it's fairly well established that job announcements are welcome o=
n
the caml list, and that the appearance of the ocaml-jobs list does not
change that.  Here's a thread that asks and answers that very question.
