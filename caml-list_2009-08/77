I support Yaron's opinion and do not mind the occasional job announcement.

Now if someone could tell me how to receive only those conference
announcements that are relevant to me, that would be a different
story.

P.S. From what I gather Jane Street uses ocaml to get rich by sending
golden coins to itself back in time through tiny short-lived quantum
loops in the spacetime continuum. They invest the golden coins that
trickle in. When the investments result in profit, they send the
profit back in time again, to get even more golden coins in the past.
The Ocaml programmers are responsible for computing the telemetry of
the coins in real time without numerical errors.
