Since you wrote a long mail presenting your activity, it would also be nice=
 to=20
present what you actually *do* with ocaml in this presentation. I guess whe=
n=20
one seeks for a job, he might also care about this aspect, in particular in=

the financial world.

I believe this message are an abuse of the mailing list. It would be more=20
respectful to use the dedicated mailing list, which is clearly indicated in=
=20
the same page where this list is documented, see:
  http://caml.inria.fr/resources/forums.en.html
