It looks good to me.  Further, much of the functionality you're
forbidding yourself in String is provided by Extlib's UTF8 module
without additional dependencies if you do need it at some place in your
program.

You can also go ahead and use buffers, sprintf, etc., so long as
everything is valid UTF-8.  They won't care; they'll only see a sequence
of bytes.
