When I re-sent the e-mail under my subscribed address I should have
further clarified my statement. If my initial e-mail address had been
allowed through it would have been self-evident. All of my
professional time is spent doing things like lock pushdown in the
network stack, identifying and eliminating false sharing between
structures, minimizing lock contention in the file system, 10GigE
network drivers etc. All of which is done in 'C' and will be for the
foreseeable future. Consequently, there is a gap between my areas of
expertise and the areas where functional programming comes in to play.
Thus, unless I shift my work in to one of those areas or pick up a
side project there I don't see how Ocaml could play a large role in my
life. My interest is purely out of intellectual curiosity.

I apologize for the confusion. I was not slighting functional
programming - just pointing out that even though I do not have any use
for the job postings I do not find them to be out of place.

Cheers
