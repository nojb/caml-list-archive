Hello !

Suppose I want to learn how ML is compiled, and especialy how OCaml is
compiled, it's various internal lambda representations and the like.
Would this book :

http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Compiler-Implementation-Andrew-Appel/dp/0521607647/

be a good one ?

It's hard to tell what this book's worth from the customer advices ; it's
especialy hard to tell if it fits well to OCaml or not.
