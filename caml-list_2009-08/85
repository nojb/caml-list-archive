I don't anticipate ever doing functional programming professionally
and I have absolutely no interest in ever living in New York or
London. Moving back to Japan would be fun but for the fact that my
wife speaks no Japanese and forcing my friends to speak English or
having a running translation of the dialog is simply not realistic.
Nonetheless, the number of employers using Ocaml is currently
sufficiently small in number that periodically hearing about
employment opportunities is interesting to me as a reminder that it
isn't just a research language. That said, if it were to ever reach
even the level of the innumerable niche conference announcements then
a push to ocaml-jobs would probably be appropriate.

Cheers
