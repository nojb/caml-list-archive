This is a bug and should be reported in Mantis - [length] comes from an
external file so there should be an ext_ref annotation in the .annot file.

Define costly! I've never noticed Vim's interpreted, probably non-optimised
internal script language taking a significant amount of time to process the
.annot files (many of which are several megabytes) for all of my sources
every time I open the corresponding .ml file.

How much have you changed in the compiler? While compiling foo.ml, all
external references are already compiled (or you'll get an error that the
.cmi file for an interface is missing). The compiler also gives as much info
in the .annot file for sources which contain errors already. Surely the .cmi
file must contain enough information virtually by definition - it's all the
compiler had to go on in the first place!

My impression reading this list is that the majority of the community would
like it included in the main OCaml distribution but let's not re-open that
thread of discussion again ;o) If someone's willing to install a tool like
ocamlspot involving, at present, a patched compiler then I'd imagine that
they'd not have too much issue installing findlib too...
