The School of Computer Science is about to advertise 2 chairs (full professor),
1 lectureship (assistant professor) and 2 postdoctoral research fellowships,
with a closing date of 27th February 2009.  The posts are sponsored by
SICSA (the Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance).

http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/sicsa-ad

The chairs and lectureship are permanent, tenured positions.  The fellowships
are three-year positions.  There will be additional lectureships advertised in
the future.

Applications from good researchers welcomed.

I would be happy to answer general questions about the School, town etc., of
course.

Best Wishes,
Kevin
