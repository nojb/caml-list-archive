I believe he's not referring to simultaneous use of pa_monad and another
extension in user code, but of Camlp4MacroParser *in* the sources of pa_monad.
Since pa_monad is build with

  ocamlc -I +camlp4 -pp camlp4orf -c pa_monad.ml

changing that to 

  ocamlc -I +camlp4 -pp "camlp4orf Camlp4MacroParser.cmo" -c pa_monad.ml

might work.
