-------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Scope

Modern software lives in a concurrent world.  The ubiquity of the
Internet allows distributed software components to be composed into
complex networked systems.  At the other end of the spectrum, with
multicore processors now the norm, concurrency is frequently necessary
to maximize application performance.

Coordination 2009 seeks high-quality papers on programming languages,
models, and architectures that address the challenge of building
robust distributed and concurrent applications.  The conference
focuses on the design and implementation of models that allow
compositional construction of large-scale concurrent and distributed
systems, including both practical and foundational models, runtime
systems, and related verification and analysis techniques.

			  Topics of Interest

DISTRIBUTED AND CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING MODELS: multicore programming,
     stream programming, data parallel programming, event-driven
     programming, web programming

FOUNDATIONS OF DISTRIBUTED AND CONCURRENT INTERACTION:
     models for processes, service composition and orchestration, workflow
     management, data query, tuple spaces

SPECIFICATION, VERIFICATION, AND TYPES: modeling and analysis of types
     and properties related to security, dependability, resource
     consumption, and component conformance for concurrent and
     distributed systems

HIGH-LEVEL OPTIMIZATIONS: program transformations for performance
     enhancement, runtime load balancing techniques, static and
     dynamic resource management

QUALITY OF SERVICE: fault-tolerant programming models and runtime support,
    models with responsiveness guarantees

DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT: component and module systems for
     distributed software, dynamic software evolution and update
     technologies, configuration and deployment architectures

SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMMING MODELS: P2P frameworks, mobile ad-hoc
     networks, sensor networks, publish-subscribe systems, event
     processing

CASE STUDIES: application of novel distributed and concurrent
     techniques in business process modeling, e-commerce, factory
     automation, collaboration, command and control

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
