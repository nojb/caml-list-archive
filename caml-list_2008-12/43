I'm curious as well.  I've never used F#, but the fact that they've
removed functors and polymorphic variants -- two of the most
interesting Ocaml features -- gives me at first glance an impression
that F# is a castrated Ocaml.  (Though I understand that some
of these changes were necessary to integrate into the .Net world).

I would like to hear the other side: features new to F# that
would also be welcome in Ocaml, especially those that are not
implemented already by some Camlp4 extension.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
