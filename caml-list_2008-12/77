Hi all,

If you are doing something exciting that involves programming languages (ocaml
or other) and security, consider submitting to PLAS! (Apologies for multiple
postings.)

                    ACM SIGPLAN Fourth Workshop on
     Programming Languages and Analysis for Security (PLAS 2009)

                    Dublin, Ireland, June 15, 2009

                       Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN
                       Co-located with PLDI '09
           Supported by IBM Research and Microsoft Research

           http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~naumann/plas2009.html

                  Submission Deadline: April 3, 2009



Call for Papers

PLAS aims to provide a forum for exploring and evaluating ideas on the
use of programming language and program analysis techniques to improve
the security of software systems. Strongly encouraged are proposals of
new, speculative ideas; evaluations of new or known techniques in
practical settings; and discussions of emerging threats and important
problems.

The scope of PLAS includes, but is not limited to:

    * Language-based techniques for security
    * Verification of security properties in software
    * Automated introduction and/or verification of security
      enforcement mechanisms
    * Program analysis techniques for discovering security
      vulnerabilities
    * Compiler-based security mechanisms, such as host-based intrusion
      detection and in-line reference monitors
    * Specifying and enforcing security policies for information flow
      and access control
    * Model-driven approaches to security
    * Applications, examples, and implementations of these security
      techniques in domains including web applications, embedded
      software, etc.



Important Dates and Submission Guidelines

  * Submission due date: Friday, April 3, 2009
  * Author notification: Friday, May 1, 2009
  * Revised papers due: TBA
  * Student travel grant applications due: Friday, May 29, 2009 
  * PLAS 2009 workshop: Monday, June 15, 2009

We invite papers of two kinds: (1) Technical papers about relatively
mature work, for "long" presentations during the workshop, and (2)
papers for "short" presentations about more preliminary work, position
statements, or work that is more exploratory in nature.  Short papers
marked as "Informal Presentation" will have only their abstract
published in the proceedings.  All other papers will be included in
the formal proceedings and must describe original work in compliance
with the SIGPLAN republication policy.  Page limits are 12 pages for
long papers and 6 pages for short papers.



Student Travel Grants

Student attendees of PLAS can apply for a travel grant (in addition to
any PLDI grants), thanks to the generous support of IBM Research and
Microsoft Research. The application forms will be on the workshop web
site.
