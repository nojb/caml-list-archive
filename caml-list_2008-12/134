Yes.

Yes. I will, most likely, work on this as a fun project for as long as 
possible in an attempt to build something vaguely inspiring before I put the 
code up somewhere (e.g. OCamlForge). I will be more than happy to give 
contributors commit access to the source because I am very busy with 
unrelated projects. If anyone is desperately keen to have a play then I'll 
consider putting it up immediately.

The only thing that some might object to is that I would like to make this a 
commerce-friendly platform if possible, i.e. facilitate the buying and 
selling of libraries built upon this platform. I don't see that this desire 
has any negative effects but I believe the presence of a commercial platform 
built around such a foundation would help to provide much-needed resources to 
fund further work.

I should also mention that several other people are working on similar things, 
also building upon LLVM. Someone has even tried to contribute an ML 
implementation to LLVM itself as a configuration tool:
