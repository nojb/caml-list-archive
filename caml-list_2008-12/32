Fedora Rawhide [the experimental/development version of Fedora] has
been completely rebuilt with OCaml 3.11.0, and all library and
application problems that were found have been patched.

List of packages:

  http://cocan.org/fedora#Package_status

You can get Fedora Rawhide from:

  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide

but you may prefer to use stable Fedora 10 which was released last
week and includes OCaml 3.10.2.

I should have sent upstream any patches that I had to add, but in case
I missed anyone out you can grab the patches we are using from here:

  http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/devel/

Rich.
