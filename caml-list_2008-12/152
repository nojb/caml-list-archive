Call for Papers

The First International Workshop on the Critical Computer Based Systems
(CCBS'09) 2009
Monte Carlo Resort=20
Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (July 13-17, 2009)
http://people.cs.und.edu/~reza/CCBS09.htm
=20
=20
The construction of dependable and complex computer-based systems demands
the interaction and involvement of industry and academy.
Industry involvement is essential since it poses practical and challenging
problems for academic researchers. Therefore, the main idea
behind organizing the CCBS=B909 is to provide a platform in which to discuss
both theoretical and practical results relevant to the engineering
of highly sophisticated and critical systems that are used in automotive,
avionics, railway, naval, chemical, nuclear, manufacturing, and
medical industries.
You are invited to submit a paper that documents research studies and
applications related to the engineering of high-assurance systems in the
aforementioned=20
industries with special emphasis on using model-based design and testing
paradigms. Papers reporting industrial experiences using methodologies and
tools to=20
manage the complexity of these systems are especially welcome.
Papers will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity, and
soundness. All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceeding=
s
and will be=20
indexed in major on-line archives (including DBLP). Extended and revised
versions of selected papers will be also published by the International
Journal of Critical Computer Based Systems (IJCCBS).
