X-Miltered: at concorde with ID 49380805.000 by Joe's j-chkmail (http://j-chkmail . ensmp . fr)!

That depends on the threat model.  If the question is, "presuming no active attack, how likely is it to break?", then the cryptanalytic results against the hash are irrelevant.  If the question is "how secure is it if someone is maliciously manipulating files", then they are certainly relevant.

If you're operating between reasonably secure machines, where an attacker having write access is already more catastrophic than a failure of Unison, then the first is what matters.  If someone else has control over some of the files, then you've gotta watch the second.
