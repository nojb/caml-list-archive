This idea rocks! The best way is to begin by providing a basic patch and
follow this explanation:
http://et.redhat.com/~rjones/how-to-supply-code-to-open-source-projects/
(even if it is not said, half of the people involved are OCaml
developers).

The other idea is that the smallest is the best. That's why your idea
rocks. If the possibility to dynamically load backend is small, it will
be a very good first step.

When you will have made this first step (that can profit to all), you
can either submit your backend or provide it by any other mean.
