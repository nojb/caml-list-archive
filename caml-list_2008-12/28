OXFORD UNIVERSITY COMPUTING LABORATORY

Fully Funded D.Phil (PhD) Studentship

Project: ConDOR: Consequence-Driven Ontology Reasoning

The Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Group is offering a fully fund=
ed D. Phil (PhD) position at Oxford University's Computing Laboratory. Th=
e post is funded by EPSRC as part of the ConDOR project [1]. The aim of t=
he project is to investigate alternative kinds of "consequence driven" re=
asoning procedures for widely used knowledge representation formalisms, i=
ncluding the W3C's OWL ontology language [2].

The studentship is fully funded (at EU fees level), and includes a stipen=
d of at least =A312,940 per year as well as provision for travel to confe=
rences. Students admitted with a start date between 1st January and 1st O=
ctober, 2009 will receive a guarantee of 3 years funding. The successful =
candidate will join an internationally renowned research group [2] workin=
g on a cutting edge research problem in an attractive and stimulating env=
ironment within one of the worlds leading universities and computer scien=
ce departments [3].

Further details, including eligibility requirements and application are a=
vailable from [4]. Prospective candidates are also welcome to contact Dr =
Yevgeny Kazakov (yevgeny.kazakov@comlab.ox.ac.uk) or Prof Ian Horrocks (i=
an.horrocks@comlab.ox.ac.uk) for further information about the project an=
d/or the post.

The closing date for applications is Tuesday 20th January 2009.

Oxford University is and Equal Opportunities Employer.
