It would greatly help to know what the INRIA team would consider as
acceptable ahead of doing the work. What kind of guidlines would you
advise me to follow? I guess I can add new passes but can I modify
existing ones?

The ideal solution would be to open the back-end using the dynlink
library. I've done it with 3.11 to speed up development. The back-end is now
a cmo file. I separately compile copt0.cmo, copt1.cmo... with different
back-ends. Then I can use command like: ocamlopt -copt copt0.cmo myfile.ml
to compile with my back-end.
But even though that's a small change I'm not sure the INRIA guys would
like it, right?

That sounds great, thanks. I'll follow up when I have the need to do that
(e.g. when
I get the above info and actually start the work).

Cheers
