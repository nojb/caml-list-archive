Subject: [Caml-list] nonblock socket in Windows

Hello

I want to have non-blocking sockets for a UDP client/server.  I use
the Unix.set_nonblock which works fine in Linux, but the manual tells
me that in Windows (Win32):

"set_nonblock, clear_nonblock	implemented as dummy functions; use threads 
instead of non-blocking I/O"

I would like to avoid threads, and on the other hand there is the
ioctlsocket function in Windows which seems to do it. So why isn't
this implemented in ocaml ?
