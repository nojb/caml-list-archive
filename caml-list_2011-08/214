Information hiding and extensibility via C++ virtual member functions
are orthogonal concepts. It seems to me that, historically, the benefit
of OO was essentially code organisation and reusability. Making it
"easier" was the main benefit over C. Compared to that, information
hiding isn't that great of a benefit compared to what you could already
do in C. In a sense, information hiding is more of a refinement, and not
the core concept of OO.

At least that my take on it.
