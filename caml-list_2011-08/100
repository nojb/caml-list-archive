Subject: [Caml-list] native plugin ocaml-mysql



Hello,

I am trying to compile a plugin for ocaml-mysql, in order to use it with the
native version of the ocsigen webserver. I ran into the following problem:

ocamlopt -shared -linkall  -o mysql.cmxs mysql.cmxa

 usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmysql_stubs
 collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
 File "caml_startup", line 1, characters 0-1:
 Error: Error during linking

I looked at how mysql.cmxa was compiled :

   ocamlopt -a -cclib -lmysql_stubs -cclib -lzocamlopt -o mysql.cmxa mysql.cmx

which does not raise any error, and tried :

    ocamlopt -shared -cclib -lmysql_stubs -cclib -lzocamlopt  -o mysql.cmxs
mysql.cmx

    with the same error.


Any idea on how to make that native plugin ?


Cheers

 -Pierre
