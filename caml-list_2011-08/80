Subject: [Caml-list] Continuation Workshop 2011: Call for participation


       ACM SIGPLAN Continuation Workshop 2011
	 http://logic.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/cw2011/
        co-located with ICFP 2011, Tokyo, Japan
             Saturday, September 24, 2011

       Call for Participation
       Early Registration deadline is August 15!


Continuations have been discovered many times, which highlights their
many applications in programming language semantics and program
analysis, linguistics, logic, parallel processing, compilation and web
programming.  Recently, there has been a surge of interest
specifically in delimited continuations: new implementations (in
Scala, Ruby, OCaml, Haskell), new applications (to probabilistic
programming, event-driven distributed processing), substructural and
constructive logics, natural language semantics.

The goal of the Continuation Workshop is to make continuations more
accessible and useful -- to practitioners and to researchers in
various areas of computer science and outside computer science. We
wish to promote communication among the implementors and users in many
fields. We would like to publicize the applications of continuations
in academic (logic, linguistics) and practical fields and various
programming languages (OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Ruby, Scheme, etc.).
