Yes.  The C compiler can see that the address of list has been passed to ex=
ternal functions in CAMLlocal, so has to assume the worst: that the address=
 is stored in some global variable, and caml_copy_string or the functions i=
t calls can access it and thereby change the value of list.  If the compile=
r is a spectacularly optimizing one (i.e. performs a ton of inter-module pr=
ocedure inlining and/or very careful escape analysis), it *may* be able to =
prove that this never happens, and therefore would be allowed to optimize t=
he call in the manner proposed.  In this case, of course, "the worst" actua=
lly happens, so such a proof must fail; if the proof does not fail, the com=
piler has a bug.
