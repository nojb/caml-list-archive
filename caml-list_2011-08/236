Subject: [Caml-list] plot library

Hi,

I have a simple dataset that I would like to plot.
My file contains:
Food 	2000 	2001 	2002 	2003
Banana 	4 	5 	5 	2
Lemon 	1 	2 	3 	4
Orange 	2 	2 	1 	3

and I want to display on the same plot the evolution of the food with some automatic
colors assigned to each food and automatic labeling. 

What do we have in ocaml to do that? plplot is the best library?
