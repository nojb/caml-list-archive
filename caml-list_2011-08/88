Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Piqi-0.5.6 released

Hello,

It is my pleasure to announce the new Piqi-0.5.6 release.

Piqi is a data serialization system for OCaml and Erlang. Starting
from this release, it supports 4 serialization formats: Google
Protocol Buffers, JSON, XML and Piq.

Some other new features include:

* An option to use OCaml arrays instead of lists for representing Piqi
lists and repeated fields.

* The ability to serialize arbitrary monomorphic OCaml types by
mapping them to already supported or defined Piqi types. This
mechanism can be used, for example, for serializing OCaml chars as
integers, bigints as decimal strings, or even "string
Map.Make(String).t" as list of {key, value} records.

* Support for “packed” binary encoding for primitive numeric types.
This is a compact encoding for representing repeated int, float or
bool values in Protocol Buffers.

* Windows builds using either Cygwin or MinGW.
