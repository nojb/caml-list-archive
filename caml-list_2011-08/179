                     University of Cambridge
                    Cambridge, 18-23 June 2012

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission Deadline for LNCS:                   Jan. 20, 2012
Notification of authors:                        Mar. 16, 2012

CiE 2012 is one of a series of special events, running throughout the Alan
Turing Year, celebrating Turing's unique impact on mathematics, computing,
computer science, informatics, morphogenesis, artificial intelligence,
cryptology, philosophy and the wider scientific world.

Its central theme is the computability-theoretic concerns underlying the
broad spectrum of Turing's interests, and the contemporary research areas
founded upon and animated by them. In this sense, CiE 2012, held in
Cambridge in the week running up to the centenary of Turing's birthday,
deals with the essential core of what made Turing's contribution so
influential and long-lasting.

CiE 2012 promises to be an event worthy of the remarkable scientific
career it commemorates.

CiE 2012 will be associated/co-located with a number of other Turing
centenary events, including:

* ACE 2012, June 15-16, 2012

* Computability and Complexity in Analysis (CCA 2012), June 24-27, 2012
 http://cca-net.de/cca2012/

* Developments in Computational Models (DCM 2012), June 17, 2012
 http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/DCM2012/

* THE INCOMPUTABLE at Kavli Royal Society International Centre
 Chicheley Hall, June 12-15, 2012
 http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/inc/

We particularly welcome submissions in emergent areas, such as
bioinformatics and natural computation, where they have a basic connection
with computability.

CiE 2012 will have a special relationship to the scientific legacy of Alan
Turing, reflected in the broad theme: How the World Computes, with all its
different layers of meaning. Contributions which are directly related to
the visionary and seminal work of Turing will be particularly welcome.

Contributed papers will be selected from submissions received by the
PROGRAM COMMITTEE consisting of:

* Samson Abramsky (Oxford)             * Pieter Adriaans (Amsterdam)
* Franz Baader (Dresden)               * Arnold Beckmann (Swansea)
* Mark Bishop (London)                 * Paola Bonizzoni (Milan)
* Luca Cardelli (Cambridge)            * Douglas Cenzer (Gainesville)
* S Barry Cooper (Leeds, Co-chair)     * Ann Copestake (Cambridge)
* Anuj Dawar (Cambridge, Co-chair)     * Solomon Feferman (Stanford)
* Bernold Fiedler (Berlin)             * Luciano Floridi (Hertfordshire)
* Martin Hyland (Cambridge)            * Marcus Hutter (Canberra)
* Viv Kendon (Leeds)                   * Stephan Kreutzer (Oxford)
* Ming Li (Waterloo)                   * Benedikt Loewe (Amsterdam)
* Angus MacIntyre (London)             * Philip Maini (Oxford)
* Larry Moss (Bloomington)             * Amitabha Mukerjee (Kanpur)

* Rineke Verbrugge (Groningen)

The PROGRAMME COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers (European and
non-European) in computability related areas to submit their papers (in
PDF-format, max 10 pages) for presentation at CiE 2012. We particularly
invite papers that build bridges between different parts of the research
community.

For submission details, see:
http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/WScie12/give-page.php?12

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer Verlag.
There will also be post-conference publications, drawing on contributions
presented at the conference.

The conference is sponsored by the ASL, EACSL, IFCoLog, King's College
Cambridge and Microsoft Research.
