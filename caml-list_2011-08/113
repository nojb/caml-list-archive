Subject: Re: [Caml-list] typer strangeness (3.12.0)

Thank you very much for these additional explanations.
Not that I understood much, but next time I encounter such
a strange behavior I will know that my simple programs are
made more complex because it's helping some superior lifeform
somewhere in the galaxy to make much more complex programs. :)

(that plus the browser cache-thing, I feel exta stupid this morning :))
