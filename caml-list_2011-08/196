Subject: [Caml-list] output-obj rule in ocamlbuild

Is there a built-in rule in ocamlbuild to generate the -output-obj output instead of a direct link?

I note there are these built-in tags in the ocamlbuild source:

ocaml_specific.ml:flag ["ocaml"; "link"; "native"; "output_obj"] (A"-output-obj");;
ocaml_specific.ml:flag ["ocaml"; "link"; "byte"; "output_obj"] (A"-output-obj");;

...but I can't find a built-in target that uses these tags. Is a custom rule in myocamlbuild.ml needed here, or should I do something in my _tags file?

cheers,
Anil
