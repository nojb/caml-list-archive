I don't think that OO is not that much used because error messages may be
long: there is the same issue with the module system which is now quite
widely used. Personally I'm not so unhappy with a 1.000 lines-long error
message : last Friday again, I get an error message with many more than
100.000 lines (when compiling a file with less than 1.000 lines of code): it
took several minutes to be printed and few seconds to be fixed: the 2 last
lines of the message was the familiar "values do not match val v: tau1 is
not included in val v: tau2" which was easy to fix in that case...
