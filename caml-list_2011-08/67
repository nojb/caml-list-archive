If you want windows libraries *quickly*, tap into opensuse's packages.

Fridrich Strba is making an awesome work about that. Many libraries,
and all working well.
Since you're getting windows libraries, you don't have to care if
they're from some linux distribution or another one as long you remain
consistent. The only issue you might be facing is whether you can run
their i686-w64-mingw32-gcc binary on your current distribution.

You can find the packages ("236" currently) at:
  https://build.opensuse.org/project/list?searchtext=windows%3Amingw&excludefilter=home%3A

Debian also has working binaries for windows but they use the
mingw.org and their own prefix (i586-msvc or something like that,
which is completely not standard and which doesn't really have a
reason to exist</rant>). Fedora has some too but I think that OpenSuse
has the biggest set of libraries.

As a note about the "i686-w64-mingw32" triplet, and its
"x86_64-w64-mingw32" friend, which are both weird and annoying to
type.
The trailing "32" should disappear and the "w64" wasn't really chosen
by the mingw-w64 project but by binutils as far as I know (let's hope
it changes).
Also, even though it's called "mingw-w64", it's possible to compile
32bit and 64bit applications for windows. Both are working well and
equally supported.


Hope this helps,

Adrien Nader
