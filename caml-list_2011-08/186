Apple dropped their restrictions on languages for iOS around a year
ago.  The press release is still available here:

    http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09statement.html

We (Psellos) are selling an app written in OCaml in the app store
right now, in fact.  It's called Cassino, and plays a card game.  At
the risk of too much self-promotion, here is a link:

   http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cassino/id411381417

We've had no trouble getting versions of the app approved by Apple.
(Granted, we're not a big enough player to merit a lot of scrutiny.)

When we started porting OCaml to iPhone, it was with the attitude of
doing something slightly crazy, but it has worked out pretty well.
I think OCaml has real advantages for writing iOS apps, and it has
also been more fun and interesting than the usual coding for the
"mobile space".
