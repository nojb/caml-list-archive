Subject: Re: [Caml-list] filename and line number.

Thanks for the replies,

Using cppo, would I need to define 'loc' in each file using log, or can 
it be defined in another module?

If not, I guess the alternative is to create a syntax extenstion that 
will include Loc.t structure as a parameter to some print function - or 
add it manually, but I would like to avoid cluttering the code with 
__LOCATION__ everywhere.

Regards
Anders Fugmann
