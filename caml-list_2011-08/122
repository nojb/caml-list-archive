Subject: [Caml-list] [ANNOUNCE] llpp v7

Hello,

New version of llpp is now available (tagged v7) at
http://repo.or.cz/w/llpp.git

Blurb:

llpp a graphical PDF viewer which aims to superficially resemble
less(1)

Changes (relative to v5):

* Human readable/editable configuration file
* Optional (default on) proportional display (for documents with variable
  width pages)
* Better pixmap cache
* Bird's eye (aka thumbnail) mode
* Help and info/setup modes (accessible by pressing 'h' and 'i' respectively)
* UI font handling was redone, i.e. Glut bitmap character API was
  replaced with Tor Andersson's glfont

  Rationale
   * bitmap characters are very very slow
   * the coverage of builtin fixed/helvetica/courier/times is tiny, so
     that not even cyrillic is visible in outlines
   * bitmaps live in their special raster world in OpenGL
   * bitmaps can not be made antialiased (glfont can be made aliased
     should there be a need)

* Tweaks all over the place (autoscrolling/zooming/user defined knobs/etc)

This version is known to work on Linux(ppc/x86_64), FreeBSD (Juergen
Lock), Mac OS X(x86_64). It used to work on Mac OS X/ppc[32|64] and
Windows XP(i386)/Vista (x86_64) in the past, but wasn't tested there
in a while.

OS X and Windows are second class citizens though.
