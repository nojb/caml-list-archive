The ability to put either the timestamp or the pid is just a possibility;
you can as well just use a "constant" file name. In that latter case, the
file will be replaced at each rotation.

The feature of rotating not on time information but on the reception
of a signal seems quite easy to add.

My bad, the documentation is lacking the following information:
if you use "<stdout>" (without the quotes) as the filename, then
the data will be written on standard output.

As I have other incentives to publish an updated version of Bolt,
I will try to release a version featuring that signal thing "soon".
