Hi Xavier,

When we tried bolt, the main issue was log rotation. We wanted to make 
sure that logs were rotated so they would not fill up all disk space.

Bolt does indeed do log rotation, but the files created files by bold 
includes either timestamp or pid, which changes between program 
invocation. This makes to harder to see which file is the current, and 
leaves a lot of log files during development.

We therefore decided to send all log to stdout, and capture it though a 
simple program that would reopen the file when it received SIGHUP.
(Logging to stdout is also helpful when developing).

As we no longer used Bolt for log rotation, we decided to leave bolt, 
keeping external dependencies down.

If bolt had the ability to reopen the log file on SIGHUB (or a function 
to reopen the log file), we would probably still be using it. That 
combined with the ability to log to stdout when developing would make it 
very useful.

Regards
