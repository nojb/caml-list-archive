I fully agree that too much log information makes to log pretty useless.
But I was not allowed to use __LOCATION__ all over the place, so I wrote 
a small syntax extension that will automatically call our log function 
with location as argument.

We actually did try it out, but we could not get it to do log rotation 
properly. We ended up logging to stdout and pipe stdout through a 
program that would send all data to disk, and reopen files whenever it 
received HUP sigal. logrotate would then do the actual log rotation.

Thanks for all the suggestions and pointers. Very helpful indeed.
