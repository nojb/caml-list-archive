Subject: [Caml-list] Extended Deadline: CFP 2011 Symposium on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages

The IFL deadline for submissions has been moved to the end of August. We already
have a great program scheduled (to be posted shortly), and hope to get a few more
interesting late additions because of this extension.

CALL FOR PAPERS

23rd Symposium on Implementation and
Application of Functional Languages (IFL 2011)
October 3-5, 2011
University of Kansas
Lawrence, Kansas, USA
http://www.ittc.ku.edu/ifl2011


The Symposium returns to the US this year, hosted by the University of Kansas,
in scenic Lawrence, Kansas. Lawrence is a lively college town less than an hour
from Kansas City and the Kansas City International Airport (MCI). The symposium
dates are October 3-5, 2011.

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2011 will be a venue for researchers to present and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2011 will use a post-symposium review process
to produce formal proceedings which will be published by Springer Verlag in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All participants in IFL 2011 are
invited to submit either a draft paper or an extended abstract describing work
to be presented at the symposium. At no time may work submitted to IFL be
simultaneously submitted to other venues. Here we follow the ACM Sigplan
republication policy: http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm.

The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to make sure
they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the draft proceedings
distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing in the draft proceedings
are not peer-reviewed publications. After the symposium, authors will be given
the opportunity to incorporate the feedback from discussions at the symposium
and will be invited to submit a revised full article for the formal review
process. These revised submissions will be reviewed by the program committee
using prevailing academic standards to select the best articles, which will
appear in the formal proceedings.

INVITED SPEAKER

Bryan O-Sullivan, author of Real World Haskell, and co-founder of
MailRank, Inc.

TOPICS

IFL welcomes submissions describing practical and theoretical work as well as
submissions describing applications and tools. If you are not sure that your
work is appropriate for IFL 2011, please contact the PC chair at
andygill@ittc.ku.edu. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

language concepts
type checking
contracts
compilation techniques
staged compilation
runtime function specialization
runtime code generation
partial evaluation
(abstract) interpretation
generic programming techniques
automatic program generation
array processing
concurrent/parallel programming
concurrent/parallel program execution
functional programming and embedded systems
functional programming and web applications
functional programming and security
novel memory management techniques
runtime profiling and performance measurements
debugging and tracing
virtual/abstract machine architectures
validation and verification of functional programs
tools and programming techniques
industrial applications of functional programming

PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended abstracts to be
published in the draft proceedings and to present them at the symposium. All
contributions must be written in English, conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS
series format and not exceed 16 pages. The draft proceedings will appear as a
technical report of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science of the University of Kansas.

(We are more liberal with the draft proceedings, also accepting (for example)
longer papers or SIGPLAN 2 column 12 page papers. For other formats contact
the chair. For the consideration for the final proceedings, the 16 page
LNCS format is required.)

PETER LANDIN PRIZE

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the symposium
every year. The honored article is selected by the program committee based on
the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize carries a
cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
