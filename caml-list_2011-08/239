Just installed it. Works fine. But I could not find a way to draw the legend
and label manually things.

For instance on 
Food 	2000 	2001 	2002 	2003
Banana 	4 	5 	5 	2
Lemon 	1 	2 	3 	4
Orange 	2 	2 	1 	3

What would be the call to Archimedes.stack ... 
to get the stacked bars with the right labeling and not too bad color (let's say red/green/blue for banana/lemon/orange).
