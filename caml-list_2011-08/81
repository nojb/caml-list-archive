Subject: [Caml-list] Second CFP: PEPM12 - Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation


ACM SIGPLAN 2012 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
January 23-24, 2012. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA (co-located with POPL'12)

Call For Papers
Paper submission deadline: Mon, October 10, 2011, 23:59, GMT

http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM12

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the broad area of program transformation,
which spans from refactoring, partial evaluation, supercompilation,
fusion and other metaprogramming to model-driven development, program
analyses including termination, inductive programming, program
generation and applications of machine learning and probabilistic
search. PEPM focuses on techniques, supporting theory, tools, and
applications of the analysis and manipulation of programs. Each
technique or tool of program manipulation should have a clear,
although perhaps informal, statement of desired properties, along with
an argument how these properties could be achieved.

Topics of interest for PEPM'12 include, but are not limited to:

 - Program and model manipulation techniques such as:
   supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program 
   adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, 
   symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

 - Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
   manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination
   checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, 
   automated testing and test case generation.

 - Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
   metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
   languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged
   computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.

 - Application of the above techniques including case studies of
   program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
   projects and software development processes,  descriptions of
   robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
   benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy
   program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, 
   visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, 
   middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and 
   web-based applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will
continue the category of `short papers' for tool demonstrations and
for presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of
interesting academic, industrial and open-source applications that are
new or unfamiliar.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to
help cover travel expenses and other support.

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal
proceedings published by ACM Press and will be included in the ACM Digital
Library. Selected papers may later on be invited for a journal special
issue dedicated to PEPM'12.


Submission Categories and Guidelines

Authors are strongly encouraged to consult the advice for authoring
research papers and tool papers before submitting. The PC Chairs
welcome any inquiries about the authoring advice.

Regular research papers must not exceed 10 pages in ACM Proceedings
style.  Short papers are up to 4 pages in ACM Proceedings
style. Authors of tool demonstration proposals are expected to present
a live demonstration of the described tool at the workshop (tool
papers should include an additional appendix of up to 6 extra pages
giving the outline, screenshots, examples, etc.  to indicate the
content of the proposed live demo at the workshop).
