Ah, my bad - I mistakenly thought the mingw32 was the project and w64 the architecture! 

I'm probably being low, but is the main benefit of using mingw-w64-mingw32 over the version shipped with Cygwin (-mno-cygwin) simply that the latter isn't working with 3.12.1 or is there another reason for using it?

I thought that one had been fixed (but clearly not, looking at my 1.2.7 META file for camlp4) - worth sending upstream to Gerd.

Going back to your original question - did those instructions work for zlib?
