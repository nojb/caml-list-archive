Subject: Re: [Caml-list] filename and line number.

Both pa_macros and cppo have a file-inclusion directive, so you could
define your preferred location-reporting macro in a header file.
That said, I would personally use the __LOCATION__ macro directly: the
less preprocessing stuff the better, and if it "clutters your code"
you could restrict your reporting a bit, which may not be a bad thing:
having a log full of useless stuff is only a bit better than having no
log.

You may also be interested in the existing logging frameworks for
OCaml, such as Bolt:
