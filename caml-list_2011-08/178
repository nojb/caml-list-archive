Subject: [Caml-list] OpenGL ES for iPhone Simulator; working example app

Greetings,

A while back I modified LablGL to work with OpenGL ES 1.1, calling my
modified version LablGLES.  Just recently I got LablGLES working in the
iPhone Simulator, which I've found to be a nice prototyping environment
for iOS projects.

I also made an example LablGLES app that works on both the iPhone
Simulator and the iPhone itself.  It's called IcosaBlue, since it
displays a rotating blue icosahedron.  It's very simple, but it's a
complete example of an OpenGL ES iPhone app coded in OCaml.

For those interested in trying OpenGL ES on iPhone and the iPhone
Simulator, I've released sources and binaries for everything.  Here are
some links:

  [LablGLES, OpenGL ES for iPhone and iPhone Simulator][1]
  [IcosaBlue, rotating blue icosahedron using LablGLES][2]
  [General page of OCaml-on-iOS resources][3]
  [Home of LablGL, OCaml OpenGL interface by Jacques Garrigue][4]

[3]: http://psellos.com/ocaml/
[4]: http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgl.html

I'd be happy to hear from anybody interested in OCaml on iOS.
