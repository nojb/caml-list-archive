                                Birds of a Feather sessions (BOFs)

     Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop (CUFP 2011)

                                        http://cufp.org/bofs-2011
                                  Tokyo, Japan, September 22 - 23

=========================================================

Following last year's success, CUFP 2011 will again include Birds of a
Feather sessions. BoFs provide a place for our community to gather
informally at CUFP and reach consensus on matters of importance. Any CUFP
attendee can propose a BoF session, and grab one of the spare rooms to hold
a discussion. Attendance in the evening is open to all.

BoF sessions facilitate ad-hoc discussions and provide a place to gather and
start off the chat, before moving on during the evening to a local
restaurant or pub. There is no deadline for proposing a session, but we
encourage you to do so at the earliest possible time to help us with
planning and to publicize your proposed discussion. Attendees are also free
to show up even if you have not confirmed, but again earlier confirmation
will help us with planning.

Please see http://cufp.org/bofs-2011 for details on how to propose a BoF
session or confirm attendance at one of them.

General information on CUFP 2011 can be found at
http://cufp.org/conference/2011. The conference is co-located with ICFP. You
can register for CUFP at the main ICFP website
http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2011.
