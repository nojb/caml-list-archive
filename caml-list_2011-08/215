Who says that the state is or can be hidden? This is certainly a later
addition to OO, when people found out that they can view a class as an
abstract data type (with the known limitations). Take off your "typed
glasses". OO is mainly a way of organizing the execution flow, and there
are lots of OO languages lacking typing and access control. And even in
OCaml you'd not use objects if your primary interest is encapsulation -
objects are not good at this. (That's all what I'm saying!)
