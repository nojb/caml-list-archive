Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml 'hackathon' - Friday 8/19 - ..

Hi,

-- Above all, the idea is nice. :-)

-- I suggest you add a line such as:
# 0 "web form input"
at the beginning of the web form data, so that the error messages of
the compiler are relevant to the submitted code.
I personally added such a line myself in the textarea but it's not
quite effective when I forget it. :-)

-- There are nasty bugs, especially with "Learn the ropes!"
where there is no feedback at all when a code which compiles well is submitted;
should it be with
  let main x = "plop"
or with a code that is supposedly correct. However, some (wrong) code
that computes too much died, which is rather a good thing. But as
there exist some people who scored, it's even more annoying. :-(
 * Was tested with Safari 5.1 and Firefox 5.0.1 / OS X Lion, though I
don't think it has anything to do with the browser. Maybe the problem
implementation?

Cheers,
Philippe Wang
