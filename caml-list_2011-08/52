Subject: [Caml-list] Val_int vs caml_copy_nativeint

Hi all,

I'm writing a C stub function to allow the calling of a C library
function from ocaml. The return from the stub is a tuple and I'm
doing this:

    /* Package up the result as a tuple. */
    v_response = caml_alloc_tuple (3) ;

    Store_field (v_response, 0, Val_int (width)) ;
    Store_field (v_response, 1, Val_int (height)) ;
    Store_field (v_response, 2, caml_copy_string (code)) ;

    CAMLreturn (v_response) ;

The above works now, but didn't work when I was using
caml_copy_nativeint() instead of Val_int() and I'd like to know
why. I found it especially confusing because caml_copy_string()
worked and was obvioulsy the right thing to do.

Cheers,
Erik
