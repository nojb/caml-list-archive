This is the way to do it.

It's a pretty common problem (and a commonly overlooked problem IME),
but you'll find it occurs in many C bindings.  A couple of examples in
libraries that I have been involved with:

ocaml-libvirt (http://git.annexia.org/?p=ocaml-libvirt.git;a=summary)
- The relationship between connections (owner) and domains (owned).

ocamlode
- Many objects are related, similar to your example.
