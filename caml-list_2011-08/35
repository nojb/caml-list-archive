This link is broken.

If you still think that, you should file a bugreport [1] against the 
pycaml package... or at least notify the Debian OCaml Maintainers list 
(in CC)...

Given the patches applied to the Debian packages that merely adapt it to 
newer Python versions, the absence of new upstream release for 6 years 
now, the absence of Art Yerkes in this thread (by the way, I put him in 
CC of this mail), I consider this project "dead" upstream. It would be 
nice if someone could take over upstream maintenance, and at least 
incorporate our patches [2] (or any other variant) for wider distribution.

As far as Debian is concerned, only coccinelle [3] depends on pycaml.
