Subject: [Caml-list] extended deadline: workshop on Virtual Machines and Intermediate
 Languages (VMIL)

Dear Colleagues:

as there have been requests to get some more time improving
submissions to the VMIL workshop, we have decided to extend
the deadline. For the details, see below. But please note
that abstract submission is now mandatory.

This workshop is a forum for research in virtual machines
(VM) and intermediate languages (IL). It is dedicated to
identifying programming mechanisms and constructs that are
currently realized as code transformations or implemented in
libraries but should rather be supported at VM and IL level.
------------------------------------------------------------
**Invited Talks**
In the tradition of past VMIL workshops, the 2011 edition
will feature high-quality, on-topic invited talks. Speakers
and titles will be announced later.
------------------------------------------------------------
**Due Dates**
Abstract submission is mandatory until August 8, 2011.
Papers for VMIL are due Aug 12, 2011. Notification of
acceptance will be on Sep 1, 2011.
------------------------------------------------------------
**Program Committee**
We have once again assembled an excellent program committee
which consists of: Steve Blackburn (Chair), Cliff Click,
David Grove, Kim Hazelwood, Antony Hosking, Doug Lea, Ben
Titzer, and Olivier Zendra.
------------------------------------------------------------

For more details please see:

We look forward to your submissions to VMIL 2011.

Best regards,
Hridesh Rajan, Christoph Bockisch, Michael Haupt and Robert
Dyer
VMIL 2011 Organizers
