              The Second Answer Set Programming Competition 

                         Call For Participation 

  	            K.U.Leuven, Belgium, spring 2009

             http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/events/ASP-competition/


................................................................


The second ASP competition is a Modeling and Solving competition open
to all declarative problem solving systems from areas such as ASP, SAT
and CP.  In the competition, both satisfiability problems and
optimization problems need to be solved.  Each team submits a solver
and modelings for all benchmark problems. These are used to solve a
number of instances of each benchmark problem.  The solver that solves
the most instances wins. The results will be published in the Tenth
International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic
Reasoning (LPNMR'09).  For more details on the format of the
competition, see the webpage.
 
The competition is open for all solvers.  The Modeling and Solving
formula offers the best opportunities for different communities to
show the strength of their applications and solvers.  Modeling support
for SAT teams, for whom modeling can be a burden, is available on the
webpage.

The competition is currently in its second phase: the registration of
participating teams and the installation of solutions to the submitted 
benchmarks. We invite teams from different areas to enter their solvers 
in the competition. For more details, see the webpage.
