Widgets are under developing. We will support button, label, textbox, 
checkbox, radio button, tab, listbox, tree, grid,..etc. We already supports
Pango and XIM for textbox.

The main purpose is to develop an ordinary desktop application covered 
by GTK/Qt. In addition, Amthing is applicable to rich client which access 
to internet services. Animation makes application rich. Concurrent environment
helps us to write asynchronous communications.
