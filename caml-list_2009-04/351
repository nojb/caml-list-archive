    Notification: Tuesday 30 June 2009


The Third Workshop on Normalization by Evaluation
  http://www.brics.dk/~danvy/NBE09/
will be held in Los Angeles on 15 August 2009
as an affiliated meeting of LICS'09

The goals of NBE'09 are:
* to establish a continuity with NBE research so far,
* to offer a forum for the new actors, and
* to identify and build a community.

The NBE'09 program will consist of an invited lecture and of
contributed papers selected by the program committee.
These papers will not be formally published, but a record of the meeting
will be available in the BRICS series as informal proceedings.

Papers should be written in English, be accessible to non-specialists,
start with a clear statement of the issues and results, and not exceed 10
pages in the LICS format
(http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/amp12/lics09/papers.html#StyleFiles).
