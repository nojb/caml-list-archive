Indeed, as I said above, a book on "today's OCaml" should cover a wide
variety of topics (syntax extensions with camlp4/5, general purpose
libraries, specific libraries like ocamlnet, GTK+ and OpenGL binding, etc).
To write such a book, there would be the need for many authors with time and
knowledge to produce a good learning and practice material for OCaml !

I think many of us would enjoy writing some paragraphs for such a project...
But would there be enough people to achieve the writing of an entire (and
good) book ?
