             Edinburgh, Scotland, September 3 and 5, 2009

Important dates

Proposal Deadline: June 5, 2009, 0:00 UTC
Notification: June 19, 2009

DEFUN 2009 invites functional programmers and researchers who know how
to solve problems with functional progamming to give talks and lead
tutorials at the The ICFP Developer Tracks.

We want to know about your favorite programming techniques, powerful
libraries, and engineering approaches you've used that the world
should know about and apply to other projects. We want to know how to
be productive using functional programming, write better code, and
avoid common pitfalls.

We invite proposals for presentations in the following categories.

Lightning talks
5- to 10-minute talks that introduce exciting and promising research
or techniques that may be in progress or not yet ready for widespread
use, but that offer a glimpse into the near future of real world
functional programming.
Examples:

    * Clustered high performance computing in a functional language
    * Making advanced type systems more accessible to working programmers
    * How and why we're infiltrating category theory info industry

How-to talks
45-minute "how-to" talks that provide specific information on how to
solve specific problems using functional programming. These talks
focus on concrete examples, but provide useful information for
developers working on different projects or in different contexts.
Examples:

    * "How I use Haskell for oilfield simulations."
    * "How I replaced /sbin/init by a Scheme program."
    * "How I hooked up my home appliances to an Erlang control system."
    * "How I got an SML program to drive my BMW."

General language tutorials
Half-day general language tutorials for specific functional languages,
given by recognized experts for the respective languages.

Technology tutorials
Half-day tutorials on techniques, technologies, or solving specific
problems in functional programming.
Examples:

    * How to make the best use of specific FP programming techniques
    * How to inject FP into a development team used to more
conventional technologies
    * How to connect FP to existing libraries / frameworks / platforms
    * How to deliver high-performance systems with FP
    * How to deliver high-reliability systems with FP

Remember that your audience will include computing professionals who
are not academics and who may not already be experts on functional
programming.

Presenters of tutorials will receive free registration to CUFP 2009.

Submission guidelines

Submit a proposal of 150 words or less for either a 45-minute talk
with a short Q&A session at the end, or a 300-word-or-less proposal
for a 3-hour tutorial, where you present your material, but also give
participants a chance to practice it on their own laptops.

Some advice:

    * Give it a simple and straightforward title or name; avoid fancy
      titles or puns that would make it harder for attendees to figure
      out what you'll be talking about.
    * Clearly identify the level of the talk: What knowledge should
      people have when they come to the presentation or tutorial?
    * Explain why people will want to attend:
          o Is the language or library useful for a wide range of
            attendees?
          o Is the pitfall you're identifying common enough that a
            wide range of attendees is likely to encounter it?
    * Explain what benefits attendees are expected to take home to
      their own projects.
    * For a tutorial, explain how you want to structure the time, and
      what you expect to have attendees to do on their laptops. List
      what software you'll expect attendees to have installed prior to
      coming.

Submit your proposal in plain text electronically to
defun-2009-submissions@serpentine.com by the beginning of Friday, June
5 2009, Universal Coordinated Time.

Organizers

    * Yaron Minsky (Jane Street Capital)
    * Ulf Wiger (Erlang Training and Consulting)
    * Mike Sperber - co-chair (DeinProgramm)
    * Bryan O'Sullivan - co-chair (Linden Lab)
