We have our own amd64.S which is based on but quite different from  
ocaml 3.10 amd64.S.
ocaml 3.11 has its amd64.S changed for Leopard.
*And* we have made some small changes to emit.ml.
Then, building the whole thing is not trivial.

Building ocaml 3.10 with our modified runtime is not trivial with  
Linux x86_64 : we use an intern script that does it. Without it, it  
would need hours to build it.
Adapting the script for Leopard is not trivial to do. But we think  
it's quite possible.

Besides, it was late at night and I was sleepy and tired when I tried.

Another answer is Leopard needs the changes made to amd64.S from 3.10  
to 3.11, which mainly fix an alignment problem.
