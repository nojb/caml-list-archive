I read that batteries included provides first-class rope-based strings and I 
was just reading up on some horror stories about immutable strings on 
StackOverflow. This made me wonder what people's thoughts are about mutable 
vs immutable strings?

I had never thought about it until I started porting my OCaml code to F# where 
strings are immutable and I found immutable strings to be a PITA. Immutable 
array-based strings seem pointless to me but I'd still appreciate an 
immutable rope-based string...
