Dear list,

I have noticed what seems to be a bug in Camomile. I submitted an 
appropriate patch to Camomile's author 6 or 7 weeks ago, but did not get 
a response of any sort. Does someone know anything about the current 
state of Camomile development?

For the curious reader, the bug is that in some buffered structure, the 
buffer is not invalidated after a flush. Thus forcing flushes while only 
a small amount of data has been queued causes multiple output of the 
buffer's prefix. This is trivially corrected (two places in the code are 
to be modified).

Michaël
