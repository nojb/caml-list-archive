Try dir /a - perhaps the attributes on the .lnk file are weird... which
might also be the cause of the problem if it's got hidden or system
attributes set for some reason.

Could be a longshot - but might this be related to an issue I reported
building MinGW PCRE a month or so ago. In order to get PCRE to link, I had
to rename the actual libpcre.a to libpcre.a.old (i.e. get rid of it) and
then rename libpcre.dll.a to libpcre.a. I can't remember what the error
message was.

I think that the problem is something to do with GNU libtool - which gcc's
linker presumably understands but flexlink doesn't... but I didn't get a
related answer to
