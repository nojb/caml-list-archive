Workshop Purpose:

Our aim is to bring together active researchers in the area of logics =20=

and mobile systems, especially in the field of logics and calculi for =20=

mobility, agents, and multi-agent systems. Many notions used in the =20
theory of agents are derived from philosophy, logic, and linguistics =20
(belief, desire, intention, speech act, etc.), and interdisciplinary =20
discourse has proved fruitful for the advance of this domain. Outside =20=

of academia, the deployment of large-scale pervasive infrastructures =20
(mobile ad-hoc networks, mobile devices, RFIDs, etc.) is becoming a =20
reality. This raises a number of scientific and technological =20
challenges for the software modelling and programming models for such =20=

large-scale, open and highly-dynamic distributed systems. The agent =20
and multi-agent systems approach seems particularly adapted to tackle =20=

this challenge, but there are many issues remaining to be =20
investigated. For instance, the agents must be location-aware since =20
the actual services available to them may depend on their (physical or =20=

virtual) location. The quality and quantity of resources at their =20
disposal is also largely fluctuant, and the agents must be able to =20
adapt to such highly dynamic environments. Moreover, mobility itself =20
raises a large number of difficult issues related to safety and =20
security, which require the ability to reason about the software (e.g. =20=

for analysis or verification). Logics and type systems with temporal =20
or other kinds of modalities (relating to location, resource and/or =20
security-awareness) play a central role in the semantic =20
characterisation and then verification of properties about mobile =20
agent systems. There are still many open problems and research =20
questions in the theory of such systems. The workshop is intended to =20
showcase results and current work being undertaken in these areas with =20=

a focus on logics for specification and verification of dynamic, =20
mobile systems.


Scopes of Interest:

The topics of interest include but are not limited to
- logics for specification and reasoning about agents, MAS, and mobile =20=

systems in a broader sense
- treatment of location and resources in logics (e.g. Linear Logic, BI-=20=

Logic, ambient calculus, spatial logics)
- security in ad-hoc networks
- temporal/modal logics and model checking
- type systems and static analysis
- logic programming.


Format of the Workshop:

The workshop will be held as a two day event before LICS. There will =20
be a general introduction and brief survey of the field by the =20
organiser as an introduction to the workshop.

The workshop will contain invited talks, contributed talks, and a =20
discussion session. The latter is meant to give the participants a =20
chance to discuss informally research directions, open problems, and =20
possible co-operations.


Submission details:

Authors are invited to submit a full paper of original work in the =20
areas mentioned above. The workshop chair should be informed of =20
closely related work submitted to a conference or journal in advance =20
of submission. One author of each accepted paper will be expected to =20
present it at the LAM=9209 workshop. Submissions should not exceed 15 =20=

pages, preferably using the LaTeX article class. The following formats =20=

are accepted: PDF, PS. Please send your submission electronically to =
LAM.09@durham.ac.uk=20
  by the deadline listed below. The submissions will be reviewed by =20
the workshop's programme committee and additional reviewers. Accepted =20=

papers will appear in informal workshop pre-proceedings and authors =20
will be encouraged to re-submit papers to formal proceedings to be =20
published as a special journal issue of Fundamenta Informaticae.
