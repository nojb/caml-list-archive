************************************************************

* A 3.5year Ph.D Position and a Postdoc Position=20

* available in the area of Program Analysis and Verification

* funded by the EPSRC project entitled "Inference Mechanisms=20

* for a Separation and Numerical Domain"

* in Department Of Computer Science, Durham University, UK

************************************************************





Applications are invited for a Ph.D. student and a Postdoctoral Research =
Associate to work on an EPSRC funded project entitled "Inference =
Mechanisms for a Separation and Numerical Domain" in the group led by =
Dr. Shengchao Qin in the Department of Computer Science. The aim of the =
project is to develop advanced static analysis techniques based on =
separation logic for automated verification of memory safety as well as =
functional correctness of substantial heap-manipulating imperative =
programs. The key objective is to develop advanced inference/abstraction =
mechanisms in the combined separation and numerical domain with =
user-defined inductive predicates, so that loop invariants and method =
pre/post-conditions can be automatically synthesised, where possible.





About the Ph.D Position:

Prospective Ph.D candidates must have (or expect to have) a good honours =
(or equivalent) degree in Computer Science or other relevant subjects. =
The studentship requires good background knowledge in most of the =
following areas: logic and discrete mathematics related to computer =
science, computer-aided verification, compilers, and program analysis. =
Strong programming skills will also be essential for the studentship.



This fully funded studentship provides a tax-free living allowance at =
the standard EPSRC rate (GBP 13,290 p.a. for 09/10) and student tuition =
fees at the UK/EU student rate (non-EU students will require =
supplementary funding). The successful candidate is expected to start on =
1st September 2009.



Closing date (the Ph.D Position): 15 May 2009



Applications (such as CV, references, a transcript and a statement of =
research interests) should be sent to Dr Shengchao Qin, Computer Science =
Department, Durham University, Science Labs, South Road, Durham, DH1 =
3LE, United Kingdom. Applicants are also required to register their =
interest of pursuing a Ph.D in Durham at =
https://bannerss.dur.ac.uk/blive_ssb/bwskalog.P_DispLoginNon

=3D=3D



The successful applicant should have received (or expect to receive) a =
Ph.D in Computer Science or a closely related subject.  Suitable =
candidates should be able to demonstrate research skills or potential at =
an international level in the field of program analysis and =
computer-aided verification.



Key responsibilities: the Postdoctoral Research Associate(PDRA) is =
expected to conduct research in program analysis and verification using =
separation logic.  Working closely with the team leader, the PDRA is =
expected to develop advanced inference/abstraction mechanisms in an =
abstract domain combined with separation and numerical information and =
in the presence of user-specified inductive predicates and lemmas. More =
specifically, the PDRA is expected to make significant contributions in =
(1) automatic inference/analysis  of loop invariants and method =
pre/post-specifications in the combined domain, (2) the construction of =
an analysis/verification tool and the integration of the developed tool =
with the verification tool HIP/SLEEK developed in National University of =
Singapore, and (3) the application of the tool to verify memory safety =
of substantial system software such as the Linux distribution.  The RA =
is expected to write and publish research papers in good quality =
conferences and journals every year.=20



Closing date (the Postdoc postioin): 31 May 2009
