Hello,

I'd like to inform you the updates of two projects:


Enhtop for OCaml 3.11
=====================

This is a patch contributed by Peng Zang (thanks!) bringing enhtop [1] 
up to date with OCaml 3.11.

There is an additional "#tellall" primitive from Peng's enhtop+ [2] 
doing partial matching over OCaml identifiers. Please also take a look 
at his SOLID (Superior OcamL Interactive Development-mode) project [2].

Enhtop will be maintained, with no additional features, until the 
publicity of OCamli [3].


Camlish v0.03
=============

Camlish [4] has been updated to version 0.03 with some bugs fixed 
(reported by Keith Waclena and Peng Zang, thanks!).

Note however, the feature of direct shell command execution will be 
removed from future releases, since I feel that Camlish should be a 
simple library dealing with the interaction between OCaml and shell and 
nothing else. On the other hand, I've added this feature to OCamli [3] 
as it seems much better suited there: as a feature of toplevel. With 
OCamli, one can execute any shell commands as toplevel primitives with 
references to variables from the OCaml world.
