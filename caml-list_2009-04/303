A class is a reference to the virtual table of a class and its
instance variables. There is exactly one virtual table for every class
you declrare and all instances of that class share the same virtual
table. All the methods are listed in that one virtual table.

So a method will cost you 4 or 8 byte (or maybe more, don't know how
big the entry for a method is) but it will be something small and
const no matter how many instances you have.
