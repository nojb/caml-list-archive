I think the existing books cover the core parts of the language well so there 
is no need for further work in that area but I would like to see books 
covering the following topics:

. Batteries (!).

. Libraries, e.g. LablGTK.

. Post 3.10 camlp4.

. Other tools, e.g. menhir, dpygen, bitstrings, micmatch.

There are also some areas where I think today's OCaml software could be 
improved:

. Automatic FFI stub JIT compilation using LLVM.

. OpenGL 3 bindings.

. GUI libraries.

. IDEs (probably depends upon GUI libraries).
