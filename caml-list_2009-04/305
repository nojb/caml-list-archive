FM2009 is the  sixteenth in a series  of symposia  of the
Formal Methods Europe  association,   and the second  one
that  is organized as  a world congress. Ten  years after
FM'99,  the  1st  World Congress,  the   formal   methods
communities from all over the world  will once again have
an  opportunity  to  meet.   FM 2009   will  be  both  an
opportunity to  celebrate, and an  opportunity to join in
when enthusiastic   researchers and practitioners  from a
diversity  of backgrounds and   schools come together  to
discuss their ideas and experiences.

The Programme Committee  of  FM2009 comprises 82  members
representing 46 countries.   For the technical symposium,
papers  on    every aspect   of   the   *development  and
application of formal methods for  the improvement of the
current practice on system developments*  are invited for
submission.  Of particular interest are papers on *tools*
and  *industrial applications* : there will  be a special
track devoted to these topics.

Many  have already joined  the celebrations. Springer has
offered a prize  for  the  best  paper;  this award  will
include  free electronic access to the  Formal Aspects of
Computing journal for one year,  and a choice of Springer
books  up  to a  value  of EUR 250.00.  The  authors of a
selection  of  the accepted  papers  will  be  invited to
submit extended versions  of their papers  to anniversary
special issues of Formal Aspects of Computing  or  Formal
Methods in Systems Design.

Complete and up to  date  information  can  be  found  at
http://www.win.tue.nl/fm2009/.  There will be  tutorials,
workshops, a Doctoral Symposium, and a Tools  Exhibition.
FM2009 is also part of the  1st  FMweek  (Formal  Methods
week, http://www.win.tue.nl/fmweek/),  which  will  bring
together a variety of events in the area.


SUBMISSION PROCEDURE
====================
The proceedings of FM2009 will be published as  a  volume
in  the  Springer  Lecture  Notes  in  Computer  Science.

for publication, should be in Springer's LNCS format,  as
