Hi,

Sorry for the late answer...

You're right, some type information is missing and there is no way to
instantiate the Dot functor with the current signature of
ConcreteBidirectional.

One easy patch (if you are compiling ocamlgraph from sources) is to add
the constraint

	... and type E.label = unit

to the signature of functor ConcreteBidirectional. I think we'll do that
in the next release of ocamlgraph (and similarly for other unlabeled
graph data structures provided in ocamlgraph).

Hope this helps,
