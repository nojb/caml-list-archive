Ok. My advice is to avoid shared pointers if at all possible and rely on a 
robust GC implementation like OCaml's. GC is vastly more efficient and vastly 
less error prone.

I concur with Basile that a loose binding is preferable to a tight binding 
when you have more than one form of deallocation. Message passing is 
generally the easiest solution.
