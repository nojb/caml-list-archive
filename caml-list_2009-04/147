     22nd International Workshop on Description Logics (DL 2009)
                           CALL FOR PAPERS
                     Oxford, United Kingdom
                           27-30 July 2009

                      http://dl.kr.org/dl2009/

The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic
research community. The workshop is thought as a gathering forum to
meet, discuss and exchange experiences among all those, both in the
academia and industry, who are interested in description logics and
their applications.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline:  20    April 2009 (strict!)
Notification of acceptance: 01    June  2009
Camera ready papers due:    22    June  2009
DL'07 Workshop:             27-30 July  2008 (3 1/2 days)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WORKSHOP SCOPE

We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics,
such as

* foundations of description logics, including expressive power,
  decidability and complexity of reasoning, novel inference problems,
  and reasoning techniques for solving these problems;

* extensions of description logics, including, but not limited to,
  closed-world and nonmonotonic reasoning, defaults, epistemic
  reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, and
  query languages;

* integration of description logics with other formalisms, such as
  object-oriented representation languages, database query languages,
  constraint-based programming, logic programming, and rule-based
  systems;

* use of description logics in applications or areas such as ontology
  engineering, ontology languages, databases, semi-structured data,
  document management, natural language, learning, planning, semantic
  web, and grid computing;

* building systems based on description logics, with special emphasis
  on optimization and implementation techniques; and

* tools that exploit description logic reasoning, such as ontology
  editors, database schema design, query optimization, and data
  integration tools.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMISSION DETAILS

We invite submissions of papers in Springer LNCS style, see

    http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html

to arrive no later than April 20, 2009.

The length of submissions is limited to 11 pages, including title and
abstract (can be omitted if necessary), but excluding references
(i.e., the length of the paper without the references must be at most
11 pages). Papers must be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair; see

    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dl2009

The workshop proceedings will be made available electronically in the
CEUR Workshop Proceedings series; see

    http://www.CEUR-ws.org/

Accepted submissions will be selected for either oral or poster
presentation; however, no distinction will be made in the workshop
proceedings: all accepted papers can be 11 pages long.
