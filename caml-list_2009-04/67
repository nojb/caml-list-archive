Can you explain what you're trying to achieve? I don't understand why
you want to connect #receive_message to #process. You might find it
easier to use Ocamlnet's RPC implementation to build an asynchronous
service. At least, looking at rpc_server.ml as an example of an
asynchronous service will be useful.

You may also be interested in orpc, which gives you a way to generate
RPC services from an OCaml signature:

  http://code.google.com/p/orpc2/

(new release coming soon.)
