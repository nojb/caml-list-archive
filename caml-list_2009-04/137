			   CALL FOR PAPERS


The ACM SIGSAM 2009 International Workshop on Programming Languages
for Mechanized Mathematics Systems will be co-located with TPHOLs 2009.

General Information

The scope of this workshop is at the intersection of programming
languages (PL) and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). The latter
category subsumes present-day computer algebra systems (CAS),
interactive proof assistants (PA), and automated theorem provers
(ATP), all heading towards fully integrated mechanized mathematical
assistants. Areas of interest include all aspects of PL and MMS that
meet in the following topics, but not limited to:

  * Dedicated input languages for MMS: covers all aspects of languages
    intended for the user to deploy or extend the system, both
    algorithmic and declarative ones. Typical examples are tactic
    definition languages such as Ltac in Coq, mathematical proof
    languages as in Mizar or Isar, or specialized programming
    languages built into CA systems.

  * Mathematical modeling languages used for programming: covers the
    relation of logical descriptions vs. algorithmic content. For
    instance the logic of ACL2 extends a version of Lisp, that of Coq
    is close to Haskell, and some portions of HOL are similar to ML
    and Haskell, while Maple tries to do both simultaneously. Such
    mathematical languages offer rich specification capabilities,
    which are rarely available in regular programming languages. How
    can programming benefit from mathematical concepts, without
    limiting mathematics to the computational world view?

  * Programming languages with mathematical specifications: covers
    advanced mathematical concepts in programming languages that
    improve the expressive power of functional specifications, type
    systems, module systems etc. Programming languages with dependent
    types are of particular interest here, as is intentionality vs
    extensionality.

  * Language elements for program verification: covers specific means
    built into a language to facilitate correctness proofs using
    MMS. For example, logical annotations within programs may be
    turned into verification conditions to be solved in a proof
    assistant eventually. How need MMS and PL to be improved to make
    this work conveniently and in a mathematically appealing way?

These issues have a very colorful history. Many PL innovations first
appeared in either CA or proof systems first, before migrating into
more mainstream programming languages.  This workshop is an
opportunity  to present the latest innovations in MMS design that may
be relevant to future programming languages, or conversely novel PL
principles that improve upon implementation and deployment of MMS.
Why are all the languages of mainstream CA systems untyped?  Why
are the (strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than
a typical CAS?  What forms of polymorphism exist in mathematics?
What forms of dependent types may be used in mathematical modeling?
How can MMS regain the upper hand on issues of "genericity" and
"modularity"?  What are the biggest barriers to using a more
mainstream language as a host language for a CAS or PA/ATP?

PLMMS 2007 was held as a satellite event of, and PLMMS 2008 was
a CICM 2008 workshop.

Submission Details

  * Submission deadline: May 11, 2009 (Apia, Samoa time)
  * Author Notification:  June 22, 2009
  * Final Papers Due: July 10, 2009
  * Workshop: August 21, 2009

   Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF),
   formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
   (http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm). The length
   is restricted to 10 pages, and the font size 9pt. Each submission
   must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as explained on the
   web. Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission.

  Papers are exclusively submitted via EasyChair

          http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=plmms09

   We expect that at least one author of each accepted paper attends
   PLMMS 2009 and presents her or his paper.

   Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library.
