Is this following partial answer relevant enough ?
The garbage collector is clearly separated from the rest of the =20
runtime library: the GC is contained in a libgc.a and our patched =20
ocamlopt links programs to this GC. The GC variables are known by the =20=

GC only.

Officially, not yet (and not before April 20th).

We did not expect the debugging part to be so complex and hard, and =20
taking so long.
The man power dramatically decreased in late September : the 2 =20
Master's students went back to Master's courses, and the 3 supervisors =20=

had to do research in parallel with teaching.
Some major bug fixes were made in February/March, a lot of major bug =20
fixes were made in April (yes, these last 2 weeks).
You know, bugs hiding other bugs... however we are hopefully getting =20
close to the fix point: today there is no known bug ! :-)
Unsupported features are - of course - not considered as bugs. For =20
instance, posix signals are (currently) not supported. And, as =20
parallel computing *potentially* requires quite a lot more memory, =20
some programs can easily end up in a blocked state when the heap =20
becomes full: our GC (currently) uses (parameterized) fixed size pages =20=

and heap.

The next days, we will concentrate on making benchmarks (if you have =20
some relevant testing programs, they are welcome), and if we don't =20
discover new bugs then we will focus on (finishing) writing a =20
documentation and a building script, for the release.
If we release as such now, we will have too much support to do because =20=

of the lack of documentation. So it's not quite a good idea...
When we have the minimal-but-sufficient documentation, we will make =20
the release :-)

In parallel, we try to make it work with OS X Leopard 64 bit and/or =20
ocaml 3.11 (currently we only support 3.10.2 - Linux x86_64).

Thanks.

N.B. I hope we will not discover new bugs in our amd64.S, our assembly =20=

guru is enjoying (abroad with no www) his "vacances de p=E2ques"...=
