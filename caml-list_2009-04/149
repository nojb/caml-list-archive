Can anyone summarize the trade-offs between the Camomile and Netstring =20=

(netconversion) unicode translation libraries? The netconversion =20
documentation =
(http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-2.2.9/doc/html-main/Net=
conversion.html=20
) mentions that Camomile implements text strings as int arrays, =20
whereas it encodes them as packed native strings... so I'm guessing =20
that Netstring is a win space-wise when random access isn't needed. =20
However, are there other trade-offs to be aware of -- bugs, other =20
performance issues, ease of use? Camomile seems to provide a larger =20
number of conversions, but I have no idea whether these are actually =20
useful, or simply legacy artifacts.

I think my unicode needs are fairly simple, but then again, maybe =20
everyone thinks that as they're diving off this cliff. :-)
