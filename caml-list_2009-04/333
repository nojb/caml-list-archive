Thanks for investigating this issue!  The current SVN version of 
flexlink prefers XXX.dll.a over XXX.a.  We will see whether it solves 
more problems than it creates...  Of course, it is always possible to 
pass explicitly the complete file name instead of -lXXX.

To build and use ocaml-pcre, I've had to remove the "-I /usr/include" 
from this line in OCamlMakefile:

   CFLAGS_WIN32 := -mno-cygwin -I /usr/include

Otherwise, Cygwin's headers are used instead of mingw's ones (in 
/usr/include/mingw), and we get a dependency e.g. to the Cygwin symbol 
_ctype_ which is not available on mingw. Have you had to do something 
similar?


Alain
