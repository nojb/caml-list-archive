The build process I followed along with its accompagnying patch are
available on the Gallium wiki at the following URL:
	http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/CrossCompiler

This is clearly a very experimental draft that is still a bit hackish.
All reports, both positive and negative are hence very welcome,
in order to polish it up.


Hope this helps,
