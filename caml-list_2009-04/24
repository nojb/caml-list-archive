Incidentally, if anyone out there is still sitting on such a (good) book I'd 
be interested in publishing it for them. The result won't be as cheap as an 
O'Reilly because our overheads are higher but at least it would actually get 
published. Alternatively, I can tell anyone exactly what they'd need to get 
started self-publishing and they could do it themselves.
