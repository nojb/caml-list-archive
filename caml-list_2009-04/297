The mli and ml are equivalent to:

  module A : sig =
    ...
  end = struct
    ...
  end

i.e. no module type is defined.

True. There is also an unfortunate amount of copy'n'paste involved as well, 
and manual maintenance of signatures. I believe that often deters people from 
using module signatures and module types at all.

Some people contest the idea that files should automatically convey module 
information at all (SML does not). Indeed, should directories convey 
something as well?
