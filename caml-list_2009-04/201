Hi --

I recently came across a syntax generator program called SYNGEN, written =
in
1995 by Jens Kl=F6umlcker.  =


My attempts to email Jens at the two addresses I've found for him have
bounced, so I'm wondering if someone here might be able to help me.

SYNGEN is written in Caml Special Light.  Trying to run the bytecode and
source on the latest version of OCMAL doesn't work.  As I've no experienc=
e
with the language I'm not sure I could get them working in short order.

I've been able to track down a version of the source for CSL in the obsol=
ete
folder of the inria ftp site, but the promised Windows executable is not
there.

Before I launch into the task of trying to compile a 15 year old program =
using
modern C compilers, which I suspect isn't going to be straightforward, I
thought I'd ask here if anyone knows where I might find a prebuilt binary=
 of
CSL (CSLRUN etc?) for Windows.

Or are the differences between CSL and OCAML so slight that someone with =
no
experience should be able to get it working quickly?

Thanks,


ian =
