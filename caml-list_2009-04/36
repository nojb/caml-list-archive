First let me say that while I have been a professional programmer for over twenty years, have used many languages, and have have been playing with ocaml for several years, I am no expert on ocaml (the only language I claim to be expert in is C++). Nor do I have much experience writing, and, like many Americans, I am monolingual.

Having said that, I currently have some free time time and would be willing to offer my assistance to this project. It would give me the opportunity to hone my writing and ocaml skills, and I believe as an experienced professional programmer (I have worked in government, military, finance, medicine, aviation, and research) and ocaml newbie I could bring a useful perspective to the project. 

I hope I can be of service,
