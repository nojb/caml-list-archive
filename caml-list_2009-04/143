                             OPEN CALL FOR PAPERS

                   JFP Special Issue on Generic Programming

                           Deadline: 1 October 2009

Scope
-----

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast to normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors,
classes, concepts, or even programming paradigms.

This special issue aims at documenting state-of-the-art research, new
developments and directions for future investigation in the broad
field of Generic Programming. It is an outgrowth of the series of
Workshops on Generic Programming, which started in 1998 and which
continues this year with an ICFP affiliated workshop in
Edinburgh. Participants of the workshops are invited to submit a
suitably revised and expanded version of their paper to the special
issue. The call for papers is, however, open. Other contributions are
equally welcome and are, indeed, encouraged. All submitted papers will
be subjected to the same quality criteria, meeting the standards of
the Journal of Functional Programming.

The special issue seeks original contributions on all aspects of
generic programming including but not limited to

    o adaptive object-oriented programming,
    o aspect-oriented programming,
    o case studies,
    o concepts (as in the STL/C++ sense),
    o component-based programming,
    o datatype-generic programming,
    o generic programming with dependent types,
    o meta-programming,
    o polytypic programming, and
    o programming with modules.

Submission details
------------------

Manuscripts should be unpublished works and not submitted elsewhere.
Revised versions of papers published in conference or workshop
proceedings that have not appeared in archival journals are eligible
for submission.

    Deadline for submission:                   1 October 2009
    Notification of acceptance or rejection:  15 January 2010
    Revised version due:                      15 March   2010

For submission details, please consult
