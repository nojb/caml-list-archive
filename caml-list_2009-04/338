There was indeed three different parsers for OCaml-like syntax in the old
camlp4. Actually there was one classical parser for the official/original
OCaml syntax but this one was not embeddable in quotations. There was also
two parsers for the revised syntax one being the classical one and the other
being for quotations.

We are talking about quotations here, and I can confirm that the two parsers
for the revised syntax where generating to different representations of the
concrete syntax.

Example (simplified):
  f 42     => App (Var "f") (Int "42")
  <<f 42>> => App (App (Con "Var") (Str "f")) (App (Con "Int") (Str "42"))

The new version of camlp4 use only one grammar for the revised syntax (instead
of two) and a grammar extension for the official/original syntax.
