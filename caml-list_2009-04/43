Once you get into the realm of having lots of authors writing an
"OCaml Bible" there's going to be so little money in it that either
none of them get paid, or the book will cost a huge amount of money
(or both).  Scientific works through traditional publishers are a bit
like that, if my father's experience editing a journal is anything to
go by.

So you might want to think about an alternate method of authorship,
such as a version-controlled, shared document, that allows
contributions and comes under a Free license of some sort.

If people still want an actual book, at the end of the day they can
take the electronic document to lulu.com and get it printed.

BTW, a lot of the content on ocaml-tutorial.org is public domain, if
that proves useful (check with the individual authors though).

Rich.
