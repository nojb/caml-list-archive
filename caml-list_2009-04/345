Hi list,

Hydro 0.7 is released. Hydro is an independent implementation of the ICE
middleware (originally by ZeroC, see zeroc.com). It is now a bit more
complete:

      * The hydrogen generator supports a faster way of doing the
        language mapping (to be enabled with the -dc switch), now
        bypassing the value tree representation in most cases.
      * It is possible to register Hydro servers at an ICE registry.
      * Support for "stringified proxies"
      * Hydromon for checking the lifeliness of remote servers

Additionally, there are many smaller changes and bugfixes.

Get Hydro at oss.wink.com/hydro. There is also a GODI package for it.

Hydro is a development effort by Mylife.com (formerly Wink
Technologies). Hydro is used in the people search component to connect
the various server with each other.
