I think that is an important point.

I have been a member of the Python community for a long time, and have 
seen that people are most definitely NOT shy about talking about things 
that need improvement.  In fact, there is a formal process for major 
improvements to the language: PEP [1].

Perhaps there is something about the criticisms (err, "improvements") 
that you are making.  Perhaps you are trying to solve problems that 
nobody else perceives.  Perhaps your "fix" for things would really make 
things worse.  Perhaps you lack the experience in any language, 
community, or business to make intelligent suggestions.

You also encountered it on freeciv-dev.

Frankly, through all your talk on all these forums, I have never yet 
seen even one single substantive thing come out of it.  I think you are 
all talk and no do.  In other words, a troll.

Actually, there are a lot more people doing that than 3D, AI, or games.

But that's like complaining about going to a Perl meeting and hearing 
about parsing or going to an Emacs meeting and hearing about Lisp.

3D stuff is not a Python strength.  If you're doing 3D, you are probably 
not using Python.  Why would they be talking about it then?

Here in the OCaml community, there is a lot of talk about math in all 
sorts of shapes.  There's little talk about threading (something I find 
very useful in Python) or text processing, though people *are* working 
on these things.

This is silly.  The fact that Windows ships a poor CLI by default 
doesn't mean that Unix is less graphically-oriented.  Almost every 
Linux distribution, plus Solaris and AIX, ship with a graphical mode 
enabled by default.  Most hide the CLI in almost the same way Windows 
does.  MacOS X goes even farther.  (Are you still forgetting that MacOS 
X is a Unix?)

Or /dev/null, preferably.  Since the set of your projects is pretty much 
the same as the contents of that file.
