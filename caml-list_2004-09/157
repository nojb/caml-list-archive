In the new version of VC 2003, project files are just XML files with a bunch 
of appropriate tags, i.e. release, debug directories, project tpye etc..

It should be fairly trivial to write an editor that can read VC .proj files 
and add/remove from them like they were working with their own project files.

[snip rest of point 1]

not sure, haven't tried this. actually not sure about the rest of ur 
questions, I just wanted to point out that proj files for VC are pretty easy 
to customize.
