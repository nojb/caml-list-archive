There is also the FOX toolkit www.fox-toolkit.org which claims also to be
both on Unix & Windows. It is a nice (cross-platform) GUI toolkit (in C++)
also (but there is no Ocaml binding to it).

If there is a Python binding to it already, you might also consider coding a
WXwidget "server" by coding (in C) the few hooks to make a program using
WxWidgets which listen on a pipe (or whatever the Windows equivalent is) for
Python instructions, and sending back (to your application) some textual
protocol. I already coded this in GUIS (see
http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/guisdoc.html for more) for GTK2 (and you can
borrow some code if you like).

IMHO, the costly coding is to interface all the WXWidget API. If it has been
done once (for Python) you might try reusing it - either with Swig (for
Ocaml) or by pluggin a python interpreter. The GUI could even (as GUIS
suggest) run in a different process than your Ocaml application.


NB: I've got no knowledge on Windows, and no significant experience with
Swig or WxWidgets. So take all above with several grains of salt.
