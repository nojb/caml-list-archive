Thanks a lot for explaining this, I now understand the comment about=20
problems using mod_caml with apache 2 on the cocanwiki page.

Unfortunately I don't think I can install apache 1.3 on this server as=20
we're using apache 2 to serve our research lab website (I wanted to add=20
a wiki to this site), and I don't think one can have both running at the=20
same time. I'll try to find another machine to do this installation=20
then.

Thanks again,

Alan Schmitt
