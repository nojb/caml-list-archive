No, cross compiling to window is nice, and it should work.

The main point is that the code generation part should be made to build for a
different arch/os than the one the compiler is built on, which is not possible
right now, well at least not easily possible without mangling the built system
a lot.

Xavier and the rest of the ocaml team, would you consider such a feature for
3.09 ?
