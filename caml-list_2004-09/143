No it doesn't. That's the problem. If it really did work,
why do imake, omake, ocamake, cake, and many other
such derivates exist?

It fails to be even marginally scalable -- for any significant
project it collapses almost immediately, and these days
it fails -- totally and abysmally -- to cope with 99% of
all C projects as well -- which is why those projects also
use M4, Auto* tools, shell scripts, make templates, Perl
or Python, and many other such tools.

Extend that to a major system requiring multi-platform
support, multiple target kinds (debugging, s
tatic/dynamic link ...) multiple developers, versioning,
documentation and testing, multiple languages,
etc etc and the collapse is total -- the tool becomes
an *impediment* to productivity. Mandating that the
whole of such a control system be written in Perl
plus a small set of external tools is a much better,
more expressive and scalable solution.

I'm not saying make isn't useful, I'm saying it isn't
a general purpose project build tool. It doesn't even
come close.
