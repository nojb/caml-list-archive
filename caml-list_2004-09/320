What do you need dynamic dispatch for?  What problem are you trying to 
solve?

I ask because I don't think it's possible without Obj.magic and friends.  
I've never needed it, but who knows- you might have a legitimate need for 
it.  In which case your problem becomes a case example and shows me 
something important about Ocaml and programming.  Or you might just need 
to think about the problem differently.
