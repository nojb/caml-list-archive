[I have a question for the community at the end of this message.  If=20
you are interested in this general topic, then please consider=20
commenting on my question.  Thanks.]

OMake looks good, but it is GPL=97 which prevents me from using it until=20=

it is a widely distributed and mature product.  For developers=20
interested in a non-GPL (yet still open source) alternative to the=20
venerable Unix make(1) tool, I'd like to mention an old Perl project of=20=

mine: Conjury.

Conjury was written entirely in modular Perl, and one of its=20
interesting features is that the entire build system, including the=20
implementation of its construction tools, can be distributed within the=20=

source code tree of the project which uses it.  It depends only on a=20
stock installation of the Perl distribution.

Here is the README for the latest version:

	=
<http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Conjury/conjury-1.004.readme>

The rest of its documentation is bundled internally as Perldoc, and=20
there is no online repository for HTML pages for it.  Sorry.  It is=20
licensed under the 2-clause BSD license (like all of my code).  And=20
while I haven't maintained it in several years, I have been considering=20=

resurrecting it for use in my forthcoming OCaml Network Application=20
Environment (NAE), which I am building out on SF.Net now.  (This is the=20=

official project name on SourceForge for what I have previously called=20=

my Pagoda project.  There is already an unrelated Pagoda project on=20
SF.Net.)

I looked at cons and gnatmake and jam and lots of other tools back in=20
1999 when I wrote Conjury, and I found them all wanting.  I still need=20=

to write decent support for the OCaml toolchain before Conjury would=20
work for me, but at the moment, it's looking like the best alternative=20=

available for my purposes.

Would there be interest in Perl Conjury as a separate project if it=20
supported the OCaml toolchain, or can I safely just bundle it inside=20
OCaml NAE and hide it from the user with a shell written in the Unix=20
make(1) language?  Would anyone like to comment on that?  Thanks.
