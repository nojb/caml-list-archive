Anybody have a pointer to this?

I'm really comparing the situation with Python. If I write some
Python code, I KNOW that there are about 100 modules (including
some pretty esoteric stuff see http://docs.python.org/modindex.html)
that are GUARANTEED to be available at any destination which has
Python included.

The guaranteed availablity of huge variety of modules is something
I really miss in O'Caml, and thats on top of the fact that even
the standard modules have missing components like I pointed out
in the my earlier email in this thread.

Cheers,
Erik
