Do you mean OCamlSDL?  I'm afraid I don't have any answers, myself.  I
decided to get on with wrapping the Nebula2 3D engine in OCaml, rather
than deal with MSVC-ifying the OCamlSDL build.  I can, after all, use
Nebula2 for 2D stuff, and it has all the other components needed like
audio, input, etc.

The authors are listed on the following webpage, you might e-mail them.
http://ocamlsdl.sourceforge.net/contact.html
They have 3 mailing lists, accessible from their SourceForge project
page, but not linked to their homepage or Contacts page.
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=939
These mailing lists did have a trickle of activity in August 2004.  You
could be the 1st post for September.  :-)
