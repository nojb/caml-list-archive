camldep does give all of the necessary information (well, it used to).  It
seems to leave out dependencies that it thinks are obvious (foo.ml produces
foo.cmo or foo.cmx).  But, at least it has enough dependency information to
produce build rules.  I haven't seen anything actually use that information
though.

One problem it has is that if it can't find an appropriate file for a
dependency, it leaves it out.
