That isn't the point, though. There are tools that are not intended to 
produce stable outputs! For example, a tool might be generating time 
stamps or guids in its output files. Such tools will never work with a 
fixpoint scheme, so you can hardly claim its universality.

Also, I'm not convinced that the move from a declarative to an 
imperative build paradigm is really what most people into functional 
programming would like to see... ;-)
