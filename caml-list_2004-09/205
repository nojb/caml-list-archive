Hello list,

The OcamlNet project announces version 0.98 of this library collection.
This version includes a lot of smaller updates (listed below), and one
major API change that might break applications using OcamlNet.

Remember there was a discussion on caml-list about a standard for
object-based I/O. There was an agreement about the class type interface:
http://ocaml-programming.de/rec/IO-Classes.html. This version of
OcamlNet implements this convention, and unfortunately, the "input"
method now raises End_of_file instead of returning 0 when the end is
reached. Of course, programs relying on the value 0 no longer work. When
programs stop with "Uncaught exception: End_of_file" this might be an
indicator for this incompatibility. Sorry for the inconvenience, but
standardization has its price.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is ocamlnet?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A collection of modules for the Objective Caml language which focus on 
application-level Internet protocols and conventions.

The current distribution contains:

- a mature implementation of the CGI protocol

- an implementation of the JSERV protocol (AJP-1.2), can be used with
  mod_jserv (Apache JServ) and mod_jk (Jakarta connector) to connect
  application servers written in O'Caml with web servers

- an implementation of the FastCGI protocol

- an experimental POP3 client

- a library of string processing functions related to Internet 
  protocols (formerly known as "netstring" and distributed separately):
  MIME encoding/decoding, Date/time parsing, Character encoding
  conversion, HTML parsing and printing, URL parsing and printing,
  OO-representation of channels, and a lot more.

Ocamlnet is developed as a SourceForge project:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocamlnet

Developers and code contributions are welcome.

Ocamlnet is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of further changes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The legacy Cgi module is no longer built by default. One can still
create it by -enable-compatcgi.

Bugfixes in Netconversion's cursor implementation. It is now better
specified, and the corner cases are handled in a better way.

Bugfix in Mimestring.write_value: Folding of long encoded words is
now correct.

Bugfix in Netencoding.QuotedPrintable: Soft line breaks are added
when lines would become too long otherwise. Uses CRLF as line
separator in output now.

Bugfix in Nethtml: In some rare cases, end tags were handled
incorrectly.

Addition: In Netchannels, there are now delegation classes. Useful
if one wants only to redefine individual methods, and not whole
classes.

Addition: Netchannels.lift_in and lift_out is a simplified interface
to lift a class from raw_in/out_channel to in/out_obj_channel.

Improvement: Netmime.basic_mime_header avoids unnecessary modifications
of the order of existing header fields. It is also faster.

Additions: Mimestring.split_mime_type, split_uri.
Netbuffer.add_char, insert_string, insert_sub_string, insert_char.

Addition: Netulex is a support module for ulex

Improvement: For bytecode, ocamlnet includes now "accelerators",
i.e. C implementations of some time-intensive auxiliary functions.
Currently, the character set conversions from ISO-8859-1 and from
UTF-8 are accelerated.

Enhanced Netsendmail module: It is now possible to create much
more complicated mails, e.g. multipart/related mails.

Improvements in Neturl: New function parse_url automatically selects
the URL syntax. Support for a lot of new URL schemes. Enhanced
URL syntax: Support for userparam, and the prevention of relative
URLs.

Added charset CP-1047 (= Latin1 as EBCDIC).

Added ocamldoc to module interfaces, including a lot of tutorials.
