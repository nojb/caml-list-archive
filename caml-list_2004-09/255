Cool.  I will look at this in more detail soon.  I had a look through 
the test files and readme.  Looks good!  Bindings are a pita, I did a 
Lua binding to Ada 95.  Even though the C FFI in Ada is much nicer, it's 
still a task to get it done.  Was putting off the Lua binding to OCaml 
due to that experience!  Kudos to you!

Would you consider releasing it under the same conditions as Lua 5.x? 
It's no big deal, just wondered.
