LOL .. Why are you sorry?

Sure -- Ocaml changed. Your version of Unison hasn't
been upgraded to match. This particular problem 
was expected -- the change in Ocaml breaks compatibility.

However, it also removes problems with name clashes
when linking/compiling with other C stuff.
So some pain is expected in the transition but
it considered worthwhile.

I actually ran into this problem myself a while back
and didn't know what was going on either.

Probably just the stuff in quotes .. that's the C name of
the function. The LHS is the Ocaml name. However if you changed
the :HS names and all references to them, it should be OK.
