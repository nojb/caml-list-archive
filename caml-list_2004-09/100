That may be so, but can we do better? I mean, programmers are
always trying to automate things better, that's what our job is.

No you don't! You're making an assumption about build processes
that specifying dependencies is fundamental.

But that isn't the case. Here is a perfectly viable build script:

	build program
	build library

You think that will work? It sure does! Here is the driver:

	limit = 10
	run build
	while (--limit && new_outputs != old_outputs)
		run build
	
This isn't efficient but it works *without* specifying
dependencies or the correct build order. 

If you want it to be faster -- specify
the component builds in the right order :)

Point being -- getting the right order is an optimisation.

The problem is that the current technique for solving the ordering
problem is to compile and link libraries in a particular
order -- in other words, hand write the build script instead
of generating it.

However if the source code contained enough information,
the build scripts could be generated automatically.
