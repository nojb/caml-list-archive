As Carl Witty pointed out to me recently, there are quite a few
checkpointing programs that can dump an arbitrary process so that
it can be restarted later in the same state. I've recently been
using "ckpt" to save an OCaml toplevel session with HOL Light
preloaded, and it works very well. Maybe other OCaml users would
find the same thing useful. See:

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy/ckpt/

The only drawback is that this program is Linux-specific. There's
a long list of alternatives at http://www.checkpointing.org, but I
haven't found a suitable one for Windows. If anybody knows of one
(even if it only works under Cygwin) I'd be very interested.

John.
