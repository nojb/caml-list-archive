Well, I don't care about Windows and its users.  I don't have to care. =20=

I have a day job that pays the rent, and neither the Windows platform=20
nor its users are a significant part of my personal lifestyle=20

I think you have your priorities crossed.  Lots of good code migrates=20
out of the Unix culture into the Windows development world, but it=20
historically *never* happens when Unix-centric people push=97 only when=20=

Windows-centric people pull.

Remember the ancient hippie proverb: "Ass, gas or grass;=A0nobody rides=20=

for free."  If you want to see growth on the Windows platform (or any=20
other platform), then you need to start paying for it=97=A0either in =
euros=20
or in time spent coding on it.

Ah, I see where we have gone awry.  Since I don't have a payroll, I'm=20
in no position to recruit.  Since it will be a long time before I have=20=

anything to sell, I am expending very little effort on marketing.  I do=20=

a Windows port of my library, and if I did, I would code it myself.

I am merely including in my announcements (four of them, so far=97 five=20=

counting this one) a note that I don't have support for Windows, and=20
that I would need assistance porting it.  If you want a Windows port,=20

the integration of appropriate patches into future releases.  Waiting=20

Arggh.  I'm not blaming "Windows whiners" for the status of *my*=20
project.  I'm blaming them for the status of *YOUR* project.

My project is moving along just fine (pretty close to a major release=20
of a whole raft of useful new components) on the [very] limited=20
publicity and non-existent Windows support it currently enjoys, thank=20
you.  Your project appears to be suffering setbacks with every message=20=

you post to the list.

(Here is the real motivation for me to post this off-topic drivel=97 I=20=

interpreter, would be a fantastic contribution to the community.  I=20
