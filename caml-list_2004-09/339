Which means 'look and feel' :)

LGPL isn't fine if you statically link OR #include
any GTK headers. That makes your binary a derived
work. It says so in the LGPL licence. So your
*source* may not be LGPL, but the resultant 
program is.

Then this clause applies, and it is anything but
what is required for a commercial situation,
where typically 'totally unencumbered' is the only
viable position:


  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
                                                                                
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
