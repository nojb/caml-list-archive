There is no "linking" involved when you use the built-in rules of omake. 
The way it looks is that in your own OMakeroot file you will have 
something like:

#
# Include the standard configuration
#
include $(STDROOT)

(although I do not really know what would be considered "linking" in a 
case of an interpreted language).

As I mentioned in an earlier post, the "built-in" support of C, OCaml, 
LaTeX, etc is not some built-in magic - there is just a "global" omake 
file that is included in the distribution that defines a number of 
default rules, using the same syntax that you would use in your own 
OMakefile.

The situation is identical to having a big make file with a lot of 
useful rules and you just adding
include /usr/local/lib/make/UsefulMakeFile
to the Makefile in your project. Doing something like that would in no 
way require modifying make itself in any way.

I would guess there would be nothing wrong with using a liberal license 
(BSD or like) on this "global omake file", in order to allow users to 
borrow pieces of it and freely modify them as needed, while the main 
omake engine would still stay GPL... Do people feel that a license 
change of this sort would be helpful?
