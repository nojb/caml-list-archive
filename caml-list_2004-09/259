I'm here (not for very long, I'm going back in a few days to CEA
working on other things, probably unrelated to Ocaml).

However, this optimisation is not for OcamlJIT, which is an
unoptimizing JIT. The main requirement of OcamlJIT was full
compatibility with Ocamlrun without touching a single line in the
ocaml/**/*.ml* sources (the ** is zsh notation) of Ocaml (actually, I
had to cheat for the toplevel where I added a single line, now
incorporated in 3.08).

Of course, one could dream of substantially change the bytecode
instruction set (for better JIT translation). But it won't be
compatible with Ocaml.

If you ask me, the one feature I would have liked in the bytecode
instruction set, is to add a LABEL bytecode, followed by a useless
word (used by ocamljit to store a pointer to machine code), and to
change the bytecode generator so that every closure had its code
pointer pointing to this LABEL bytecode.

But the rule of the OcamlJIT game was to leave Ocaml as much as
possible unchanged.

BTW, I would be delighted to have feedback of people using OcamlJit
with Ocaml 3.08.
