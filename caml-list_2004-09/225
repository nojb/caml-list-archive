Do you mean that the integers of type int are not mod 2^31 in Ocaml?

That's certainly an argument to make me make my mind to switch,
which I was postponing forever, having failed to translate my
simple programs to Ocaml (I have to confess I did not try hard).

I learnt how to use the "num" library in order to deal with larger
integers than 2^30, but if Ocaml makes it simpler...

I was sticking to the advice on
http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/bigpicture.html

   Should I switch from Caml Light to Objective Caml?

   Caml Light is still maintained, though no longer actively
   developed.  We make bug-fix releases from time to time and
   still provide support for it.  It provides a more stable
   programming environment than Objective Caml, which is still
   evolving, though at a slower pace than immediately after its
   introduction.

   If you're perfectly happy with Caml Light, value reliability
   more than performance, don't need the new module system, don't
   need the new object stuff, then stay with Caml Light. If you
   need objects, powerful modules, the native-code compiler, or
   just like being on the cutting edge, go for Objective Caml.
