Very good! I designed and implemented some build-things myself, this is one of 
the must requirements for any automatic dependency checker. It's sort of 
obvious to use MD5 and include rules in the hash, but the really good idea in 
omake is making one batteries-included package that doesn't depend on 
external scripts or anything like that. I believe that approach is much 
better than autotools approach, where everything is a mess. I know it, 
because I built KDE so many times!

I was actually thinking of re-implementing GNU make in ocaml in a similar way, 
this shows that more can be done.
