I was flipping through the OCaml manual while riding a train this past 
weekend when I noticed a small oddity.  While the individual modules of 
the standard library are presented in alphabetical order, the other 
libraries documented in the manual are not presented in any particular 
order.  While this doesn't really matter if you are looking at the pdf 
or html versions of the manual, it is a bit of a nuisance when trying 
to find the appropriate section in a printed version.

Is there some reason they're not in alphabetical order?  Could they be 
rearranged in a later release?

And in a completely unrelated note:  Congratulations to team OCant 
(which includes such familiar folk as Damien Doligez and Xavier Leroy) 
on winning the judges prize at this year's ICFP programming contest 
<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/contest/results.php>.  An 
extremely cool bunch of hackers, indeed.
