Sorry for not answering earlier. GC simpòy is not an issue. We allocate 
a lot, but newly allocated blocks tend to have a very short life. The GC 
  is kept latent during PLC rounds and activated between rounds with 
heap compaction disabled. The full_major collection is an order of 
magnitude faster than the cycle time we require, and since we run it 
sistematically between rounds it runs in constant and predictable time.

The only unpredictable latencies are due to heap compaction, but we only 
run heap compaction when the system is known to be in quiescent state 
until user input.
