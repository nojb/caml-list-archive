with anyone :/ If I'm trying to be nice and helpful then everyone
takes adventage of it for some reason, does it happen to you ? My
classes are ok, I love my english class since the teacher is very nice
to me and I think I will get a good grade in it ;) Lately I been into
drawing in my free time, I love art as well.  Anyways I won't bore you
