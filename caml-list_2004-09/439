I'm sorry, I was wrong.  The normal DLL loading mechanism will report the
name of the DLL that's missing, but LoadLibrary will simply set the error
and exit.  You could use a DLL dependency tool to find out which DLL yours
depends on (e.g., Cygwin's "cygcheck", which will also work on non-Cygwin
DLLs/programs).

I'd be interested in the results (hopefully positive) of your tests.  Feel
free to e-mail me directly with this info.
