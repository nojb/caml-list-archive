Yes, actually, I've realized that mailing lists such as this are filled
with early adopters who are nevertheless 100% satisfied with their
personal situation.  It's not everybody, but it's always somebody.  If I
talk about improvement, they're always vocal about how satisfied they
are.  I encountered a similar phenom on comp.lang.python and this
confirms the archetype.  My main purpose is to have a presence and
provide a channel for people who are *NOT* satisfied.  In other words, I
seek recruits for ocaml-biz, COCAN, and ocamlgames.

You're welcome.  There's a lot of truth in stereotypes.  One of the
reasons I gave up on Seattle's local Python user groups, is I'd keep
going to meetings, and they'd talk about all sorts of text processing
scripting database stuff.  Never about 3D graphics, AI, or games.  I
conclude that there's this entire world of text processual data that a
lot of people are into, that they think is really really kewl, but that
I've just never been involved in.  I suppose text has a compelling
tractability, it seems to fit the UNIX scripter hacker meme.  Contrast
this to Windows which doesn't even have a decent OS shell by default.
Instead one has abundant GUI eye candy.  Between the UNIX and Windows
world, there is clearly a split between textual and graphical
orientation.  It's not an exclusive split, I did say it was a
stereotype, but in terms of dominant trends it's quite true.

OCaml's UNIX-centric community doesn't strike me as an exception to this
rule.  My plans are mainly about graphics technologies I need to build,
not graphics technologies that are readily available.  OCaml is mainly
proven in the realm of language transformation.  So, is its
UNIX-oriented community an accident?  I think not.

'Twas a stereotype, not a vent.

You sure make a big deal out of out of 1 initial statement that was
framed with the caveat, "I know you Linux / mingw guys aren't into
this."  I was just being honest about what native Windows developers
actually consider useful.  If one thinks one's solving some kind of
Windows deployment goal, well, cross-compilation from Linux ain't it.
It's an avoidance goal, not a deployment goal.

I think that's your point of view, not my project.  Discussions of what
may or may not be my projects are best left to ocamlgames and ocaml-biz.
