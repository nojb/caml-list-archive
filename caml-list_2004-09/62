Interesting !
However, I can't help thinking that I don't write to learn yet another
language for writing my Makefiles... Why not using directly OCaml for
writing Makefiles and exposing all nice OMake features through a library ?
You would benefit of a good tool for error checks which is the Ocaml
compiler.

Other way to ask the question : what features make the OMake language better
than OCaml for writing Makefiles ? Or is it just syntactic sugar ?

Nicolas Cannasse
