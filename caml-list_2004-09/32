The copyright holders, the lead of whom is Xavier Leroy, so it should probably
be best if you simply wrote to th caml-team mailing address, which you should
easily enough find at the caml web page, at the bottom of it if i remember
well.

Please keep me in CC if you do so, as i have interest in following this
discussion, and maybe some insight to provide on the licencing issues.

Friendly,
