Ocamake is using ocamldep to build the dependency tree :
http://tech.motion-twin.com/ocamake.
However, two modules can be mutualy recursive from ocamldep point of view
(both ML depending on other MLI), and this is not enough information to know
in which order we need to link the CMO : this even might be impossible to
link in the cases the modules are effectively recursive ! OCamake is doing
some additional heuristics to try to guess which linking order is best.
