I run across this problem all the time at work with C/C++ header
files. The difference here is C/C++ allows forward declarations which
remove the need for cyclic includes. However, it adds on maintenance
requirements for renaming structures and classes and their
declarations all over the place if things get messy.

I'm glad OCaml atleast 'seems' to have a more well defined approach to
cyclic dependencies.
