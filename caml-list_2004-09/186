...what do you imagine you'll be doing with OCaml?  What kind of
technological progress do you hope has occurred in OCaml-land by then?
This can include the language itself, libraries, community
infrastructure, killer apps, etc.

This isn't a question with right-or-wrong answers.  It's just everyone's
personal crystal balling.  I'm hoping to learn what various contingents
of the OCaml community care about, in a long term strategic sense.
