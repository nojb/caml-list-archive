I was the initiator of a discussion much like this just recently.

The good advice I got was to refactor and move the common stuff
own the module hiearchy. So if you have two modules A and B
which SEEM to need each other, create a new module C containing
the required commong code and use the functionality of C in
both A and B.

I tried this for my situation and it not only worked like a charm,
in hindsight it made a whole lot more sense this way.
