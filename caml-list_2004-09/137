I think (and hope) that existing practice supports the idea that
linking does create a derived work.

I am the (sole) author of a library released under dual license;
the GPL for linking with GPL compatibale code and a commercial use
license allowing people to use the library in closed source
applications. This commercial use license earns me money.

The very fact that I give people an option (GPL or commercial)
shows the intention that the library can only be used with 
closed source programs if a license is paid for. I am hoping
that not even the slimiest lawyer would try to get around this.

If you do decide to hire a lawyer, be aware of the large body
of existing practice that would be used by the defence to 
uphold the linking/derived work connection.
