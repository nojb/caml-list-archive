(This is the second post.
Ocaml mailing list seems to be something wrong.)

I tried to implement Ocaml binding for wxWidgets
a few months ago which followed the same method as wxHaskell
(http://wxhaskell.sourceforge.net/).

Anyone who has interest in this job can find some comments and tar ball
at http://pllab.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/wxcaml/doc/index.html.

There is an example program which uses frame, menubar, menu, statusbar
widgets.

Current Status:
I used "ocamlidl" to generat types and functions for ocaml
which was done without any problem.
And then I tried to implement "wxcaml" as object-oriented style like LablGtk
but it required too much time.
Any comments?

Good luck.
