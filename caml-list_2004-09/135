This is sensible, I'd say it is a requirement of a general-purpose build 
system.  We have updated the OMake configuration files to include the 
MIT unrestricted-use license explicitly.

The OMake interpreter remains GPL, which should not affect licensing in 
your project.  The script files use the MIT license, which reads as follows:
