Sorry, I meant how did you find Gtk+ on Windows?  Was Gtk-Wimp 
successful at presenting a Windows style interface?  I have only used 
gtk-wimp in the context of a code editor, gps - for Ada development, it 
seemed much closer to the Windows L&F but IIRC it wasn't entirely there. 
  This was a while ago though.

WxWidgets supports OpenGL now, so if there was a binding that would be 
an option.
