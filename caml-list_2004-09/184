1) this is not a problem of infection, but of right to do something or
   not.
   And the problem with the LGPL is not a problem of linkage (LGPL
   puts no restriction on the linkage itself), but that there are
   conditions in the LGPL which are difficult to fulfill without
   dynamic linking (difficult - not impossible).

2) the point I was trying to make was that the distinction between
   static and dynamic linkage is not relevant here, since the tool 
   discussed does not link to anything anyway.

Or do you just mean that since linkage has not been tested before the
courts, it may mean just anything, including everything present on the
same hard disk?
An ambiguity is only a problem if you happen to be in the ambiguous
area. I do not see how it can matter when you are well outside of it.

(My last answer, this discussion is getting completely ridiculous)
