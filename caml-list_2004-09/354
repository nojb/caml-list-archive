I'm the french student having worked on it. The reason why I haven't
made any official release is that it doesn't work at all; I couldn't
solve memory issues. 
I'm working on a little "developper documentation" on my spare time, but
I have got fewer and fewer spare time, so... And what i've done for the
moment is in french... 

Whatever, what I can say you is that i've made a caml tool equivalent to
"wxDirect", which parses C header, and generate a typed Caml binding to
wxWidget. Even if the source of this tool is very awful (i couldn't find
time to clean it), it works quiet well, as the binding works -at least
on the few examples inspired from wxhaskell's one that i've tried-, and
as the typing scheme seems fine. I also tried to find solution to make a
nice integration of this binding to Ocaml, including garbage collection,
which doesn't work at all.

I think i will release something -a developper release- when the
developper documentation is ready, but i can't say you when: as I said
upper, i have very very few time to spend on it.

Whatever, feel free to ask me for more information, i will try to help
anybody asking...

Good night...
