Not necessarily, but I'm not 100 sure I can justify that.

Consider mathematical code that uses lazy evaluation. Certain
expressions might be expressed in terms of an infinite sum of
terms. It would also be possible to have two expressions
declared like this, divide one by the other and have something
which when evaluated results in a finite constant and without 
even trying to evaluate the two infinite sums.
