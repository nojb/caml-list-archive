Graph drawing is an open and active research topic which makes a heavy
usage of state-of-the-art optimization tools and algorithms.

Displaying a graph "as planar as possible" is (of course) an NP-hard
problem and even a very hard one because constraints are not totally
explicit (most of the time you would like an interactive tool that
allows you to add and remove constraints while looking for a
satisfactory answer).

Try AGD (it is built over LEDA)
