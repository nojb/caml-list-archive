I have started some time ago with this and interfaced a few classes of 
wxwidgets, just to see how it works. I implemented (parts of) the 
application , window and menu classes and parts of the event system ( you can 
use 'connect' to connect ocaml functions to menus events);  So the basic way 
was ok. I just wanted to do something different ;-)

I don't like the swig way so I didn't use it, but it's a pain to go c++ -> c 
-> ocaml, massive typing :-), maybe c++ -> c -> ocamlidl would be better...

cheers
 Michael
