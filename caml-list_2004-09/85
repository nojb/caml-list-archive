I think this is going to depend on how threads are implemented, and as I
understand it, that varies depending on what platform, and which compiler
you are using.

I've attached a small program that will help determine this.  As far as I
can tell, on Linux, there seems to only be one current directory shared
between all of the threads.  This is the same for native and byte-code.
