I wasn't referring to myself.  I was referring to Jere Sanisalo's work
on ocalibs.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocalibs/  Apparently I'm
the first person to notice his work and give feedback upon it.  I'm
still evaluating whether it's good enough to build an OCaml gaming
empire out of.  Jere is responsive but, like most authors volunteering
code, overworked.  If anyone wants to help his project, that would be
great.  For our part, one or the other of us will probably cough out a
VS 2003 build in a week or two.  It currently has some VS6 project
components, so this is just a small modernization effort.

I was writing a long C.V. to answer your question.  Then I realized it's
off-topic and you're probably not that interested in the answer anyways.
I will give you the operative answer you want to hear:

"None."

It's not quite true, but it's true enough for your purposes.  I'm more
interested in people with shared purpose.  Please join us on
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocamlgames/ in that case.
