I haven't been working on this since April.  In fact, I diverted into
SML/NJ for a time.  Around July a would-be business partner of mine
caused me to drop what I was doing and worry about Python.  I got over
that; I don't take him too seriously now.  I decided that an OCaml
Script Server is probably going to be slow, but I've been avoiding
writing a SWIG wrapper for Nebula2 because it's going to be (1) painful
(2) politically difficult.  I worked on my AI stuff instead.  A few days
ago I decided, however, that I need to implement the OCaml Script Server
for political purposes, not technical ones.  It is a scaffolding, and
not what I'd call a fun project.

Richard, I really wish you'd answer my e-mails about not being able to
access the COCAN wiki.  I've sent you 2 now, to 2 different addresses.
Why can't I see it?  Switching ISPs didn't solve the problem.  I'm using
IE6 version 6.0.2800.1106.  128-bit, all service packs and bugfixes.

I'm off to my sister's wedding, and returning Monday, so I won't be able
to correspond until then.


Cheers,                         www.indiegamedesign.com
