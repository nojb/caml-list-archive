Hi all,

The name of the student is François-Xavier Houard.
He is a student of Emmanuel Chailloux.
His email address is : fxhouard@free.fr

Hi worked on a wxWidgets-ocaml binding for a few months. He continued this work 
as a summer job during July and August at LexiFi in Paris.

Unfortunately, he didn't have enough time to finish this indeed very interesting 
work.

I'm sure he will be happy to share his experience and code with anybody 
interested. I let him step in (be patient, he's now supposed to be in a 
university lecture and can only read this list later)...
