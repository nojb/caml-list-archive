I want to be able to extend the functions so that my build system knows=20=

how to use more toolchains than just C and Ocaml, and I want those=20
extensions to be bundled with my non-GPL code.  If I were to use Omake,=20=

then I expect my code would link to the functions in the Omake=20
distribution, and I would then be in violation of the GPL if I didn't=20
use a GPL-compatible license for my distribution.

I think LGPL might be a more appropriate license for you if you are=20
interested in broadening the user base for Omake beyond the GPL=20
cybersphere.

I'm not trying to argue for you to change the license.  I am not nearly=20=

enough of an egomaniac to believe that my declining to use your tool=20
should be considered a "strong argument" for you to adopt a different=20
license.
