    Bonjour,

I never understood how worked those functions building a balanced
search tree from a sorted list in O(n) _without_ first counting the
number of elements in the list.

Hence it is not implemented in Baire. As far as I know, there is no
Caml implementation of any of them either (they all iter on the list
applying O(log n) insertion function) but I may be wrong.

SML/NJ standard library has a O(n) 'from_ordered_list' function for
red-black trees. SML/NJ implementation of red-black trees uses zippers
to handle insertion and deletion operations. It may be difficult to
understand if you are not used to them.

Ralf Hinze wrote a good paper on red-black trees (Constructing
red-black trees, WAAAPL'99, available from his website). It explains
how to implement 'from_ordered_list' in O(n) and most of existent
functional implementations must be more or less based on it.
