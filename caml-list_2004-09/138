If you are bundling, not linking, what's wrong with bundling the GPL OMake 
with your non-GPL code, and contributing your OMake improvements back to 
OMake?  

You are perfectly entitled to bundle incompatibly-licensed programs.

If OMake's GPL license somehow compels people to contribute back more 
`toolchain-awareness' and therefore grows the program, then the GPL seems 
like the *ideal* license.  Afterall, it is very unlikely that you will have 
anything of commercial value in the OMake extensions -- would it not be fair 
to say?
