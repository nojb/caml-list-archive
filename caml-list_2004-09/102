It isn't universal, though.  There are pathalogical cases, even with common
tools where it never will stabilize.  It is an exercise in the TeXbook.
There are also some old Ada compilers that wouldn't build without proper
ordering.  Fortunately, with Ada, the order can be determined from the
source.

In fact, other than C, and the few things I mentioned earlier about ocaml,
a possible (and correct) build order can be determined from an analysis of
the source, and an understanding of the languages involved.

I'm not sure if having a specific build order is a bad thing, I just think
make's approach to determine it aren't right.
