Ok, so you are an aspiring game developer who has written no games.
You are also an aspiring ocaml game developer who has written no ocaml
( according to your posts ).

At the same time, you have strong opinions on what the Ocaml community
should be doing to meet with your approval.
( Summary: completely different from what it is currently doing. )

With no experience in developing commercial or significant opensource games, 
and even less experience in OCaml, you preach on Ocaml implementation issues.
What chutzpah !

You last tried this kind of trolling in the FreeCiv groups.
Could you please go back there ?

BTW: your web site has been down since March...
