Hi,

Was looking on the web for an alternative to using GTK+ on Windows (no 
flames please) and found WxWidgets.  It looks like a quite nice GUI 
toolkit.  There seemed to be some interest in developing a OCaml binding 
via Swig according to the net, but I can't find any such binding.

Has anyone made such a binding?  If not I was thinking about using swig 
and the wxpython interfaces as the starting point for a wxwidgets 
binding for ocaml.  Has anyone tried to do this in the past?  Any 
thoughts on the issue?


Cheers,
Chris
