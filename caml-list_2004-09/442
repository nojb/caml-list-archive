                    April 19--21, 2005
	      
                        Nara, Japan


The 16th Int. Conf. on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA'05) 
will collocate with the 7th International Conference on Typed Lambda
Calculi and Applications (TLCA'05) as part of the Federated Conference 
on Rewriting, Deduction and Programming (RDP'05).


IMPORTANT DATES:
 Nov    12, 2004: Deadline for electronic submission of title and abstract
 Nov    19, 2004: Deadline for electronic submission of papers
 Jan    14, 2005: Notification of acceptance of papers
 Feb     4, 2005: Deadline for final versions of accepted papers
 Apr 19-21, 2005: Conference
The deadlines are strict.


RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects 
of rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

* APPLICATIONS:
  case studies; rule-based (functional and logic) programming; 
  symbolic and algebraic computation; theorem proving;
  system synthesis and verification; proof checking.
* FOUNDATIONS:
  matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;
  strategies; constraint solving; explicit substitutions; tree automata.
* FRAMEWORKS:
  string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
  higher-order rewriting; proof nets; constrained
  rewriting/deduction; categorical and infinitary rewriting.
* IMPLEMENTATION:
  compilation techniques; parallel execution; rewriting tools.
* SEMANTICS:
  equational logic; rewriting logic.


INVITED TALKS will be given at RTA'05 by:
  * Amy Felty                 (Ottawa)
  * Yoshihito Toyama          (Sendai)
  * Philip Wadler             (Edinburgh)


BEST PAPER AWARDS AND TRAVEL GRANTS:
An award of 100,000 Yen will be given to the best paper or papers as decided
by the PC. 

A limited number of student travel grants is available. Preference will be
given to students whose papers are accepted at RTA and who do not have
alternative funding. Students applying for travel support should indicate this
by sending an e-mail to the PC chair (giesl@informatik.rwth-aachen.de)
together with their submission.

rewriting techniques will be very welcome. The page limit is 15 pages (10
pages for system descriptions).

Computer Science series. More information about paper submission is available
at the RTA'05 web page.
