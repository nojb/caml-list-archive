The OCaml Network Application Environment is a project to provide a=20
modular framework of libraries in Objective Caml to support the=20
development of concurrent, single-thread-reactive network application=20
servers with a functional programming style.

	The project page on SourceForge is here=20
<URL:http://sf.net/projects/ocnae/>.

Its centerpiece will be a general-purpose implementation of the Blocks=20=

Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) Core, and other application=20
protocols may follow.  It is a work in progress, and most of the code=20
is not yet ready for production use, but a preview release is on the=20
near horizon.  (NOTE: This is *not* a solicitation for assistance.)

Previously on the Caml List, I have made announcements about a personal=20=

project I called "Pagoda".  I have also mentioned that my earlier Iox=20
project has been abandoned and that I am working on a new project with=20=

the same purpose in mind.  The OCaml NAE is that project; it has been=20
renamed to be more descriptive, and to resolve a conflict with another=20=

project on the SourceForge.Net project hosting service.

The only package currently released in this project is the Core=20
Foundation (Cf) library, which is identical to the currently released=20
Cf library that is listed under my name on the Caml Humps.  I would be=20=

grateful if the Humps could be updated to reflect the migration of this=20=

library into the SourceForge File Release System.  I would also be=20
grateful if the Projects page at the Beepcore web site could be amended=20=

to list this project as Type: Peer.

Additionally, I have just uploaded a raft of source code into the CVS=20
repository for the OCaml NAE project.  All of this new code, including=20=

the current snapshot of the BEEP core implementation, has not been=20
published until now and it remains almost entirely undocumented.  I=20
mention it because developers of network application servers interested=20=

in my progress may wish to monitor this SourceForge project.

I plan to make another announcement soon to the Caml list and the BEEP=20=

Builders list when the preview release is available.
