Hi all,

I have created a binding from Haskell to wxWidgets, called wxHaskell.
You can find more information (and nice screenshots) at 
<wxhaskell.sourceforge.net>
There is also a paper about it at <www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/pubs.html>

I also know that there is a student in France that has made a lot of 
progress
on an O'Caml binding to wxWidgets (as he contacted me a few times
about technical issues). He also used the wxEiffel C wrapper (that wxHaskell
uses)

Personally, I am very impressed with wxWidgets: wxHaskell works
very well across the main platforms (MacosX, Windows, and GTK)
and is quite stable. It is also nice that wxWidgets uses native controls
on each platform, giving an application native look-and-feel.

A particularly pragmatic route to implementing a wxWidgets binding
to wxHaskell would adapt the wxDirect program of wxHaskell to generate
O'Caml bindings and just copy the wxHaskell model -- it would fit O'Caml
quite well, especially when OCaml objects are used to model the C++ classes.

Anyway, I hope this helps,
All the best,
 Daan Leijen.

[ps. I probably won't  respond to this thread anymore as I am going to 
ICFP.]
