I've been using omake for a while now and it has worked very well for
us.  One nice feature of omake as opposed to ordinary make (not sure
how this compare to scons and other competitors) is that omake takes a
broader view of dependencies, including the rules themselves in the
calculation.  So, for example, when you modify a build command,
everything that was built with that build command is recompiled.
