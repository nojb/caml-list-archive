I have read the Laurikari article and it describes the kind
of thing I was looking for. It provides a mathematical formalism
for Tagged NFAs and gives an modification of the subset
construction which handles determinising such TNFAs.

I think this gives all the functionality of lex
and Str/PCRE together (except for back references).

That seems a reasonable goal for a first release
because it can simplify the life or ordinary
programmers as well as compiler implementors.

Perhaps more expressive automata will follow
(as well as performance improvements :)
