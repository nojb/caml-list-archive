Indeed, ocamlgraph does not deal  with the display of graphs, which is
notoriously a difficult problem (and we are not graphs specialists, so
we won't enter such a trap). However, ocamlgraph has an output for the
ASCII .dot  format, to be used  for instance with the  Graphviz set of
tools:  http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/   (there  is  a
Debian package called graphviz for instance)

Among these  tools there  is one displaying  graphs (called  dot, with
outputs in various formats  including PostScript), which makes efforts
to  display planar graphs  (but sometimes  it fails  to draw  a planar
graph as planar). The dot input syntax is very simple.

On the Graphviz web site, you'll also find a lot of material regarding
the problem of graph layout.
