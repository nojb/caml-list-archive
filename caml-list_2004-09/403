Greetings,

I am trying to return a file handle from C. A simple Val_long does not
work, so I did some research and found something like the following:

  return caml_alloc_channel(caml_open_descriptor_out(myhandle));

This compiles (with 2 warnings):

  warning: implicit declaration of function `caml_alloc_channel'
  warning: implicit declaration of function `caml_open_descriptor_out'

However, the functions should be avaliable once running in ocaml, no?

Anyway, my real problem lies in the fact that when I do something like:

let fh = get_my_out_handle () in
Printf.fprintf fh "Hello, World!\n";;

nothing appears in my output file. No warning, errors or anything. In my
C source, I can do the exact thing and the contents are written.

Can anyone help me return a file handle from C to OCaml that can be used
with the OCaml output/input functions? I do realize a different type
would have to be returned for input/output. I was working on the output
portion first.

Thanks,

Jeremy Cowgar
