Almost certainly Graphviz is your friend; specifically, the "dot" program.

  http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/

It's very easy to write your own binding to this (i.e., write out a
simple text file in .dot format), although I'm sure someone has
written one themselves if you prefer.

Another option is daVinci, but it went commercial a while ago - I'm
not sure what the license terms are.  It was certainly open and free
once upon a time.
