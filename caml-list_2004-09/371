Did the question mention anything about the space used by the algorithm?
If one is allowed O(n) temp space, then simply converting the sorted
linked List into a temp array as the first step will keep the algorithm
O(n) (constant factors aside).  One would need a constant-time-access data
structure anyway, to build a balanced tree bottom-up in a functional way.
