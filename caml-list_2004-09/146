Hahahah :) Autoconf doesn't even work on Linux!

Python worked pretty well cross platform, with some care,
for pure Python code for quite some time -- but with distutils
the transparency is enhanced to include C extensions which is a
pretty major leap forward, since extensions are a vital part
of Python.

In fact, Ocaml is pretty close to this goal already: the
lower level technology is largely in place, and tools
like 'findlib' help with integration. There's just no
top level tool, because to make one requires a standard
package architecture (way of installing things so they
get found and built if necessary).

INRIA would probably say "that's not our problem".

I doubt IDE's solve this -- they simply provide an interactive
management facility with a higher level of automation, but the price
is that extending them is much harder: they don't scale either,
they just break later :)
