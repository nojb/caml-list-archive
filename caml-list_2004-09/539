I haven't actually checked, but I suspect I'd find something similar.
There may
be an interesting psychological observation to be made here: most people
find
very high-order functions intellectually unmanageable.

Something similar is usually acknowledged in logic with respect to long
quantifier alternations (for all x there exists a y such that for all z,
...).
I believe I once saw a provocative claim by Kreisel that most
mathematical
concepts are in fact only invented in order to hide complicated
quantifier
alternations.

I've just had a look through some real programs that I've written and
the=20
answer is definitely yes. I use them quite a lot. For >2 they are mainly
3,=20
sometimes 4 and I haven't seen any >4.

I seem to use them when I write generic functions which are later
specialised.

Funny to think that this function is still state-of-the-art Java and
C++. ;-)
