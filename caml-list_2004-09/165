Because they have knowledge and experience that your average programmer or 
blowhard on the internet doesn't have.  I wouldn't trust the average 
lawyer to write code, and I wouldn't trust the average programmer to write 
a license.

I'm not 100% sure where the line is drawn here.  Nor am I 100% sure anyone 
else is either.

That "blowhard on the internet" quip includes me- IANAL.  An analogy to 
make things clear: I can, with a few sentences, explain type inference to 
my grandmother.  But there are a heck of a lot of intricies and subtlities 
that will get glossed over in this paragraph introduction- some of them 
not so intricate or subtle.  Exactly how corner cases and gray areas get 
handled can not be deduced from this abstract.

In this case, I am grandma- I've had the five minute abstract thrown at 
me over dinner in casual conversation.
