Well, I wanted to use Lua from Ocaml, so I wrote an interface to do so. 
It's somewhat incomplete and probably slightly buggy at the moment, and
the error-handling isn't great, but it works.  Comments and advice are
welcome; this is my first attempt to do anything big/serious with Ocaml's
FFI.  I've only tried this on Linux, but it should work fine under MinGW
or Cygwin.

You can get it at: http://cec.wustl.edu/~snh1/olua-0.1.tar.gz
