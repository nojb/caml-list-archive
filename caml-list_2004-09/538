When he says that "theorem proving algorithms do not work [...] they
only prove trivial theorems",
he may just be out of date, or he may only be talking about completely
automatic provers. (Even
then his claim is a bit questionable: what about the Robbins Conjecture
etc.?)
=20
I didn't notice anything about the relevance of the halting problem in
that page, so maybe it's
somewhere else. Anyway, it's clearly not relevant to proving the
correctness of typical real-world
algorithms, whatever he may or may not say.
=20
His general dismissive attitude to formal methods is not uncommon. And
it's prefectly reasonable
to point out that modern computer systems can be so complex and
ill-defined that they are hardly
amenable to formal treatment. But a more balanced view would acknowledge
the significant
success of formal methods in certain niches, and their role in trying to
check that very unmastered
complexity.=20
