What I specifically meant by "not been answered authoritively" is that 
it's never been put in front of a judge.  There is basically no precedent 
to cover this.  While existing practice is helpfull, as it tells the judge 
what is "common sense", it's not as helpfull as precedent is.

Personally, I'm not sure where common sense lies here.  What's the 
definition of derivitive work?  What's the definition of linking?
