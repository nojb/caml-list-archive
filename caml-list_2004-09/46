No, that was not a typo, but your are right, I had problems with my 
Cygwin mount points (this automatic mounting in the Cygwin setup scripts).

The other question is about the GODI distribution which I don't think is 
intended to be compared to CPAN but would like to make ocaml and library 
distribution easier and in a kind standardized 
(http://www.ocaml-programming.de/godi/). For Cygwin beginners this 
procedures of building Ocaml and then Ocaml libraries from source could 
be in a way to difficult or "tedious" before they could use Ocaml.

So, my idea about creation of a Cygwin Ocaml library package wasn't 
meant to include GODI in this package. But, GODI could be an example of 
what libraries are important for other developers. Actually, GODI shows 
which libraries can be built relatively easily under Cygwin.

Personally, I'm using the libraries around the pxp XML Parser from G. 
Stolpmann (PCRE, findlib, ocamlnet, wlex, pxp) and I can remember what 
problems I had in the beginning to build PCRE-Ocaml (STATIC=1 and so on; 
even more in the times the Cygwin-PCRE package wasn't updated). Without 
PCRE-Ocaml nothing would work, so I was stuck. I think for beginners and 
even for every developer in OCaml (Cygwin) a Cygwin package including 
such libraries would be very valuable.
