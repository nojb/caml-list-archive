Dear Adrien,

Many thanks for your prompt and positive response!

Well, I am not an expert either. I mean, I face accessibility issues as
a user, but that does not necessarily mean I know how to fix them as
people tend to believe. I should probably learn that, too.

The W3C has a work group on accessibility, the WAI (Web Accessibility
Initiative).

This group has published:
- The WCAG, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines:
https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag
- Tge ATAG (Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines):
https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag
 
And a few other documents that may be a bit less relevant here.

I also did a little presentation on accessibility. It is not focused on
web accessibility but may be of interest to those curious about how
blind people use computers:
http://brl.thefreecat.org/conf.mkv

The presentation is in french, sorry about that.

And the video has a bug (when I run X the content of the screen is not
displayer), I hope this will be fixed soon.

I am not sure how to make such features accessible either. Intuitively,
I have always thought that a pad that can be modified by several persons
in parallel is intrinsically inaccessible. However, I don't know whether
this is actually true or not. And even if it's true, there may be some
kind of "best effort" way to provide at least some degree of
accessibility. I will investigate on this.

I think it's really not a big deal if it takes time. Roughly speaking we
start with "nothing" (no accessible alternative at all) so any single
thing happening would be an improvement over what currently exists.

When you are blind, sometimes it's even difficult to simply
figure out what exactly is not working or what you don't have access to,
because you don't have access to it. I mean, say there is a button to
underline something. If the screen reading system does not present this
button to me, I won't be able, by myself, to tell you that this button
is not accessible, because I don't even know it's here.

That's why, IMO, sometimes the most effective way to progress is to
physically meet and see together what works and what does not. If you
are in Paris and would like to, we could organise such a meeting.

Cheers,

Sébastien.
