Thanks for the links. I have poked a few people on IRC too and there's
now a fair bunch of links in the ticket.

That would be tremendously helpful. The software is already planned to
be able to extract information from the content (the outline at least)
and more may be added but presenting that well to blind users is
something I have troubles designing. That said, such information and
notices can also be an unwanted distraction including to non-blind
users.

I am indeed in Paris and believe meeting would be very helpful.
There's probably a bit of homework I should do first however: there are
for sure several issues that I can already notice and fix.

Best,
