                             CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                                   HOPE 2017

                        The 6th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
                     Higher-Order Programming with Effects

                               September 3, 2017
                             Oxford, United Kingdom
                           (the day before ICFP 2017)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HOPE workshop series are intended to bring together researchers 
interested
in the design, semantics, implementation, and verification of higher-order
effectful programs. They are informal, consisting of invited talks,
contributed talks on work in progress, and open-ended discussion sessions.
They are dedicated to John Reynolds, whose work is an inspiration to us all.

The 6th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Higher-Order Programming with Effects will
take place on Sunday, September 3, 2017, that is, the day before ICFP 2017,
in Oxford, United Kingdom.

# Goals of the Workshop

A recurring theme in many papers at ICFP, and in the research of many ICFP
attendees, is the interaction of higher-order programming with various kinds
of effects: storage effects, I/O, control effects, concurrency, etc. While
effects are of critical importance in many applications, they also make code
harder to build, maintain, and reason about. Higher-order languages (both
functional and object-oriented) provide a variety of abstraction 
mechanisms to
help "tame" or "encapsulate" effects (e.g. monads, ADTs, ownership types,
typestate, first-class events, transactions, Hoare Type Theory, session 
types,
substructural and region-based type systems), and a number of different
semantic models and verification technologies have been developed in 
order to
codify and exploit the benefits of this encapsulation (e.g. bisimulations,
step-indexed Kripke logical relations, higher-order separation logic, game
semantics, various modal logics). But there remain many open problems, 
and the
field is highly active.

The goal of the HOPE workshop is to bring researchers from a variety of
different backgrounds and perspectives together to exchange new and exciting
ideas concerning the design, semantics, implementation, and verification of
higher-order effectful programs.
