Subject: Re: [Caml-list] linking of stublibs with bytecode target

This is wrong. Shared stublibs should always be there. It reminds me of 
the issue I just encountered with ocaml-extunix:

   https://github.com/ygrek/extunix/issues/23

Shared stublibs were built, but not installed by setup.ml.

Maybe it's a bug in oasis, then.
