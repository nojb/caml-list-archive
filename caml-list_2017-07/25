Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Prose v1 - a collaborative text editor

Hello,

I am happy to announce the first release of Prose, a collaborative text
editor started after being both frustrated and horrified by Etherpad
Lite.
Etherpad Lite is heavily used in groups I am involved in or close to:
FFDN, DIY ISPs, Éxégètes Amateurs, Framasoft, ... (all being horrible
leftists and libre-ists). It occurred to me that its bugs,
administration costs and limitations were hampering us.

It realistically aims at replacing Etherpad Lite with something better
on every aspect for both clients and servers: lower CPU, memory and
network usage, more features, fewer bugs and an active development.

The code is hosted on https://gitlab.com/adrien-n/prose and can be
downloaded either through git or through tarballs on
https://gitlab.com/adrien-n/prose/tags .
A demo is available on http://prose.yaxm.org/pads/caml-announce . Any
document name can be used and the website root is an alias for
"default".

Its development has been in line with the vision of the new French
President to make France a « Startup Nation ».
As such, the current release works, has an UI that shouldn't change too
much but also has a few caveats that aren't immediately visible. It is a
« minimum viable product », i.e. « a product with just enough features
to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future
development. » [1]. It is believed the AGPLv3 license will scare
absolutely no angel investor.

I haven't conducted thorough benchmarks because performance is very
clearly in favor of Prose:
- lower network usage for cold and hot browser caches, almost optimal,
- much much lower CPU usage
- > 4 times lower server-side memory
- > 5 times lower page load time

Installation is not documented through an Ansible role which is stored
under ansible/ in the sources. Ansible code is not very fun to write but
reading it shouldn't be an issue and it guarantees the procedure is
always up-to-date.

The project wouldn't exist without Ocsigen and QuillJS.
QuillJS [ https://quilljs.com/ ] is a rich-text editing widget which
features Operational Transform [2] for edition deltas.
Ocsigen [ https://ocsigen.org/ ] is already well-known in the OCaml
world; it does most of the hard work an everything else is based on it.

The code has been quite heavily documented and its entrypoint is
prose.eliom.
One of the project goal has been to make an ocsigen project that could
be used by others to learn. Maybe it has now grown too much for that but
it should still be possible to extract interesting blocks and make a
nice tutorial using it.

Besides general improvements, future version will introduce client-side
storage, session-handling and encryption along with more export formats.
Tests, bug reports and contributions are warmly welcome. Development is
carried on gitlab which handles oauth2 and authentication using accounts
from twitter, facebook, github and bitbucket is possible.
