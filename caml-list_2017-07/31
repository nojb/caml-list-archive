Thanks for your response.

That commit message is indeed quite clear. I got lost in the other=20
ones that were more concerned with .c files.

I wouldn't have said that it worked by fluke. This design seemed=20

OK. Well, I will have to rethink my tool then.

To give a bit more background, the problem concerns the checklistings=20
LaTeX package (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/checklistings) which allows=20
for compiling code snippets extracted from LaTeX documents. For OCaml=20
listings, it is normal to pass the -i option so that the types=20
inferred for a code snippet can be displayed in a document. It is also=20
normal for later code snippets to depend on earlier ones. The -i=20
option, however, does not generate the .cmi file required to compile=20
later snippets. My solution was thus to rely on the previous behaviour=20
of ocamlc.

Would it be reasonable to have a means of both compiling and showing=20
the inferred types? For instance, by passing both -c and -i?

Tim.
