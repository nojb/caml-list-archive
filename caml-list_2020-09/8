Subject: [Caml-list] Compiler Construction (CC) 2021 - Call for Papers

ACM SIGPLAN 2021 International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC =
2021)
Co-located with CGO, HPCA and PPoPP
Sat 27 February - Wed 3 March 2021
https://conf.researchr.org/home/CC-2021

CALL FOR PAPERS

The International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC) is
interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense:
analyzing, transforming or executing input that describes how a system
operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special
case.

=3D IMPORTANT DATES =3D=20
Abstract Submission: November 8, 2020
Full Paper Submission: November 10, 2020
Author Response Period: December 7 - 9, 2020=20
Author Notification: December 22, 2020
Artifact Submission: January 5, 2021
AE Notification: January 20, 2021
Final Papers due: January 22, 2021
Conference: February 27 - March 3, 2021

Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest which
include, but are not limited to:

- Compilation and interpretation techniques, including program
  representation, analysis, and transformation; code generation,
  optimization, and synthesis; the verification thereof
- Run-time techniques, including memory management, virtual machines,
  and dynamic and just-in-time compilation
- Programming tools, including refactoring editors, checkers,
  verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers
- Techniques, ranging from programming languages to
  micro-architectural support, for specific domains such as secure,
  parallel, distributed, embedded or mobile environments
- Design and implementation of novel language constructs, programming
  models, and domain-specific languages

CC is an ACM SIGPLAN conference, and implements guidelines and
procedures recommended by SIGPLAN (https://www.sigplan.org).

Prospective authors should be aware of SIGPLAN=E2=80=99s Copyright
policies. Proceedings will be made available online in the ACM digital
library from one week before to one week after the conference.

ARTIFACT EVALUATION

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit their artifacts
for the Artifact Evaluation (AE). The Artifact Evaluation process
begins after the acceptance notification, and is run by a separate
committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work
described in the papers.

To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to
indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are
interested in submitting an artifact.

Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully
will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves.

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make
these materials publicly available upon publication of the
proceedings, by including them as =E2=80=9Csource materials=E2=80=9D in =
the ACM
Digital Library.
