*Call for Papers for the 26th International Conference on Database Systems
for Advanced Applications (DASFAA 2021)*

April 11 to 14, 2021, Taiwan

*Conference Scope*
The International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications
(DASFAA) is a leading international forum for discussing the latest
research on database systems and advanced applications. DASFAA, a
well-established international conference series that provides a forum for
technical presentations and discussions among database researchers,
developers, and users from academia, business, and industry, showcases
state-of-the-art R&D activities in the general areas of database systems
and their applications.

*Topics*
DASFAA 2021 welcomes high-quality, original, and previously unpublished
submissions in the database theory, technology, and practice. Topics of
interests for the conference include, but not limited to, the following:
- Database theory: Big data management, graph data management, data
management in social networks, data semantics and data integration, spatial
data management, sequence and temporal data processing, temporal and
spatial databases, large-scale knowledge management, RDF and knowledge
graphs, query processing and optimization, text databases, information
integration, multimedia databases, multimedia data processing, cloud data
management, data archive and digital library, data model and query
language, data streams and time-series data, data warehouse and OLAP,
embedded and mobile databases, databases for emerging hardware, parallel
and distributed databases, probabilistic and uncertain data, real-time data
management, Semantic Web and triple data management, Semantic Web and
knowledge management, sensor data management, statistical and scientific
databases, transaction management, XML, RDF and semi-structured data, and
Web data management.
- Technology and Practice: Machine learning for database, graph and social
network analysis, text and data mining, search and recommendation
technology, network embedding, security, privacy and trust, medical data
mining, distributed computing, data mining and knowledge discovery, data
semantics and integrity constraints, data quality and credibility,
recommendation systems, crowdsourcing, bio and health informatics, search
and information retrieval, information recommendation, database usability
and HCI, HCI for modern information systems, index and storage systems,
blockchain, parallel, distributed & P2P systems, Deep Web, Web information
systems, advanced database and Web applications, and information extraction
and summarization.

Paper Submission
Paper submission must be in English. All papers will be double-blind
reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to
DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity. All paper submissions will
be handled electronically. Any submitted paper violating the length, file
type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.
Each submitted paper should include an abstract up to 200 words and be no
longer than 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) in LNCS
(Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format. We encourage authors to cite
related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also
consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable. All papers
must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF
only.
The submitted papers must not be previously published anywhere and must not
be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA
review process. If the paper was accepted, at least one author will
complete the regular registration and attend the conference to present the
paper. For no-show authors, their papers will not be included in the
proceedings. Accepted papers will be published in the conference
proceedings.

*Double-Blind Review*
DASFAA 2021 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, i.e., the PC
members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the
authors. To ensure the anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their
manuscript as follows:
- Author's names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or
elsewhere in the paper.
- Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere
in the paper.
- Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be
acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
- Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the
author's names in the paper's associated metadata. For example, if your
name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file
called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into
the PDF file. Submissions must have all details identifying the author(s)
removed from the original manuscript (including the supplementary files, if
any), and the author(s) should refer to their prior work in the third
person and include all relevant citations.
It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve
anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise
potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate
rejection. Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an
extended version of a short paper that has published elsewhere is strongly
discouraged in DASFAA 2021. Because of the double-blind review process,
non-anonymous papers that have been issued as technical reports (e.g.,
arXiv or similar) cannot be considered for DASFAA 2021.

*Formatting Template*
Please use one of the following templates for the LNCS (Lecture Notes in
Computer Science) format:
