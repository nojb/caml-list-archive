Subject: [Caml-list] ML Family Workshop 2022: Final Call for Presentations

We are happy to invite submissions to the ML Family Workshop 2022, to
be held during the ICFP conference week on Thursday, September 15th.

The ML family workshop warmly welcomes submission touching on the
programming languages traditionally seen as part of the “ML family”
(Standard ML, OCaml, F#, CakeML, SML#, Manticore, MetaOCaml, etc.).
The scope of the workshop includes all aspects of the design,
semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching of the
members of the ML family. We also encourage presentations from related
languages (such as Haskell, Scala, Rust, Nemerle, Links, Koka, F*,
Eff, ATS, etc), to exchange experience of further developing ML ideas.

The workshop does not have proceedings, making it the perfect venue to
run some ideas with the community or present some work in progress
within a friendly environment. The PC has a broad expertise and
submissions are 3 pages long: when in doubt, just submit!

Currently, the workshop is scheduled to be an in-person event. We will
give to the authors of accepted abstracts the opportunity to give
their talks remotely if necessary, in case they could not travel.

See the detailed CFP online on the ICFP website:
