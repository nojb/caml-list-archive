Subject: [Caml-list] ML Family Workshop 2022: DEADLINE EXTENSION

To increase your chances of submitting your work to the ML workshop,
*the submission deadline is extended by a week*.
The new deadline is Friday 10th June (AoE).

A quick reminder:
- The workshop does not have proceedings, making it the perfect venue
   to run some ideas with the community or present some work in
   progress within a friendly environment.
- The work load as an author is low: submissions are only 3 pages long
   (excluding references)
- YOU have the power to make the ML workshop a success!
- You have one more full week to submit to <https://ml2022.hotcrp.com/>
   (please register your submission early!)
- All the details are here:
<https://icfp22.sigplan.org/home/mlfamilyworkshop-2022#Call-for-Presentations>
- The ML workshop is colocated with ICFP 2022 <https://icfp22.sigplan.org/>

Benoît Montagu, chair of the ML workshop 2022
