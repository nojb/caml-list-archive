I have to agree with Jacques:  using a match construct (i.e. `typecase')
rather than a `cast' is cleaner.  It makes it a lot more obvious that the
cast might fail and in the case where you want to deal with several
alternatives, a `typecase' is exactly what you want, whereas using `cast'
would be very awkward (using handlers all over the place).
Of course a `cast' is a little better in the case where you *know* that
it will succeed, but the textual overhead of a `typecase' does not seem
significant.

No it shouldn't.  And type-systems are being developed that catch those uses
(pushing array bounds checking either to compile-time or (when the analysis is
not powerful enough) to the programmer (to insert the checks by hand)).
