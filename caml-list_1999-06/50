I'm not in favour of the extensive use of casts, but this 
sounds like the kind of reasoning that was behind SML's syntax for
references and imperative programming, which makes the imperative features
of SML very hard to use.  The problem is that when you really do need to use
casts in an
application, e.g. in window programming, then you'll probably need to use
them a fair bit,
so an awkward syntax could be quite problematic.
