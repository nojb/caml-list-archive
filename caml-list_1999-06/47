I have the begining of a C header parser that i intent to use to generate the mlgtk
stubs. It is entirely written in caml, and is under the GPL, if you are
interrested, tell me. Up to now, it parses the headers and put them in a big
list. My plan was to generate the bindings with this lists. I have some ideas on
how to do it automatically for most C constructs, other could cause problems. If
you are interrested, i can do a website for it, separate from mlgtk, or also send
it to you.

Friensly,

Sven LUTHER
