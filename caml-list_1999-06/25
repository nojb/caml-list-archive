The next version of the mlgtk library (gtk+ bindings for ocaml) will contain a
gtkDrawing module, that beside providing a Graphics compatibility module,
provides a way of defining GtkDrawingarea widgets with backing pixmap, that you
can act upon in a Graphics like manner (but providing the gtkdrawingarea widget
as parameter.)

It is not yet complete, but already functional for drawing stuff. Mlgtk is
found at :

http://cristal.inria.fr/~cuoq/mlgtk.html

but it don't yet contain this, write to me and i can get you a current snapshot
of it.
