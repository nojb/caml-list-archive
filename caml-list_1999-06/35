  I've implemented a small widgets toolkit (library of window objects
to build graphical interfaces). This toolkit is in a very early stage,
but it is already used to provide menus in Efuns, and a completely
working file selection dialog box.

 As any widget toolkit, the library contains scrollbars, texts with
other embedded widgets, pixmaps, labels, scales, editable labels,
buttons, bars, panels, viewports, menus, and composite widgets, such
as selectors, applications, dialogs and even complete file selection
dialog boxes.  Moreover, a special class WX_Graphics.t can be used to
create windows where you can draw with the same functions as in the
Graphics module.  Several such objects can be used in a single
application, using the #active method to activate the widget in which
you want to draw. A simple exmaple using WX_Graphics is provided with
the library.

 Finally, lots of features have not been implemented yet, or are just
implemented to work in demo examples.

 The widget library is available as a component of the Efuns package,
