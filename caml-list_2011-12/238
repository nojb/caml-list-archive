I fully agree, and as mentioned earlier, I'll help to maintain such a community distribution (or whatever we will call that glibc/eglibc thing for OCaml). Adding to the list above, a community distribution would provide an additional benefit for the users/community: We could release patch sets often and early while regular OCaml releases appear only every year or two. As Goswin already mentioned, big eye-catchers like first class modules are nice, but fixing the bugs (i.e. PR/4863, trivial patch from a core member(!) waiting to be applied for 3 months) is even more important (although probably less interesting from the core hackers point of view).
