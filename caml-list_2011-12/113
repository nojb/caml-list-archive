Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml maintenance status / community fork (again)

Personally I'd even suggest to disconnect OCaml and INRIA, with an independent team of core maintainers (with appropriate spare time and knowledge). INRIA would still contribute to OCaml, but no longer control OCaml.

Honestly, opening up the development of OCaml would be terrific; but 
trying to disconnect it from INRIA sounds like a very bad idea to me.

Concerning the issues with the ARM port, there is no chance to get a 
good support for this architecture (which includes accepting patches) 
without someone in the core team who feels responsible for the port and 
commits to maintaining it.  You might want to create a new "core team" 
completely disconnected from INRIA, but the problem would remain the 
same (I don't believe in a completely decentralized development model 
for something like OCaml).  Instead, I'd suggest contacting the existing 
core team (caml@inria.fr) in order to find a solution.


Best regards,
