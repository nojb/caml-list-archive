I think a good package system (with associated repository) and better
documentation are the two biggest things that can help OCaml's
adoption. It's true that there are languages that have become
successful without a package management system, but it has become
increasingly expected that languages have one. OCaml does not have
marketing or hype, so it has to win over new users by not creating
barriers to adoption. Plus it's much easier to work on a daily basis,
even for veterans. This is already true with GODI, which saves me a
lot of time when the library I need to install is available in its
repo.

The question is: what should be done? What must be done to enable
OASIS-DB? Or should everyone adopt GODI? What's the situation between
these two systems? Maybe having some kind of rough roadmap would help
there.

Regarding documentation, this is a problem in many fronts, beginning
with the book situation. Practical OCaml was a good idea, badly
executed. And Jason Hicks' fine book is probably stuck in limbo
because of legal battles and so it never came out. I recently had a
look at the Go language from Google, and the "A Tour of Go" tutorial
is very good (at http://tour.golang.org/ ). Maybe something similar
for OCaml would be a nice addition, especially given that the OCaml
Tutorial is apparently MIA. But I think having a good package manager
should come first (btw, Go has one).
