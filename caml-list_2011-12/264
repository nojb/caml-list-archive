Hello,


installing packages in R also is quite easy.
In a running R you just type "install.packages("RMySQL")"
get a window to select a server and things then happen
automagically: source download, compilation, installation.
either in a systemwide manner or if permissions of your session
do not allow it, somewhere beyond your local $HOME.
It's even easier than with Perl / CPAN.

(And using not the official CRAN packages is easy: just
change the setting of the used repository and you could
install the newest/freshest stuff easily too.)


Or when installing at the OS level not officially supported packages
on Arch linux (for official ones you could just use
the installer pacman), then makepgg will help you.
For installation as well as creating packages by your own.

[...]

And why to use GODI and create OCaml/GODI packages and not
a *.deb or *.rpm or PKGBUILD/tgz?

Or does GODI also allows creation of such OS-related packages?
