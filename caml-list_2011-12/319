Simple answer: There is a bootstrap problem: The existing Ocaml users
are almost Unix-only. They do not care about Windows. In order to
establish "Windows-typical problem solving" you need definitely more
Windows users, but they will only come if you have a Windows-typical way
of distribution.

My thinking is that you can break this circle only if you go forward and
try to make as many Unix-style solutions available under Windows as
possible. Once there is a Windows community you can address it
differently, but for the time being I don't see a good alternative.

By the way, your plan includes Unix emulation, too, under point 3. It's
only more hidden.
