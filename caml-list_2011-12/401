Subject: Re: [Caml-list] try ocaml website

Hi,

The website is really nice :) I'm a bit too used to ledit and find the
lack of ^w, ^u, ^k a bit annoying, but the experience is really smooth,
that's good!

The only "real" thing that it's missing is a way to reset the toplevel
without reloading the page. It's the same problem as with the real
toplevel now that I think about it, but I didn't think of reloading the
page directly!

Great work anyway :)
