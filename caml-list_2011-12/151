I thought OCaml was a free software...

Seriously, i don't understand why a fork would be a bad thing. There are
lots of parts for which one don't need to be superman to contribute. And
right now there are lots of trivial patches on the tracker that remain
without response after several years, so there is clearly a need for
improvement.

Also the development of OCaml seems a bit opaque, we don't know where
the discutions of the core team happen. Maybe it is on caml@inria.fr but
it is not public. I think people are interested (i am) about technical
discutions on the compiler.

Cheers,
