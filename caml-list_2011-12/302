Interesting collection, but it misses a shell.

Also, I'm unsure about several details. In particular, how the
command-line arguments are passed down to the started process. The win32
idea of command-line is a big mess, and you will continuously run into
problems if you just keep it. Cygwin works around by providing an
alternate path for passing the command-line down to the started process.
I fear we also would need such a mechanism. (The GnuWin32 docs do not
explain completely what they do, but it reads as if they just keep the
win32 conventions.)

Because of this, I'm still favoring a clean reimplementation, at least
of sh, make, and the frequently used file utilities. GnuWin32 might be
an interesting fallback source for complicated commands where we can
live with limitations (e.g. awk, which also sometimes appears in build
scripts, but would be a tremendous amount of work to reproduce).
