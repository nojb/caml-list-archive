This is indeed annoying.
Unfortunately, and quite surprisingly to me, using -o /dev/stdout does
not help.

I've seen a comment in a record initialization (to comment on
a given field) moved far away, after the end of the record.
Here is an exemple :

---
type record = { a : int; b : int; c : int }
let r1 = {
	a = 0 ;
	b = 1 ; (* This is about b *)
	c = 2 }
---

where the comment disapear. While in this one :

---
type record = { a : int ; b : int ; c : int }
let r1 = {
        a = 0 ;
        b = 1 ; (* This is about b *)
        c = 2 } and
    r2 = { a = 0 ; b = 1 ; c = 2 }
---

the comment is moved after initialization of r1. :-(
