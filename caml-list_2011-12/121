It's nice to see this thread coming back to the original issue after having
been hijacked. You can notice that contributers to this thread have
opinions but not many facts and arguments to support them.
Contacting the OCaml maintainers privately is definitely not the way to let
the development process happen in the open, but bad habits are hard to get
rid of.
I think we all understand that the core team is in an uncomfortable and
conflicting situation and that the questions asked in this thread won't get
an answer. In french this is called "avoir le cul entre deux chaises".
Benedikt did not suggest at any point to set OCaml free from the original
developers, he suggested to set it free from the INRIA.
