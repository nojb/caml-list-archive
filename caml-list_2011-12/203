Why should that be a low-level language ? Why not core-ML ?

What I see as the very first issue is the spread of the efforts between
similar yet incompatible ML dialects leading to 4 weak communities (SML,
OCaml, F#, Haskell) instead of a really strong one and all the related
problems that come with it (fewer books, risk for industrials, work
duplication, inefficient funding, lack of visibility, etc).

Example : there is an excellent whole source code optimiser ... for SML.
And an award winning SMT solver ... in Caml developed in a company that
invests heavily in information-centric web applications ... in F# (
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/ if you don't
know Nikolaj Bjorner's Z3). Now say you want to do an application that
delivers optimal electricity production plans. What language do you choose ?

Just being able to reuse the source-code between string ML dialects even
after recompilation (X -> CoreML -> specific platform) would be an
improvement.
