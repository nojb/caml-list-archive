There must have been a misunderstanding: I have the full LaTeX
sources, of course.  What may have been lost is Pierre's first cut at
an OCaml version of the book.

Alan Schmitt adds:

No, no, the online edition is identical to the 2nd edition, which has
one additional chapter.  It's just that pages are wider and taller
than those of the 1st edition, resulting in fewer pages overall.

I stand very firmly by the NC license.  If anyone wants to make money
out of this book or a derived work, the original authors and all the
future contributors should get their share, Debian orthodoxy
notwithstanding.
