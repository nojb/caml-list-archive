The port is not in a clean state yet. It's still a bit messy, and I'm going to separate various things first (i.e. select FPU / CPU independent of platform ABI, for example use VFPv3 with softfp EABI, etc. or use Thumb-2 on armel, etc.). I hope to get some more time to work on it during the week. You can follow the work at:

http://github.com/bmeurer/ocaml-arm

Testing and feedback is always welcome, of course.

Concerning your proposal to split the patch into multiple smaller patches:

(a) This would probably result in roughly two patches, the first one to fix the existing armel port, and the second one to add support for FPUs, armhf EABI, Thumb, Thumb-2, etc. (these depend on each other in various ways).
(b) It would be a lot of work for almost no benefit, because it is an almost completely new backend and not simply a set of bug fixes for the existing ARM backend, and must be treated this way. And even if I'd spend my days splitting up the patch, there's still that unresolved OCaml contributions issue (i.e. high probability of wasting my time because that patch set will just idle in Mantis).
