The feature we want is exactly Jeremie's "hack" (his words). We need
this feature for debugging and displaying data in log files. This kind
of data is almost never polymorphic, so there is no practical issue
here. Also we don't need a standardized output format. However we would
often like to truncate the data to a reasonable size.

I understand that this feature could be replaced in the future by a more
complete solution, but we would be happy if it were provided as an
"experimental extension" of OCaml.
