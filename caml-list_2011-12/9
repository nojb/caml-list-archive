 High-Level Parallel Programming

=========================================================
9th International Workshop on Practical Aspects of High-Level Parallel Programming (PAPP 2012)
=========================================================

affiliated to The International Conference on Computational Science

June 4-6, 2012, Omaha, USA

*Aims and scope*

Computational Science applications are more and more complex to develop and require more and more computing power. Sequential computing cannot go further. Major companies in the computing industry now recognise the urgency of re-orienting an entire
industry towards massively parallel computing.

Parallel and grid computing are solutions to the increasing need for computing power. The trend is towards the increase of cores in processors, the number of processors and the need for scalable computing everywhere. But parallel and distributed
programming is still dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing. Thus high-level approaches should play a key role in the shift to scalable computing in every computer.

Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages such as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming, parallel execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries, genericity and meta-programming in object-oriented
languages, etc. have produced methods and tools that improve the price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of target applications. Also, high level languages offer a high degree of abstraction which ease the development of
complex systems. Moreover, being based on formal semantics, it is possible to certify the correctness of critical parts of the applications.

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel programming: design, implementation and optimisation of high-level programming languages, semantics of parallel languages, formal verification, design or certification of libraries,
middle-wares and tools (performance predictors working on high-level parallel/grid source code, visualisations of abstract behaviour, automatic hot-spot detectors, high-level GRID resource managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.), application of
proof assistants to parallel applications, applications in all fields of computational science, benchmarks and experiments. Research on high-level grid programming is particularly relevant as well as domain specific parallel software.

The aim of all these languages and tools is to improve and ease the development of applications (safety, expressivity, efficiency, etc.). Thus the PAPP workshop focuses on applications.

The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing and computational science researchers who are potential users of these languages and tools.

*Topics*

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on topics including:

     applications in all fields of high-performance computing and visualisation (using high-level tools)
     high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for parallel and grid computing
     high-level parallel language design, implementation and optimisation
     practical aspects of computer assisted verification for high-level parallel languages
     modular, object-oriented, functional, logic, constraint programming for parallel, distributed and grid computing systems
     algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries
     generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries
     benchmarks and experiments using such languages and tools

*Paper submission and publication*

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be
reviewed by at least three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the Procedia Computer Science series, as part of the ICCS proceedings.

Submission must be done through the ICCS website

We invite you to submit a full paper of at most 10 pages describing new and original results, no later than January 9, 2012 (firm). Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop.

*Important Dates*

     January 9, 2012: Full paper due (firm)
     February 9, 2012: Notification
     March 1, 2012: Camera-ready paper due
