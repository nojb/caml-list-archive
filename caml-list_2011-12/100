> The French book "Le langage Caml" is very great, althought it is quite old,

I'd also like to advertise the book "Programmation Fonctionnelle, Générique et
Objet" by Philippe Narbel that I found very good and which is probably more
up to date.
Such a book translated into english would be very valuable IMHO.

(Note: since it's not the first time I raise attention for this book it's perhaps
worth saying that I have no link whatsoever with the author nor publisher)
