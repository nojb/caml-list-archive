My opinion is that oasis-db+odb is good enough for wider use.  I don't 
know what plans Sylvain has for the oasis-db server side, but what's 
currently provided is good enough to make many people's lives easier.

Any current work in packaging things for oasis-db will almost certainly 
be not lost by future updates.  Worst case, if the database side of the 
server gets re-designed, all it has to do is re-import the tarballs and 
everything will be fine.  AFAIK, only Sylvain can change the warning. 
As well, he's the one that knows the server side of things.  I have 
experience dealing with some of its ... subtleties, but no ability to 
fix.  For the client end (downloading, installation) - that's entirely 
me, and I'm happy to work with people on IRC (which I find myself doing 
often with beginners) or over email.

Probably more useful would be for people to try packaging the libraries 
that they use for themselves.  I've not made grand announcements so that 
its users can grow slowly, without huge expectations.

I've just started this wiki page: 
https://github.com/thelema/odb/wiki/SoftwareToPackage listing the status 
of many pieces of software under oasis-db.  Extend.

I was trying to share it with a small group to work out the bugs, and 
then share with more and more, kind of incremental adoption.  We'll see 
if Sylvain's server can handle whatever load comes from this announcement.
