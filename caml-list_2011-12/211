I will try to use it for some time.
But your description of it does not match my dreams.
Ideally, I would `odb install this-package --version=X.Y.Z`,
and `odb install another-one --branch=master`, and odb would
upgrade and/or rebuild what's required.
Very similar to the gentoo package system from what I know.

Thank you anyway for not being selfish with your time.
