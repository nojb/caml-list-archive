Coq has been adapted to work with both camlp4 and camlp5. In my
experience, Daniel has been much more responsive on camlp5 matters than
the OCaml team on camlp4 matters. And Xavier's mail suggests that camlp4
is a maintenance burden for the OCaml team.

Why is it such a bad idea to drop camlp4 out of the distribution, and
just let camlp5 live? My feeling is that people using camlp5 care about
it, but people using camlp4 do so just because it's in the official
distribution and wouldn't care switching to camlp5 (or stop using this
kind of syntax extension) if camlp4 was officially deprecated in favor
of camlp5. At worst, someone will start maintaining camlp4 independently.

Daniel already maintains and develops camlp5. I guess Jérémie would also
volunteer to join him (but he already offered to maintain camlp4
independently). In Debian, there are currently 49 packages depending on
camlp4, and 7 depending on camlp5. That also increases incentive /
possible help for maintaining it.
