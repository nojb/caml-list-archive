Sure I could, but I do not have extra hardware resources. Also setting up ocaml
on windows is a daunting and frustrating exercise, especially so because some 
other libs are needed too (pcre, camomile, etc).

Concerning the mail notifications - there are no errors in the logs - maybe the
mails land in gmail's spam folder? And btw if anybody wants to add some project to
build (without (many) dependencies) and/or receive notifications - please tell.
