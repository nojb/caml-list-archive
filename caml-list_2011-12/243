No, distributions won't start shipping the community distribution just
because it exists. I cannot speak for Fedora (and others), but
Debian/Ubuntu won't switch to the community distribution that easily. In
fact, it may appear as a seperate source package at some point but won't
replace INRIA's ocaml in Debian.

If you look at Debian's ocaml package, you'll notice that very few
custom patches are applied.

	http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/ocaml/3.12.1-2

Patches from 1 to 6 are just (let's say) build configurations to cope
with Debian's standards. All the rest has been submitted to upstream,
except patch 11. Some of the submitted patches were even applied in
trunk. I guess the rest will be integrated as well… Most of the patches
(from 7 to 15) are there to avoid build failures on some architectures.

The problem with the community distribution is that:
1) it doesn't exist yet. So, we cannot commit on something more than vague.
2) we don't even know its release schedule, etc…
3) we don't know the kind of changes that will be integrated to the
community distribution
4) as of today, we don't even know if it is a good idea ; if it will be
a success ; etc…

(a) seems very reasonable but (b) is unclear to me. You don't need to
create a community distribution of ocaml to experiment new features
sitting in ocaml's svn. Just checkout the relevant branch, and start
playing. The idea of the community distribution is to have an ocaml with
some patches on top of it (patches for bugs those sitting in mantis for
long time, a few features/experiments that are not present in ocaml's
svn). The idea is also to not diverge too much to keep things compatible.

my 2cents,
