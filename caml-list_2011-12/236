As far as I know, Coq uses:

  [1,2,3] not at all
  [4] a bit (e.g. tactics/tauto.ml4)
  [5] a lot (e.g. most of *.ml4 files)
  [6] for macros and conditional compilation indeed

I've heard of some attempts to port Coq to dypgen, but since no public
announcement was made, I guess this is quite difficult...

Are there other such libraries? It's not really Coq's business to create
a new one...
