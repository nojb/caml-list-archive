I'm willing to spend time and knowledge, and I hope others are also willing to do so, that's what my mail is about to some degree.

As mentioned there are various forks, we also have several forks of our own. I'm not proposing to add just another fork with 1-2 contributors, but I'm proposing to join forces on a single OCaml community project with a clear goal (the other forks can continue to exist and work on their respective goals with merging into ocaml-ng from time to time, i.e. when a milestone is reached).
