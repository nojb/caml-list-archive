I also agree that a binary package is much less satisfactory anywhere 
with a compilation environment.

I'd love to get a report on how well odb can be used on mac.  Its second 
test of usefulness was being able to install oasis, which has a *ton* of 
deps.  It passed this test a long time ago, and should install oasis 
just fine.

If you have ocaml and findlib installed, odb should work for you.  Of 
course, let me know via its bugtracker or #ocaml on IRC if you have any 
problems.
