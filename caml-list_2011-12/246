That is probably what they said about eglibc too in the beginning. Now
eglibc is used in Debian/Ubuntu and is (or because it is) a great

Obviously nobody is going to say: Yes, lets start this project, we will
ship it right away. It first has to proof itself. And first adopters
will be those that have the most problems with the standard ocaml.
