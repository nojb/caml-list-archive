As the only place where this 0 value exists is in the constructor and
it can easily be shown that the function never returns a semi-initialized
t, then this looks quite unprobable here. But I welcome the warning
nonetheless :-)

Yes, this was my initial intention as well.
Unfortunately, my actual types are much more complex than what's shown
in the example; especially a value of type t2 is quite hairy to construct
and there are lots of operations having lots of complex output types
(records of records of functions of records...) That's why I had this
TODO note in the margin commanding to "build a dummy t to get rid of the
option type" for so long, until I had this terrible idea of using
Obj.magic.
