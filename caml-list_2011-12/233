You are suggesting a dynamic parser tool. This is already available as
the dypgen tool:
  http://dypgen.free.fr/

I suspect adapting Coq to such a tool would require considerable work,
because the devil is in the details and they really need backward
compatibility. I'm already impressed they managed to support both
camlp4 and camlp5.
