Subject: [Caml-list] Questions about OCaml and google native client

I have just been reading about google native client, and it seems like it may
be a fun platform for which to write something.  OCaml looks like the best
language on there so far.  Questions about it:

1.  How alive is the project of supporting OCaml on google NACL?  The version
of OCaml supported there is 3.11 from what  I could find, several months behind
current release.  Anyone know if and when this will get brought up to date?

2.  Are there any particularly good OCaml programs now available that run in
google NACL?  Any nice ones available from the google app store?

3. Any other thoughts about the viability of this combination?

TIA very much,


Al
