Sure but is there any effort not based on free will limitation which would works ?
Marketing, an attractive website, an packaging/oasis-db like thing, good introductory tutorials (I've appreciated
the chapter1 of jon harrop, btw), a distro maybe based on batteries or ... argh.

Each piece of software, libraries, exist becaus of a reserch project, someone choosing ocaml as
the tool of choice, or spare-time and leisure. This diversity is the consequence of free will.
sometimes it's waste of resources, but try to join each resources by email and convince
them to unify their efforts. Or give them compensation for it.

Joining together jane-street core and batteries, you can already forget about it, so joining
ML/Haskell/OCaml/F# efforts together...

And people getting away from for example c-- or llvm based lower level stuff, there's always an explanation
of lower "energy" like barrier to get a thing done, writing your own stuff rather than diving and get drown in a monster, etc...

that's open source devel.
