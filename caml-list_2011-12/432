Subject: Re: Re: [Caml-list] Need help for a practical hacking book about ocaml

Hi,

I'd like to see both of your texts, and probably other similar texts, on
something like github, but maybe it would make more sense to keep them
separate.

First, because each of them has a different perspective on ocaml. You could
still exchange stuff between them as you see fit.

Another reason is maintainability. If an adequate amount of expositional text
is added to bob's, it might grow rather large.

This is interesting.
Keep it going.

daniel
