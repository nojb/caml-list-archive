Jonathan Protzenko has started to write down some guidelines how to 
contribute most effectively to OCaml. These ideas are being discussed, 
and should be published soon.

For a big project like the one you mention (a complete rewrite of 
OCaml's build system), it is always a good idea to contact the 
development team first with a detailed proposal and wait for some 
feedback before doing the heavy work.  Contacting the development team 
can be done either via the bug tracker or by email (caml@inria.fr)
