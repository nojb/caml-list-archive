I have no problem with that.

That's the part where I doubt it will happen. How do you find such
people? The job description does not sound very attractive, and
honestly, if I don't have any (or only limited) interest on my own in
this, I'd do this type of work only for money (because it's frustrating,
and Windows users are not really known to be grateful for getting
something for free).

Hence, my idea of reusing as much Unix scripting as possible. It's
finally easier.

Btw, a lot of infrastructure already exists: GODI for mingw, only that
it is broken now, and would need a few days of fixing everything.
Because GODI includes a binary package concept, you could easily extract
the built libraries, and distribute them in a zip-style format.
Currently you need the mingw toolchain for using the compilers, but as
you pointed out, this could be improved.

You may ask why GODI is broken for mingw. Well, see above. The job is
unattractive, too time-consuming, and I lost all interest in it. It's
better done by somebody who needs that for his/her own work.
