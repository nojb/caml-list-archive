You happy guy...
...so i think you do your own software and sell it.
if freelancing for other companies, then most often (nearly always)
they decide the language to use.

The wrong thing?
Google is not using Ocaml for anything.
So it must be avoided ;-)

Because of Frank Zappa: One Size Fits All

Easy (easier) installation and linking would maybe help a lot
that people don't wait for the big bloaty lib.

Some people are good admins, others are good programmers,
and only few people do like both....

But... hmhhh... there are a lot of tools now that can be used
to compaile/link or install Ocaml and related libraries.


This does mean:
  1) the tools provcded with OCaml maybe are not as good as most people want them
  2) there are already a lot of people contributing and providing tools for that problem


1) could be a point of criticism,
2) shows that the "missing effort in the community" is not true

If community effort would solve all problems, then 2) would
kill 1)

It seems not to be the case.

So 2) can't solve 1).

It either needs better installation tools in the official distribution,
or adapting one of those external tools, or at least recommending one of them
as "recommended by the core team".


Other options might also be possible.

Ideas someone?

Even GitHub needs some more colors... ;-)

Ah, it needs a tool, named "camlscatter", which not only pushes the OCaml
projects to many servers, but of course also is written in OCaml (just be be
consequent).
(Should it be part of the official distribution?)

FULL ACK!

Bloat is contrary to modularity.

Pick what you need, and build what you want.


(The customers might have different wishes, looking for monoliths (?!), but
 isn't this a programmers discussion?)

ACK.

But because the language is rapidly evolving (*) - despite any other
comments on that - I think it's hard to have a book that is
up to date.

But O'Reilly would not have a problem to make new editions from time to time...
...if there are people who would write the book and update it soon.


>

A book could be also done as a collaberative approach.

But documentation is all to often contrary to programming,
at least in "the masses", and "the masses" is what is looked for,
when it is asked for "community efforts".



Ciao,
   Oliver

(*): Maybe people look for bloaty libraries, and call that "progress" of a "language".

     But the issue on first class modules for example...
     ...can this be ignored, when people talk about progress of a LANGUAGE?

     How many libraries (or how much OOP) would be needed as a workaround for this?

     That even in times of urging Ocaml programmers the core team decided to implement this
     feature (and planned others too) is a huge plus, that shows me, that in the Ocaml core
     team, thinking and elegance has priotrity over hype issues and bloat.
