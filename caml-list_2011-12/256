                           COORDINATION
 14th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

As ICT technologies and software-intensive systems are increasingly 
embedded  into the fabric of everyday life, effective coordination 
techniques are needed to enhance our ability to develop software that 
is responsive to emerging societal demands and changing application 
needs, exploits effectively recent advances in computing and 
communication technology, and is capable of adaptive behaviour in the 
short and in the long term. COORDINATION is the premier forum for 
exposing innovating research results and relevant experience reports 
on software technologies for collaboration and coordination in 
concurrent, distributed, and socio-technical systems. Its distinctive 
feature is the emphasis on high-level abstractions that capture 
interaction patterns manifest at all levels of the software architecture 
and extending into the realm of the end-user and social domain.


Coordination 2012 seeks high-quality contributions on the usage, study, 
design and implementation of languages, models and techniques for 
coordination in distributed, concurrent, pervasive, and multicore 
software systems. The focus is on languages, formalisms, models, 
middleware, patterns, and algorithms that conceptually support a proper 
engineering of the interaction dimension. Research paper should 
demonstrate an ability to increase modularity, adaptivity, simplify 
reasoning, and ultimately enhance the software development process and 
its integration into a socio-techical context. Both practical and 
foundational perspectives are of interest.Given the increasing importance 
of coordination models and technologies in almost every domain of our 
existence, the organizers of Coordination 2012 are keen to provide a 
forum for studies that address practical concerns and industrial grade 
solutions, e.g., the introduction of concurrency and distribution 
concepts to novel domains, comparative evaluations of programming models 
on important problems, and the adoption of domain-specific languages. 
Experience reports are thus welcome that describe lessons learned from 
the application of proposed models and techniques to problems in the real 
world.In addition, the conference this year will welcome short "Visions 
in Progress" papers that tries to look far ahead into the future of ICT 
and society to expose innovative - though preliminary - ideas on highly 
innovative models, technologies, or applications, related to coordination 
models/languages/technologies.

* Submissions*

All Research and Experience Papers must report on original unpublished 
work and cannot be under review for publication elsewhere. Innovation, 
scientific and technical soundness, and the capability to prove the 
advantages of the proposed techniques, other than their potential for 
applicability, will be the key criteria for evaluating submissions. 
Maximum length: 15 pages.

Visions in Progress papers can report on work that has already been 
presented elsewhere, but the paper in itself must be a new synthesis and 
must clearly outline the motivation for the vision and the path that can 
eventually lead to its realization. Solid motivations, radical innovation, 
capability to look far beyond the state of the art, and feasibility of 
the proposed vision, will be the key criteria for evaluating submissions. 
Maximum length: 5 pages.

All contributions should be submitted electronically as postscript or PDF, 
using the Springer LNCS style, via EasyChair. Submissions exceeding the 
state length will be rejected without reviewing.

Each paper will undergo a thorough evaluation and the conference 
proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. 
Proceedings will be made available at the conference. Submission is a 
firm commitment that at least one of the authors will attend the conference, 
if the paper is accepted.

DisCoTec 2012 invites proposals for one day workshops to be part of the 
joint event. DisCoTec 2012 hosts conferences in the area of coordination 
languages, distributed systems and formal methods for distributed 
systems, ranging from practice to theory. We invite workshops in these 
areas to provide a forum for presentations of preliminary research 
results and ongoing work as well as presentations of research work 
to a focused audience. DisCoTec workshops provide a vivid and open 
forum for discussions.

One day workshops will be held in conjunction with the main events. 
Prospective workshop organizers are requested to follow the guidelines 
below and are encouraged to contact the workshop chair if any questions arise.

* Important Dates *

January 13, 2012              Workshop proposal deadline

      from any members of the community, but by-invitation-only workshops 
      will also be considered. Please explicitly state your preference.
    * The publicity strategy that will be used by the workshop organizers 
      to promote the workshop.
    * The participant solicitation and selection process.
    * Publication plan. Each workshop is responsible for managing its own 
      publication (e.g., pre- or post- proceedings), if any is desired.
    * Approximate budget proposal (see section Budget below for details).
    * A preliminary version of the call for papers. This CFP must include 
      important dates including submission, notification, and camera-ready 
      deadlines.

are responsible for the following items:

   1. A workshop description (200 words) for inclusion on the DisCoTec site.
   2. Hosting and maintaining of web pages either on the DisCoTec website or 
      linked from the DisCoTec site..
   3. Workshop proceedings, if any. If there is enough interest, the 
      organizer of DisCoTec 2012 may contact the editor-in-chief of the 
      Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science 
      (http://info.eptcs.org/) for having a common volume dedicated to the 
      workshops of DisCoTec 2012.
   4. Publicising the event. 
   
* Budget *

DisCoTec will provide registration and organizational support for the 
workshops. Registration fees must be paid for all participants, 
including organizers and invited guests.

To cover lunches, coffee breaks and basic organizational expenses, 
all workshops will be required to charge a minimum participation fee 
(the precise amount is still to be determined). Each workshop may increase 
this fee to cover additional expenses such as publication charges, student 
scholarships, costs for invited speakers, etc. All fees will be collected 
by the DisCoTec organizers as part of the registration, then additional 
funds will be redistributed to the individual workshop organizers.
