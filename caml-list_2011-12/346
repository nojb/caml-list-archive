I may also add support to emit small functions using Thumb-1 (for pre-ARMv7 / armel) in the future to reduce code size.

Some notes about performance of the new backend: It is up to 4x faster (Cortex-A8 / armhf) and code size is reduced by up to 28% compared to the 3.12.1 backend (Cortex-A8 / armel). See [1] for details.

While we are at it: Can we have this patch applied to the Debian OCaml package? This would (a) get OCaml running native on armhf and (b) get some testing / feedback for the patch.

HTH,
Benedikt
