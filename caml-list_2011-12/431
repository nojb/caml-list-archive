This is great, although I'd like you to make the tex sources available
on something like github or gitorious so that it's easier to contribute
things to (but you keep control of the overall organisation so that it
stays organized and searchable as a book instead of as a wiki as
suggested).

I started a small book on OCaml myself some time ago, when I was teaching me
the language, focused on how to switch from C to OCaml (how to use modules, how
to live with a GC, how the runtime works internally, and how to mix OCaml and
C). I could translate it from French ascii to English tex and add the required
diagrams, and contribute it if you are interested?
