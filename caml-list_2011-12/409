Subject: Re: [Caml-list] try ocaml website

I happened to have a windows virtual machine started and tried in IE 8
(8.0.7600.16385). I can't type in it and it seems to work fine at
first I get this behaviour:
  # let x = 42;;
  # x;;
  Characters 0-1:
  Error: Unbound value x

Also, something statements don't produce anything on screen except a
new prompt: "42;;" and "print_endline \"pouet\";;" don't print
anything. It looks like nothing gets evaluated.

I wouldn't consider IE8 as a high-priority however since I've actually
been having troubles finding people who were using IE on their own
free will nowadays.

Regards,
Adrien Nader
