Subject: Re: [Caml-list] bytecode: ./prog vs ocamlrun ./prog

Hello.

> Do "head -1 prog" to see the right ocamlrun.

  Thank you, this really helped, but in the other way.
I've found that this executable has ELF format.
So, this is a -custom linked bytecode executable.
  But I can't find anywhere in the documentation
any information about whether can I / should I run
such executables using ocamlrun or I can't / I shouldn't.
  If the answer is "I can't / I shouldn't", then the problem
is solved (and maybe I should report a
documentation-related issue to mantis?).
