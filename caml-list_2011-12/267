Someone recently posted a story about trying to install OCaml under Windows.
It echoed my own experiences.

Over the past few years we've gone from depending entirely upon Linux and
OCaml to not using it at all. When my Linux box blew up I thought we were in
real trouble but it was actually much easier to get everything we need up
and running under Windows using F# than it had been using OCaml.

The only project I miss from my OCaml days is HLVM. I can still hack on it
when I travel but I need my netbook running Windows so I want it running
under Windows. Due to the difficulty of getting OCaml working under Windows,
I'll probably just port HLVM to F#...

Cheers,
Jon.
