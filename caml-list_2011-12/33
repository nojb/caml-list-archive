I concur. That said, Gitorious being Free Software, it is also possible
to set it up on alternative locations. I'm still an admin of OCamlForge,
although a *very* dormant one. But if there are enthusiastic volunteers
to work on the idea, I'll be happy to support them in an attempt to
install a Gitorious instance as part of the OCamlForge.

It that will prove to be feasible, we can ask FusionForge upstream to
add support for self-hosted Gitorious instances, as the current
FusionForge for Git is hardly useful at all (no support for multiple Git
repositories, no support for pull request, etc.). I believe this could
benefit the OCamlForge, as well as a very valuable addition to
FusionForge in general. (We can even dare asking the Caml Consortium to
sponsor the last part of the plan, but first we need to show the plan is
feasible ant that it has potential.)

Cheers.
