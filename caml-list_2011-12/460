Subject: [Caml-list] working %.pp.ml target with ocamfind/ocamlbuild

There's a very useful %.pp.ml target in OCamlbuild that runs the source through camlp4 and outputs the result.  This doesn't work when ocamlfind is used, as it includes the -pp flags within the ocamlfind invocation.

I took a look at adding support for this into ocamlbuild (when -use-ocamlfind is specified), but I couldn't spot any way to get ocamlfind to output the syntax options.

I just wanted to check that this is all in fact true, since it requires patching ocamlbuild, findlib, and oasis to make it work. Does everyone else manually run the camlp4o command when using syntax extensions like type-conv or pa_lwt?
