Not very alive, by the looks of it.  However ...

... the patch to ocamlopt is really small.  Possibly even a candidate
for going upstream.  So updating it to the latest OCaml 3.12 ought to
be very simple.

The current patch only implements the changes for i386.  For OCaml in
particular since 64 bit is so useful, it'd be nice to have an
equivalent patch for the x86-64 backend.  That's also probably not
hard, although the sandboxing techniques for i386 and x86-64 used by
NaCL are reportedly quite different.

No idea ...

NaCL is a fantastic concept actually.  It's a bit of a shame that
other browser vendors seem to be steering clear, although there does
seem to be a plugin.

So having an OCaml backend (and other functional languages) is a
thoroughly good thing IMHO.  It could finally offer a clean break from
Javascript / targeting Javascript, while allowing web programs to run
at full speed and be written in reasonable languages.

A possible downside is current lack of portability to non-x86 &
non-ARM platforms.  (NaCL supports i386, x86-64 and ARM only).

Here's an introduction to how NaCL works:
