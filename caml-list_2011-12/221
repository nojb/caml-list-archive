There's another use of camlp4 besides syntax extensions: better
syntax errors, and the alternate syntax.

While learning OCaml I've used camlp4o quite a few times to figure
out what is wrong with the code, as ocamlc just gives you a location and "Syntax error",

In fact learning the alternate syntax, and using camlp4r was easier for me,
because the syntax errors were closer to the actual place of the error.
With the original syntax the errors are often reported late, for example a typo of ";" instead
of ";;" can cause syntax errors to be reported in what you'd consider to be another function.
Eventually I learned how the original syntax works, but I still find camlp4o to be a time saver
 sometimes.

If camlp4 is dropped from the core distribution can these improved syntax error messages
be merged into the core parser? Also what will happen with the alternate syntax?

Best regards,
