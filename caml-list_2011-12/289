Well, that's precisely the point: the natural way to use gcc 3 under 
Cygwin is through symlinks in order to have /usr/bin/gcc links to 
gcc-3.exe. But then ocamlopt and flexlink cannot see it.  A solution 
would have been to have them look directly for gcc-3.exe (and to fix the 
change of path for /lib/mingw), but we decided to use this opportunity 
to switch to gcc 4.

Even if Windows supports kinds of symlink internally, this is a rarely 
used/exposed features. I think it's a bad idea to rely on them for a 
packaging system (targeted to "native" Windows users). They would look 
"foreign" to users, and we should expect a lot of bad support from 
existing tools.
