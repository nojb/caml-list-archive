( For those interested, the book is available online at
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/books/llc.pdf )

I have contacted Xavier Leroy and Pierre Weis a few years ago to get
the TeX sources of the book. I didn't intend to translate from French
to English, but only, for a start, from Caml Light to Objective Caml.
Neither of them could find the sources (they must be about twenty
years old and buried in a 300Mio hidden hard disk somewhere), so I
didn't proceed further.

Remark: there have been at least two successful collaborative
translation efforts in the past:
  http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/
  http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/

I would be ready to participate in such an effort again.
That said, I think the Oreilly book, and Jason Hickey's book draft,
are already good documents (I think "Le langage Caml" would be
significantly better suited to the specific audience of mathematics
undergraduate learning OCaml as their first language, but that's quite
a narrow target).
  http://files.metaprl.org/doc/ocaml-book.pdf

In the context of engineers-friendly OCaml learning document that
could possibly warrant translation, there is also Maxence Guesdon's
"Introduction au langage OCaml". I see it as a well-presented subset
of the Oreilly book, for people that do not need a complete reference
but only a reasonable first taste of the language.
