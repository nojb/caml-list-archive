Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Camlp4/p5 type reflection [was: OCaml maintenance
 status / community fork (again)]

Many people are still frustrated with the camlp4/p5 situation. IMHO, we
should give up on camlp4 inside the distribution, and only implement a
few of its features in the regular parser:

- Antiquotation syntax (i.e. << >> expressions) because this makes it
  very easy to incorporate foreign syntax elements. Of course, we
  would also need the ability to recursively invoke the ocaml parser
  for parts of the antiquoted expression (this would also open the
  door for transformations of the AST).

- A simple macro language (ifdef at least), for the cases antiquotations
  would be too complex.

That means we would give up on arbitrary syntax extensions in the core
distribution. There could be still camlp4 or p5 as a separate add-on,
but it will be a second-class citizen, and it would be clear that it is
a bit behind with the newest syntactical features. Also, it could be
developed outside the core team.
