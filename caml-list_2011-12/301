True. I tend to see the whole toolchain as a single element that you don't
split but it should be possible to only provide binutils.

OK, thanks. As I've stated, I'm really interested in this ability. I see
them as complementary with ocamlnat making it possible to quickly do
one-time scripts and experimentations while .cmxs files would be used for
persistant plugins. I can't start using them right now but I think that I'll
try them in a few months.
