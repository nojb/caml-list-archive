Yes, it's a third party server. What's the problem?

My thinking here is different: We should lower the barriers for packages
as far as possible. We are not in the position of CPAN who can reject
packages not conforming to a relatively high standard.

docs.camlcity.org does the best in this situation: If there is a manual,
you can look at this. But if not, there is at least a pretty-printed
interface, and you can search these interfaces.
