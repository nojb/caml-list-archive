It looks more like you wouldn't accept any external help, which is quite
contradictory with your complaining on not having a lot of time to
dedicate to ocaml. There are people that are actually paid (or otherwise
rewarded) to make all of Debian and Ubuntu (including ocaml) work
optimally on ARM (smartphones, tablets, and stuff).

So I agree with Benedikt's "lacking behind several years" point, but it
shouldn't be taken as negatively as you do. I'm not saying that someone
else would have come up with a better solution than yours :-)

It's still unclear to me whether this kind of patches are welcome. I've
been recently approached by an armhf porter (other than Benedikt)
interested in having an ocamlopt running there, but I told him to back
off because I don't know whether needed changes would be merged. Once
again, I don't say we would have come up with a working solution before
the next release of OCaml, but the result (if any) would have already
been tested and deployed in Debian (and/or Ubuntu) before an upstream
submission.

Of course, we could carry on our patches in a Debian-specific way (and
we already do), but lack of upstream interest is very demotivational for
further development.
