Subject: [Caml-list] Need help for a practical hacking book about ocaml

Hi, all,
   I was writing(or collecting)  a hacking book about ocaml, now it's
already more than 100 pages :-)
  I would help to contribute it for free to the ocaml comunity.  Anyone
would like
 to help it?
 I put it here  http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/master.pdf

 My book mainly focus on how to make ocaml programmers more productive,
quite different from other existing books. Btw, I collected a lot online
resources, anyone can tell me how to credit them?

 I have been digging haskell, ocaml, lisp for several years, honestly
speaking, I found ocaml is still the most productive language.

Many thanks
