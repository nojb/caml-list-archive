... would be interesting to know.

In some other code with partial matches, I got no error...
(with or without the partial-flag).

And I also would not await an error at all...

The difference between the true/false result and the
Pcre.Error(0) result is, that the latter one occurs in
recursive calls of a function.

But AFAIK pcre-ocaml should have no problem here...
...and it's not even multithreaded, but even there,
nothing like that should happen...?!

Can you be more precise in what you mean with where it comes from?
If the exception is called Pcre.Error(0) I would assume it., coming from
Pcre module.
