f# is not compatible enough to do this (e.g. missing objects and
polymorphic variants). I was already thinking a bit about this, e.g.
whether it would make sense to port Ocamlnet to f#. As it is already
ported to win32 in general, this should not be too difficult regarding the
OS-level functionality, but the said language incompatibilities make it
essentially impossible.
