OK, I can agree here.
More communication might be fine.

I don't know how much the OCaml team is overwhelmed with work.
And I don't know how much time it needs to give feedback; that
also depends on the bugtracking tools.
If the used tools are too uncnvenient, maybe they could be changed.

But that also needs work.

I remember that I once had a feature wish.
As far as I remember, it was picked up, but
also done silently...

Last time when I was logged in at the OCaml bugtracker (long ago btw),
there were a lot of issues... some bug-reports, some feature wishes.
Don't remember if automatic messaging must be activated, but I
don't remember that status change was reported to me.

When I use launchpad for Ubuntu, then Messages will be delivered automatically
to the reporter of a bug.

Maybe the toolchain can be enhanced, so that no extra overhead for writing
messages is necessary.

Ciao,
   Oliver
