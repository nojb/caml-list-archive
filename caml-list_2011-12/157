You can follow the progress here: https://github.com/colinbenner/ocamlllvm

It does work for some simple examples already, but it's still very early prototype quality and requires a patched LLVM. LLVM as such is not a bad idea for the compiler backend, but getting things to work with stuff compiled by the regular OCaml backends is the difficult part. We'll see how that turns out.

I don't think it's a trollish topic raised by Stéphane. The QPL is a serious problem and I fear many of us may already already be violating the terms of the QPL, it would be nice to get rid of that issue at some point. The exact license (GPL, LGPL, MIT, BSD, Apache, ...) doesn't matter all that much, almost every other open source license is better than the QPL (just my 2c).
