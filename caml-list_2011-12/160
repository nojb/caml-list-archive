ocaml-llvm was the initial attempt, based on the upstream OCaml sources. But we decided to ditch the surrounding OCaml stuff, esp. the broken make-based build system in favor of something simple, based on oasis and ocamlbuild (just like I did with ocamlnat). So the one to follow is ocamlllvm.

Just drop Colin a mail and ask him for the current patch (should be for 2.7 or 2.8, IIRC).

Yes, the long time goal (maybe impossible to reach with just one bachelor thesis) is to have a simple set of patches for LLVM (mostly calling conventions, maybe some additional intrinsics for the weird OCaml exception model), which can be merged upstream.

Hm, I'm not sure. It's really easy to generate LLVM code for OCaml in general, the problem is getting things to interact with legacy OCaml code, with exception handling being one of the most important issue. The required stuff will be very platform specific and very specific to OCaml, and we don't even know if it's going to work.
