For example, does it mean that [1] will be sent to upstream? It is in
"For Beta-testers" section for now… but, I'm pretty sure you'll have
more testers if the patch was publicly published (reading code helps
testing). And, if yes, then do you know when?

(I can't check ocaml's bugtracker content right now as it appears to be
offline. Apologies if that specific patch has been _publicly_ submitted
on mantis).
