It's just historical. I imported a bunch of OCaml packages into Macports a =
few years ago and preserved the prefix since it wasn't really worth the tro=
uble to rename so many ports.

I've actually given up on MacPorts and switched to Homebrew recently. They =
don't like importing libraries in Homebrew and defer that to the language-s=
pecific package manager.  I'm hoping that odb will be sufficient to act as =
the lightweight library installer to complement Homebrew.

The only annoying thing about installing OCaml from source these days is th=
e 'compiler-libs' convention that most packages seem to do, but isn't reall=
y written down anywhere. Is there a Mantis bug about this one (I couldn't f=
ind one)? It's really helpful to get the Lwt toplevel working and isn't ver=
y obvious where those files come from without diving into the Debian packag=
ing.

I've got a small pull request to add it to the Homebrew package at any rate=
. Comment on it to give it some life and it might even get merged... https:=
