Well, G'Caml did not appear finally. But this explains why no generic
printer has been added so far: There was always the hope to get this
feature automatically by some generalization in the compiler. Same for
type-safe unmarshalling, and other features needing introspection.

On the one hand, these features are badly needed by users. On the other
hand, the language designers strive for an excellent solution, and not one
that will become obsolete sooner or later.

The situation is different today. We'll now have GADTs in the next
release, which work quite differently, and which are no replacement for a
separate introspection solution (like the one Alain suggests), but could
be a clever add-on. So, it has become more likely that the pragmatism wins
this time, because it makes the new playground GADTs more enjoyable (in
particular when the compiler supports the generation of "standard GADTs"
just representing the structure of a type).
