The 23rd International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
Applications (RTA 2012) is the major forum for the presentation
of research on rewriting.


IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract:           Jan 04, 2012
Paper Submission:   Jan 09, 2012
Notification:       Mar 02, 2012
Final version:      Mar 26, 2012

RTA 2012 seeks original submissions on all aspects of rewriting.
Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;
    rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and
    algebraic computation; SMT solving; theorem proving; system
    synthesis and verification; proof checking; reasoning about
    programming languages and logics; program transformation;
    XML queries and transformations; systems biology;

  * Foundations: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models
    of programs;  matching and unification; narrowing; completion
    techniques; strategies; rewriting calculi; constraint solving;
    tree automata; termination; complexity; combination;

  * Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus
    and higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction;
    categorical and infinitary rewriting; stochastic rewriting;
    net rewriting; binding techniques; Petri nets;

  * Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution;
    rewrite and completion tools; confluence and termination checking;
    certification of rewriting properties; abstract machines; explicit
    substitutions;

BEST PAPER AWARD:
An award is given to the best paper or papers as decided by the
program committee.

STUDENT SUPPORT:
Limited student support will be available and announced in future
versions of this call.

PUBLICATION:
RTA proceedings will be published by LIPIcs (Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics). LIPIcs is open access, meaning that
publications will be available online and free of charge, and authors
keep the copyright for their papers. LIPIcs publications are indexed
in DBLP. STACS, FSTTCS and ICLP proceedings also appear in LIPIcs. See
http://www.dagstuhl.de/lipics for more information
about LIPIcs.
Accepted papers will be considered for publication in a special issue
of the journal Logical Methods in Computer Science (LMCS).

SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submission categories include regular research papers,
applications of rewriting techniques, problem sets, and system
descriptions.

The page limit for submissions is 10 proceedings pages for system
descriptions and 15 proceedings pages for all other categories.
Additional material may be provided in an appendix which is not
subject to the page limit. However, submissions must be self-contained
within the respective page limit; reading the appendix should not be
necessary to assess the merits of a submission.

Submissions are accepted in either Postscript or PDF format.
LaTeX template for LIPIcs is available at:
    http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors.tgz
LaTeX template specialized for RTA 2012 is available at:
    http://www.csl.sri.com/users/tiwari/lipics-authors-rta2012.tgz
Authors can use either one for preparing their submission.

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the
EasyChair system at:
       http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rta2012

Questions concerning submissions may be addressed to the PC chair,
Ashish Tiwari by emailing ashish_dot_tiwari_at_sri_dot_com
