The problem is that flexlink.exe (and ocamlopt.exe) are Win32 
executables. They cannot follow Cygwin symlinks.  Of course, I had 
/etc/gcc symlinked to gcc-3.exe through /etc/alternatives, but it did 
not work.

It depends on who is "we". I can imagine that library developers still 
need a C toolchain but release binary packages that don't.

FWIW, LexiFi's application is distributed together with flexlink.exe and 
ocamlopt.exe, and it can recompile and dynamically load user-defined 
plugins without any other external tool.  (Our clients don't need to 
install anything else to write, compile and run native OCaml code.)

Benedikt's work on ocamlnat also includes a similar direct code 
generator as ours(to avoid the external assembler); I don't think it 
comes with a COFF file emitter, though.  But yes, ocamlnat can be used 
to script native-code applications.
