Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml maintenance status / community fork (again)

Just for the record, caml@inria.fr also happens to be list where the 
members of the Caml Consortium discuss their issues. There's potentially 
private/sensitive information in there, and it's not always clear what 
relates to the consortium member's interests, and what is more about 
language design. So having a third list just to discuss language design 
issues is not as easy as it seems.

Cheers,

jonathan
