Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Don't forget the user

Hi Andrej,

I would gladly welcome any patch for my ocaml-installer that allows one 
to build the self-contained environment you describe. Some people seem 
to have volunteered to help out; let them be assured that I will gladly 
review any patch they send.

I'm just afraid it's a big task to do so, which is why I haven't 
tackled this earlier (I could easily see myself spending the whole week 
on it).

There's also http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=0005392 that could 
be improved with the ocaml installer. Any patches for that are welcome, 
too.

Just for reference, the project lives on github 
<https://github.com/protz/ocaml-installer>.

Cheers,

jonathan
