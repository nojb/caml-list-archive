Here is the feature request I proposed:

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4956

Here is the response by Pierre Weis:

"This is a major feature wish that requires careful thinking and a lot 
of work!

Furthermore, we would not have a completely satisfactory solution in the 
end (due to this <poly> catch all case that tend to propagate, as far as 
you use polymorphic functions). The correct solution to get this feature 
in its full glory is a major modification of the type system along the 
lines of G'Caml.

In short, a natural feature wish in a strongly typed polymorphic 
language; we had it in mind for decades; unfortunately, we are not yet 
ready to offer it, even in the rather limited extent you proposed."

In other words: what you did is awesome but I'm not sure that it will be 
added in the trunk :(

Cheers,
