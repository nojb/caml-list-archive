If we can adopt the eglibc model, then the community thing will be the version shipped by distributions, i.e. the community thing is the OCaml for distributions/packagers, not an alternative to the official version. That way we do no longer need to maintain specific patches / versions for Debian, Red Hat, MacPorts, etc. This ensures that versions are compatible across different distributions (because they do no longer need to maintain their own set of patches).

I think of the community thing as:

(a) A single place for patches, while waiting for the next official OCaml release.
(b) A common ground for experimenting with new features. As you already noted, feedback and adoption for experimental stuff hidden within the SVN repository wasn't all that great, so maybe we can change it this way (esp. since it would be coordinated with the distributions/packagers to some degree).

The community team (namely the packagers in this case) already spend this time, as already noted by others (i.e. Stephane). And even if that's the same effort for the core team (I doubt that, since if nothing else, you'll at least have a single tested patch set to review, instead of a bunch of independent, incompatible, and probably untested patches), then there's at least the win for the community.

I shouldn't have used the term "fork" initially, this is misleading. Don't get me wrong. Don't think of my proposal as a "OpenBSD vs. NetBSD" thing with a whole new project.

I can help with the low-level compiler and runtime stuff, others have already expressed their intention to help with Camlp4, etc. You'll receive an email.
