Your patch is way too monolithic. You cannot seriously expect anyone to
apply it as it is.

The git repository looks more sensible, but the history is kind of messy
(e.g. one big initial import removing/duplicating arm.S, then later
merge). My advice is to maintain a clean patch series (e.g. one patch
for each new feature you advertise, or whatever logical split you see
fit), in addition to publishing your working git repository. Please read:

  http://halobates.de/on-submitting-patches.pdf

An acceptable workflow for me would be two git branches, one with your
ongoing development, and another one starting from 3.12.1 release with a
cleaned up and detailed history. Both would continuously have the same
tree, but the cleaned-up one would be rebased if needed to keep the
history clean. Then each commit of the cleaned-up branch would be
reviewed and discussed separately as a candidate patch for upstream
inclusion. All this can be done efficiently with git.

What tests did you perform, by the way?


Cheers,
