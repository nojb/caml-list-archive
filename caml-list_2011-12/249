Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Some comments on recent discussions

Better Windows support would be very nice too. A friend recently had a
python app that he wanted to port to native code, and I offered to do
it for him in OCaml. The linux version was quick and easy to develop,
and we both believed that he could just install OCaml and the required
libraries on windows and have easy cross-platform support with little
effort. He spent two days trying to get GODI and Batteries working,
and finally gave up; it was eashobier for me to just rewrite the bits
I was using directly in my code and not have dependencies. For a
larger project, it really wouldn't have been feasible not to be able
to rely on GODI, and (since my main area of interest is end-user
native apps) this has made me wary of using OCaml for anything other
than apps for my own use, or apps that I am very sure will only be
used under linux.
