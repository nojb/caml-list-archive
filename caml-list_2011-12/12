Subject: [Caml-list] TURING CENTENARY CONFERENCE

**********************************************************************
SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS:

                   TURING CENTENARY CONFERENCE
                      http://www.cie2012.eu

        Computability in Europe 2012: How the World Computes
                     University of Cambridge
                    Cambridge, 18-23 June 2012

CiE 2012 is one of a series of special events, running throughout the Alan
Turing Year, celebrating Turing's unique impact on mathematics, computing,
computer science, informatics, morphogenesis, artificial intelligence,
philosophy and computational aspects of physics, biology, linguistics,
economics and the wider scientific world.

CiE 2012 is planned to be an event worthy of the remarkable scientific
career it commemorates.

PLENARY SPEAKERS include:
Andrew Hodges (Oxford, Special Invited Lecture), Ian Stewart (Warwick,
Special Public Lecture), Dorit Aharonov (Jerusalem), Veronica Becher
(Buenos Aires), Lenore Blum (Carnegie Mellon), Rodney Downey (Wellington),
Yuri Gurevich (Microsoft), Juris Hartmanis (Cornell), Richard Jozsa
(Cambridge), Stuart Kauffman (Vermont/ Santa Fe), James Murray
(Washington/ Oxford, Microsoft Research Lecture), Stuart Shieber
(Harvard), Paul Smolensky (Johns Hopkins) and Leslie Valiant (Harvard,
jointly organised lecture with King's College).

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS and informal presentations are now invited for this
historic event.

For submission details, see:
http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/WScie12/give-page.php?12

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer-Verlag.
Post-conference publications include special issues of APAL and LMCS.
We encourage all researchers presenting papers of the highest research
quality at CiE 2012 to submit their full papers to the CiE journal
COMPUTABILITY where they will be handled as regular submissions.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Submission Deadline for LNCS:                    Jan. 20, 2012
Notification of authors:                         Mar. 16, 2012
Deadline for final revisions:                    Apr. 6, 2012

CiE 2012 will have a special relationship to the scientific legacy of Alan
Turing, reflected in the broad theme: How the World Computes, with all its
different layers of meaning. Contributions which are directly related to
the visionary and seminal work of Turing will be particularly welcome.
