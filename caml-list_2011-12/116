Since the reception was not bad when I presented it to the Caml 
Consortium meeting, yes, I'm proposing this as an extension to the 
official compiler. The plan is to create a branch in the OCaml SVN (I 
don't know when I'll be able to do it, hopefully before end of January) 
and follow the same approach as for GADTs (i.e. ask the community for 
some feedback, and discuss the proposal amongst the core team). I cannot 
commit on the final outcome, of course.
