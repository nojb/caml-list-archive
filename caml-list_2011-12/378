There.

Pcre.Error(0) is cryptical but not strange: it is the same as
Pcre.Error(Pcre.Partial). Whatever gives you the error message
mentioning Pcre.Error(0) does not have access to type information, so it
cannot give you more than Pcre.Error(0). You didn't tell where the error
message came from.

try Pcre.exec ...
with Pcre.Error e ->
  match e with
    | Partial -> ...
    | _ -> ...

If you are using the generic exception pretty-printer (module Printexc),
you can register a pretty-printer for Pcre.Error with
Printexc.register_printer.

The only way a new version of pcre could "fix" that would be if it
registered a pretty-printer as explained above. But this is not the
case, even in the last version (6.2.4).
