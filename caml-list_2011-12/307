I had never heard of that one before and asked people about it. It turns out
it's a collection of binaries already available in other places. That makes
it both uninteresting and interesting.

It's annoying because it will have all the bugs the other have.

It's good because it saves work and you don't have to go hunt for various
binaries everywhere: you have them in a single place.

I think these are definitely fine for programs. Shell scripting shouldn't be
an issue. Libraries of projects like gnuwin32 are probably not as good
however. It shouldn't be an issue to bundle the programs if needed. :-)
