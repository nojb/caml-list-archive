Thanks.

About why ocaml is more productive, probably my explanation will cause a
flaming war,  so
correct me if I am wrong.

Of course, I understand monad, arrow, frp, TH, ST monad or other topics in
haskell, but that
does not really help solve the *real wolrd problems*. And laziness/purity
is really a big hurt.

I think what helps is we could share our tricks programming with ocaml,
some nice tricks or
techniques really help boost productivity. For example, I wrote a tiny
toplevel library (like hoogle
for haskell), I found it really helps.

My experience in ocaml limited,  and the documentation of ocaml is really
lacking, so I think sharing
will help the small community.

I wrote the docs using latex, I digged muse tonight, I can htmlized it, if
that could help sharing.
I would publish it to github after Christmas.

Merry XMas :-)
