Personally I'd even suggest to disconnect OCaml and INRIA, with an independent team of core maintainers (with appropriate spare time and knowledge). INRIA would still contribute to OCaml, but no longer control OCaml.

You might want to create a new "core team" completely disconnected from INRIA, but the problem would remain the same (I don't believe in a completely decentralized development model for something like OCaml).

The problem is IMHO that there is no one at INRIA caring about ARM. In an open model we would have maintainers for the ARM port(s).

I wasn't aware that there is a separate communication channel for the core team. I was under the impression that the caml-list was the best way to reach both the core team and the community.
