Subject: [Caml-list] Why isn't there a common platform for functional language interaction ?

    Caml-list,

Given that other people are raising trolls, here is mine...

I have to admit I appreciate F# transparent interaction with C# libraries
which allows me to use large amounts of code that I would have had to
poorly rewrite otherwise (GUI, database, web stuff, etc). Same happens with
SML, Caml, Haskell and F#, some pieces of code are just way better in one
language than in the others, and you end partially porting these libraries
to Caml which is a waste of time and you don't benefit from the updates of
the original code and nobody but you can maintain your quick-and-dirty port.

Why isn't there a core functional languages to which everyone could
compile, on which the compiler research could be done (certification,
optimisation, garbage collection) and that would allow full interaction of
the different dialects at run-time ?

At some point I thought that C-- (http://www.cminusminus.org/index.html)
and that type of work would converge to that but it never happened.

        Diego Olivier
