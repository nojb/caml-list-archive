Subject: Re: [Caml-list] RFC: basename, dirname, PR#4549

Hi,

I've done a lot of system programming in the past years, and I cannot
remember that I had to work around this small incompatibility.

Semantically, the POSIX specs are better, because only directories are
allowed to have trailing slashes, and if you want to get the basename of
"path/" you want the name of the directory in >99% of the cases. The
trailing slash has only the meaning that it is asserted that the path
refers to a directory. And operations like "basename" better ignore such
assertions.

There could be a problematic area, though: URLs. A trailing slash means
here a different resource. I don't know whether anybody is using
basename in this context.

Gerd
