I may also add support to emit small functions using Thumb-1 (for pre-ARMv7 / armel) in the future to reduce code size.

I've updated the backend, and a new patch is available for testing at [1], you can also test it by cloning the ocaml-arm repository at [2], some documentation is available on the Wiki at [3].

The following new features are included:

- Support for both VFPv3-D16 and VFPv3(-D32), using ocamlopt switch -ffpu (armhf only).
- Support for architecture selection using -farch.
- Support for profiling using gprof.
- Code cleanups.
- Confirmed to work with Debian/armel on ARM9 / Cortex-A8 and Debian/armhf on Cortex-A8.

Testers and feedback welcome.

greets,
Benedikt
