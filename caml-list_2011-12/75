We used to have 100 seperate little modules all over the place. Now we
have 2 contenders for a "standard library". I think we are going the
right way there. Lets leave that allone for at least a year or two.

And we do (initially) need 5 APIs for string functions and we need to
test them all and decide which one fits best. And there can be more than
one that should be kept. E.g. one API with exceptions and one with
option types.  But then all modules in the "standard library" should
provide those APIs we want to keep consistently across all modules.

Lets agree that we eventually want one standard library.

Can we also agree that the standard library can be external to the
compiler, like Batteries or Core is?

ACK. Totaly different fruit. Even talking about a standard library is
imho fruitless (at this point in time) and OT to the original problem.
