Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Storing ocaml values outside ocaml's heap

Hi William,

this can be made working, and there is already a lot of support in
Ocamlnet (module Netsys_mem, espeically init_value). I'm now using this
all the time for populating shared memory blocks (which need to be outside
the ocaml heap) with normal ocaml values.

In Ocamlnet I'm using simply a bigarray for keeping the reference to the
off-heap memory area (remember, bigarrays are just pointers to C arrays).
This allows it to program the whole algorithm accessing such values in
Ocaml.

A warning though: Experience shows also that this type of programming is
very error-prone, as you always have to take the memory representation of
ocaml values into account.
