Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Some comments on recent discussions

Hi Martin,

GODI is currently broken on Windows, and I would need to invest again a
few days to get at least the basics running again. This is a big problem
for me, because I've personally no direct advantage from this, and there
is also the question how you can keep such a very different port running
when you don't use it (i.e. errors will start accumulating again). At
least I'd need support from a skilled porter with direct interest in it.

Also, the usefulness is not totally clear to me. Actually, only those
GODI libraries will run painlessly that are either ocaml-only, and that
have been specially ported. So for any bigger real-world app you would
clearly run into big problems anyway, because it is almost sure that
there is a non-ported library in the dependency chain. It might be good
enough for education or programs not needing deep OS support, but it is
clearly limited.
