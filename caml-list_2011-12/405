This is really great!

One comment, it doesn't work on Safari. I see parts of the page, but the
dynamic parts don't work. This is a problem I already had on an
ocsigen.orgpage, and I reported on the Ocsigen list. When I turn on
the javascript
debugger in Safari and reload the page, it then works. However, without the
javascript console open, refreshing the page does nothing.
