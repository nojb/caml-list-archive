So, (0) stands for the first entry in the list I assume.
BadPartial-exception then would be Pcre.Error(1). ?

That there is only returned an int, instead of the type information,
where does that come from?
Why is that not available?
Does it coming from working together with the *.c stuff?

Hmhhh.
Not used that stuff so far.

OK, thanks.

I also looked now, at what the original package offers...
...for example with "make doc" a lot of additional
nice docs will be created.

That was not offered by my OS-based installation.
So, looking at the source package was an interesting experience.
