Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml maintenance status / community fork

So what your proposition adds to the existing ocaml forks out there
is that there should be people reviewing and merging incoming patches
and releasing a semi-official community version for each official
release.

The problem with this proposition as stated, in my opinion, is that
the original fork is very easy to do but the following review/release
processes asks for more volunteers time.

Why not concentrate on a fork that's already there with plenty of
patches, for instance this one :

https://github.com/thelema/ocaml-community

and roll a first release out of it ?
