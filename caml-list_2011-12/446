Subject: [Caml-list] Some simple(?) questions about camlp4 <:quotations< ... >>


I'm writing a mini-DSL that'll use camlp4 quotations.  In general
http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Quotation has been very
helpful, but I still have a few questions:

(1) Is any other syntax available for quotations apart from
<:foo< ... >> and the default quotation expander << ... >>?

(2) Is there any way to escape >> inside a quotation.  In particular
some of my quotations will contain C code, and >> is a C operator
(right shift).  This is not a show-stopper, but it'd be nice to be
able to offer a way for C code to contain right shifts, in a way that
is easily comprehensible to C programmers.

(3) In a custom-defined quotation expander, does the antiquotation
syntax $bar$ have any special meaning?  I want to use $variable
substitutions, so if $ is being treated specially this might cause
problems.

Rich.
