Whether you call it a "fork" or a "distribution" doesn't matter. It's basically what I described in my initial proposal for a "community fork" (or a "community distribution"). Simply a place where contributors are welcome, patches are reviewed and processed (in a reasonable time frame), with focus on cooperation and communication.

If people fear the word "fork", can we agree on a "community distribution" (in the eglibc sense) instead?

While we don't have a Drepper here in OCaml land (yet?), there are certainly a few common problems, Stephane already mentioned OCaml as an unpleasant upstream.
