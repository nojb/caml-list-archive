The plan is that OASIS-DB exports its packages in a format that is
understood by GODI. OASIS-DB would then appear as a second source for
packages. For users there would be practically no difference -
godi_console just fetches packages from a second site, too.

For package developers this will mean that there is a choice. More
complicated packages will probably remain native GODI ones (because of
the unlimited scripting) whereas the average library will be well
expressable in OASIS-DB.
