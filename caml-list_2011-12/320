Binary packages could be cross-compiled. This is what has been done for
Coq dependencies [1]. Our goal while doing this was just to produce a
working Windows version of Coq, but maybe the idea could be extended to
provide a full development environment as envisioned in your point 1
(self-contained OCaml toolchain, with no C compiler). The "decent
Unix-like" environment you mention would then be an actual existing
(foreign) one.

Cross-compiling raises the issue of testing of binary packages. But if
we can get a working (and reasonably maintainable) OCaml toolchain on
Windows, pure OCaml test-suites could be used to test them natively.

I don't know about others, but the cross-compiling way would be my best
choice: I don't really care about Windows itself, but I do care about
Windows users of my software :-)
