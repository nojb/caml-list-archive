No. That said, you could implement your own quotations mechanism as a
Camlp4 extension (changing the grammar of the language). The benefit
of the "official" quotations is that you don't touch the existing
OCaml grammar (... of Camlp4).

> (2) Is there any way to escape >> inside a quotation.

Camlp4 doesn't touch the content of quotations... except that the
lexer needs to know when they stop. ">>" is always interpreted as the
quotation delimiter, and this is hardcoded in the lexer, so you can't
change that. For example escaping with "\>>" would not work. Any
non-">>" symbol will be handled by you (that is, the parser you set up
for your quotation) and you can do as you wish. For example you could
specify to your users that you will always interpret ">\>" as if it
was a ">>", providing an escape mechanism.

No, if you have told the lexer that you doesn't want it to lex
antiquotations specially. This can be configured through a Camlp4
option.(Camlp4_config.antiquotations).

That said, I think antiquotations are very convenient for any DSL (as
it allows your users to compose pieces of DSL program using OCaml
constructs such let bindings, etc.). If I were you, I would change the
DSL syntax to free the $...$ for antiquotations.
