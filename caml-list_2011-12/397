Yes, the docs are created with ocamldoc and are
pretty printed docs with a lot of information.

Not sure if these are the unchanged Debian-Packages.
It's an older Ubuntu what is running here.

So it could be reported either at the Debian or the 
Ubuntu side.

The docs could be created via the sourcce package.
Not sure if this was intended or not.
Depends on how Debian/Ubuntu want to handle that.

Maybe there could be also a package called "libpcre-ocaml-doc"
added then, which at the moment does not exist (at least not on this
old distribution).

Ciao,
