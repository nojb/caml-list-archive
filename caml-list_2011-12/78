Hello Gabriel,

[ I should not participate to such a thread... anyway I'm participating. :-) ]

Yes, yes and yes!

I especially loved the "do one *complete* program in one chapter of a
few pages" approach.

I thought about the same.

Another idea: adapt the book to ePub format extended with Javascript
(apparently latest ePub draft has such scripting capabilities) and use
js_of_ocaml tool to embed an OCaml toplevel inside the book: read the
examples, execute examples, play with the examples! Wouldn't it be
nice? ;-)

Unfortunately, it is available under a non Free license (Non
Commercial clause of CC-BY-NC-SA licence), this is a show stopper for
me. I would like such a book to be included in Debian or other Free
Software distributions.

Wouldn't it be the non Free license, I would even start from the PDF. :-(

Best regards,
