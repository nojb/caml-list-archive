Do you mean source-level compatibility between the two languages?  I'm 
afraid they are too different, and limiting oneself to their 
intersection is not realistic for a large project (and you'd loose many 
benefits of each language).

For a bridge between the two languages, it would not be very different 
from a generic bridge between OCaml and .Net (similar to CSML), with the 
same major issue of having to deal with two separate GCs and references 
between them, maybe just with a better structural treatment for sum 
types.  Not very exciting, and to make it usable, one would also need to 
address existing issues with OCaml under Windows anyway.
Also, I don't think that people really want to use both languages in the 
same project.


Maybe you mean something else with interoperability?
