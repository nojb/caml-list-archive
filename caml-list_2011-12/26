Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml maintenance status / community fork

I'd say it depends very much for which kind of work the community fork is
used. If it is just for enhancing the standard library, please don't do it
- there are as many opinions as contributors. If it is for fixing bugs I'm
for it - provided there is a process to get the fixes back to the original
Ocaml version.

Regarding your work, Benedikt, I'm not sure what would be the best. It's
highly interesting work, but it's deeply changing the compiler, so
probably not something a community of volunteers could review (although
they could test it at least).

I'd see this more as an effort to organize help for the core team, and it
would be essential that the "fork" is working in both directions.
