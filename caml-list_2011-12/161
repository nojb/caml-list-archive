I'm not a lawyer, but the QPL is not necessarily compatible with free software licenses, as already noted in another thread.

Right. I would like to place focus on discussing this point, as it seems to be the root of the evil. It would be so easy to fix, IMHO, and you don't need to give up control by the core team. Why not accept a model similar to i.e. the NetBSD project, with a lot of committers (experts in their own areas) and 2-3 people to keep an eye on the overall direction?
