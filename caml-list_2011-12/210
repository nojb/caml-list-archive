Subject: [Caml-list] how could the community help with Oasis-DB; towards a CPAN for OCaml?

Edgar, It's excellent to know that you have some knowledge of Oasis-DB.

I share the common assumption that this is one of the missing bricks
of the OCaml ecosystem, and I hope the community at large can help
with it. I asked Sylvain about it a few months ago, but he wasn't sure
at that time what was the best way to help. With him now having less
time available, I was afraid things could stall on that front.

Could you (or Sylvain) make a more precise picture of how exactly the
community could help in the Oasis-DB effort?

Is the priority to upload package (then maybe the warning on the
webpage advising not to do it seriously should be changed), or are
there other things we could help with, for example development
aspects? Who/where should we ask for advice/help when we have issues?

A few months ago we tried to organize an "OCaml packaging sprint", in
which in particular Hezekiah M. Carty was of great help. Do you think
we could restart a similar effort in the short future?

It would really help, I think, if:
- there was a list somewhere of things other people can contribute
- you talked more about the progress of the effort (I discovered
'odb.ml' by absolute chance a few weeks ago, while I follow almost all
OCaml-related information channels); if people don't know about your
work, they won't contribute
