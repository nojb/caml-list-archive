I join you.

1°)
According to me, enlarging the user base is the root solution to this.
We need more tiny-to-small projects (they woul more look like code 
snippets) in Ocaml.

2°)
There is a need for "common type" web apps in Ocaml:
- a CMS (as Drupal, Joomla,...)
- a Redmine-like
- a blog hosting, just like Wordpress
- ..

3°)
There need to be an Ocaml application that has a link with a need in web 
development:
- an Ocaml thing better than Sonar http://www.sonarsource.org/
- http://goo.gl/Oq6ew

That works and ease packaging for OS package manager: it should be easy 
to build RPMs, .deb, so that it's easy to upgrade for system 
administrators in production environments and easy to get _exposed_ in 
the system package management tool.

I'm on the way of creating a computer science institute of my view and 
the goal is to teach Ocaml, and produce OCaml code. We'll see how it 
works :-).
