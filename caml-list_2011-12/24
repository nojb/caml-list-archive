<blockquote class=3D"gmail_quote" style=3D"margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1p=
x #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">Dear caml-list,<br>
<br>
During the last year or two it seems that time and interest in OCaml mainte=
nance from the official OCaml development team is diminishing. It takes sev=
eral months to get a patch reviewed (if at all), which is quite frustrating=
 for OCaml contributors and even worse for OCaml users. I suspect that this=
 is one of the top reasons why there are only a few active contributors to =
OCaml (and the number of active users, at least on the mailing list, is dec=
lining).<br>

<br>
I understand that INRIA does not necessarily pay people for full time maint=
enance jobs on OCaml (and Coq), and the official dev team is probably alrea=
dy doing as much as possible to maintain OCaml. Given that OCaml is such a =
nice language with a lot of useful frameworks available, it is too sad to s=
ee it loosing ground just because of it&#39;s closed development process an=
d lack of time of the official team.<br>

<br>
I&#39;d therefore propose to open up OCaml development to a wider range of =
developers / contributors, to ensure that OCaml will be ready for the (func=
tional programming) future. There are already various &quot;OCaml forks&quo=
t; in the wild, with different goals and patch sets, so simply starting ano=
ther fork would be rather useless. Instead I&#39;d suggest to bundle effort=
s in a new &quot;OCaml community fork&quot;, which is always based on the m=
ost recent upstream OCaml release (starting point would be 3.12.1 for now),=
 and takes care to review and integrate pending patches as well as developi=
ng and testing new features. Let&#39;s say we&#39;d name the fork &quot;OCa=
ml-ng&quot;, then we&#39;d try to release a new patch set every month or tw=
o, based on the official OCaml release, i.e. &quot;ocaml-3.12.1+ng201112&qu=
ot; and so on, to get early testing and feedback (should work together clos=
ely with the Debian/Ubuntu/etc. OCaml maintainers).<br>

<br>
With this process, OCaml upstream could merge (tested) patches from OCaml-n=
g once they proved working in the wild, and thereby<br>
<br>
1. maintenance overhead for INRIA people is reduced,<br>
2. maintenance status of OCaml would be way better,<br>
3. there would be a lot less frustration for possible contributors, and<br>
4. users benefit from a better and more up to date OCaml.<br>
<br>
Now that does of course raise a few questions:<br>
<br>
1. What is the opinion of the official development team / INRIA on this?<br>
2. Who would help with the community fork?<br>
3. What about infrastructure?<br>
<br>
Feedback and suggestions are welcome.<br>
