Right, of course, wrong wording.

I don't know what's the best to move on. But whatever it will be, the entry barriers for contributors and new maintainers should be lowered and both the process and the outcome of decisions should be opened up, IMHO. Otherwise the overall situation will stay the same; OCaml may have an ARM maintainer then, but will continue to lack an XYZ maintainer, even though there are patches and contributors. Enlarging the existing core won't magically improve communication / contact with the community; as Gabriel noted there are human issues in play here.

Ok, I'll keep them CC'd. I don't want to start a new private discussion with them as that certainly won't help with openness either.
