For GODI packages, there is also an autobuilder:

https://godirepo.camlcity.org/openapps/autoui.cgi

It simply fetches packages from GODI, and builds them, once every night.
This is now only for debian, simply because this was enough for me to
check the quality of the packages. If somebody is interested to run it on
its own (very simple scripting), I could publish the scripts, with some
setup explanations.

If reasonable I could also set up a few more VMs for more OSes. I'm a bit
concerned, though, that I won't have the time to maintain these.
