Wouldn't it be more reliable to write a GCC OCaml frontend, or an LLVM OCaml frontend?
(or generate GCC Gimple, or LLVM IR).
I think GCC already has a frontend which is written in the language itself (Ada).

There are things that cannot be easily expressed in C, such as tail calls,
type hierarchies, etc. Also there is a lot of undefined behaviour in C that you can quite easily hit,
especially if you automatically generate code.
