Yes, I guess.  Is has been known for some time that the mingw port could 
be made to work with a standalone mingw compiler at little cost, but the 
"officially" supported mingw port required Cygwin, and flexdll needs to 
be adapted a little bit.  Providing long-term support for this new setup 
will take some resource (yet another Windows port!).

Alternatively, one could decide that the officially supported "mingw 
port" is based on a standalone mingw (or mingw-w64); Cygwin packagers 
could always create OCaml packages for the mingw compilers shipped with 
Cygwin.

This is a big move, which will probably make some people unhappy.

Yes, I can help solving some specific problems (e.g. with flexdll); but 
probably not for long-term maintenance.
