In Tuebingen we started with scheme in the first year and later there
were several classes on FP languages and a few using ocaml, for example
the compiler construction class. But the later classes are pick&choose,
you just need enough credits from each of the 3 major groups, so people
can probably completly avoid FP based curses.

Personally I think the introduction to computer languages class we had
is a must. How else do you even know what is out there and if you like
it?
