Yes, OCamlPro is working on different projects to improve OCaml
(namespaces, better inlining, debugging, multicore gc, etc.), but the
main focus is currently on improving development tools (edition,
refactoring, navigation, documentation, etc.), while minimizing the
modifications on the compiler itself. The plan is to release a first
version by the beginning of 2012, but it will be complementary to OCaml,
not a replacement.

For the OCaml distribution itself, OCamlPro will have a different
release cycle for its own version, targetting industrial users, but the
high quality testing process required to do that is still under
construction.
