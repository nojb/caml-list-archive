If you mean having a "good" indentation, opening it in Emacs+tuareg-mode 
then indenting will work fine.

Note that it's a file by file way and it doesn not split uselessly long 
lines to shorter ones: just indentation. Or I dont know how to fully use 
tuareg-mode ;-).

For a large set of files, I don't know how to ease the work.
