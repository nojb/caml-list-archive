I agree that package management, a *single* standard library, and a good
web presence are the most useful things we can do. We desperately need
oasis, oasis-db, and eventually an OCaml Platform to succeed. The standard
library contenders are Batteries and Jane St Core. Ideally these could be
merged, but that will take a lot of effort from both teams. On the web
side, we did start a project to build a new website for OCaml, announced at
the last User Meeting. We are continuing to work on it, although admittedly
progress has been slow.

Nothing wrong with compiler improvements. We don't have to pick between
these options. Let's just work on all of them.  :)
