Subject: [Caml-list] Caml-PR ... a first idea

Hello,

if there would be a *nice* OCaml-T-Shirt available,
an official one by the Caml-Core-developers/INRIA,
I would order one (or more) :-)


Design ideas could be contributed as part of a Ocaml-T-Shirt contest, where the
OCaml Core Team is the jury, and the design ideas will be hosted on GitHub.

Using *.svg for the picture could help in a collaborative design attempt of
course ...


Ciao,
   Oliver
