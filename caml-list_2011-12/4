Subject: [Caml-list] Caml bug tracker: downtime scheduled from december 5th

Hello,

Mantis[1], the bug tracker used for OCaml, will be down from december, 5th
at the end of the morning.

At this date, we'll move the caml site to a new server. The DNS change
should be transparent for the web site, which should remain available all
the time. This is the occasion to upgrade mantis while moving it to the new
server too.

Mantis will be available anew when the DNS change is propagated, which can
take some hours or days.

Cheers,

Maxence
