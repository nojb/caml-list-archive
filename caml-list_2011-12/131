It works if you add -cc "gcc -shared", or -ccopt -shared. Looking at
call_linker in utils/ccomp.ml, it seems to be by design: the command to
link executables and the command to link plugins are two different
variables, that are both overridden by the -cc option.

I suggest you to add -ccopt -shared when linking a plugin in your
myocamlbuild.ml (or not using -cc at all).
