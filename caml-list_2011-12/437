CALL FOR PAPERS

********************************************************
World Congress on Internet Security (WorldCIS-2012)
Technically Co-Sponsored by IEEE UK/RI Computer Chapter and IEEE K/W Section
June 10-12, 2012
Venue: University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada
www.worldcis.org
********************************************************

The World Congress on Internet Security (WorldCIS-2012)
is Technically Co-Sponsored by IEEE UK/RI Computer Chapter
and IEEE K/W Section. The WorldCIS-2012 is an international
forum dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practical
implementation of security on the Internet and Computer Networks.
The inability to properly secure the Internet, computer networks,
protecting the Internet against emerging threats and vulnerabilities,
and sustaining privacy and trust has been a key focus of research.
The WorldCIS aims to provide a highly professional and comparative
academic research forum that promotes collaborative excellence between
academia and industry.

On the ubiquitous networking environments, information is
explosively used for various kinds of purposes. From a
service perspective, a number of context or ambient aware
services are envisaged for "ubiquitous networking" but based
on the context security remains an issue.

The objectives of the WorldCIS are to bridge the knowledge
gap between academia and industry, promote research esteem
and and to fostering discussions on information technologies,
information systems and globa security applications.
The WorldCIS-2011 invites speakers and researchers to submit
papers that encompass conceptual analysis, design implementation
and performance evaluation.

Original papers are invited on recent advances in Internet,
Computer Communications and Networking Security.

The topics in WorldCIS-2012 include but are not confined
to the following areas:

*Internet Security
*Security, trust and privacy
*Self-organizing networks
*Sensor nets and embedded systems
*Service overlays
*Switches and switching
*Topology characterization and inference
*Traffic measurement and analysis
*Traffic engineering and control
*Trust and Data Security
*Virtual and overlay networks
*Web services and performance
*Wireless mesh networks and protocols
*Ad hoc mobile networks Security
*Addressing and location management
*Broadband access technologies
*Blended Internet Security Methods
*Biometrics
*Boundary Issues of Internet Security
*Capacity planning
*Cellular and broadband wireless nets
*Congestion control
*Content distribution
*Cryptography
*Cross layer design and optimization
*Cyber-physical computing/networking
*Geographic information systems
*Privacy Protection and Forensic in Ubi-com
*Quality of Service Issues
*Regulations
*Secured Database Systems
*Security in Data Mining
*Security and Access Control
*Semantic Web and Ontology
*Data management for U-commerce
*Software Architectures
*Defence Systems
*Delay/disruption tolerant networks
*End Users
*Enabling technologies for the Internet
*Implementation and experimental testbeds
*Future Internet Design and Applications
*Middleware support for networking
*Mobility models and systems
*Multicast and anycast
*Multimedia protocols and networking
*Network applications and services
*Network architectures Network control
*Network management
*Network simulation and emulation
*Novel network architectures
*Network and Protocol Architectures
*Peer-to-peer communications
*Performance evaluation
*Power control and management
*Pricing and billing
*Protocols and Standards
*Resource allocation and management
*RFID
*Optical networks
*Routing protocols
*Scheduling and buffer management
*Virtual Reality
