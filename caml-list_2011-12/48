And one of the great sub-topic is how to avoid that students *hate* FP.
When i say to other programmers i code in ocaml, they answer they
absolutely hate this language they have to learn at university. I met this
"effect" more than 15 times !
There's a great problem of old boring professors who teach FP with
uninteresting problems (and lectures).
So the litlle part of programmers who faces FP-language simply forget how
to think in FP way..

&gt; Well, if you ask whether _any_ FP language is taught, the results won&=

&gt;<br>
&gt; I&#39;m currently doing consulting for a web company (in Germany) - ar=

&gt;&gt;&gt; A fork could possibly get traction from the community, but you=
 would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; have to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; provide interesting features that the real OCaml does not prov=

&gt;&gt;&gt; fixes<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; won&#39;t be enough.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; So now, here is my real problem. What are those famous so wanted<b=
r>
&gt;&gt; feature that this fork will provide? And what makes you (a plural =
you)<br>
&gt;&gt; think that ocaml is such a slowly moving and evolving language?<br>
&gt;&gt; According to the caml web site, in the past two years, we&#39;ve s=
een<br>
&gt;&gt; native dynlink, polymorphic recursion and first class module makin=
g<br>
&gt;&gt; there way into the language. According to what can be found on the=
<br>
&gt;&gt; trunk of the ocaml svn, the next release will have GADTs. And the<=
br>
&gt;&gt; compiler have also been modified to incorporate things like a nice=

&gt;&gt; and some backends have been added.<br>

<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; So before saying we need to fork the OCaml compiler to add &quot;m=
