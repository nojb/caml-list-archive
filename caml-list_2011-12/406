Yes, I've seen that - what I mean isn't clearing the view, but really
reseting the variables and whatever is defined.
Maybe there actually is something in the standard toplevel, but I don't
think I've ever heard about it :)

The behaviour I want would be:

# let x = 42;;
val x : int = 42
# reset ();;
- : unit = ()
# x;;
Characters 0-1:
Error: Unbound value x
