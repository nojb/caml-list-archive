I may also add support to emit small functions using Thumb-1 (for pre-ARMv7 / armel) in the future to reduce code size.

Dear Benedikt,

This looks like an impressive amount of work.  I'd like to suggest that a good
approach to getting some/all of this merged might be to divide the patch up
into smaller units each addressing a particular deficiency or implementing
a particular feature.  In that way it should be more straightforward to
understand the effects on the whole system of each particular patch and
maintain stability and compatibility.  I understand that this might cause some
work and that some of the patches might be intertwined.  (Another approach
might be to introduce this backend as a second ARM backend with the
understanding that it may be experimental to a certain extent---but I think
that's less satisfactory, and less likely to find favour with everyone.)

Which items from the above list would you most like to see in the core
distribution?  I would have thought the basic VFP support was fairly high
up the list.

Mark
