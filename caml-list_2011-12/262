Fine book, but the author's name was Jason Hickey.

The last (?) version from 2008 looks a littlebid disturbed,
regarding the column titles.

In this book it's mentioned the following:
  "This book has been submitted for publication by Cambridge University Press.
  This draft may be used until the time the book appears in print."

If the book will not be published, maybe his book might be polished
and provided freely (and might be included into OS distributions?)
Payment for Jason Hickey could be done via donations, so that
he gets something back for his work.

Ciao,
   Oliver
