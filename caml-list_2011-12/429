A good idea.

You could put the above paragraph into the preface.
And mention, that even you found OCaml to be the most
productive language, you even want to become more productive,
and that was the reason for your book... (that's what I understood).

Maybe you could elaborate a littlebid more about why you
think that OCaml is most productive.
It's of course also my conclusion from looking at a lot of languages.
But you might be better in explaining it.

You asked for help.
Can you specify more detailed, which kind of help you are looking for?

Ciao,
   Oliver
