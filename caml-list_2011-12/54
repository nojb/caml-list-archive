ACK. Of course, improving the compiler is a topic of its own. I can fully
understand Benedikt's frustration.

We discussed this often enough. I think Oasis-db is a part of that, but
not the answer to everything. It is more designed to package smaller
libraries.

If you want a more universal answer, you end up with something like GODI.

Btw, some quite popular languages can live entirely without package
management. What I mean: this makes life easier, but is not crucial to
adaption. Users choose languages because of other criteria.

This may all be true for a single person. A group is recognized
differently, though, especially by real social interaction (conferences,
meetings etc.), by press coverage, and by company support.

> GitHub

Can't we stop talking about such very technical things? There are ocaml
projects on GitHub, and ocaml popularity hasn't boosted because of this.

You will for sure see troll patches - people trying to get something into
the compiler that should better not be solved there. I'm not sure whether
a community process can sort this all out. However, I'm not against trying
it, because there is a large class of undoubted problems (e.g. errors).

I'd also like to hear this.
