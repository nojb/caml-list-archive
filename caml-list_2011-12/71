Hi,

My only complaint about the current development model is that it is a
bit opaque and we don't really know what is happening; we mostly only
see the result once it has been done.

I'd like to know some things like: this feature/patch (will/will
not/might/might not) go in/will be tried/we have no idea/... Maybe a
preliminary opinion from the guts but at least some signal because
it's impossible to see a difference between something that hasn't been
looked at yet and something that is being silently rejected.

This would also make the core development seem more active (and
considering the major changes we've seen with each major release in
the past years, it definitely is).

Regards,
Adrien Nader
