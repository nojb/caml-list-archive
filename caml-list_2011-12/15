Subject: [Caml-list] TLDI 2012 Call for participation

                The Seventh ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
             Types in Language Design and Implementation
                            (TLDI 2012)

                      CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                     Saturday, January 28, 2012
                   in conjunction with POPL 2012
                        Philadelphia, PA, USA

The role of types and proofs in all aspects of language design, compiler
construction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent
years. Type systems, type-based analyses and type-theoretic deductive
systems have been central to advances in compilation techniques for modern
programming languages, verification of safety and security properties of
programs, program transformation and optimization, and many other areas. The
ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation brings
researchers together to share new ideas and results concerning all aspects
of types and programming, and is now an annual event. TLDI 2012 is the
seventh workshop in the series and will be co-located with POPL in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in January 2012.


PROGRAM

Invited speakers:

  - Frank Pfenning (Carnegie Mellon University)
    Towards Concurrent Type Theory 

  - Neelakantan Krishnaswami (Max Planck Institute)
    Semantics for Graphical User Interfaces
