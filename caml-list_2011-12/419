It's the other way around: Ocsigen is based on js_of_ocaml. The examples
on [1] (and Try OCaml AFAICT) don't need Ocsigen.

[1] http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/manual/

If you want to write a full client-server application with both sides
written in OCaml and a clean integration, then Ocsigen is for you :-)
