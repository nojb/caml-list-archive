In my pcre.mli this error is not mentioned.

There is a


type error =
  | Partial  (** String only matched the pattern partially *)
  | BadPartial  (** Pattern contains items that cannot be used together
                    with partial matching. *)
  | BadPattern of string * int  (** [BadPattern (msg, pos)] regular
                                    expression is malformed.  The reason
                                    is in [msg], the position of the
                                    error in the pattern in [pos]. *)
  | BadUTF8  (** UTF8 string being matched is invalid *)
  | BadUTF8Offset  (** Gets raised when a UTF8 string being matched with
                       offset is invalid. *)
  | MatchLimit  (** Maximum allowed number of match attempts with
                    backtracking or recursion is reached during matching.
                    ALL FUNCTIONS CALLING THE MATCHING ENGINE MAY RAISE
                    IT!!! *)
  | RecursionLimit
  | InternalError of string
      (** [InternalError msg] C-library exhibits unknown/undefined
          behaviour.  The reason is in [msg]. *)


Which also mentioned a partial-match error.
But Pcre.Error(0) looks somehow cryptical
and strange to me.

Maybe that old version is just too old.

Yes, I think that makes sense.
But Pcre.Error(0) is not very verbose, and I also want to know
what I catch and why...

Installing a newer pcre was easy, but then my build process complains
about multiple stublibs-directories. So I threw it away.
So maybe it's better to change the apt-get stuff instead.

(I also tried to create a pcre-ocaml PKGBUILD for Arch Linux, but
 I would need to fake the install-drectories, so that it would install
locally inside the fakeroot... any ideas on that?)


Ciao,
