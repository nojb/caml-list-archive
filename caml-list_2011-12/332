Subject: [Caml-list] Thread.exit

Hello,

I use the threads library.

I would like to ask if

     Thread.exit

must have the following type:

     unit -> unit

instead of:

     unit -> 'a

i.e. the same as the type of Pervasives.exit.

In my code:

   let bits = try receive ()
              with Channel.End -> close ();
                                  Thread.exit ();
                                  exit 0
   in

I must make a bogus call "exit 0" empty to make the type-checker happy.
If "Thread.exit" had the same type as "Pervasives.empty", it would not 
be necessary.

It is not a big problem, but I think this is unnecessary constraint and 
if removed, I could simply write:

   let bits = try receive ()
              with Channel.End -> close ();
                                  Thread.exit ()
   in

(i.e. without confusing bogus calls)

Maybe I am just too sensitive, but I would still be interested in these 
small improvements, if they make sense.

Regards,
