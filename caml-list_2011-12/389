Subject: [Caml-list] polymorphism in general

Hello,

I have a question about polymorphism in general.

Let's take this example:
  val polymorph1 : 'a * 'b -> string = <fun>

Is it polymorph?
I have a doubt because the result is always a "string", not something 
related to either "'a" or "'b".

So another way to ask the question: is polymorphism only qualified by 
the parameter?

Thank you for your help.
