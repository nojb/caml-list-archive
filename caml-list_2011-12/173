The LLVM issue already was discussed months or years ago.
There also was a testlanguage implementation with some features of OCaml,
performing good, but AFAIK it was far away from competing with OCaml in respect
to what the language offered as features. (Performance alone is not enough.)

Don't know if this project exists today.
But my impression is, that this was one of many attempts
that started with good ideas but did not come to a stage
that could be interfaced with OCaml.

One reason, why I'm sceptical on the many suggestions done 
on here on the list these days....


Ciao,
