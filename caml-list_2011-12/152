Gabriel, I'm really surprised at how good you are at stopping any
serious discussion !

I really doubt Stéphane wanted to start another trollish topic on the
list. In fact, he raised a very important point (IMHO). If one seriously
considers investigating some time to contribute such a backend, the
licensing issue will be the first stopper.

It is amazing how people easily turn controversial questions into "trolls" !
