Thanks!
I've even found Toploop.initialize_toplevel_env () that does exactly
what I wanted thanks to you :)


It might be a good idea to make it more obvious or name it in the handy
commands of the website then - I really believe that people, especially
beginners or when toying around, want to clean their environment
often. I though about it because I just had something weird I could not
explain because the first thing I did was define a global x, and 10
minutes later it came back inside a function where I shouldn't have had
an x...
Maybe reset it when changing lesson? (though that might be unwanted
sometimes too, I don't know.)


Cheers,
