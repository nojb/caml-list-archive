Yes that'd be one major goal: to get patches applied (whether they're fixing bugs or adding features). Whether it will be possible to get the "original OCaml version" updated using a new process or whether the "original OCaml" will be obsolete at some point,... I don't know. I guess time will tell. At least we'll see some more activity in the OCaml core area again.

I can't tell you right now how these things are going to work out, I'm open for suggestions. Most of what I have in the pipe (and others who sent me their patches for review because they haven't received any response from the OCaml team) does not "deeply change the compiler". The largest patch, which I'm working on right now, is about replacing the existing arm port with two new ports, armel and armhf, to overcome the various issues with the existing port (and to utilize VFP/Neon hardware in modern ARM boards/netbooks).

... or as an effort to disconnect "core team" and INRIA...
