Subject: Re: [Caml-list] RFC: basename, dirname, PR#4549

Hi,

I think the difference will mostly matter for code only that requires
human input of paths, whether in a prompt or through a configuration
file, and even there it would be rather unlikely to encounter such
paths.  Big deal, users can change their input easily.  Having done my
fair share of path mangling, I guess most applications that generate
paths internally only, e.g. to walk through a directory hierarchy, are
safe.  It would seem highly unusual that anybody added an extra slash
in code accessing files within a program.  I personally prefer
standard conformance.

Regards,
Markus
