Sylvain has worked with me to enable auto-installation of oasis-db 
packages via odb[2].  There's not a large repo of packages[1], but most 
of it is auto-installable (run odb to get a list), as long as you have 
ocaml and findlib to start from.  The dependencies are automatically 
handled and installed from source.  I even have confirmation that it 
works under windows, although it definitely needs cygwin there.

The repo could use some love with people uploading[3] new packages to 
it.  Just provide a tarball and optionally a link to the tarball on some 
other website.  Oasis dependencies are detected automatically, packages 
w/o an _oasis file need to have deps specified manually.  Odb is able to 
install findlib-enabled projects that use ([./configure &&] make && make 
install), (omake && omake install) and oasis' setup.ml for building. 
This last option is able to execute whatever sequence of configure, make 
and install commands are needed for your project, without replacing the 
current infrastructure.

Files uploaded to the repo are available with odb --unstable, they have 
to be manually approved to become part of the default --testing.  I hope 
that in time, the --stable option can become default.  Odb also installs 
by default to ~/.odb/lib.  --sudo tells it to use sudo for global 
install, --have-perms tells it to install to the global repo without 
sudo.  If anyone wants to auto-detect permissions on the ocamlfind 
global, we can get rid of --have-perms.

I'm on #ocaml most of the time, and will get back to you if I'm away. 
Tell me how things work or don't.
