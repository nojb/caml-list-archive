Well, package management for scripting languages is way easier. You can
especially do some of the management at load time. If, for example, a
symbol is missing because a predecessor is too old, there is generally
the possibility to work around by providing an alternate definition, and
to resolve this within the scripting environment.

A statically typed compiler language like Ocaml is more difficult,
because you can do these kinds of fixups only at build time. Part of
this is that you need to recompile all successors of a package if you
upgrade the package.

The question includes the answer. Do you really want to support five
different package types?

Not yet, but this is certainly not impossible with a to-be-written
package converter.

So far, there has been nobody who investigated this in detail.
(Actually, I'm a bit surprised that none of the OS packagers had the
idea yet - this could save a lot of time for them.)
