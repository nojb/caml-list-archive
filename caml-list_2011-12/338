Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Re: how could the community help with Oasis-DB;
 towards a CPAN for OCaml?

I tried to use Oasis on one of my projects. I got stuck at the very
begining. I am on MacOS, there is no binary installer, and no
instructions for MacOS users. It told me a bunch of dependencies were
unsatisfied when I tried to compile. It would be useful to write a
line or two about how to satisfy all the dependecies, for example:

"If you are compiling Oasis from source, it is easiest to satisfy all
the dependencies by installing them via GODI" (if that's even true).

Even better: provide a binary installer for MacOS.

With kind regards,

Andrej
