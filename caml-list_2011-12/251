Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Some comments on recent discussions

good points. an alternative would be a wiki page describing step by
step and in detail, how to set up an ocaml development environment on
windows, particularly how to get ocamlfind and manual package
installation working. my friend couldn't manage to get Batteries
working either, even after he gave up on GODI, and i didn't know
enough to help. it's a bit frustrating for me because i don't have or
use windows either, but if i develop an end user app i really want it
to be as cross-platform as possible.
