I'm pretty sure you mean "core development team", not INRIA.  INRIA is a 
large research institute, you know. And as I said, the "core development 
team" is not limited to members of INRIA.  It may very well be the case 
that no one in this team care about ARM (honestly, I don't know), and if 
this is the case, I agree this should be fixed.

Yes, I argue for opening the current model a little, by enlarging the 
existing core team. Creating a new "core team" would create more 
frustration and problems than it would solve, in my opinion.  We have 
enough fragmentation in this community.

I confirm that the best way to contact the core team is caml@inria.fr 
(see http://caml.inria.fr/contact.en.html).
