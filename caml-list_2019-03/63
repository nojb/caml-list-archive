programming languages and software engineering. Authors of papers
published in PACMPL Issue OOPSLA 2019 will present their work at
OOPSLA in Athens.


Papers may target any stage of software development, including
requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation,
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation,
maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may
include the development of new tools (such as language
front-ends, program analyses, and runtime systems), new
techniques (such as methodologies, design processes, and code
organization approaches), new principles (such as formalisms,
proofs, models, and paradigms), and new evaluations (such as
experiments, corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).

Submissions due: Fri 5 Apr, 2019
https://2019.splashcon.org/track/splash-2019-oopsla


## Onward! Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on
everything to do with programming and software: including
processes, methods, languages, communities, and
applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more
open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not
yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about,
approaching, and reporting on programming language and software
engineering research.

Submissions due: Mon 22 April, 2019
https://2019.onward-conference.org/track/onward-2019-papers
(transitioning to https://2019.splashcon.org/track/splash-2019-Onward-paper=
s)


## Onward! Essays

Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of
writing about topics important to the software community. An
essay can be long or short.  An essay can be an exploration of
the topic and its impact, or a story about the circumstances of
its creation; it can present a personal view of what is, explore
a terrain, or lead the reader in an act of discovery; it can be a
philosophical digression or a deep analysis. It can describe a
personal journey, perhaps the one the author took to reach an
understanding of the topic. The subject area=E2=80=94software,
programming, and programming languages=E2=80=94should be interpreted
broadly and can include the relationship of software to human
endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological,
historical, or anthropological underpinnings.

Submissions due: Mon 22 April, 2019

& Experience (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners
interested in techniques and tools for code generation, language
implementation, and metaprogramming.  GPCE seeks conceptual,
theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics
of interest, which include but are not limited to (i) program
transformation, staging, macro systems, preprocessors, program
synthesis, and code-recommendation systems, (ii) domain-specific
languages, language embedding, language design, and language
workbenches, (iii) feature-oriented programming, domain
engineering, and feature interactions, (iv) applications and
properties of code generation, language implementation, and
product-line development.

Submissions due: Fri 21 Jun, 2019
https://conf.researchr.org/home/gpce-2019


## Software Language Engineering (SLE)

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the discipline of
engineering languages and their tools required for the creation
of software. It abstracts from the differences between
programming languages, modelling languages, and other software
languages, and emphasizes the engineering facet of the creation
of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific
methods and practices that enable the best results. SLE 2019
solicits high quality contributions in areas ranging from
theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools, techniques,
and frameworks in the domain of software language engineering.

Abstracts due: Fri 14 Jun, 2019
Submissions due: Fri 21 Jun, 2019
https://conf.researchr.org/home/sle-2019


## Managed Programming Languages and Runtimes (MPLR)

The International Conference on Managed Programming Languages &
Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang) is a premier forum for
presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed
programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as
building blocks for some of the most important computing systems
around, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems)
to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and
anything in between (mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

Submissions due: Mon July 8, 2019
https://conf.researchr.org/home/mplr-2019


## SPLASH-E

SPLASH-E is a track focused on education-related challenges,
