The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international forum for
researchers with interests in all aspects of functional programming, taking a broad
view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment
for presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see below at scope).

Please be aware that TFP uses two distinct rounds of submissions (see below at submission
details).

TFP 2019 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming events. TFP 2019
will be accompanied by the International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming
in Education (TFPIE), which will take place on June 11.


== Scope ==

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes. As part of
the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following five article
categories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:

     Research Articles:
         Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
     Position Articles:
         On what new trends should or should not be
     Project Articles:
         Descriptions of recently started new projects
     Evaluation Articles:
         What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
     Overview Articles:
         Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication to any
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: theoretical,
implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming
techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

     Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
     Functional programming in the cloud
     High performance functional computing
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
     Dependently typed functional programming
     Validation and verification of functional programs
     Debugging and profiling for functional languages
     Functional programming in different application areas:
     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
     systems, global computing, grids, etc.
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages
     Novel memory management techniques
     Program analysis and transformation techniques
     Empirical performance studies
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
     (Embedded) domain specific languages
     New implementation strategies
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, please contact
the TFP 2019 program chairs, William J. Bowman and Ron Garcia.


== Best Paper Awards ==

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper accepted for
the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging that
students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student paper is one
for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students
are listed as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for the
best student paper is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best paper happens
to be a student paper, that paper will then receive both prizes.


== Instructions to Author ==

Papers must be submitted at:

     https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2019

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally reviewed either
before or after the Symposium.


== Pre-symposium formal review ==

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted before an early
deadline and receive their reviews and notification of acceptance for both presentation
and publication before the symposium. A paper that has been rejected in this process may
still be accepted for presentation at the symposium, but will not be considered for the
post-symposium formal review.


== Post-symposium formal review ==

Papers submitted for post-symposium review (draft papers) will receive minimal reviews and
notification of acceptance for presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will
be invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback received at the symposium. A
post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these articles for formal
publication.


== Paper categories ==

There are two types of submission, each of which can be submitted either for pre-symposium
or post-symposium review:

     Extended abstracts. Extended abstracts are 4 to 10 pages in length.
     Full papers.        Full papers are up to 20 pages in length.

Each submission also belongs to a category:
     research
     position
     project
     evaluation
     overview paper

Each submission should clearly indicate to which category it belongs.

Additionally, a draft paper submissionâ€”of either type (extended abstract or full paper) and
any categoryâ€”can be considered a student paper. A student paper is one for which primary
authors are research students and the majority of the work described was carried out by the
students. The submission should indicate that it is a student paper.

Student papers will receive additional feedback from the PC shortly after the symposium has
taken place and before the post-symposium submission deadline. Feedback is only provided for
accepted student papers, i.e., papers submitted for presentation and post-symposium formal
review that are accepted for presentation. If a student paper is rejected for presentation,
then it receives no further feedback and cannot be submitted for post-symposium review.

== Format ==

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more information
about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site (http://www.springer.com/lncs).
