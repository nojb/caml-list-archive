Subject: [Caml-list] 4.08.0+beta2

Dear OCaml users,

The release of OCaml 4.08.0 is approaching. We have created a
second beta version to help you adapt your software to the new
features ahead of the release.

The source code is available at these addresses:

 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.08.0+beta2.tar.gz
 https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.08/ocaml-4.08.0+beta2.tar.gz

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
following commands.

opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.0+beta2 --repositories=3Ddefault,bet=
a=3Dgit+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

or

opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.08.0+beta2+<VARIANT> --repositories=3Dd=
efault,beta=3Dgit+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git
 where you replace <VARIANT> with one of these:
   afl
   default_unsafe_string
   flambda
   fp
   fp+flambda

We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here:
 http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/bug_report_page.php

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.


The changes from beta1 are the following:

- The --enable-flambda configuration option now works correctly
  (beta1 would ignore it).

* GPR#2104, GPR#2211, PR#4127, PR#7709: Fix Thread.sigmask. When
  system threads are loaded, Unix.sigprocmask is now an alias for
  Thread.sigmask. This changes the behavior at least on MacOS, where
  Unix.sigprocmask used to change the masks of all threads.
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan, review by J=C3=A9r=C3=A9mie Dimino)

- GPR#2263: Delete the deprecated Bigarray.*.map_file functions in
  favour of `*_of_genarray (Unix.map_file ...)` functions instead. The
  `Unix.map_file` function was introduced in OCaml 4.06.0 onwards.
  (J=C3=A9r=C3=A9mie Dimino, reviewed by David Allsopp and Anil Madhavapedd=
y)

- GPR#2239: Fix match miscompilation with flambda
  (Leo White, review by Alain Frisch)

- GPR#2223: ocamltest: fix the "bsd" and "not-bsd" built-in actions to
  recognize all BSD variants
  (Damien Doligez, review by S=C3=A9bastien Hinderer and David Allsopp)

- GPR#2264, MPR#7904: the configure script now sets the Unicode handling mo=
de
  under Windows according to the value of the variable WINDOWS_UNICODE_MODE=
. If
  WINDOWS_UNICODE_MODE is "ansi" then it is assumed to be the current code =
page
  encoding. If WINDOWS_UNICODE_MODE is "compatible" or empty or not set at =
all,
  then encoding is UTF-8 with code page fallback.
  (Nicol=C3=A1s Ojeda B=C3=A4r, review by S=C3=A9bastien Hinderer and David=
 Allsopp)

- GPR#2266: ensure Cygwin ports configure with `EXE=3D.exe`, or the compile=
r is
  unable to find the camlheader files (subtle regression of GPR#2139/2041)
  (David Allsopp, report and review by S=C3=A9bastien Hinderer)

- MPR#7918, GPR#1703, GPR#1944, GPR#2213, GPR#2257: Add the module
  Compile_common, which factorizes the common part in Compile and
  Optcompile. This also makes the pipeline more modular.
  (Gabriel Radanne, help from Gabriel Scherer and Valentin
   Gatien-Baron, review by Mark Shinwell and Gabriel Radanne,
   regression spotted by Cl=C3=A9ment Franchini)

- GPR#2160: restore --disable-shared support and ensure testsuite runs corr=
ectly
  when compiled without shared library support.
  (David Allsopp, review by Damien Doligez and S=C3=A9bastien Hinderer)

- GPR#2229: Env: remove prefix_idents cache
  (Thomas Refis, review by Fr=C3=A9d=C3=A9ric Bour and Gabriel Scherer)

- GPR#2231: Env: always freshen persistent signatures before using them
  (Thomas Refis and Leo White, review by Gabriel Radanne)

- MPR#7923, GPR#2259: fix regression in FlexDLL bootstrapped build caused by
  refactoring the root Makefile for Dune in GPR#2093)
  (David Allsopp, report by Marc Lasson)

- MPR#7929, GPR#2261: Subst.signature: call cleanup_types exactly once
  (Thomas Refis, review by Gabriel Scherer and Jacques Garrigue,
  report by Daniel B=C3=BCnzli and Jon Ludlam)
