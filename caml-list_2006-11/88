2nd Workshop on Language-Based Parallel Programming Models (WLPP)

in conjunction with

SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON
PARALLEL PROCESSING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
September 9-12, 2007, Gdansk, Poland,

Workshop Web Site

CALL FOR PAPERS

WLPP 2007 is a full-day workshop to be held at the PPAM 2007 focusing on
high-level programming for parallel and grid computing, with special
emphasis on component architectures and models. Its goal is to bring
together researchers working in the areas of applications, computational
models, language design, compilers, system architecture, and programming
tools to discuss new developments in programming Grids and parallel systems.
The workshop focuses on OpenMP, Unified Parallel C (UPC) and Co-Array
FORTRAN (CAF) language-based programming models, contributions on other
high-level programming models and supportive environments for parallel and
distributed systems are equally welcome.

This workshop will feature papers that explore experiences from application
developers in the use of the language and performance of real applications,
experiences in the implementation of tools supporting the development and
parallelization of applications or supporting the final execution on
different computing platforms. We also welcome experiences in moving ideas
and concepts from one programming model to another.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to,

· Language and library implementations.
· Proposals for, and evaluation of, language extensions.
· Applications development experiences.
· Comparisons between programming models.
· Benchmark Suites and performance studies.
· Debuggers and performance analysis tools.
· Compiler Implementation and Optimization.
· Optimization Techniques.
· Hybrid Models (OpenMP-MPI etc.)

Please submit full papers (formatted according to the PPAM specification),
not previously published or submitted for publication elsewhere by e-mail to
the workshop chair (address below). Include a cover page with the title,
abstract, names as well as e-mail and physical addresses of the authors as
well. Please submit postscript files, preferably viewable by ghostview or
pdf-files.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Paper due   April 30, 2007
