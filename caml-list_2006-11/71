Hello,

I'd like to write an assembler, to be able to understand how the vm really=
=20
works. I've to work on this for a school project (a compiler, I want it to=
=20
output caml bytecode object files).

I've understood that the data part, after the code itself, was generated us=
ing=20
output_value (I didn't know this function before).  What I don't get now ar=
e=20
the cu_reloc, cu_primitives and cu_imports fields of the compilation_unit=20
type.

If you can help on this,
Thanks
P.E. Meunier
