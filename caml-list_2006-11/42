I just did a quick scan of some F# docs and I saw nothing. What did you have in
mind?

For almost any given language feature, there will be people who like it, and
people who don't. Do you think having class based OO in OCaml is a good idea?
I find it useful, especially since OCaml records are far too restrictive, but
I hope that in some future ML that there are other approaches as the
class/object system is complex, and the interactions with "core ML + modules"
is tricky.

That said, the class system is being used and it won't go away, and some
people really like it.

Did you consider GCaml style generic functions?
