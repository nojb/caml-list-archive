     'Which  department issued this passport?' asked the cat. There was no
answer.
     'Department four hundred and twenty,' said the  cat to itself, drawing
its paw across the  passport  which  it was holding upside-down.  ' Well, of

attend the funeral,'  went on the cat in an official voice. ' Kindly go home
at once.' And it shouted towards the door : ' Azazello! '
