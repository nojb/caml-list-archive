Actually, in our LibMojave (which is what OMake uses) we have bindings for:
 - FAM
 - Gamin (using either the generic FAM interface, or taking advantage of
Gamin extensions)
 - kqueue (FreeBSD, OS X)
 - inotify (Linux)
 - ??? (Win32) - not sure what exactly is used there

In all five cases, we provide the _same_ fam-style interface on the
OCaml side. We also have OMake autoconf-style scripts that can detect
which of the fours notification mechanisms is present on a specific
machine and use the appropriate one.

That might be true, but only if you happen to be on a machine that
provides inotify. We do utilize inotify if it is present, but we also
have an option of using one of the other four when there is no inotify.
