Hi,

I'm trying to decrypt .cmo files produced by simple programs, such as
1+1;;
or
print_string "string";;
or
List.length [1;2;3;4;5];;

According to the source of Ocaml, there's something called the 
"cmo_magic_number", systematically written at the beginning of all .cmo 
files. Does it have a real function for executing the programs, or is it just 
a way to make sure the file contains ocaml bytecode ?

Then, there's the address of what seems to be the last bytecode instruction.
Then, the bytecode instructions, as documented in opcodes.ml.

After that, I can't understand anything : there vaguely seems to be some 
information related to linking or so... What is the precise structure of this 
part ? Is there some kind of a bytecode assembler ?

Thanks,
P.E. Meunier (pierreetienne.meunier@ens-lyon.fr)
