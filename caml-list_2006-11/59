Here is what I tried:

# open Printf;;
# let x = 1234.5678;;
val x : float = 1234.5678

(* Just for fun *)
# printf "%.2f %.*f" x 3 x;;
1234.57 1234.568- : unit = ()

(* I understand that the following should print "1234.57 1234.57": *)
# printf "%.2f %.*1$f" x x;;
Bad conversion %1, at char number 5 in format string ``%.2f %.*1$f''
