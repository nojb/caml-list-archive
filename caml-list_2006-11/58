I take a different reading to you Martin, although I think it is 
confusing.  I believe that the number specified before the dollar sign 
is the argument that specifies the /precision/ of the output.

So, it is not to specify the argument to print, but the argument to use 
as precision.  That said, I tried it in the context they suggest and I 
couldn't make it work!

Ermine: do you have a situation where this is important?  I can't think 
of any situation that comes to mind.

Peter.
