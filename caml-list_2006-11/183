Maybe it's because I know the standard syntax quite well.
Or maybe because there are some things that are too weird in the revised 
syntax, like lists stuff.

Like that :

OCaml		Revised
x::y::z::t	[x::[y::[z::t]]]
x::y::z::t	[x; y; z :: t]

=> It's too weird for me.

The reversed notation for types : I don't like it either.
(maybe just because I'm not used to that)

In declaration of a concrete type, brackets must enclose the constructor 
declarations:
OCaml	Revised
type t = A of i | B;;	type t = [ A of i | B ];
Why is it so much better to add brackets? To me they are useless...
Do they really make things clearer for some people?

Well, I am not going to say all I like and all I don't.
Of course there things that are potentially "better", like parenthesis 
around tuples. But I prefer not having to put them systematically.
There are good ideas in the revised syntax, but it doesn't fit my tastes 8-)
