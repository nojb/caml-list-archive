You can solve this one by setting up symbolic links before profiling
your program.

You can solve this one by copying or renaming the dump files
between the runs of your programs.  I agree this is inconvenient.

Not really.  What to do when two source files are compiled
with different values for this option?

What I will implement is an environment variable, to specify
the name of the dump file used when profiling.  Then you just
have to set it before running your programs.
