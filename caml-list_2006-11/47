We use Bigarray to map geographical data.  It works.  As far as I'm
aware ArrayX.map_file is really just a wrapper around mmap, and read
accesses are just indirections on a pointer.

Depends a lot on what format your data is in.  Ours is stored as a
huge array of 16-bit signed ints and Bigarray supports that naturally.
If your data was in an unsupported format, or if it wasn't strictly an
array, you might end up doing contortions.
