Hello,

If you look closer, you can see that the book is about the version 2.04.

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/book-ora009.html

With OCaml 2.04, you don't have those warnings because they hadn't 
appeared yet.

         Objective Caml version 2.04

# "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+";;
- : string = "[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+"

You can probably avoid warnings by backslashing your backslashes...

Still I believe the OCaml Team should find another way to express 
regular expressions, because if \. and \\. both mean \\. then it is a 
very bad idea...

Well, enjoy OCaml :-)

PS : I hardly understand what I'm supposed to do to post in this 
mailing-list, so you have probably not received this one before, but 
maybe you already have...
(I hope this time it'll work...)
