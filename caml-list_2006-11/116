              1st IEEE & IFIP International Symposium on
             Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering

                  June 6 - 8, 2007, Shanghai, China
                 http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/TASE2007/

                             Call For Papers
                 Submission Deadline: January 5, 2007
         For more information e-mail: jifeng@sei.ecnu.edu.cn

The 1st IEEE & IFIP Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering
Conference (TASE 2007), sponsored by IFIP and IEEE, will be held in
Shanghai, China June 2007.

Large scale software systems and Internet are of growing concern to
academia and industry. This poses new challenges to the various
aspects of software engineering, for instance, the reliability of
software development, Web-oriented software architecture and Aspect
& Object-orientation techniques. As a result, new concepts and
methodologies are required to enhance the development of software
engineering from theoretical aspects. TASE 2007 is a forum for
researchers from academia, industry and government to present ideas,
results, and ongoing research on theoretical advances in Software
Engineering.


Topics of Interest:
Authors are invited to submit manuscripts of original unpublished
research in all theoretical areas of software engineering
(Requirements, Specification, Testing, Workflows, Architectures,
Verification, Languages, and Logics). The topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:
* Requirements Engineering
* Specification and Validation
* Software Testing
* Component-based Development
* Model Checking for Software
* Software Processes and Workflows
* Software Frameworks and Middleware
* Software Architectures and Design
* Software safety and reliability
* Reverse Engineering and Software Maintenance
* Aspect and Objected –orientation Techniques
* Embedded and Real-time Software
* Service-oriented Computing and Web Services
* Model-driven Development
* Coordination and Feature Interaction
* Parallel and Distributed Computing
* Logics of Programs
* Program Analysis
* Semantics and Design of Programming Languages
* Type Theory


Submission Guidelines:
Authors should submit and register their paper through our
web-interface at: http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/TASE07/submit by
January 5, 2007(Web interface will be accessible after December
1, 2006). Submissions must not have been published or be concurrently
considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be
reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. They
will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the
field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the
conference. The proceedings of the conference will be published by
the IEEE Computer Society Press. Papers must be written in English
and not exceed 10 pages in IEEE format. Instructions for authors are
available at http://computer.org/cspress/instruct.htm. Latex
document classes can be downloaded from the website at
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/.
