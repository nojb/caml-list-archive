For some experiments here at AEP, we'd like to install OCaml on our AIX 5.2
server.  There is an "OCaml for AIX" advertised on the Camel Hump, but the
server linked there appears to be defunct.  Also the only email address
that I have (or INRIA has) for the developer, Christoph Bauer, also is
defunct.

Does anyone know how to get "OCaml for AIX," or does anyone know how to
contact Christoph Bauer?
