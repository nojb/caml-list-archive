Well, this comparison point certainly helped to persuade Microsoft

Yes and no, though the topic often comes up.  Currently, operators are
overloaded through a statically-resolved version of Ada-style trait
constraints, which works well enough in practice.

Haskell-style type classes or the proposed default parameters for Scala
are other possible design points. These are a little less compelling
when you can't redesign the whole .NET library design to take advantage
of the feature, but still potentially worthwhile.

Best wishes,
Don

As a mostly Java programmer now, I have to say I'm a bit envious. C#
generics
look a lot better to me than the Java 5 ones.

What I didn't notice while looking at the F# docs was a way to declare
a generic function/value, where by "generic" here I mean in the
GCaml/CLOS
sense, not the Java/Ada sense. Is something like that in F#, or planned?
