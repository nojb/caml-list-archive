Yes, originally I didn't intend to write a SOAP server, I just wanted to 
use one - so I looked around for SOAP and OCaml and found OC-SOAP. I 
then thought I might be able to extend OC-SOAP, but in the end I chose 
to map from OCaml types to a schema rather than from schema to an OCaml 
types. For the server side this made more sense, and is nice, in a 
way... SOSS and OC-SOAP complement each other well.

I may soon add a client feature to SOSS, but it will never work with a 
generic SOAP service, since it will be generated from the OCaml server 
side interface file - rather than the more public WSDL. It would only 
provide a solution for an OCaml client with OCaml server where the 
developers of each are in close contact with each other. For myself 
though, I only wanted to develop a server side application in OCaml and 
develop a client in another language - which is why I haven't added this 
feature yet, though most of the glue is, by default, already written.

I think I may have already read in a message somewhere that you 
recommended CDuce after using it for OC-SOAP, but if anyone else is 
reading this that is interested in manipulating XML in an OCaml 
application, I found OCamlduce to be very clear, concise and expressive. 
I was very impressed.
