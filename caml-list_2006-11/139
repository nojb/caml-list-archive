If a book comes from the heart it will contrive to reach other hearts. All art and author craft are of small account to that.
Without wisdom, knowledge is either useless or destructive.Those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly.All that makes existence valuable to any one depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people.
