Hi,

I'd like to announce that I've released a SOAP server for OCaml.

It's available at http://www.caterpillarjones.org/soss

An overview follows below, but I should mention two things,
one: it's still alpha code, I have not used it extensively yet, and
two: it makes extensive use of OCamlduce, which may be of
interest to some people here.

I hope some people find it of use.

Thanks,
Stefan Lampe

SOSS is an implementation of a SOAP server for OCaml.

It is designed to allow a service, developed in OCaml, to be made available
as a SOAP service with minimal effort.

It's features include:
   It can serve the service through HTTP or TCP
   It has the option of restricting service functions to sequential access,
      providing protection to services that are not thread safe.
      Alternatively, multi threaded access is just as possible
   RPC style or wrapped document style SOAP messages
   A generation utility to allow, from the service interface, automatic
   generation of:
      Interface routines
      Message schema
      WSDL 1.1
      WSDL 2.0 (tentative support)

It is possible to write a series of service functions in pure OCaml without
regard to SOAP and, from the interface file for the service automatically
generate all that is required to reveal the service as a SOAP service
through HTTP or TCP.

It is not, however, a completely general SOAP server. It's goal is as 
above,
to define an OCaml service and reveal it as a SOAP service. As such it
provides no support for more general SOAP features, such as SOAP with
attachments.
