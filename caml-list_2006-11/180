Maybe if regexps are taken to first class values (at least in the 
syntax, whatever what is done behind...), like in Perl, then it'll be 
easily usable. Well, I will look with more attention to micmatch, maybe 
it's actually really easy to handle it.

I will think about it when I have time for that.

In deed, you're probably right. Still I hope not.

That's really hard :-D

I like the OCaml syntax very much (I must be crazy :-D)
(but definitely not the one of "Camlp4 Chapter 6 : The Revised syntax")
