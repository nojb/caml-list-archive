Subject: Re: [Caml-list] beginners or not (Was: build problem with 3.12.0; no ocamlrun in /usr/local/bin)

Hi,

> admin interface.

Just curious: is there someone who would be interested in the former
without also being interested in the latter?  Moreover, since the total
traffic of even the three combined sub-topics (beginners, using OCaml,
improving OCaml) is relatively low, it strikes me as unnecessarily
burdensome for users to maintain membership in yet another separate list.
Finally, it seems that many of the questions typical of absolute beginners
have found their way into Stack Overflow.  That should ease some of the
concerns of subscribers only to the caml-list about being confronted with
"silly" questions should the beginners list be merged into the caml-list.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
