Subject: [Caml-list] ICFP Programming Contest starting in two weeks

This is a reminder that the ICFP Programming Contest 2011 will be
starting in two weeks.  See:
http://www.icfpcontest.org/2011/05/contest-announcement.html

Participants would need to prepare some virtual (or physical) machine
running Debian squeeze.  See:
http://www.icfpcontest.org/2011/05/judges-machine-and-system-environment.html
 (You would only need an environment compatible with the guest, not
the host.  There exists various virtual machine software such as
VirtualBox and VMware Player.)

We look forward to your participation!
