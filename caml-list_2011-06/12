Subject: [Caml-list] [CFP] International Workshop on Rigorous Protocol Engineering
 (WRiPE 2011)

This workshop is examining pragmatic approaches to building correct
Internet protocols, which I hope will be of interest to OCaml hackers.

--
1st International Workshop on Rigorous Protocol Engineering (WRiPE 2011)

Co-located with the 19th IEEE International Conference on Network
Protocols (ICNP 2011), Vancouver, Canada, on October 17th 2011.
http://wripe11.cis.upenn.edu/

WRiPE is an inter-disciplinary workshop that will bring together
researchers from the networking, formal methods and programming
languages communities.  ICNP started nearly twenty years ago as a
conference focused on the application of formal methods to the
design and analysis of protocols primarily from the telecommunication
space. This initial focus on formal methods has diminished over the
years as ICNP has shifted towards research on Internet protocols.
The aim of WRiPE is to reinvigorate and revitalize the application
of formal methods to the design and analysis of network protocols.

We think the time is ripe for this type of workshop because (1)
verification techniques have matured greatly in the last few decades,
(2) verification tools such as model checkers, theorem provers, and
SAT/SMT solvers have attracted a sizable user base, and (3) such
techniques and tools have not traditionally been applied to network
protocols (in particular IP, which is now the dominant networking
technology).

By network protocols, we include traditional IP routing protocols,
wireless multi-hop routing, BGP policies, transport protocols,
application-layer overlay networks, and enterprise and data center
networks. These may also include security extensions to these
protocols, e.g. IPSec and Secure BGP, as well as protocols developed
using emerging software router platforms such as OpenFlow. By
verification technique, we mean any rigorous method of demonstrating
that an implementations satisfies a given specification, or that
reliable conclusions can be extracted from measurements.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
 * Correct-by-Construction methods: meta-model frameworks (logics,
   algebras, calculi, etc.) for Internet protocols
 * Applications of model checkers, theorem provers, and SAT/SMT solvers to
   Internet protocol design.
 * Domain specific languages (declarative, functional, or logic-based)
   that raise the level of abstraction in Internet protocol development.
 * Formal-methods based techniques for run-time verification and testing
   of Internet protocols.
 * Combining model checking and theorem proving for verifying
   Internet protocols.
 * Model finding techniques for network configuration.

Submission guidelines

Paper submission will not be blind. The submissions will indicate
the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Please do
not submit abbreviated versions of journal or conference papers.
In particular, submissions to WRiPE must not be concurrent with a
substantially similar submission to a conference or workshop,
including condensed versions of work that has been submitted and
is currently under review. We do encourage submissions of
work-in-progress based on novel and interesting ideas.  Submitted
papers must be no longer than six (6) pages in double-column format
with standard margins (i.e., at least one inch all around) and at
least a 10 point font. This length includes everything: figures,
tables, references, appendices and so forth. Longer submissions
will not be reviewed. Papers should include a title; full list of
authors, their organizations and email addresses; and an abstract
of fewer than 200 words.

Important Dates
 * Submission deadline for papers      June 20, 2011.
 * Notification to authors             July 30, 2011.
 * Camera ready due                    Aug 20, 2011.
 * Workshop date                       Oct 17, 2011.
