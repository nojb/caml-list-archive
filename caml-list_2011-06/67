Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml on iPhone/iPad Simulator

I've been working for a while with OCaml on iOS devices (iPhone and
iPad).  Just recently I've also gotten OCaml working on the iOS
Simulator.  This is an easy way to try out OCaml on iOS, as you just
need Apple's free (or inexpensive) development tools, Xcode.  You
don't need a device, or to register as an iOS developer.  I've put
sources and binaries for everything on our website.

For those interested, here are some links:

    [How to make OCaml 3.12.0 generate code for iOS Simulator][1]
    [Amusing sample app named Gamut that runs in the Simulator][2]
    [General page of OCaml-on-iOS resources][3]

[1]: http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iossim.html
[2]: http://psellos.com/ocaml/example-app-gamut.html
[3]: http://psellos.com/ocaml/index.html

Compiling and running under the iOS Simulator works with all recent
Xcode versions (3 and 4).  However, you currently need to use Xcode
3 to build a 32-bit OCaml compiler (Mantis bug # 5268).

OCaml on iPhone is working in production (we sell an iPhone app).  I'm
finding that the iOS Simulator is a pretty nice development environment.
For most things it's a lot quicker than testing on an actual device.

I'd be happy to hear from anybody interested in OCaml on iOS.
