******************************************************


The World Congress on Sustainable Technologies (WCST-2011)
is a multidisciplinary congress, bridging efforts across the
natural, social and engineering sciences, the environment and
development of communities. The congress covers a wide spectrum
of topics that relate to sustainability, which includes technical
and non-technical research areas. It also encourages sharing
new knowledge in the field of sustainable technologies and the
environmental impacts.

The mission of WCST-2011 is to provide the opportunities for
collaboration and reflection that have the potential to greatly
enhance the infrastructure and capacity for conducting and applying
art, science and technology for sustainability. The WCST bridges
the gap between academia and industry by creating awareness of
current development in sustainable technologies.
