First you'll have to know what kind of values accumulate in the heap. If
they are custom blocks, then you'll have a pointer in the block pointing
to a structure that identifies the kind of values (as a general rule).
If it's a problem in the binding, then looking closely at custom blocks
is likely a good idea.

Do not know about muddy, but it may be a good idea to tweak parameters
in alloc_custom in order to force garbage collection often. If the
problem goes away, I'd recommend reading closely about alloc_custom,
look at how it is implemented, and modify muddy.c accordingly.

Anyhow, for such GC problems, I'd recommend using ocamlviz.

Good read on the topic:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/pdf/chap9.pdf

In the marking phase of Mark & Sweep, gray cells are marked cells whose
descendents are not yet marked.
