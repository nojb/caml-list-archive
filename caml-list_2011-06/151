Not really. This is a practical exam. 3h and a half facing a computer, with a set of problems to solve, with huge 
inputs. Hence the need for performance.

Here, Dijkstra's algorithm is only going to be a step in the process of solving a more elaborate problem. Not having a 
priority queue readily available means that I am going to have to waste some time reimplementing an efficient structure.

The Set option covers some cases (and it does work in the case of Dijkstra) ; but in other cases it won't work :/
