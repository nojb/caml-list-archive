Subject: [Caml-list] invitation to submit to workshop on Virtual Machines and Intermediate
 Languages (VMIL)



Dear Colleagues:

It gives us great pleasure to invite you to submit your
contributions to **the fifth international workshop on
Virtual Machines and Intermediate Languages (VMIL 2011)**,
which will be co-located with SPLASH 2011.

This workshop is a forum for research in virtual machines
(VM) and intermediate languages (IL). It is dedicated to
identifying programming mechanisms and constructs that are
currently realized as code transformations or implemented in
libraries but should rather be supported at VM and IL level.
------------------------------------------------------------
**Invited Talks**
In the tradition of past VMIL workshops, the 2011 edition
will feature high-quality, on-topic invited talks. Speakers
and titles will be announced later.
------------------------------------------------------------
**Due Dates**
Papers for VMIL are due Aug 8, 2011. Abstract submission is
not required but recommended until August 1, 2011. Notification
of acceptance will be on Sep 1, 2011.
------------------------------------------------------------
**Program Committee**
We have once again assembled an excellent program committee
which consists of: Steve Blackburn (Chair), Cliff Click,
David Grove, Kim Hazelwood, Antony Hosking, Doug Lea, Ben
Titzer, and Olivier Zendra.
------------------------------------------------------------

For more details please see:

We look forward to your submissions to VMIL 2011.

Best regards,
Hridesh Rajan, Christoph Bockisch, Michael Haupt and Robert
Dyer
