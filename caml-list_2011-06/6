 Computing Systems (IDCS 2011)

[Apologies for multiple copies.]

*******************************************************
The 4th International Workshop on
Internet and Distributed Computing Systems (IDCS 2011)
in conjunction with
ICA3PP'11, October 24-26, 2011, Melbourne, Australia
*******************************************************

IDCS’11 workshop is the fourth one in its series to promote research
in diverse fields related to Internet and Distributed Computing
Systems. The emergence of Web as a ubiquitous platform for innovations
has laid the foundation for the rapid growth of the Internet.
Side-by-side, the use of mobile and wireless devices such as PDA,
laptop, and cell phones for accessing the Internet has paved the ways
for related technologies to flourish through recent developments. In
addition, the popularity of sensor networks is promoting better
integration of the digital world with physical environment. In this
workshop, we are interested in receiving innovative papers on emerging
technologies related to Internet and distributed systems to support
the effective design and efficient implementation of high-performance
computer networks. The target audience includes researchers and
industry practitioners those are interested in different aspects of
the Internet and distributed systems, with a
 particular focus on the practical experiences with the design and
implementation of related technologies as well as their theoretical
perspectives.
