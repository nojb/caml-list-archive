Subject: [Caml-list] ocamldoc changes the names of polymorphic types

Hi everyone,
I used particular names for some polymorphic types in my .mli files but these
names were replaced with default names by ocamldoc in the documentation.
E.g.:
.mli:
type ('dom,'tf) manager = {
  bot : 'dom; 
  ...
}

.html:
type ('a, 'b) manager = {
	bot : 'a;
	...
}

Is there any way to force ocamldoc to keep the names given in the documentation
?
If it is not the case I think it would be a good thing because it could make
the documentation more readable.

Regards,

Vincent
