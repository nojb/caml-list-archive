Great stuff, thanks!

Any chance you can specify a license for the cheatsheets? At present,
they only say "(C) ..." meaning that one can do very little with them,
e.g. printing them for persona use and little more.  An interesting
usage pattern which is forbidden in present form is distributing them to
students of a university class which on OCaml.

It would be great if you could attach a liberal license to the PDFs.
Even better would be if you could release (.tex?) sources. I'm sure that
would turn most of the feedback received via this list into useful
patches :-)

Thanks again,
Cheers.
