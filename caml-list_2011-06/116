Yes, especially when they are so separated, subscribing to yahoo mailing
list is just not pleasant (frankly speaking I've not managed yet).
Beginners should be able to learn from more advanced users at zero
cost. Helping them is much easier when the posts arrive on one ML
instead of two, they would also have an access to the announcements
about new releases of the compiler and it's libraries. Bigger traffic is
better in this case (obviously to some limit, but I doubt we would have
this problem), it encourages people to join the discussions. If it's
only a historical reason to have yahoo based group and separate advanced
mailing list, then I admit I would like to see these two mailing list
merged. I think it's important in the days where OCaml is getting more
popular and having new people on the list is actually beneficial in long
term for OCaml community.
