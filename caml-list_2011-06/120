Ha! :D
I was looking for that mailing list at INRIA, so I had no chance of finding it!
Well, I gave up in less than 1 minute, so I didn't waste too much time.
It feels a bit like "beginners are not worth having a mailing list @INRIA". :-(

I believe that discussions about types that less than 1% of all ocaml
programmers understand, recursive functors (for these it must be even
worse), GC tweaking, etc. is "hacking".
I don't think it's harmful to have such discussions in the standard
mailing list.
But I think it's harmful that the standard mailing list gives priority
to such discussions rather than to beginners, even if I kind of prefer
the current situation for practical reasons.

However, I understand that some people don't want to have too many
beginners questions in their mailbox.
But it kind of also reflects that our community is not really willing
to grow (am I wrong? I hope so.).

I believe that would be good.
