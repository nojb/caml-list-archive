Subject: [Caml-list] Vim syntax file for 3.12 features

Hi,

Has someone tweaked Vim's syntax files for OCaml so that they support
3.12's first-class-modules?  (The syntax highlighting of any code using
this feature is just plain wrong at the moment).

On a related note, it's my understanding that a large percentage (most?)
of the OCaml community uses Emacs.  Without meaning to start an editor
flamewar, I would like to know the opinion of those who've edited OCaml
under both Emacs and Vim: is the former's support so much better that
it's worth the effort to learn Emacs?

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
