Subject: [Caml-list] CFP PEPM12: Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation


ACM SIGPLAN 2012 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
January 23-24, 2012. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA (co-located with POPL'12)

Call For Papers

http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM12

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners working in the broad area of principled program transformation,
which spans from refactoring, partial evaluation, supercompilation, fusion and
other metaprogramming to model-driven development, program analyses including
termination, inductive programming, program generation and applications of
machine learning and probabilistic search. PEPM focuses on techniques,
supporting theory, tools, and applications of the analysis and manipulation of
programs. Each technique or tool of program manipulation should have a clear,
although perhaps informal, statement of desired properties, along with an
argument how these properties could be achieved.

Topics of interest for PEPM'12 include, but are not limited to:

 - Program and model manipulation techniques such as:
   supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program 
   adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, 
   symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

 - Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
   manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination
   checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, 
   automated testing and test case generation.

 - Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
   metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
   languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged
   computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.

 - Application of the above techniques including case studies of
   program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
   projects and software development processes,  descriptions of
   robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
   benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy
   program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, 
   visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, 
   middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and 
   web-based applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will
continue the category of `short papers' for tool demonstrations and
for presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of
interesting academic, industrial and open-source applications that are
new or unfamiliar.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to
help cover travel expenses and other support.

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal proceedings
published by ACM Press. In addition to printed proceedings, accepted papers
will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Selected papers may later on be
invited for a journal special issue dedicated to PEPM'12.

The SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM's Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism
apply.

Submission Categories and Guidelines

Authors are strongly encouraged to consult the advice for authoring research
papers and tool papers before submitting. The PC Chairs welcome any inquiries
about the authoring advice.

Regular research papers must not exceed 10 pages in ACM Proceedings style.
Short papers are up to 4 pages in ACM Proceedings style. Authors of tool
demonstration proposals are expected to present a live demonstration of the
described tool at the workshop (tool papers should include an additional
appendix of up to 6 extra pages giving the outline, screenshots, examples, etc.
to indicate the content of the proposed live demo at the workshop).

Important Dates

 - Paper submission: Mon, October 10, 2011, 23:59, GMT
 - Author notification: Tue, November 8, 2011

 - Workshop: Mon-Tue, January 23-24, 2012
