Exactly, I think in that way as well. (in case if it's shortest path
problem).

And if one does not need performance but understanding what's the purpose of
the priority queue is,
what is the interface, and how it should behave, than implementation as a
list is sufficient. Please note
it is for exam and major pressure is put on Dijkstra not on implementation
or performance (as far as I
understood) of the priority queue. (which can be changed later easily)
