Subject: [Caml-list] ocaml async communications

Hi there,

I've implemented basic asynchronous communications in ocamlmpi. It's in the
svn version. I'd be glad if fellow ocaml parallel programmers took a look
and tested it out. Suggestions welcome, also, let me know if there is an API
call you need urgently. The objective is to complete all the missing stuff
from MPI-1 standard, eventually. It's incredibly comfortable to use the
generic interfaces of ocamlmpi. Compared to C, it's a breeze. This addition
was quite helpful in my research code, I could easily program my own
all-to-all-personalized communication function :) And as you know, for
achieving communication/computation overlap this is the best way to proceed,
which I haven't exploited in my new parallel information retrieval
application yet, but I did verify that the async. calls worked.

Regards,
