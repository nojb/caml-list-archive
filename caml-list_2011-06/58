APLAS 2011 Call For Papers

Ninth Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
Kenting, Taiwan, December 5--7, 2011
(co-located with CPP 2011)

http://flolac.iis.sinica.edu.tw/aplas11/
==========================================================

BACKGROUND:
APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by 
providing a forum for the presentation of latest results and 
the exchange of ideas in topics concerned with programming 
languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia, but is an 
international forum that serves the worldwide programming 
language community.

APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of 
Software (AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with 
many researchers from Europe and the USA. The past APLAS symposiums 
were successfully held in Shanghai ('10), Seoul ('09), 
Bangalore ('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), 
Taipei ('04) and Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops.
Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in
Springer-Verlag's LNCS 6461, 5904, 5356, 4807, 4279, 3780, 3302, 
and 2895.

The 2011 edition will be held at Kenting, a seaside resort in 
Southern Taiwan.


TOPICS:
The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical 
issues in programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited 
on, but not limited to, the following topics:

+ semantics, logics, foundational theory;
+ design of languages and foundational calculi;
+ type systems;
+ compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
+ program derivation and transformation;
+ program analysis, verification, model-checking, software security;
+ concurrency, constraints, domain-specific languages;
+ tools for programming, verification, implementation. 

APLAS 2011 is not limited to topics discussed in previous
symposiums. Papers identifying future directions of 
programming and those addressing the rapid changes of the 
underlying computing platforms are especially welcome. 
Demonstration of systems and tools in the scope of APLAS are 
welcome to the System and Tool presentations category. 
Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are
welcome to consult with Program Chair prior to submission.


IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract Deadline (new): June 17, 2011 (23:59 GMT)
Submission Deadline (new): June 21, 2011 (23:59 GMT)
Notification: August 29, 2011
Camera-Ready: September 19, 2011

INVITED SPEAKERS:
Nikolaj Bjorner, Microsoft Research Redmond
Ranjit Jhala, UC San Diego
Peter O'Hearn, Queen Mary U. London
Sriram Rajamani, Microsoft Research India

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
We solicit submissions in two categories:

Regular research papers, describing original research results,
including tool development and case studies, from a perspective of
scientific research. Regular research papers should not exceed 16
pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and
figures. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and
why it is significant. Submissions will be judged on the basis of
significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. In
case of lack of space, proofs, experimental results, or any
information supporting the technical results of the paper could be
provided as Appendix or a link to a web page.

System and Tool presentations, describing systems or tools that
support theory, program construction, reasoning, and/or program
execution in the scope of APLAS. Unlike presentations of regular
research papers, presentation of accepted papers in this category is
expected to be centered around a demonstration. The paper and the
demonstration should identify the novelties of the tools and use
motivating examples. System and Tool papers should not
exceed 8 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and
figures. Submissions will be judged based on both the papers and the
systems or tools as described in the papers. It is highly desirable
that the tools are available on the web.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page
at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2011. Acceptable
formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or Acrobat
Reader. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. The
proceedings are planned to be published as a volume in
Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference.

            The First International Conference on
           Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2011)
                    FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

                   http://formes.asia/cpp

               (co-located with APLAS 2011)


CPP is a new international forum on theoretical and practical topics
in all areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education,
that consider certification as an essential paradigm for their work.
Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some sort,
preferably with production of independently checkable certificates.
We invite submissions on topics that fit under this rubric.

Suggested, but not exclusive, specific topics of interest for
submissions include: certified or certifying programming, compilation,
linking, OS kernels, runtime systems, and security monitors; program
logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code; certified
decision procedures, mathematical libraries, and mathematical
theorems; proof assistants and proof theory; new languages and tools
for certified programming; program analysis, program verification, and
proof-carrying code; certified secure protocols and transactions;
certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra,
polynomial systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;
certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality,
first-order logic, and higher-order unification; certificates for
program termination; logics for certifying concurrent and distributed
programs; higher-order logics, logical systems, separation logics, and
logics for security; and teaching mathematics and computer science
with proof assistants.

INVITED SPEAKERS:

* Andrew Appel (Princeton University)
* Nikolaj Bj=C3=B8rner (Microsoft Research)
* Peter O'Hearn (Queen Mary, University of London)
* Vladimir Voevodsky (Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University)

IMPORTANT DATES:

Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract
before submitting the full paper.  The submission should include when
necessary a url where to find the formal development assessing the
essential aspects of the work.  All submissions will be
electronic. All deadlines are at midnight (GMT).

  Abstract Deadline:           Monday, June 17, 2011 (new)
  Paper Submission Deadline:   Friday, June 21, 2011 (new)
  Author Notification:         Monday, August 29, 2011

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:=20

Papers should be submitted electronically online via the conference
submission web page at URL:=20

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcpp2011

Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or
Acrobat Reader. Submissions should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format,
including bibliography and figures.  Submitted papers will be judged
on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and
clarity. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and
why it is significant. The proceedings of the symposium will=20
be published as a volume in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.=20

Each submission must be written in English and provide sufficient
detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the
paper.  It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a
summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their
significance and relevance to the conference, all phrased for the
non-specialist.  Technical and formal developments directed to the
specialist should follow.  Whenever appropriate, the submission should
come along with a formal development, using whatever prover, e.g.,
Agda, Coq, Elf, HOL, HOL-Light, Isabelle, Matita, Mizar, NQTHM, PVS,
Vampire, etc. References and comparisons with related work should be
included.  Papers not conforming to the above requirements concerning
format and length may be rejected without further consideration.

The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere, including the proceedings of other published conferences or
workshops.  The PC chairs should be informed of closely related work
submitted to a conference or journal in advance of
submission. Original formal proofs of known results in mathematics or
computer science are among the targets.  One author of each accepted
paper is expected to present it at the conference.

AWARD FOR BEST PAPER:

An award will be given for the best accepted paper, as judged by the
program committee.  The committee may decline to make the award or split=20
it among several papers.
