Impressive formatting. I can't imagine the dreadful time you've spent
checking each description to make sure it doesn't overflow the column width.

Some small remark:
First, I find the organization  of the "Standard Library" one a bit
surprising; maybe ordering modules alphabetically would be better.
More importantly, I'm a bit disappointed by the "OCaml Standard Tools" one.
They don't mention ocamlbuild and ocamlfind which I use much more often and
would, I think, be more appropriate on a cheat sheet that relatively arcane
options of the compiler (which I don't think I could use from this cheat
sheet anyway, each time I touch -custom I need to re-read the documentation
in full). Of course ocamlfind is not part of the base distribution, but I
still think it is a "standard" tool.
Stretching it a bit, I don't use ocamlyacc anymore, as I found menhir [1] to
be a better replacement for all purposes. That's the one I would have chosen
for a cheatsheet -- but I understand the value of describing a tool included
in every OCaml installation.

Thanks for the work.
