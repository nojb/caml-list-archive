This should not happen - the expected behavior is that the connection is
closed.

That should be controlled by number_of_parallel_connections.

No idea. Do you have a sample program demonstrating the effect?

Also, in ocamlnet-3.3.1 (released on Friday) large parts of the
Http_client were rewritten. Maybe your bug goes away by simply
upgrading.
