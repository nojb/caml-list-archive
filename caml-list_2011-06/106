Subject: Re: [Caml-list] build problem with 3.12.0; no ocamlrun in /usr/local/bin

Thanks Andrew, that is good to know.  I had looked on the ocaml web 
page, but didn't think to look in the usual repositories.

Incidentally, with the kind help of Matthieu Dubuget, my problem has 
been solved.  It was rather embarassing: I forgot to do "make install".

All is well.   Thanks everyone!
