Subject: [Caml-list] TYPES 2011 in Bergen 8 - 11 Sept: Deadline for abstracts 19 June

                        Types Meeting 2011
                  Bergen, 8 - 11 September 2011

                       http://www.types.name

The 18-th Workshop "Types for Proofs and Programs" will take place
in Bergen, Norway from 8 to 11 September 2011. CSL'11 will take place
in Bergen from 12 to 15 September: http://www.eacsl.org/csl11

The Types Meeting is a forum to present new and on-going work in all
aspects of type theory and its applications, especially in formalized
and computer assisted reasoning and computer programming.

Invited speakers:

    * Georges Gonthier, Cambridge
    * Dag Normann, Oslo
    * Vladimir Voevodsky, Princeton

We encourage all researchers to contribute talks on subjects related
to the Types area of interest. These include, but are not limited to:

- Foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics;
- Applications of type theory;
- Dependently typed programming;
- Industrial uses of type theory technology;
- Meta-theoretic studies of type systems;
 -Proof-assistants and proof technology;
- Automation in computer-assisted reasoning;
- Links between type theory and functional programming;
- Formalizing mathematics using type theory.

The talks may be based on newly published papers, work submitted for
publication, but also work-in-progress. There are no formal
pre-proceedings. More details on http://www.types.name

Deadline for abstracts: June 19
Submission site: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=typespre2011
