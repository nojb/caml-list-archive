Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 3.12.1 Release Candidate

Dear OCaml users,

The release of OCaml version 3.12.1 is imminent.  We have
created a release candidate for your testing pleasure.  Please
download the sources, compile, install, and test your favourite
software with it.  Then let me know what happened, one way or
the other.

We want to know about any show-stopping bugs, especially in the
compilation and installation phases.

This release candidate is available as source code at this
address: < http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.12/ >

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.
