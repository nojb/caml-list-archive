Subject: [Caml-list] build problem with 3.12.0; no ocamlrun in /usr/local/bin

Hi, I'm a new user of ocaml, and having some difficulties that are probably due
to my own ignorance.   Namely, ocamlrun doesn't seem to get produced when I
compile the code.

I've downloaded and tried to compile ocaml 3.12.0 on a 64-bit linux system
(Fedora 14, kernel 2.6.35.6-45.fc14.x86_64).	make world and make bootstrap
seem to work fine; here's the last bit of output from 'make bootstrap'.

make compare
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/ocaml-3.12.0'
Fixpoint reached, bootstrap succeeded.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/ocaml-3.12.0'

However, if I type 'ocaml', I get this response: 
bash: /usr/local/bin/ocaml: /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun: bad interpreter: No such
file or directory

This is no surprise, because only ocaml and ocamlc are installed in
/usr/local/bin.  As far as I can tell, ocamlrun is never created, nor are many
of the executable files listed in the INSTALL document, ocamlrun, ocamlyacc,
ocamllex, etc.

The output from 'configure' says these should be installed in /usr/local/bin: 

Directories where Objective Caml will be installed:
	binaries.................. /usr/local/bin
	standard library.......... /usr/local/lib/ocaml
	manual pages.............. /usr/local/man (with extension .1)

Can anyone help me?  I have to say I can't quite figure out what to try next.  
Thanks for your help.
