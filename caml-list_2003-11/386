I find most of it fairly easy to understand (although I haven't tried to
modify it).  Just looking at the definitions of the types for the various
representations is very enlightening.

It's actually called C--...did you know that already?

Look in the asmcomp and testasmcomp directories if you didn't already...

The license might be an issue in actually using the code in a compiler
for another language, though.
