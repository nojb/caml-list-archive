This is not a criticism of OCaml, but the executables do tend to be
quite large. This seems mainly down to the fact that OCaml links the
runtime library in statically. There was previous discussion on this
list about the merits and problems with linking the runtime
dynamically.

Of course you can always use OCaml as a scripting language (ie.  tiny
"executables" preceeded by #!/usr/bin/ocaml), or distribute the
bytecode, which tends to be small, so you have more choices than the
languages you've listed above.
