What I did was just skipping the Unix.close, but close *both* in- and
out-channels and it worked (until now ;-) ).

Yup, I've seen this one already.  This one makes it complicated, since
for propagating the exception, I have to duplicate the closings:

    .
    .
    .
  with         =20
  End_of_file -> output_string oc (line ^ "\n");
  Found line -> (close_out oc; close_in ic; raise Found line);
  close_out oc;
  close_in ic

Since I am new to streams & co, are there any kind of rules when to
prefer streams to normal I/O?  Is there more overhead when using
streams?  Shouldn't I use streams when working on a regular text file?

What if I want to break from a stream with an exception (as above the
Found exception)?  Closing/accessing the channel is only possible in the
stream creation as in my corrected version:

let read_lines ch =3D
  let read_new_line n =3D
    try Some (input_line ch)
    with End_of_file -> close_in ch; None in
  Stream.from read_new_line

Now I want to stop reading lines after a certain number of lines

let rec read_n_lines n =3D
  parser
  [< 'line; rest >] -> if n <> 0 then print_endline line; read_n_lines
(n-1) else ()
  [< >] -> ()

Didn't type-check it, though ;-)  Anyway, how can I close the stream in
this case?

Thanks!
