It is not documented, mostly because the documentation doesn't introduce
the notions needed to talk about sharing, pointers, and liveness of
data.  It would be nice to do it, in order to give some precise
specification of (==), weak pointers, and finalisation.  But it is
a large amount of work, as the corresponding theoretical work doesn't
exist (as far as I know), and we should carefully avoid over-specifying.

Definitely not.  Weak pointers are erased first, and finalisation
functions are called afterward.  When the finalisation function is
called, it really has the only existing pointer to the value.
