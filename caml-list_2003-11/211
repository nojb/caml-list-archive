Hmm, you're right.

I had confused myself, I guess, by absorbing the widespread use of "C
runtime" to mean MSVCRT.DLL (or libc.so, or whatever).

OK.  Getting back to the original question again (how to reduce data to be
transferred over the network), both O'Caml and C statically link this
runtime stuff, right?  So, why is O'Caml's "hello world" (compressed) 45k,
to C's 1 or 2k?  Is that 43k the garbage collector?  Or is it mostly that
O'Caml, in contrast to C, is linking in a bunch of stuff from its standard
library that isn't strictly required for "hello world"?  Or something else
again??

Hope I'm not going round in circles here...
