I think in academia you can say these things. But on the sprawling
real projects, badly managed, written by poorly skilled programmers,
checked exceptions are a really bad idea. (Trust me on this one, I've
worked on several such projects).

I don't agree with his point of view on strong typing .. but then he's
coming from a Java background, so what do you expect?

HOWEVER, if I don't have to write .mli files (ie. if I don't have to
tediously define what all my functions throw), then guess what: I
think checked exceptions, infered automatically by the compiler, could
actually be a really GOOD idea. But it looks like this would require a
major change to the language - ie. getting rid of .mli files
altogether and adding the 'public' / 'abstract' keywords to the .ml
files as described by, I think, Brian Hurt in another thread.
