Did you forget to include the word "mainstream"?

Python and Ruby are hardly scripting languages, even though they are
often used as such.  I think they could be decent general purpose
programming languages except for a few unfortunate design decisions
(such as scoping rules).

Not just that, the OO hype is a huge factor.  Faced with advocates who
claim that subclassing is all you need and other language features
are undesirable, it takes a while for inexperienced programmers - even
smart ones - to become disillusioned and take the time to learn
something different...

It's difficult for programming languages to be judged on merit.  People
who are reasonably unbiased and know enough to be able to make informed
comparisons aren't likely to consider any language or paradigm the
"one true way".  But not many people listen to advocates who don't claim
that their solution is perfect.

I'm fairly sure nobody on this list would claim that OCaml is above all
other languages for every possible purpose.

However, does anyone consider OCaml the best existing language for a
particular use?  Or just the most convenient implementation of the
features needed?
