There is an inherent tension between large projects and writing a tool
like gnatmake: large projects are not entirely written in OCaml, or any
other single language. 

While it is possible to write a tool that is smart about OCaml, it can't
know about about all the other tools you are using to generate
documentation, or to generate OCaml code from some specification
language. A make replacement therefore must be language-neutral. You
still could write a tool that handles recompilation of pure OCaml
projects but you would have to use it from a language-neutral make
replacement in truly large projects.

Ocamldep is a simple example for such a tool: it is smart about OCaml
but it emits Make syntax and does not try to solve the problem that Make
can solve better.
