                      PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Third International Conference on
       Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE'04)

                     Vancouver, October 24-28, 2004
                       co-located with OOPSLA 2004

                          http://gpce04.gpce.org
----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------
Scope
------------------------------------

Generative and component approaches have the potential to revolutionize 
software development in a similar way as automation and components 
revolutionized manufacturing. Generative Programming (developing 
programs that synthesize other programs), Component Engineering (raising
the level of modularization and analysis in application design), and 
Domain-Specific Languages (elevating program specifications to compact 
domain-specific notations that are easier to write and maintain) are key
technologies for automating program development.

GPCE arose as a joint conference, merging the prior conference on 
Generative and Component-Based Software Engineering (GCSE) and the 
Workshop on Semantics, Applications, and Implementation of Program 
Generation (SAIG). The goal of GPCE is to provide a meeting place for 
researchers and practitioners interested in cutting edge approaches to 
software development. We aim to foster further cross-fertilization 
between the software engineering research community on the one hand, and
the programming languages community on the other, in addition to 
supporting the original research goals of both the GCSE and the SAIG 
communities. We seek papers both in software engineering and in
programming languages, and especially those that bridge the gap and are
accessible to both communities at the same time.

------------------------------------
Topics of Interest
------------------------------------

The conference solicits submissions related (but not limited) to:

   +ACo Generative programming
      o Reuse, meta-programming, partial evaluation, multi-stage and 
        multi-level languages, step-wise refinement
      o Semantics, type systems, symbolic computation, linking and 
        explicit substitution, in-lining and macros, templates, 
        program transformation
      o Runtime code generation, compilation, active libraries, 
        synthesis from specifications, development methods, generation 
        of non-code artifacts, formal methods, reflection
   +ACo Generative techniques for
      o Product lines and architectures
      o Embedded systems
      o Model-driven architecture
   +ACo Component-based software engineering
      o Reuse, distributed platforms, distributed systems, evolution, 
        analysis and design patterns, development methods, formal
methods
   +ACo Integration of generative and component-based approaches
   +ACo Domain engineering and domain analysis
      o Domain-specific languages (DSLs) including visual and UML-based
DSLs
   +ACo Separation of concerns
      o Aspect-oriented programming, feature-oriented programming,
      o Intentional programming, and multi-dimensional separation of
concerns
   +ACo Industrial applications

Reports on applications of these techniques to real-world problems are 
especially encouraged, as are submissions that relate ideas and concepts
from several of these topics, or bridge the gap between theory and
practice. 
The program committee is happy to advise on the appropriateness of a 
particular subject.
