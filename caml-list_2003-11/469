Saying "older" is wrong not because it just compiles too often, but
because it also doesn't compile things it should.  Think of someone
moving files around without changing timestamps, and then putting the
old files back.  Normal make won't recompile them.

It is better to comile when you shouldn't than it is to not compile when
you need to.

And compiling ocaml isn't always fast.  The code I'm working on doesn't
compile the ocaml code any faster than the C code.
