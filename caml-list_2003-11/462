Older is incorrect, as well.  The program should run cc on the .c
provided that the .c is different than the one used to produce the .o.
Timestamps are useful as a cache, but a proper tool will need to use
file hashes, or something to properly detect a file changing.

An unrelated annoyance I've found is that ocamlc doesn't allow for the
objects to be stored in a separate directory from this source.  This
makes things, such as multiple configurations, multiple targets
difficult.  Since ocamlopt doesn't currently support cross compilation,
anyway, this is less of an issue.
