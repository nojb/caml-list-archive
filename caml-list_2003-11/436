Ok i have read your mail but i need time to understand all what is lying
in it.

I don't want to reproduce make bugs... I just want to do something
simple where you can type :

let my_prog = {
	name : "my_prog";
	compile_target : [Opt;Byte];
	toplevel_files : [ "my_prog.ml" ;
	"something_ocamldep_dont_recognize_as_toplevel.ml" ];
	package : "all_my_life" ;
	target_tag : Binary; ( or Documentation or Custom of string )
	}

let _ =
	add_target my_prog

Ie, it is not makefile syntax.

But, i don't really have begin my project... So i can't already said
that i will use this or that...

Kind regard
Sylvain LE GALL

ps : if you are interested, i will contact you when i will consider
enough mature to begin with this huge task ( in fact, i have made a kind
of start with the findlib branch of cameleon, but i am not finished ).
