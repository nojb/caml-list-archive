	This doesn't really solve my problem, I still have to know what the 
type was at some point.  Thanks for the help, though.

	It is good news that your print_bool and mine look identical, though 
(well, you have a space I don't have).  I must be understanding 
something here.  :)

	What I was hoping to do here was print out the termios structure from 
tcgetattr without having to create separate print functions for the 
boolean types, int types, and char types.  It just means I've got to 
pay slightly closer attention.

	Thanks again.
