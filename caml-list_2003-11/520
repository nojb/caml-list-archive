Is there a place to discuss omake?

Specifically, my question: is there something like the GNU Make 'shell'
function?  What I'm trying to do is use the output of 'ocamlc -where' in
a variable.  I need to run extract_crc as part of my build, and ocamlc
-where is a nice portable way of finding this directory.

Thanks,
Dave
