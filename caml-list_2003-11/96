Well, quite easily. I was getting segfaults in one program I wrote
because in the C part I'd accidentally used 'return' instead of the
'CAMLreturn' macro.

The way to diagnose these sorts of problems is to add regular calls to
`Gc.full_major ()' into your program. If the program crashes while
making these calls, then you can be fairly sure it's a GC-related
memory allocation problem. Look at the stack trace - it should give
you some clues.
