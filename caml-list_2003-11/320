The single change the programmer would have to make in this case is to add 
a new error case that is not being handled.  In which case the compiler is 
being nice and telling you all the places where you need to think about 
how to handle this new error case.

The biggest problems I see is that there are a number of places in Ocaml 
where the programmer still has to spell out the types of things- .mli 
files being the obvious example.
