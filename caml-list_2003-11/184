Ocaml uses at least some of these libraries itself (although not via
printf- I was wrong about that).  So, to be fair, you need to statically
link them into Ocaml binary as well- increasing it's size by half a
megabyte or so as well.

As a side note, I just finished downloading a ~10M compressed program 
(Adobe Acrobat reader) over a 56K baud modem.  Took about 45 minutes or 
so.  Modems teach you to be patient.  If not, I'll trot out long winded, 
boring stores about how as a kid I was forced to use a 300 baud modem to 
connect to the internet, through fourteen feet of snow, up hill, both 
ways!  :-)
