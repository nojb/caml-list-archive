	If anyone's interested, this made it all work:

#define raise(a) kill(getpid(), a)

	My application is working beautifully natively compiled on SunOS 4.1.4 
(sun4c).  This includes a few libs I made as well as the zlib interface 
from ocamlplot.sourceforge.net (which meant I had to port bzip2 as 
well).

	I'm very happy with it.  If anyone wants bins, let me know.
