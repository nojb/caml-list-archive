Actually there are two (at least) ways of doing this:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocurl/

which is an OCaml wrapper around the Curl library.

Or, you could use some Perl-fu with:

http://www.merjis.com/developers/perl4caml/

which includes a wrapper around the Perl LWP and HTML::TreeBuilder
libraries, so you could not only download the page, but also parse it
into an HTML tree (the HTML::TreeBuilder parser is about the best
parser ever written for parsing fuzzy, incorrect HTML, and there's
really no way you would want reinvent this in OCaml).
