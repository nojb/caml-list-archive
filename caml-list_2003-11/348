Yes, all well and good, but I *do not* want have to go and change all
.mli files to support checked exceptions, and then go and change them
all again when I decide to put a SQL database behind some persistence
library deep in the code.

This is the problem with checked exceptions in Java: the set of
exceptions that can be thrown is an implementation detail which is
exposed unnecessarily through the API.
