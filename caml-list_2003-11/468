That's true doing a hashing is nice for C, but ocaml compilation is fast
enough so maybe the time difference between making the hash and compiling is
not so big. Another issue is storing the hashing in a temp file, while you
can compare directly time stamps of the object with the source. Actually the
only case were hashing is useful compare to timestamps is when a file is
only touched ( am I wrong ? ). This is not an average case, and when it's
happening juste compiling only this file (without a bunch of .h) seems fast
enough.
