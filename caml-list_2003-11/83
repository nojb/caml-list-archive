Benjamin Pierce did a nice talk at ICFP a couple of years ago about
sophisticated module systems, examining where (or if) they are really
needed.  The slides are at

http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/modules-icfp.ps

This is not exactly on target for your point about ease-of-use, but it's
related.
