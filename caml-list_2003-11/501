It's called 3.07pl2 and has been available since Oct 20 at the usual
place (http://caml.inria.fr/).  (It is identical to 3.07 + patch 2,
for those who have applied the patch, but the tarball and binary
distributions were updated.)

That exception is caught and re-raised (for finalization purposes), so
you're just seeing the finalization point.  If you really want to
pinpoint the location of the error, either go back in time using
ocamldebug, or just run ocamlc outside ocamldebug with the "stack
backtrace" option set (OCAMLRUNPARAM=b).

> Now what?

What about sending some code to reproduce the problem to caml@inria.fr?
Or even better submit a bug report to caml-bugs@inria.fr with a URL to
the repro case?  (Remember: shouting "I have a bug!" on this list
accomplishes nothing beyond venting some steam.)
The repro case doesn't have to be small, all what is needed is that
it reproduces the problem.
