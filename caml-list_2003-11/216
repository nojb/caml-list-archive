Well, maybe not: 45k is very far from huge even for a puny modem, after
all, and a worthwhile factor of ten improvement over the smallest Python
"hello world" I've seen.  (though that 45k doesn't include decompression
for initial unzipping, so the comparison I make there isn't quite correct)

Thanks for everybody's responses.
