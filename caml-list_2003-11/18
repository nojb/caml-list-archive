Depends on what you mean by "interface".  The _specification_ of 
Obj.magic
depends on many implementation choices of the compiler and runtime.

... or a change in the data representations used by the compiler and
runtime.

Not true.  We can make changes that break many uses of Obj.magic without
changing the language or the type system.  That's why Obj.magic is not
documented.
