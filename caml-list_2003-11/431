My turn to beg to differ. I won't give any
rationale, or advocate anything .. 

lets just say I'm a member of WG21 (the C++
ISO Standardisation committee) and they
have a mailing list too...

I won't even give any quotes .. I'm sure
you can use your imagination ..

I find the tinge of religion of strong
typing, proofs of correctness, concepts
of abstract backed by mathematics ..

a welcome relief :-)

today I wrote 3 lines of C++ ..]
