Clocks on computers have a 10ms quantiziation- i.e., they measure 
everything as multiples of 10 milliseconds.  All measurements are accurate 
only up to about +/- 10 milliseconds.  I.e. if times reports that 
something takes 50 milliseconds, it probably takes more than 40 but less 
than 60 milliseconds.

My recommendation if you want to time something that takes less than 
seconds to do, is to do it lots of times.  You want the amount of time 
between two calls to times to be at least seconds, if not tens of seconds 
or minutes.  You then divide the total amount of time taken by the number 
of times the operation was executed, to get the time per execution.  

Is there a wrapper to the clock function kicking around?
