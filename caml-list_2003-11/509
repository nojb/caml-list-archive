I agree.  I don't think there's a workaround for this.

As getting patches and/or commit access to the Ocaml CVS tree is not
easy, I'm thinking of setting up a web page for patches to the official
Ocaml distrubtition.  I think this would be good for several reasons:

1) Anybody can submit then and they can be reviewed by the community.
   This would generate good quality patches.

2) The patches would be online in an easily accessible place when a
   Ocaml CVS committer wants to include them into the official
   distribution.  This could be done before a new Ocaml release,
   although patches should be applied to CVS as soon as possible
   to make the patching easier (less conflicts) and to test the code.

3) All patches would be in one location.

I've got two patches I would want in, the first for fixing this
function naming issue, the second free()ing some memory to avoid
a valgrind warning.

Best,
Blair
