Map depends on keys to be ordered. This in turn requires to allow for a
user-defined order: assume sets as keys that are implemented by
unordered lists. Different lists can represent the same set. Hence, it
must be possible to provide a user-defined order that would treat those
lists as equal. The functor argument of Map contains the compare() which
does just that.
