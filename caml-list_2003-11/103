Nope, unless mod_caml does.

I was about to try this, but decided to nuke my mod_caml build
directory and start fresh, instead.  I had to add

  include Makefile.config

to makefile (not Makefile) to get $(APACHELIBDIR) and the other
configuration variables, but Apache can link this fresh mod_caml
perfectly.  I guess I had some old compiled cruft that was built for
O'Caml 3.06 laying around. :-)

Ah, I wanted to ask about that.  Does Cgi.Template use CamlTemplate?
The documentation for CamlTemplate uses ${...} for variable
interpolation, but Cgi.Template uses ::...::.  OTOH, mod_caml uses
CamlTemplate if it is available.

By the way, I love mod_caml.  I'm using it to write a Wiki engine that
will hopefully be used to serve a Wiki about O'Caml.  My only
complaint so far is that the build process needs more polishing. :-)
