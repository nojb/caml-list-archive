Ah, I wouldn't use the autoconf configuration. It's out of date
(indeed, I've temporarily removed it from the CVS version).

Stick with the basic Makefile and the instructions in INSTALL.

No.

mod_caml links with CamlTemplate if it's available, so it's there for
you to use. CamlTemplate and mod_caml's Cgi.Template are two different
templating systems, and you should use whichever suits your style
best.

Excellent! Agreed. We'll have autoconf working at some point.
