Thanks for the pointer.  My intentions are twofold, first I want to load 
textures in different formats to use with OpenGL (png and jpeg 
specifically).  I also want to develop an image processing program.  I 
started doing it in Ada, but got fed up having to bind to libjpeg, 
libpng, ... write bmp loading code, etc.  I probably would've went on 
with it in Ada, but I wanted to use a functional language for something 
sizeable.
