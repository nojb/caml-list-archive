It looks like the system is missing a GCC support package. On my Debian
system, libgcc_s.so.1 is provided by the 'libgcc1' package, whose
description reads:

  .... a library of internal subroutines that GCC uses to overcome
  shortcomings of particular machines, or special needs for some
  languages.

It's been a few years since I used RedHat, but I remember there being an
equivalent package ... it might have been called 'gcc-lib'. In any case,
I'm pretty sure that package *should* be installed on any development
box. Is it absolutely necessary? That I don't know, but I just grepped
the OCaml source tree for 'gcc_s', and that string doesn't occur, so it
looks like GCC or some associated program decides when that library is
needed.

Maybe somebody with better knowledge of GCC internals can give you a
more definite answer.
