Well, included is a macro language that should (ideally) allow you to 
define things you want. If needed, you can relatively easily extend the 
language of built-in functions as well (which means you have to change 
omake source code, but it gives you access to full OCaml).

Well, does it really have to be written in OCaml?

Note that if one would want to use omake for simple projects, all that 
[s]he would have to learn is couple of macros (which completely hide the 
notions of "target", "dependency", etc) and couple of standard 
variables. E.g, you'd need couple of line for the project:

OCAMLC = ocamlfind ocamlc -package "fileutils"
OCamlProgram(my_prog, X Y Z ...)

Note that the standard macros are not in any way built-in (the way make 
has a big number of built-in rule), they just come from an include file 
(that can be studied and even modified if a small simple project ends up 
growing into a large and complicated one).

Note - if in the example above you do not want to rely on external 
ocamlfind, you could add ocamlfind code to omake, changing the above to

OCAMLINCLUDES += $(ocamlfind fileutils)
OCamlProgram(my_prog, X Y Z ...)
