I design moderately large Java projects for a living, and I think 
checked exceptions are the only thing that forces poorly skilled and 
indifferent programmers to do any error handling at all.  When a 
designer establishes a sensible policy regarding exceptions, checked 
exceptions make it possible to be reasonably confident that (nearly) all 
error conditions are handled in a sane manner.  On a large project, this 
is a precious advantage.

There's nothing worse than using a library without having any idea what 
exceptions it might throw.  It's like playing Russian roulette.
