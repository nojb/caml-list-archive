I definitly thinks that such a thing could use OCamake. As I told before,
adding C bindings compilation might be easy but require some fixes. For
other operations (file rename, copy, auto install, etc... ) we can provide
them in another module. I agree to work on that with you if you want (french
language will help ^^).

That's precisely why I wrote OCamake...

Of course :)
