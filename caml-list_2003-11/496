We've had recently exactly the same problem with libsmbclient (we even posted it here but no one seemed to have noticed it). The only solution we found yet was to modify the source code of libsmbclient to rename the colliding names (string_set and sys_open). But this is clearly not a good solution.

The #define you suggested does not seem to work and I think this is beacause they are not exported in the header files but are in the the .so and therefore visible in the global C namespace. And I'd prefer not to have to use C++ (I think I should be able to do it in C), so I did not try the namspace trick.

That's why, unless someone has a canonical solution to the problem, I think functions with such common names should have their names prefixed.
