Well... depends how you define mainstream I guess.  Plenty of professional
programmers have never heard of functional programming, to say nothing of
O'Caml.  And in terms of raw popularity, it certainly seems very far from
mainstream.  If Google is any judge (it's certainly not perfect, but for
order-of-magnitude it'll do), O'Caml isn't even in the "top 30": even if
you lump in ML and SML and include all the various spellings, Caml doesn't
get even a fifth as many hits for "X programming language" as Scheme.
Scheme itself is hardly considered mainstream by J. Random Hacker, being
roughly a factor of twenty off Java's Google-measured popularity.
