yes, but does the style of reporting have to be exposed
at the type level? if yes, then it probably is not just
an implementation issue. in my experience, getting
error reporting/logging/program-self-monitoring right
for non-toy programs is a hard problem and has serious
ramifications throughout the whole design of the program,
much like concurrency and memory management. the fact that
we have a complicated mechanism (exceptions) to deal with
this suggests that it should never be an afterthough and
relegated to mere implementation details.
