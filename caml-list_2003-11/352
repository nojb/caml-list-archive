	Ooh, this is the key, the compiler doesn't know that that exception 
can't be thrown.  This goes back to exception handling thread from 
earlier, I think.  If the compiler knew the exception wouldn't be 
thrown, then the tail call optimization would be possible.

	Anyway, I think this clears up my confusion, thanks.
