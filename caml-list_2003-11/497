Thanks for answering.

I finally managed to fix my mail client. I haven't been able to get 
anything from the list yesterday..

I am also trying to compile an auto-generated file, but it is rather 
small (140 lines of code). The binary search is probably not the way to 
go, but let me see what happens if I try to increase the stack size...

OK, done that...
ocamlc is presently running with 98% of the cpu and some 70 MB of memory 
footprint. It's almost certainly looping somewhere, allocating it's head 
off...

I am using the Xavier-patch 2 to ocaml-3.07. I'm not ehntusiastic about 
using CVS. Since my company uses ocaml as it's main language for 
developing commercial applications, I'd prefer to have a stable stock 
version. After all the turmoil around 3.07, a stable bugfix release is 
overdue now.

***

Let try to produce a backtrace for the list...

OK, so the standard ocamlc is compiled without debugging info. Let me 
tweak the Makefile, so that I can build a copy of ocamlc with the -g option.

Done that. Here's the command I'm using to run the debugger:
[alex@flyingtuxman anagrafiche]$ ocamldebug 
/opt/ocaml/3.07+2g/bin/ocamlc -I 
/opt/ocaml/3.07/lib/ocaml/site-lib/postgres -I
