Notice that the debian package, which is currently split in ocaml-base
and ocaml, where ocaml-base contains only the ocamlrun executable and
the needed dll.so, and is 400Ko of installed size, will soon be changed
to include a ocaml-interpreter or ocaml-toplevel package, of around 3Mo
installed size, containing the ocaml toplevel and all the .cma/.cmi
needed to run ocaml scripts interactively, without needing to install
the full ocaml package, and all its dependencies.

In this case, you just need to add ocaml-interpreter to the dependency
of the package containing your scripts, and everything will load from
itself when you apt-get it :)))

Naturally this will only work if you run debian, or macos X. Maybe
Cygnus also, but i am not sure.
