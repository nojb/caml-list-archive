I suppose. I bet I have seen some strange quirks which somehow made a thread 
wrapper library in C++ I had written incompatible across linux and solaris. I 
guess I had thought Solaris kernel got it right, but I ended up not having 
understood the reasons, at least not from the user documentation.

Thanks for the info.

I couldn't quite figure out why only one proc. can execute ocaml code yet, but 
I can dig into the documentation :)
