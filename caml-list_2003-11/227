Two choices: either abort the whole program (uncaught exception), or 
ignore it.  Ocaml's life is a little easier, as GC takes place inside the 
single thread of execution.  But I dislike making the language spec 
require that.  

Now, *which* of those two choices is "correct" is a matter for some 
debate.  Myself, I like aborting the whole program.

What I dislike is resource leaks- as plugging the holes manually can often
be tricky.  If I wanted to hand-manage resource deallocation, I'd be
programming in C (well, not quite- but the point is made).
