Sorry I didn't answer earlier, the traffic on caml-list is getting
quite heavy these days.

Because of the way we trigger a minor collection in native code, the
counters will overestimate the number of words allocated by a few words
per minor GC.  Note that it is always an overestimation, and the error
is at most 256 words per collection.

No.  The other fields are accurate.

No.  The error in minor will propagate.

You can repeat your experiment after changing the size of the
minor heap, that will give you a good idea of the error.  The
bigger the heap, the smaller the error, and it converges to
error=3D0 for an infinite heap.

If you're only interested in minor+major-promoted, you don't even
need a Gc.full_major.  A Gc.compact would be if you are timing a
very allocation-intensive program, and even then I doubt it will
make much difference.

Good question.  I don't know the answer.  Maybe you should file this
as a feature wish in the bug tracking system:

Another candidate for the bug tracking system.
