I have a file which is approximately 278,440 lines of text (more specifically, it is the result of doing 'ls -lAR /')

I was trying to write this relatively simple program to analyze it but it seems that End_of_file was thrown very early. 

To test, it, I made a simple function:  

let rec count_lines file n =
    try let str = input_line file in
    count_lines file (n + 1)
    with End_of_file -> Printf.printf "The file is %d\n lines long" n

and ran it with something like:
    let file = open_in "longfile.dat" in
    count_lines file 0

The result was 26187.

count_lines is a stripped-down version of the original function i used to analyze the file. If I used the original, it threw an End_of_file at line 23806. 

I'm running 3.07+2 on FreeBSD 4.9
any suggestions?
