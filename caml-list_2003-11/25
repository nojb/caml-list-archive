I'm using ocaml on Solaris8/x86, and many C libraries, with no
problem.
However, one trouble with this platform is that there are many
possible combinations of C compiler/assembler/linker, depending of how
many GNU tools you are using.
There is also the problem of patches. There are numerous bugs in the
original release of Solaris8/x86, and some concern very essential
things like dynamic loading. Make sure all recommended patches from
Sun are installed.

If you happen to be using Solaris9/x86, I'm afraid it is not tested
yet.
