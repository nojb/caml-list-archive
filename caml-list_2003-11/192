I don't understand what this has to do with what I said in the quote.
Yes, C runtime is present on essentially all systems, but the point is
that C and O'Caml are fundamentally different: with C, you can *ignore*
that runtime, and write a program that simply doesn't use it at all.  Not
so with O'Caml (for perfectly good and sensible reasons).

Also, I'm simply looking for a way to distribute code, not trying to start
a pissing contest between C and O'Caml :-) so I'm not interested in
"evening things up".

Well, I guess they already have, in the sense that O'Caml has a .NET
implementation -- right?  Always assuming that implementation is more than
the publicity stunt that the Python one was, of course...
