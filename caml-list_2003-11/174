	Probably around 800 of my own and whatever the unix library brings.

	I'm happy to say I've never written any code that was intended to run 
under Windows, so I can't answer that question.

	I wasn't aware you could distribute python exes.  That was my point.  
You can for OS X because of the way applications work in OS X, but 
that's quite different from anything I've seen in Windows (which, 
AFAIK, doesn't even ship with python).

	I have to say I'm really surprised by such a strong emphasis on 
executable size.  I've been learning various programming languages 
specifically because I want to create more reliable applications with 
reasonable performance with less effort (both initially and throughout 
the lifetime of the application).
