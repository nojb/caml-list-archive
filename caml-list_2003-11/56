	One thing that really seems to be missing from exception handling is 
the ability to print a stack trace from an exception.  I realize 
there's a flag on the ocamlrun to print stacks for uncaught exceptions, 
but that's not exactly what I'm looking for.  I'd like to be able to 
catch and exception, log it, and continue.

	Similarly, is there a way to print an exception at least like the 
toplevel does?  I can catch any type of exception with the appropriate 
pattern, but I don't see how I can report it without expecting it.
