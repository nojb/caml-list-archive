How can one know? I don't know *every* language :-)

All I can say is -- Ocaml does many things I want
to do very easily, so easily that I have found
no pressing need to learn Haskell, or to write
much code in any other language I do know.

But I'm biased. Ocaml is the only language
I know with strong FP support (I exclude
Python due to lack of static typing).

There are some things I find would be better
if I could bind to C/C++ more easily:
there is a lot of that stuff out there.
But I find the best solution to that is
to design and implement my own language (Felix)
rather than use any existing one. Oh yeah,
the implementation is written largely 
in .. Ocaml .. and quite a bit of the design
is stolen straight from Ocaml I like it so much :-)

Now, one other thing I wanted to play with
was message passing and async processing ..
and JoCaml seemed the best choice .. oh,
that's an Ocaml derivative .. :-)
