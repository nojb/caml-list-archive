Thanks.  From how many lines of source code?

How big is the "hello world" executable?

If you're distributing executables over the internet to people who use
modems (ie., most people ;-), download size is important.

Unfortunately, neither is an option.  I want to distribute single
executables (for Windows, anyway).  Actually, another issue: can O'Caml
generate Windows DLLs?  ISTR some issue about that...

Well, bad reference for what purposes?  I don't care whether there's
bytecode, machine code, or lemon jelly in my .exes, as long as they're
small :-)  And I don't need any speed above what Python provides.

Great.
