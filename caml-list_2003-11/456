True, but his code doesn't actually use the values of the arguments
passed to the C functions.

What is needed is a primitive function which ignores its arguments and
returns a known value. But I don't think there is such a primitive in
the current compiler. (Not as far as I can see by looking at
bytecomp/translcore.ml anyway).
