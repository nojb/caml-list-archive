Thanks for the pointer.  I'd looked at it before and thought it looked
interesting (somebody mentioned it in a comp.lang.python post).

For you, I'm sure.  I'm afraid might make heavy weather of it even so :-(

I've only used COM (when using C++, that is) from MSVC++, and ISTR that
people have said that, for example, using COM from mingw is not easy
unless you know a lot about it (I'm not talking about the language
extensions in MSVC++ -- at least, I don't *think* I am -- but I don't know
what the issues are that cause the alleged problems).
