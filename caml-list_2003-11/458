agreed.

this is a fascinating proposal. i have two immediate questions:

* as someone else pointed out, relying on convergence towards
   fixpoints may be too strong. some build processes may
   never converge, rather they evenually stabilise in some
   "open ball", so you might need some (user supplied) notion
   of "close enough". how do you do that?

* according to [1], a cartesian closed category with fixpoints
   and finite sums is equivalent to the category with one object
   and one arrow. how do you deal with this?
