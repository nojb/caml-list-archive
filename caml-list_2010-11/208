Subject: Is OCaml fast?

I apologize beforehand if this is not the forum to ask.

I am on the fence about whether to learn OCaml or not, and while
reading an article called "Why OCaml"
(http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/Ocaml/why_ocaml.html), I saw
that OCaml was praised for the speed of the executables it generates -
and was referred to, speed-wise, as "second to none", except C and
C++.

However, when I actually went to the Language Shootout page suggested
in the article, I found out that OCaml is not 2nd, it is 13th, behind
languages like Haskell and C#...
(http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php)

Is it just hype, then? Or am I missing something?
