Even back in 2001, Doug Bagley had noted all the things that were
wrong with the tasks on his "The Great Computer Language Shootout".

During autumn 2004, on Brent Fulgham's website, new tasks were added
and old Doug Bagley tasks removed.

By 2005 only 2 tasks remained from that old Doug Bagley website.

By August 2008 none of those old Doug Bagley tasks were measured for
the current benchmarks game.
