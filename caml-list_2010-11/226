Yes I also remember that.
I hope that the new OCaml compilers did not
make OCaml lessperformance by enhancing other features.

And I don't realy think so.

But were the old code-snippets emoved, or what was going on,
that OCaml degraded that much?

 From my experience - normally using ocamlc for most of my OCaml
programs - it's even fast enough with this bytecode.
If it will be not fast enough, I have an option as a joker:
compiling to native code. :)

Doing this is rather psychologically, as I like to have a potential
for enhancement. :)

If you really always need the best performance, of course compiling
to native code will be best choice.
But at lest for my work I have not found out really bottlenecks,
and always was faster than doing things in Perl or Python or so.

Learning OCaml IMHO does make sense in any case. :)

But be aware one big disadvantage: if you have learned Ocaml,
this may absolutely kill your motivation in learning other languages =20
afterwards.So,if you need some other languages for your job, learn =20
them first, and learn OCaml after this, for your pleasure.

But you may never have fun at work then, until your boss allows you to =20
use OCaml.

And this is not a joke, I mean it as I wrote it!

Ciao,
    Oliver
