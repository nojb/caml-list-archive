I spent some time improving OCaml solutions, and most of the time, my
solutions were refused: the organizers don't let you unroll loops, fix
GC parameters, etc. One strength of OCaml is that it runs fairly fast
immediatly, but you can make it run even faster with some tuning,
something that you cannot do with many other languages. Such tuning is
not allowed there, so, it is not a good place for OCaml hackers. If
the organizers had been consistent, they would have forbidden Haskell
programmers from adding strictness in their programs, but then, there
programs would have been 2x slower than OCaml programs.

Well, actually, things might improve in the future, if we manage to
improve the performance of the compiler itself, and have more
"official" libraries. For example, most parallel solutions in OCaml
currently use fork() and sockets for communication. Using an official
shared-memory library, we could directly improve the performances of
many OCaml solutions.
