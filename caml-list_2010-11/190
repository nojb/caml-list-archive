I think it is inconceivable. I doubt facebook will switch to ocaml and =

The problem is how to migrate code to another language smoothly ? You =
can not
stop all development for a month and say "Hey everybody, we are porting
our 10 millions lines of code of PHP to X.". The reason C++ succeeded =
was
because there was a smooth migration path. C code is valid C++ code. You
can incrementally add objects to an existing codebase.

Do we have example of big companies porting their whole codebase to =
another language ?

Apparently they decided to keep PHP and switch from a slow bytecode =
interpreter
to a 2x-faster compiler.

I doubt any user care about how facebook is implemented. Twitter and =
Foursquare run on Scala and
this is not a very popular language.
