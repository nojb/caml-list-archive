Well... (ducks, wears helmet).

Dr Jon Harrop communicated with me directly (two days ago)... and when
I expressed my lack of faith after reading his "Rise and fall of
OCaml" article at
http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/rise-and-fall-of-ocaml.html
, he in fact counter-suggested that F# is now the horse to bet on -
so... what do you guys think?

Over the last couple of days, I've played a lot with ocaml (to be
exact, Linux/ocamlopt, since my interest in the speed of what I make
remains dominant) as well as F# (with Visual Studio 2008). To my
limited understanding, the differences between OCaml and F# are small
- and the benefits of direct access to the .NET ecosystem of libraries
seems to counter the ... uncertain status of OCaml libraries. I just
begun looking into all this, so I could be very wrong, of course - but
I am spoiled rotten with Python's libraries, so not having "batteries
included" in OCaml seemed like quite a problem... until I realized F#
completely covers this.

So, to conclude - what do you guys think about F# ?
