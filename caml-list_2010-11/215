Maybe it is time to join forces and update the shootout for OCaml?

If some people are interested here, I can setup a repository on the forge
to update all this tests. 

If I get 2 people interested, I will setup a VCS repository + project on
the forge, this afternoon. Drop me an email + preferred VCS (among svn,
git, darcs) and your account login on http://forge.ocamlcore.org. I will
take care, when ready, to made this code available in the shootout once
finished.

Sylvain Le Gall
