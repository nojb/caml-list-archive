I've set it to 4M and I think it's worked wonders, the collection time is no
more so significant in gprof output (surprisingly) at least now I can
identify the real bottlenecks! Indeed the 5-instr long fast path is quite
fast. Due to the peculiarities of my code, it didn't result in much speedup
but I've solved this problem, I can't believe I've overlooked the Gc
parameters, I should probably be setting them from within the code. A bit
embarrassed about it actually :)

I've been thinking whether some kind of doubling strategy would work for the
minor heap size. What do you think?

Best,
