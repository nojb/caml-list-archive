Hi,
  The application itself is written in Xcode. You need to be a member of =
the development
program at =A359/$99 or equivalent per year to get access to the signing =
keys if you need
to modify 'extern' functions (native C code of the interpreter)

You don't need anything apart from iTunes to download (using document =
sharing)
source code in .ml files to the iPad and execute in the App

Or you can type in ocaml statements directly into the interpreter for =
example draw_rect 100 100 200 200;;
will draw a box immediately because the default startup open the =
graphics library.

There are some irritations, for example itunes does not allow a document =
with the name .ocamlinit
to be selected for download, so I provide an 'ocamlinit' instead to =
execute if it exists. If it doesn't
exist then the default startup is executed that comes with the App

The built-in keyboard is not ideal for ocaml with its dearth of easily =
accessible symbols. An external
keyboard is recommended if you want to do real work. Another issue is =
the lack of a decent editor
suited to programming - perhaps someone could port chamo to the iPad ?

I envisage a typical program would be developed on the workstation, =
compiled to a .cma file and then
downloaded to the iPad. However I have not tried this route to see if it =
works. you need to make sure the
ocaml version is identical.

There is no dynamic loading allowed - all the standard library that was =
relevant is linked in statically

Regards,

Jonathan
