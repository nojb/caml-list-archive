That summary page 

> > (http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-
> > fastest.php)

shows box plots (quartiles, outliers, median) of the normalized timing
measurements for each of the tasks, for each of the language implementations.

A graph like that shows some of those language implementations are very fast for
some benchmark programs and very slow for others.

To characterize that as "reducing an entire programming language's strengths (or
weaknesses!) to a single number" seems kind-of misleading.

Especially when the question that page answers is stated 3 times - "Which
programming language implementations have the fastest benchmark programs?"
