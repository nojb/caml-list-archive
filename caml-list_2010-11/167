The C files in byterun/ are compiled with and without debug/profiling, =
and the following files are created:
- libasmrun.a  (normal)
- libasmrunp.a (profiling)
- libasmrund.a (debug)

Only the normal and profiling ones are installed by default. You can =
grab the debug version from your ocaml build tree and link against it =
manually, with something like:

$ ocamlopt -output-obj -i foo.o foo.ml=20
$ cc -lasmrund -lm -o foo foo.o

It'd be convenient to have a compiler option to select libasmrund =
without having to go via -output-obj (as "-p" does for profiling); the =
code for this is in asmcomp/asmlink.ml:runtime_lib().
