I personally do not know much of F#. Particularly because I do not =20
have a Windows machine :( We all know here that Jon is very fond of F# =20=

after having been fond of Ocaml for a while.

The socalled "Ocaml mass exodus" mentionned in Jon's article seems to =20=

me as as objective as the language shootout benchmarks ;) In =20
particular the plot I made myself of the posts to the mailing list is =20=

definitely not as clear as the one presented in the article (you can =20
do it yourself from the figures at =
<http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/index.fr.html=20
 >). Jon also mentions (in the comments) the figures from Google =20
Trends about Ocaml vs F# (<http://www.google.co.uk/trends?q=3Df=20
%23%2Cocaml>). But funnily enough, you can see from the excerpts =20
selected by Google that F# deals as much with the language than =20
with... ahem, other stuff. Furthermore the plot was already increasing =20=

before the release of F#, so is this increase really significative? My =20=

whole point here is not that Jon is wrong or right: maybe he is right, =20=

I just say that the supposed exodus does not seem significative to me. =20=

Anyhow I do not "feel" it. I would even say that I feel the contrary =20
(and I am not the only one: see Paolo's comment in Jon's article).

Then Jon suggests in his article that that this is due to the =20
"inability of Ocaml's GC to [deal with parallelism]". Again, all of us =20=

here know that Jon has been quite frustratred with this for a while =20
(and not only him, cf some very recent thread =
<http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2010/11/642bb03b01227d825e=
71b0a46ae7e73f.fr.html=20
 >). However there are also plenty of guys who are not bothered by =20
this (see the very same thread). Choose your camp. On one hand, if you =20=

go to F# you won't have to choose. On the other hand, this does not =20
make F# necessarily faster than Ocaml (as Jon himself proved it: =
<http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/pure-f-now-only-2-slower-than-=
ocaml.html=20
 >).

Of course if you listen to Jon you will be convincend that you should =20=

choose F#. Many people here will probably react by saying that you =20
should choose Ocaml. I am personnally neutral here: in the end, I =20
would say that both languages are great (about F# I should say "look =20
great" since I never tried it). So whatever is your final choice I =20
guess you won't be disappointed.

Cheers,
Vincent

PS: BTW about the complain in Jon's article about the lack of a native =20=

REPL in ocaml, I think this recent post also answers it very partly: =
<http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2010/11/aef35ed6ad039ce80c=
5c66175e80fcc5.fr.html=20
 >. Probably nothing compared, though, to the F# REPL (trusting Jon on =20=

that).=
