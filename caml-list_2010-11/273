I did not say they are equivalent.  It is a matter of what is allowed
(or not) and for what reason.  The question is why is C allowed to use
an external library for managing its memory but — for this specific
benchmark which is precisely about managing memory — OCaml is not
authorized to make use of its very own library!

Note that you did not answer my question.
