I thought you might be interested to know that my new OCAML App for the =
iPad was published
on the iTunes Store yesterday. I believe this is a significant =
achievement given the notorious
reluctance of Apple to embrace languages other than C/obj-C/C++ and I =
would hope it would
promote wider dissemination of type safety.

The real win would be if the new paradigm was accepted for teaching the =
new generation of
students etc, which would require greater acceptance by potential =
employers which is a bit
of a chicken/egg scenario.

Anyway I am inordinately proud of my new publication and if you know =
anybody who has an iPad,
please let them know about it.
