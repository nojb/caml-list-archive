Eighth International Workshop on
Practical Aspects of High-Level Parallel Programming (PAPP 2011)

part of The International Conference on Computational Science
June 1-3, 2011, Tsukuba, Japan

http://www.papp-workshop.org

AIMS AND SCOPE

Computational Science applications are more and more complex to
develop and require more and more computing power. Sequential
computing cannot go further. Major companies in the computing industry
now recognise the urgency of re-orienting an entire industry towards
massively parallel computing.

Parallel and grid computing are solutions to the increasing need for
computing power. The trend is towards the increase of cores in
processors, the number of processors and the need for scalable
computing everywhere. But parallel and distributed programming is
still dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message
passing. Thus high-level approaches should play a key role in the
shift to scalable computing in every computer.

Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages
such as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming,
parallel execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries,
genericity and meta-programming in object-oriented languages,
etc. have produced methods and tools that improve the
price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of
target applications. Also, high level languages offer a high degree of
abstraction which ease the development of complex systems. Moreover,
being based on formal semantics, it is possible to certify the
correctness of critical parts of the applications.

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming: design, implementation and optimisation of high-level
programming languages, semantics of parallel languages, formal
verification, design or certification of libraries, middle-wares and
tools (performance predictors working on high-level parallel/grid
source code, visualisations of abstract behaviour, automatic hot-spot
detectors, high-level GRID resource managers, compilers, automatic
generators, etc.), application of proof assistants to parallel
applications, applications in all fields of computational science,
benchmarks and experiments. Research on high-level grid programming is
particularly relevant as well as domain specific parallel software.

The aim of all these languages and tools is to improve and ease the
development of applications (safety, expressivity, efficiency,
etc.). Thus the PAPP workshop focuses on applications.

The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the
development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing
and computational science researchers who are potential users of these
languages and tools.  Topics

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

     * applications in all fields of high-performance computing
       and visualisation (using high-level tools)
     * high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for
       parallel and grid computing
     * high-level parallel language design, implementation and optimisation
     * practical aspects of computer assisted verification for
       high-level parallel languages
     * modular, object-oriented, functional, logic, constraint
       programming for parallel, distributed and grid computing systems
     * algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries
     * generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic skeletons,
       patterns and high-level parallel libraries
     * benchmarks and experiments using such languages and tools

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the Procedia
Computer Science series, as part of the ICCS proceedings.

Submission must be done through the ICCS website.

We invite you to submit a full paper of at most 10 pages describing
new and original results, no later than January 8, 2011. Submission
implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and
present the paper.

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop.
