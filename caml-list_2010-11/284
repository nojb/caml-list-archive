That was also true of early ML implementations. When I was first taught =
ML at university we used the Cambridge ML interpreter and you actually =
had to sit there and wait for it to solve the 8-queens problem. At the =
time, I thought ML was a complete joke and could see no use for it =
outside its very specific domain of theorem proving and actually really =
resented being taught it on a general CS course. I know better now =
though. ;-)

Later language implementations inherited many of these inefficiencies =
though. Many of the things that can make OCaml and Java slow were =
inherited from Lisp. They are, in effect, designs that still bear the =
burden of dynamic typing despite being statically typed.

Cheers,
Jon.
