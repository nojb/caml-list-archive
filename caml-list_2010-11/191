Joe is 99.9% of world's population, excluding experts in this special =
area.

You can develop web services using probably any programming language =
available in the world. That's what I was about to say, it doesn't =
matter from a technological point of view. So if the programming =
language is irrelevant, but you have to pick one, you'll start looking =
for arguments to prefer one over the other (based on available =
libraries, marketing, etc.). Some argument made Facebook pick PHP =
(instead of Perl, Java, Ruby, C/C++, OCaml, Haskell, Standard ML, =
whatever), probably something trivial like availability of PHP =
developers, or simply because PHP was popular at that time (i.e. there =
were people who knew the term "PHP").

Now the world looks different of course, there are hundreds of millions =
lines of existing code, and really porting all that code to a new =
language would involve a lot of effort, money and time.
