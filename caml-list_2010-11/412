Hello everybody,

I did some final work on OCamlJIT2, and compared the result to OCamlJIT. =
The performance measures are presented in the following tech report =
(skip straight to section 4 for the performance results):

http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.6223

In short: Performance measured on a P4 "Northwood" (no long mode, plain =
x86) 2.4GHz. OCamlJIT2 beats OCamlJIT by a factor of 1.1 to 2.0 in every =
benchmark, and - rather surprising - was even able to beat ocamlopt in =
the number crunching benchmark (probably an issue with the x86 backend =
of ocamlopt).

As mentioned by Xavier Leroy and others previously, we probably went as =
far as we could go in the direction of JITting the byte-code virtual =
machine, while preserving its general stack-based nature and instruction =
set. Moving even further means translating the byte-code to some =
intermediate form suitable for use with standard compilation techniques; =
but as we saw earlier, in an LLVM-based prototype, the compilation =
overhead increases dramatically and the benefit of JIT compilation =
vanishes.

Therefore, as suggested earlier, I'll try to get my hands on the native =
top-level now (already contacted Alain for the emitter code). =
Additionally, the linear scan register allocation will be implemented by =
a student as part of his diploma thesis.

regards,
Benedikt=
