It's not a matter of the technical migration. You simply wouldn't find
enough engineers that can master a "fast well designed typed
language" (assuming here you have the more advanced ones in mind :-) ).
Also, there is the question whether it is the best approach to let the
most talented developers in the company program the user interface, with
day-to-day tasks like "hey Joe, can you please fix this broken link".
(Not that there are also complicated UI's but these are rare.)

At Mylife.com (where I'm currently consulting for) large parts of the
backend are now running in Ocaml, but the web frontend is done by
another team, and there is PHP involved. IMHO, it would be a
misallocation of human resources if we (the Ocaml team) also did the
frontend.

Usually languages are only switched when a completely new project is
started.
