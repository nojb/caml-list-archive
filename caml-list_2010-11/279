I'm not sure which examples you looked at for lablgtk2.
The goals of lablgtk are:
  * be as close as possible to the spirit of Gtk+
  * while providing type and memory safety
  * and allow comfortable use through objects and optional arguments
This resulted in a 2-layer implementation, with a lower layer
that just wraps basic Gtk+ calls, and an object layer on top of it.
Some examples mix the two layers, which may look strange, but
I think that when you use only the upper layer, this is clean enough.
(The lower layer is not dirty, but converting between the two may be
verbose and look clumsy).

The obvious alternative to lablgtk2 is of course labltk.
I personally think that labltk is still the easiest way to build a GUI,
but many do not like Tk's look&feel.

I'm not aware of other GUI toolkits for ocaml, but I think there are also
web-based UIs.
