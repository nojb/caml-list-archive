How they do that ? Are they using compiler frontends to assist them
in automatically translating part of the code to F# ?

OCaml and F# are very similar language, so such porting does not look =
that hard.
Translating from C++ to F#,  or from PHP to Java seems more complicated.
I wonder what kind of techniques people have developed to help such =
language-to-language
translation.
