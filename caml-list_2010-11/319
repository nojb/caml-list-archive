It's a design decision. As the author of LablGTK said above, one of
its goals was to stay as close to possible as the original C API. This
has advantages (easy to transfer knowledge and documentation to the
OCaml side), and disadvantages (you miss on providing a nicer API that
would be possible with a more expressive language).

In the end the LablGTK API is only a bit nicer than the C API, so the
GUI part of a LablGTK program would be similar to the equivalent C
version. Unfortunately if you want a higher-level GUI library, I don't
see any viable alternative in OCaml right now.
