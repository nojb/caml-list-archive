I remember one argument on that topic, many years ago,
maybe rom Xavier leoy or other core developers, and it goes like that:

Benchmarks on such small problem solving is ONE comparision, what  
makes sense, but it must be added by comparisions of "optimizations"  
of the code in large applications.

The lower the level of the Ã¶anguage the harder it is to keep track of
possible optimizations on a very big program.

But the higher the language level is, the easier it is to
keep that in mind.

So: when optmizing small snippets of code this helps optimizing  
performance in maybe critical sections, but to get an overview on all  
interdependencies is close to unmanagable with lower leveled languages.



I have not seen a comparison of performance in this repect,
but I also would think higher level languages might be a better choice here.


Any comparisions on that scale of programming, which you know of?

Then please throw in a link here.

Thanks.

Ciao,
    Oliver
