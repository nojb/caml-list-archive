I think, this totally off-topic. But anyway, when a program create a
temporary files it needs to remove ASAP, itself. I wouldn't 
deliver a program with a notice like "sometimes FD leaked, not a
problem, just remove $TMP/myprogram-*". 

For the little story, the leaked FD (hence the temporary files) was
400MB each and it quickly get noticed after a few run (and a full HD).
