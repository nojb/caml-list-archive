But if it were not performant enough, I (and many others too, I think)
would consider it being a nice toy language.

AFAIK in the past, functional langauges were not adapted, because they were
very unperformant - at least this is one reason.
Another reason might be, that the available functional languages in the past
were overloaded with parenthess ;)
