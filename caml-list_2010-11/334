Aw, come on - the suspense is worse than the crime thriller I'm reading at =
the moment!

Here, given the UK's austerity measures as applied to my imagination, is a =
logical rather than imaginative argument.

If a great deal of thought has been given to the benchmarks game (and I can=
 well believe that it has) then it stands to reason that someone, hopefully=
 you, knows the reasoning (justification is perhaps too strong or personal =
a word) behind the various rules and so could write it down. So please shar=
e it - not just with us but with the authors in all the languages represent=
ed by the shootout by updating the relevant page on its website. It seems s=
afe to assume from the level of questioning (and lack of answering from any=
one else) that the reasoning is not obvious so a point or two would help to=
 clarify it and if not close the discussion, at least fairly and squarely m=
ove it to the shootout's forums...

Alternatively, if that's not the case, stop dancing around the point and ju=
st state that the rules are that way because you say that they are. Full st=
op. End discussion. On all lists.
