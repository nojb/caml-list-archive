ocamlscript is certainly a wonderful tool, for prototyping and
otherwise.  It unfortunately doesn't help specifically with the "load
a large file and do something with it" case.  A native-code toplevel
allows you to keep the native code speed benefits and load the file
only once.  Interactive experimentation on the file's data then
doesn't require waiting for the data to be read in each time.
