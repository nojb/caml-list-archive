Hyperthreading was never remarkable about performance or whatever and is
probably not pure SMP (emulated SMP maybe?).

There are various development regarding this subject (most recent
first):
- Plasma (MapReduce in OCaml)
  http://plasma.camlcity.org/plasma/index.html
- OC4MC (OCaml for MultiCore)
  http://www.algo-prog.info/ocmc/web/
- ocamlp3l
  http://camlp3l.inria.fr/eng.htm
- jocaml 
  http://jocaml.inria.fr/
- ocamlmpi
  http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocamlmpi/

All these projects try to tackle the challenge of SMP from different
point of view. Maybe you'll find what your answer in one of them.
