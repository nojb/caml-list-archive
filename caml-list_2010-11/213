Hi,=0A=0A> I am on the fence about whether to learn OCaml or not, and while=
=0A> reading an article called "Why OCaml"=0A> (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murph=
yk/Software/Ocaml/why_ocaml.html),=0A> I saw that OCaml was praised for the=
 speed of the executables it=0A> generates - and was referred to, speed-wis=
e, as "second to none",=0A> except C and C++.=0A=0AYes, Ocaml is fast (more=
 on that later), but you should consider speed=0Aas just the icing in the c=
ake.  Besides all the cool language features,=0Awhat makes me recommend Oca=
ml to people who -- like you -- may be on=0Athe fence, is that among the no=
t so mainstream languages, Ocaml is=0Aperhaps the one people are more likel=
y to stick with for actual work=0Aafter they get past the learning stage.  =
Remember that though Ocaml=0Afavours the functional paradigm, it is flexibl=
e enough to support those=0A(few) situations where it actually makes sense =
to be imperative and/or=0Ause an object oriented approach, and where a pure=
ly functional solution=0Ais just intellectual masturbation.=0A=0A> However,=
 when I actually went to the Language Shootout page suggested=0A> in the ar=
ticle, I found out that OCaml is not 2nd, it is 13th, behind=0A> languages =
like Haskell and C#...=0A> (http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-pro=
gramming-languages-are-fastest.php)=0A> =0A> Is it just hype, then? Or am I=
 missing something?=0A=0AThere's lies, damn lies, and shootout statistics. =
 Getting good performance=0Ain Haskell is often something of a black art th=
at baffles even gurus. In=0Acontrast, Ocaml has very good "performance pred=
ictability".  Moreover, it=0Ais possible to get good performance from fairl=
y idiomatic Ocaml programmes,=0Awhereas in other languages you may need to =
write ugly code which looks like=0Anothing one would write for elegance and=
 sanity.=0A=0ABest regards,=0ADario Teixeira=0A=0A=0A=0A
