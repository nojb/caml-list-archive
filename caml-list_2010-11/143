Each time I need more debug information for the ocaml runtime itself
(which hopefully is not often) I recompile Ocaml adding various "-g"
and "-O0" here and there in some makefiles.

But I've noticed there are some special targets and rules, specifically in
byterun/Makefile, that seams to be there for that very purpose (the suffix
rules for .d.c extention). So I suppose there is a standard way to
compile ocaml in debugging mode.

Do someone have some knowledge to share about this ?
