Hi,
  Perhaps a further explanation is necessary. What I have done is ported =
the interpreter ocamlrun
to the iPad and added a gui based on Graphics.cma and bound ancillary =
libraries such as Num.cma
into the executable. The ocaml interpreter itself is written in ocaml =
and is identical to the workstation
version of the same release. This means you can drop a compiled library =
into iTunes and then load
it immediately in iPad (provided it does not use shared objects which =
are not bound into the signed app.

So you could say the app is written in ocaml. I have called it =
'OcamlExample' with the intention that
users will substitute their own code making use of #use or #load =
statements

The alternative option to use ocaml's own native code generator seems to =
me a bit pointless because
the app is then hard-wired to a given function. But if anyone wants to =
write a type-safe game or something,
this would be an interesting. You could use the standalone codesign =
function of xcode perhaps
=20
The other thing you will have gathered is it allows creative activity on =
the iPad, without becoming a developer.

With this version you cannot compile to a file on the iPad, but you can =
#use source files which then get
compiled into memory in a sense. But the ability to exchange compiled =
bytecode with the host running iTunes
means this is not too much of a limitation in my view.

Regards,

Jonathan
