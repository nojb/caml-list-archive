I'm not sure I disputed that anywhere, in fact I think if anything implicit=
ly agreed with it...

> To characterize that as "reducing an entire programming language's

I'm not clear how you extracted that from what I said which was that reduci=
ng a programming language to a single number (or three numbers, if you want=
 bars) is not a good summary of the *total* strengths of that programming l=
anguage. I then went on to stress that the combined results from the shooto=
ut don't claim to do that, they simply show an interpretation of the combin=
ed results from the different benchmarks.

My attempt at a point was that ranking programming languages (that's just "=
programming languages" not "execution speed of programming languages") is a=
 largely futile activity, because it's just too subjective and hard to quan=
tify in a rigorous manner, and importantly that the shootout doesn't try to=
 do that. The relevance and value of that point to Thanassis' original ques=
tion is for him to decide...

"

Which part of my statement "The shootout doesn't claim that the final ranki=
ng displayed is anything other than a score of how well the languages did a=
t the various benchmarks given" (prefixed with the Latin abbreviation for "=
Note well") caused you to need to write this?
