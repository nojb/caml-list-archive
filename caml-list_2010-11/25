HotSWUp 2011: Third Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Upgrades=20


                  (co-located with ICDE 2011)=20
                       Hannover, Germany=20
                        April 16, 2011=20


                    http://www.hotswup.org=20


              Submission deadline: 15 November 2010=20


OBJECTIVES=20


Actively-used software systems are upgraded regularly to incorporate=20
bug fixes and security patches or to keep up with the evolving=20
requirements. Whether upgrades are applied offline or online, they=20
significantly impact the system's performance and reliability.=20
Recently-introduced commercial products aim to address various aspects=20=

of this problem; however, recent studies and a large body of anecdotal=20=

evidence suggest that upgrades remain failure-prone, tedious, and=20
expensive.=20


The goal of the HotSWUp Workshop is to identify cutting-edge research=20
for supporting software system upgrades that are flexible, efficient,=20
robust, and easy to specify and apply.  Many diverse research areas=20
are concerned with building large, evolving, highly-available systems.=20=

As such, HotSWUp seeks contributions from all these areas, ranging=20
from databases to distributed systems, and from programming languages=20
to software engineering, and separately reflected in conferences such=20
as SIGMOD, ICDE, SOSP, OSDI, OOPSLA, PLDI, ICSE, and FSE.  By seeking=20
contributions from both academic researchers and industry=20
practitioners, HotSWUp aims to combine novel ideas with experience=20
from upgrading real systems.  The present workshop aims to build on=20
the successes of HotSWUp'08 and HotSWUp'09 where the paper=20
presentations and lively discussions attracted a diverse audience of=20
researchers.=20


The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:=20


- Upgrading Information Systems under Schema Evolution.=20
- Programming language / operating system / database support for=20
software upgrades.=20
- Improving the reliability of upgrades (e.g., support for upgrade=20
validation and for rollback after failures).=20
- Support for system or data restructuring (e.g., evolving APIs,=20
changes to database schemas).=20
- Identifying dependencies between components and guaranteeing safe=20
interactions among mixed versions.=20
- Coordinating and disseminating upgrades in large-scale distributed=20
systems.=20
- Software upgrades and the Cloud Computing Infrastructure.=20
- Tools for preparing, testing, and applying software upgrades.=20
- Human factors in software upgrades (e.g., usability of upgrading=20
tools, common operator mistakes).=20


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES=20


We are interested in papers that address practical as well as=20
theoretical aspects of software upgrades from large scale to embedded=20
applications. Particularly welcome this year are submissions=20
concerning software upgrade issues in database systems.  Preferably,=20
submissions should fall into one of the following categories:=20


- Suggest how a successful approach can be applied in a different =
context=20
(e.g., static dependency analysis applied to distributed-system =
upgrades).=20
- Refute an old assumption about software upgrades (e.g., by presenting=20=

negative results).=20
- Describe a new problem or propose a novel solution to an old problem.=20=

- Present empirical evidence related to the practical implementation of=20=

software upgrades.=20


Papers must not exceed 5 pages, in IEEE camera-ready format (templates=20=

at=20

Papers must be submitted electronically at http://www.hotswup.org.=20
