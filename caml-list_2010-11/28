PIC ASM is the first "programming language" Beno=EEt learnt, a few years =
ago. He has practiced it ever since.
But meanwhile he learnt OCaml (among other languages). A few months ago, =
he suggested me to implement an OCaml virtual machine running on PICs, =
with maximum performance efficiency in mind. This is why OCAPIC's VM is =
implemented in ASM.=20

The purpose is of course to program PICs with a high level language =
while remaining (relatively) *very* efficient.

Vincent St-Amour and Marc Feeley have a similar project (Scheme on PICs) =
which a much higher priority on portability: their VM is implemented in =
C code.
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stamourv/picobit-ifl.pdf

The "side effect" of our project =97 which can interest many OCaml users =
=97 is that OCAPIC provides "ocamlclean", which is a tool that takes an =
OCaml bytecode binary (produced by ocamlc) and reduces it by =
(statically) eliminating most of its deadcode (and of course dynlink is =
thence broken; note that dynlink is not relevant on PICs). This tool is =
independent from the rest of OCAPIC.
Actually, this tool was mandatory for programs using OO-layer : without =
it, bytecode binaries embedding OO-layer were to big to fit on our PICs.=20=


Cheers,

Philippe
