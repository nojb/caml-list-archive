Hyperthreading is a hack to better utilize idle cpu sub units. The CPU
has multiple complete sets of registers, one per hyper thread. Execution
of the threads is interleaved. Now when one thread is doing some
floating point operation the cpu switches over to another thread and
lets it do some integer aritmetic. But that assumes the threads are
using different sub units. If they are using the same unit then they
just block each other and no speedup occurs.

The speedup of hyperthreading is purely from avoiding dead cycles when
one thread waits for something. On te other hand the cache is shared
between threads so per thread it is smaller and more easily
trashed. Hyperthreading can be much slower too.
