	Actually, I'm quite interested in the same thing
from a different angle: rather than being concerned with
_compiler_ code optimisation, I'm concerned with human ability
to reason about code: ocaml loses the simplicity of reasoning about
derived from referential transparency available in 'pure' functional
languages. (But of course the two things are strongly related)
