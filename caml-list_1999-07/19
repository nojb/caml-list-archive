There is another way to get around this:

#!/bin/sh
# (* 
exec ocaml "$0" "$@"
*) directory ".";;
print_string "Hello world!"; print_newline();;
exit(0);;

It does not matter whether "ocaml" is itself a script or not, and you 
do not need to specify the interpreter with an absolute file name;
/bin/sh always exists. The solution is a bit tricky: The first lines
are interpreted by both /bin/sh and ocaml.

	# (* 

The shell sees a comment line because of #. Ocaml sees the beginning of
a directive with a comment between # and the name of the directive
which is allowed.

	exec ocaml "$0" "$@"

This line is only seen by the shell, as ocaml thinnks it is a comment.
It causes that the process switches over to run ocaml with the given
parameters. The shell stops here and does not read further.

	*) directory ".";;

The end of the comment and the directive. #directory "." has no effect,
as "." is already in the search path.

That's what they tell you. I believe that kernel programmers do not like
recursions at all. (There are actually some serious problems with recursions
in kernel mode, for example recursive mutexes.)
