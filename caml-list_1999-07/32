Subject: recursive algebraic and class types
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: weis

Someone recently posted a patch which allows class types
and algebraic types to be mixed in the same declaration,
so that they can be mutually recursive .. but I have lost
the email. Could I ask the patch be posted again?

Is there a simple workaround without the patch?

[I need something like

	type expr_t = X | Y of class_t
	class type class_t = object method lookup : expr_t -> expr_t end
]

BTW: when such changes to syntax are given, if applied they
will not be useful with camlp4 unless it too is patched. :-(
