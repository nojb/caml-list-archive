>From the README:

	This package implements frequent string operations: searching, replacing,
	splitting, matching. It is independent from the Str library, and can 
	replace Str in many cases. Unlike Str, xstr is thread-safe. xstr does
	not implement regular expressions in general, but an important subset.
	Some operations of xstr are performed as quickly as by Str; if the string
	to be processed is small, xstr is often faster than Str; if the string is
	big, xstr is upto half as fast as Str. 

You can download the package from the usual place:

	http://people.darmstadt.netsurf.de/Gerd.Stolpmann/ocaml/

This package has an entry in the O'Caml link database; updates are announced
here:

	http://www.npc.de/ocaml/linkdb/

Note: that xstr is often slower than Str (which bases on the GNU regex library)
is partly caused by the missing bitstrings. As substitute I use an array of
16 integers storing 16 bits each. The membership-test for bitstrings is the
most frequent operation, and it must be fast to get good results. What I would
need is a primitive that finds the next character in a string that is member of
a given bitstring. Most time-consuming loops in xstr do exactly this.
