Hello,

I am not sure whether I have once again overlooked a feature so here
my question:

Is it possible to compile some module to native code and to link this
native code to generate an efficient toplevel?

When linking in custom runtime mode I can easily link in object files,
but only ".cmo"- or ".cma"-files (=byte code). In order to make use
of the native code, I would probably have to link against ".cmx"- or
".cmxa"-files, which is not possible.

Am I overlooking something or is this impossible due to restrictions of
the linker?

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
