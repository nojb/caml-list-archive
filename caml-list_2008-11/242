That's reducible to the standard debate of static vs dynamic linking in =
any language, surely? The only "impact" on performance presumably is the =
re-writing of the symbol tables which flexlink/dlopen does as the .cmxs =
file is loaded but that must be negligible. However, isn't ocamlopt able =
to do some cross-module optimisation (which is why .cmx files are =
usually shipped as well as .cmxa) - this presumably isn't possible when =
linking dynamically...

Short-term, native dynlink doesn't work on all platforms (AFAIK?) so =
.cmxa is not dead, whatever your linking preference.
