This is a really awesome project! Performance is fine on a decent browser. 
Times taken to highlight syntax_common.ml on this machine:

Chrome:     0.5s
Firefox:    1.1s
IE7:        5.7s
Konqueror: 17.5s

Looks like you've got an OCaml bytecode interpreter written in Javascript. 
Could you write a compiler and call eval to get better performance?

I've been thinking about run-time generating code using LLVM that runs in 
OCaml's VM recently. Using that to implement Javascript on top of OCaml's VM 
would be interesting...

Anyway, I think that's a really great piece of work!
