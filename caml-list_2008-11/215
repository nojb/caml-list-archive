Well, it is a tool deficiency, but the fact is that it's a deficiency
we have, and until someone writes the tuareg extension for
ocamlwizard, we'll continue to have this deficiency.  (Better not
forget vi users, ocamde users, Eclipse, etc.)  'Course, that fixes the
editor part, but there's still all the other places where OCaml code
can be displayed - eg. on web pages, in version control systems, in
books, .. - so better extend ocamlwizard to those areas too.

Again, Perl gets this mostly right, in that the module developer can
define "modes of use" of the module.  In Perl something like:

  use CGI qw(:standard);

causes all the "standard" symbols to be imported (as defined by the
module author).  Or you can import just the symbols you want.  As
befits a dynamic language, the implementation is completely flexible
-- at runtime the module sees the literal string parameter and can
decide to export any combination of symbols it likes based on the
string parameter.  An example of how flexible and idiomatic that can
be is shown here:
