If you include in batteries an external package that has its own =20
hierarchy and is designed to be opened I don't mind having that =20
hierarchy. In that case you can just add the new toplevel entry =20
CoThread. And if I want to use CoThread, I just open CoThreads, not =20
Control.Concurrency.CoThreads. Just try to keep it as flat as =20
possible, don't try to force modules in an ad-hoc hierarchical =20
taxonomy to try to sort out modules. I don't care if the toplevel list =20=

of modules is three hundred pages long if there is an efficient mean =20
to access their documentation (like tags). I do however care a lot if =20=

it becomes bureaucratic to be able to _use_ a module in my code.

But (unfortunately, sorry to repeat that) Batteries is not a CPAN like =20=

initiative. It aims at giving a library of modules/syntax extensions =20
selected by the library maintainers, as such it is inherently =20
centralized and I don't think that questions (1) or (2) are actually =20
pertinent for the project.

Best,
