Our final goal is of course to write the whole Web application in OCaml (both 
server and client sides). And thus to get the same static guarantees for the 
code beeing executed on the browser as we have on server side with Ocsigen 
(for example valid xhtml, etc).

To run OCaml on a browser, there are several solutions: 
For example you can use a compiler to js (see for example ocamljs), or a 
plugin. O'Browser is an alternative. It seems to be efficient enough for most 
uses. For tasks requiring very high efficiency, the only solution is a plugin
_and_ a very efficient xhtml/css rendering engine.

Cheers,
Vincent Balat
