X-Spam: no; 0.00; andrej:01 andrej:01 ocamlyacc:01 ocamlyacc:01 functor:01 modules:02 executable:03 logical:04 implement:06 seem:08 refers:08 bauer:09 bauer:09 accepts:09 file:11 

I have the following situation:

- a signature S
- two modules A and B, which both implement S
- an ocamlyacc file which refers to an implementation of S

I want to generate two executable, one where A is used and another
where B is used.

The most logical thing would be to turn the ocamlyacc part into a
functor which accepts an implementation of S. But there does not seem
to be any way of doing this. What can I do?

Can menhir do this?

Best regards,

Andrej
