I often use the OCaml top-level by copying and pasting code from a XEmacs or 
KWrite window into a KTerm. However, there appears to be a synchronization 
problem where the top-level prints two spaces after each newline at a random 
point in time. So the indentation is not only wrong but the code has random 
pairs of spaces injected into it. I assume this is a race condition between 
printing due to the pasting and printing after the top-level reads a newline.

Any ideas how to circumvent this problem? How is this synchronization supposed 
to occur?
