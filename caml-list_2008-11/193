Well, we're trying to be future-proof. Don't you think we should?

Well, if you it's just the matter of [printf], we can add it to
[Batteries.Standard] to import it in the standard namespace. The biggest
question is how many things we want imported in that standard namespace.
Or you could start your files with [open Text.Printf] or [module P =
Text.Printf] or any similar combination.

Oh, and, [Printf.printf] works, too. This is one of the modules which
have a shortcut to their path in the hierarchy, to mirror the base
library.

Cheers,
 David
