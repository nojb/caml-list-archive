I have recently read several chapters of this documentation, I found it is of 
really good quality. There are no equivalent in English because most Unix doc 
is for C, so while reading it I was thinking that I would be pleased to 
traduct it in English (well perhaps not all because it's huge, but at least 
some chapters). The result would be written in my usual poor English but then 
it would be easy for an English born guy to correct it.

But unfortunatly this documentation is not GFDL released or so, it is 
copyrighted so it is currently not allowed to touch it.
