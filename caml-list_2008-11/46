Smoke already runs fine using Mesa and Mesa is still seeing huge performance 
improvements, e.g. using run-time generated code via LLVM. If you desperately 
needed Smoke on an embedded platform, I would just port it to OpenGL ES 
instead of reinventing the wheel.

I would opt for the loosest available binding, e.g. sending XML over sockets, 
and avoid native code FFI in OCaml for anything high-level at all costs.
