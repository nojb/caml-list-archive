Sure.

No. :-)

I think it is extremely unlikely that OCaml will get many more libraries so I 
do not think it is worth spending much time designing infrastructure to cope 
with that eventuality.

You could but it will still deter newbies:

  open Text.Printf
  printf "Hello world!\n"

etc.

Sure. I would certainly vote for flattening out the hierarchy as much as 
possible though. For example, I would keep containers in List, Array etc. and 
not nest them in Data or Containers or Collections.
