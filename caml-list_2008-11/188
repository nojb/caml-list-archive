I only have one major concern: you say "with the large number of modules 
involved, we would need a hierarchy of modules" but the number of modules 
involved is tiny (a few dozen in OCaml compared to tens or even hundreds of 
thousands in any industrial-strength language) because OCaml has very few 
libraries. Yet your module hierarchies are already enormous and often require 
a longer sequence of modules to reach simple functionality than is required 
in a comparatively-huge library like .NET.

To me, the most striking example is printf which is just printf in F#, 
Printf.printf in OCaml and is now Text.Printf.printf in OCaml+Batteries. 
Surely this is a step in the wrong direction?
