Easy - look at CPAN[1].  If you want to scale a project you have to
make decisions that allow a distributed network of people to
cooperate, without needing too much central coordination.  CPAN is a
great example of this loose coupling because packages make their own
decision about naming (albeit they can become "official" later - but
they won't need to rename unless there is an actual naming conflict).

If the problem is documentation or provenance of packages, then add a
mechanism to solve that problem.  Perl also solves this through an
existing, lightweight, distributed mechanism (a standard location to
install man-pages, and a standard man-page format and man-page
generating mechanism -- POD).
