No, it's not. You cannot ask everyone to regenerate all the
documentation of every single package they have as often as they install
new packages. The problem is linking already-generated documentation
post-facto.

It is the replacement for [Pervasives], indeed. And I'm pretty sure
that, for beginners, [Pervasives] is more confusing than [Standard].
Since it's automatically opened anyway, most people won't need to know
the name.

Well, that was my argument for hierarchies. Stop stealing my
arguments :)

More seriously, sure.

Well, I've started working on a new generation of documentation
generation should make navigation by topics feasible. I'll try and have
a prototype within 1-2 weeks.
