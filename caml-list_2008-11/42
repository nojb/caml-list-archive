I've implemented GUIs in C++ using Qt, and in OCaml using Smoke, and in F# 
using WPF. Qt is by far the most limited in terms of functionality and is 
filled with incidental complexity to boot. Finally, Qt isn't even safe so Qt 
GUI apps are prone to crashing to the extent that even Trolltech's own tiny 
demo programs crash.

I agree that GTK is worse but my point is simply that Qt leaves a lot to be 
desired, primarily because it is entirely founded upon old-school programming 
practice that is long since outdated.
