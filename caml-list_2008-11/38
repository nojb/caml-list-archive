As a longtime KDE user, I'm very much disappointed by the most recent
major KDE release, in terms of how much slower it got on my
not-all-that-old-hardware (an AMD64 Compaq machine running in 32 bits).
A lot of it comes from the fact that my home directory is mounted via NFS,
but this used to work a lot better.

A typical KDE application literally hammers the filesystem upon every
single application startup, and it got progressively worse every major
KDE release. Qt is not an angel in that respect either -- that's about
the major gripe I have with Qt.

As a longtime developer who uses Qt (recently only for open source stuff),
I do know that Qt's performance in general has continuously improved, and
they have made real low-level architectural improvements. New KDE releases
always hammered Qt pretty hard, it was a similar story when KDE 3 came
out, although the perceived slowdown wasn't as bad (and it was on worse
hardware).

But Qt can't really help with the application and the KDE "middleware"
making things worse than they need to be...

As for Qt demos segfaulting: I wonder if that may be due to OpenGL bugs.
Seriously.
