Would it be useful, then, to have Smoke have a built-in renderer for
embedded/non-accelerated platforms? It should still be faster than Mesa,
since you can work with higher-level objects that can perhaps be drawn
faster with object-specific rendering functions, instead of having
to tesselate everything and then just work on triangles?

I'm pretty sure that such built-in rendering would perform better and
have smaller footprint for non-accelerated platforms than going through
the whole OpenGL stack.

What do you think?

Then, there's still a whole lot of work in getting OCaml interoperate
with native platform (think OLE, browser plugins, yada yada).
