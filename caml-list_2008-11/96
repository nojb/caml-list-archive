Exactly.

The 3.10 manual says:


7.2  Streams and stream parsers

The syntax for streams and stream parsers is no longer part of the
Objective Caml language, but available through a Camlp4 syntax
extension. See the Camlp4 reference manual for more information. Support
for basic operations on streams is still available through the
Stream[Stream] module of the standard library. Objective Caml programs
that use the stream parser syntax should be compiled with the -pp
camlp4o option to ocamlc and ocamlopt. For interactive use, run ocaml
and issue the #load "camlp4o.cma";; command.

I don't know. Have you tried ocamllex followed by camlp4?
