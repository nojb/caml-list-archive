Dear Daniel,

Xavier and I would be happy to see our course notes translated, of course.
We would then license them appropriately.  We are thinking of a "Creative
Commons" license of the kind "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
United States" (See http://creativecommons.org/license/).  We could also
provide the source code.

If you or someone else is willing to take responsability for such a project,
please contact us.

Best wishes,

         Didier
