I'm not sure I understand what you want to acheive. If it is only a =20
documentation issue cannot that be done with ocamldoc's -dump and -=20
load ?

Is this Pervasives ? If it is I think the latter name is more =20
descriptive.

If Threads and CoThreads are really semantically compatible I think =20
that your idea of only having everything in Threads and CoThread is =20
better and sufficient (i.e. top-level Condition, CoCondition, etc. =20
should be dropped). Advise the users to open Threads/Cothreads to use =20=

the modules (or functorize their code on Concurrency). This allows to =20=

quickly switch from one implementation to the other by changing the =20
toplevel open directive. With the current proposal users may be =20
tempted to use Condition directly, and what happens if some have used =20=

Condition and others CoCondition in their modules and we suddenly try =20=

to use them toghether ?

Of course when you look it as a long list it does, but that's a =20
presentation issue. This proposal is much more convenient to use in =20
your code and that's what eventually matters (at least to me). Thanks =20=

for the new proposal.

Best,

Daniel
