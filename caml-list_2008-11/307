Dear Sir/Madam
We recently came across your website and wondered if we could spare a moment of your time to assess if you would be interested in the range of web solutions we currently offer below. 
Our core services are:
Web Design - Either involving creating new web designs from scratch or revamping your existing graphics to bring them more up-to-date and on par with the competition.
Web Development - Our experienced programming team can tailor a solution to almost any requirement, from online-stores, booking systems, through to more custom bespoke requirements such as viral Facebook applications.
Content Management Solutions (CMS) - We have a specialist team who have years of experience developing "CMS" websites. This functionality is increasingly popular, and essentially means you will be able to log into a very easy to use and powerful back end system to update and manage your website. It massively reduces your longer term costs and means you can easily keep the website up-to-date with a click of a button.
Search Engine Optimisation - The final core service we offer involves search engine optimisation (or "SEO"). Many businesses are realising if your website isn't optimised for key search phrases on search engines like Google then its likely you won't see much traffic (and lots of traffic normally means lots of sales!) Our team can put together an effective SEO strategy for you as well as implementing this. 
We also offer a whole range of other related services, probably too many to list here but to name a few we can provide Corporate IDs (including logo design), newsletter systems, flash animation development, forums, blogging systems... and loads more!
The million dollar question... how much does this all cost? Obviously prices will vary a huge amount depending on our your exact requirements. If this is something of interest to you we'd be happy to arrange for a quotation and for someone from our team to give you a call to talk details, just drop us an email back with your rough requirements and a contact number (and suitable time to call) and we'll be in touch.
This email has been sent as a one-off so we won't contact you again unless you want us to. If you aren't interested in our services simply ignore this email and we won't bother you again (and of course your details will never be passed on, we hate spam as much as you probably do!)
Kind regards,
Carl Johnson
Island Web Solutions
