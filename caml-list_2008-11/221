PhD POSITION:

  "Trust and Authority in an Open Web Environment"

  at the VU University Amsterdam, Department of Computer Science

  Deadline for applications: December 15, 2008


THE POSITION

This PhD position is concerned with management of trust and authority
for accessing, integrating and distributing information resources with
varying access limitations, ranging from open Web sources to
confidential sources.  More specifically, the student will address the
following research questions:

1. How should trust and authority of data and metadata be represented
   in Web formats?  The work of the student will include the
   development of an ontology that captures the key concepts involved
   in trust and authority.

2. How can one identify and represent trust and authority policies in
   a mixed (open Web, limited access, confidential) environment? Many
   organizations have trust/authority policies. The challenge here is
   to represent these in an interoperable way, so that we can we use
   and combine them in a (semi-)open setting.

3. Which reasoning techniques can be employed on the trust/authority
   ontology and the policy representations? An important issue here
   is to show that the methods can guarantee the stated trust and
   security requirements.

The use cases in the project are in the area of web-accessible museum
and TV collections, where there is a mix of public and confidential
information on multimedia objects.


THE PLACE

The Department of Computer Science provides an exciting academic work
environment with a large range of ongoing national and international
research projects. The student will become a member of the Semantic
Web research group of the VU, which is one of the world leaders in
this area.


QUALIFICATIONS

MsC in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or related discipline,
and the capabilities to function in a large research team.


APPOINTMENT AND SALARY

The Ph.D. student will be appointed for a period of four years. Salary
is based on the salary scales of the VU University Amsterdam.  As part
of their training the student will be enrolled for the courses of the
Dutch graduate school SIKS (School for Information and Knowledge Systems).
