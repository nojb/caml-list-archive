Actually I posted a few years ago a small module imitating parts of quicheck:

 http://aryx.kicks-ass.org/~pad/ocaml/quickcheck.ml

Apparently they even now use my ugly file in the Janet Street Core Library.

I didn't find much in this ocaml reins library ... and it
looks quite heavy in functors ...


Your library looks very good, very clean. I just noticed you missed 
the 'pair' and 'tuple' random generators.


One criticism is that like many other libraries, such as oUnit, 
ocamlcalendar, they seem a little bit heavyweight. You got hundreds
of functions, 5 modules ...
