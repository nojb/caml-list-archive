If I may advertise myself, have a look at the implementation of
MiniHaskell at the PL Zoo, http://andrej.com/plzoo/ . It has lazy
lists, and the code is supposed to be educational.

Hmm, looking at interp.ml I see that it's not as call-by-need as it
could be. So, a good exercise then is to fix the interpreter to make
it lazier :-)

Best regards,

Andrej
