Yes, that's exactly the kind of loose binding I would opt for. Good thinkin=
g!

There's still the question of how to write the C++ bit. Longer term,=20
generating C++ at run-time using the LLVM's CLang project might be an=20
alluring option but I'd still value process separation as long as unsafe=20
languages are in the mix.
