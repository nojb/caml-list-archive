Isn't it almost as simple to write, in a script:
   ocamlbuild -cflags -I,$DEPDIR -lflags -I,$DEPDIR
instead of:
   ocamlbuild -I $DEPDIR
Remember that $DEPDIR must be absolute, or relative to the _build directory.

Then you can use ocamlbuild with the -lib option as usual, in a 
"decoupled" way. For instance, if bla/bla.cma is in your current directory:

$ ocamlbuild -classic-display -lib bla -cflags -I,../bla -lflags 
-I,../bla test.byte
ocamldep.opt -modules test.ml > test.ml.depends
ocamlc.opt -c -I ../bla -o test.cmo test.ml
ocamlc.opt -I ../bla bla.cma test.cmo -o test.byte

And for modules, instead of -lib bla, you write -lflags bla.cmo or 
-lflags bla.cmx. You can have several -lflags if you want. Unfortunately 
you have to specify the extension, so it is true that a -mod option 
would actually add something.

I admit, though, that it is not really easy to understand how to include 
a library. One solution would be to have findlib in ocamlbuild, but even 
then, there would be problems if you want a Makefile which is supposed 
to work also when findlib is not installed.

I think there is a recent debate about the -I option of Ocamlbuild...
