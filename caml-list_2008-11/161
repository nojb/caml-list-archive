Interesting point. So far, the approach of Batteries has certainly been
different, in large part because we don't want everything to end up part
of the Batteries hierarchy (or, well, lack thereof). Of course, this is
in contradiction with our sometimes imperialistic tendencies, so we may
be guilty of schizophrenia.

Perhaps we should organise a poll on this subject.

I'm not sure the man-page format quite scales up to the kind of
hyperlinked complexity we have in Batteries for the moment. But yes, I
agree, we can certainly work something out. In fact, we could say that
we've started on this track, albeit perhaps not with such grand
ambitions.

Thanks for the idea,
 David

P.S.: I've pointedly ignored your perch on POD :) In my mind, that's a
very different topic. For the moment, we'll stick with ocamldoc.
