You really should check.

I have not yet looked too much into the source, but if the 
batteries_core.ml is one of them to be referenced anyway, I'm afraid all 
modules (not just parents/siblings) will be linked.

Try to compile the following source into executable:

----
open Batteries.Data.Persistent.List

let _ = iter
----

You will end up with being asked for numerous unrelated modules during 
the linking phrase, or you can use the recommended "ocamlfind 
batteries/ocamlc" shortcut. Either way, an executable of +50 times 
bigger in size (i.e. +1M for the 2 lines) than using the standard List 
will be produced.
