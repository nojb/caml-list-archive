Let me ditto this: a lot of people are falling all over the new book, 
"Practical Common Lisp," because it talks about things like parsing ID3 
tags from MP3 files, and so talks about the general process of parsing 
binary files in Common Lisp. What you're trying to do is very similar, 
and in fact I'd love to see a "general module" for defining, reading, 
and writing C/C++-style structures to/from binary files. parted sounds 
like a great example of that kind of work. Thanks for digging into it!
