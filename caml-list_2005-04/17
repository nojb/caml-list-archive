This seems to be a communication failure between the translators & 
proofreaders of chapter 11 and their counterparts on chapter 6.  I was a 
proofreader on chapter 6, so I'm a guilty party.

I'm not certain, but I think the type in question is called "phrase" in 
chapter 6.

Is the translation effort still active at all?  I got dropped from the 
translators mailing list when I changed ISPs about 2 years ago.  Could 
one of our French-speakers check in the original text to see if I've 
figured this out correctly?

I'd recommend Levine et al., "Lex & Yacc", from O'Reilly.  It doesn't 
address ocaml at all, but it's a good grounding on how this family of 
tools work.
