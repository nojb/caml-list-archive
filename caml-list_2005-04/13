hi,


i think there's a problem in the oreilly book (probably the english
translation?)

Chapter 11, section 'Basic Revisited' (p307) in the third paragraph, talks
about "the declaration of the type |sentences|"

i don't see this type used or declared anywhere in the book, and i can't
see if |sentences| is a convention of some sort in ocamlyacc/lex

i'm a newbie biting off quite a bit in starting with ocaml{lex,yacc} but
it's the job i need to do, so that's where i am.

any pointers muchly appreciated.


jack
