It is -- I just do not have much time to care about it.

I downloaded your files.  For a start, all the modules are -pack'ed
into camlGI.cm[x]a, so you only need to link with that file.  Also,
the interface of the library is in camlGI.mli with complete
documentation.  In particular, you should not use hidden submodules:
e.g. in "path.ml", say [open CamlGI] and then [Cgi.HttpError] instead
of [Cgi_types.HttpError].  Same in "index.ml": you should say [open
CamlGI.Cgi], not [open Cgi].

[Request.metavar rq.rq "SERVER_NAME"] can simply be replaced with
[Request.server_name rq.rq]

[cgi#header_was_emitted ()]: such method does not exist in the public
interface.

I do not see why you set [rq=request] as the request can be gotten
from the cgi object [cgi#request].

Do the examples provided with the lib work as they should?

Are you sure your [main] function actually terminates?  Indeed, the
output is buffered (at least by CamlGI) and may not be fully outputted
until the script finishes.  Also, if you wish to launch a new
process/thread per request, be sure to use the [fork] optional
parameter to [handle_requests ?fork f conn] -- otherwise [f] will
return immediately and the output "channel" will be closed early.

CamlGI follows closely the spec -- even the multiplexing part which is
not implemented by many.

CGI output is not buffered.

Why is that?  Do you need persistence for that?

Hope it helps.  If it does not, send me an example (if possible
minimal but definitely self-contained) that exhibits the undesired
behavior and I'll have a look.
