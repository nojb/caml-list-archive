I think this is a major problem with current campl4 situation. In my
experience one starts extending an entry point of the ocaml grammar,
then discover that he needs to extend something else, but unfortunately
that "something else" is not public.

Why there are so few grammar entry points made public?

I think camlp4-ers life woule be a lot easier if more of them are made
public.

Cheers.
