I have ported my application to NetCGI, and it works as a CGI script,
just as it did under OCamlGI.  However, if compiled as a FastCGI script,
it denies connections from the server and then dies (broken pipe).  I'd
rather run the cgi as a standalone application, preferably FastCGI as
that's in my server, but if the FastCGI code in NetCGI doesn't work, I'd
be fine compiling it as AJP.

How should I either
(1) fix a broken pipe error in NetCGI or
(2) fix the broken pipe?

Thanks again,
Mike Hamburg
