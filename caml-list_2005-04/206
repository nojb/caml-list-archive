It's arguable that it wouldn't be /that/ much worse than the current=20
situation, where =3D=3D on non-mutable structures is already =
implementation=20
dependent.
I am not advocating for such a change though, if only because in most=20
cases the arguments of =3D=3D are known to be of the same type, so it is =
a=20
good thing to be able to take advantage of this information. However, it =

would still be nice to have both equalities available (yes, I know, yet=20
another equality). In the problem I'm working on, only mutable=20
structures are compared, so the extended =3D=3D would work as intended. =
Of=20
course, you would have to know what you're doing when using this=20
predicate, but this is already the case for the current two equalities : =

you have to watch out for the aforementioned non-mutable structures with =

=3D=3D and for cyclic values with =3D .

Call me pessimistic, but I have little hope that this "feature wish"=20
will be fulfilled, so I would happily settle for fun a b -> a =3D=3D=20
(Obj.magic b) (if it works, still haven't had a chance to try it). I'd=20
be grateful if someone could tell me whether this particular use of=20
Obj.magic is safe.
