Hello, our team (Moscava) offers post-doctoral position.
Both positions (especially the first one) are caml-related.

Candidates should hold a doctorate or Ph.D. for less than one year or
be about to obtain one (ie, before September 1, 2005)
Aplication deadline is April 22 (position starting in September).


More information on the adminsitrative nature of the offer is available at
<http://www.inria.fr/travailler/opportunites/postdoc/postdoc.en.html>


As regards scientific matters, we offer two subjects.
Interested candidates are invited to consult the web pages specified in
the following abstracts for additional information, and to contact us.

--Luc Maranget


First subject: Jocaml3
**********************

Jocaml is an extension of Ocaml based on the Join-calculus,
see http://join.inria.fr. There are already two releases of the
Join-calculus and Jocaml. A third version, simplified and better
integrated to the Ocaml compiler, is under development. It remains to
implement remote communication in distributed settings, which
represents a good third of the whole Jocaml implementation. As a final
result, we want to get a release of Jocaml, accessible on the web and
compatible with successive releases of Ocaml.

<http://www-rocq.inria.fr/fr/actualites/recrutement/post-doc/moscova.htm>


Second subject: Pattern Matching Warnings for Haskell
*****************************************************   	

Since Ocaml 1.05, Ocaml features an efficient
and complete detection algorithm for pattern-matching anomalies such
as useless match clauses and non-exhautive matchings. The
corresponding theory is described in
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/papers/warn.ps It also handles
disjunctive patterns, without exponential explosion in practice.

The post-doctorant will implement the detection algorithm in, for
instance, GHC. She or he will demonstrate and document the work in
order to make it available in a standard Haskell release.
