The default mode in gcc for amd64 is almost this (-mcmodel=small).  It  
assumes pointers live in the lower 2GB of address space, but 'sizeof (void  
*)' is still 8.  I'm not sure why the small model doesn't use 32-bit  
pointers.

The -mcmodel=medium model does 64-bit operations on pointers, but the code  
must still live in the lower 2GB of address space.

The -mcmodel=large isn't yet implemented.
