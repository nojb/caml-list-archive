Greetings,

We are trying to create a stand-alone .cmxa library
of our system, which in turn, depends on other .cmxa 
libraries.  When we link our .cmxa library, we get link errors
of the form:

/usr/local/lib/ocaml/nums.cmxa is not a compilation unit description.

This is pretty important to us because many users just
want to download the .cmxa file without having to install
a lot of auxilliary libraries.

Can you explain this limitation?  I looked through
the mailing list archives briefly, so if you can point
me to a relevant thread, that would be helpful.

Also, this limitation is asymmetric as
.cma files can be relinked into new .cma files.

Thanks, Mary
