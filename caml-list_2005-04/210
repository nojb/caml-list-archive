Given then that my application should be multithreaded, and will be
running on a webserver using Rails (which traditionally uses FastCGI),
which of these libraries do you suggest that I use?  Http, Netcgi_afp or
Netcgi_fcgi?  Or are they interoperable enough that it doesn't matter?

Thanks a lot,
Mike
