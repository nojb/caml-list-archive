I updated my patches for 64 bit SPARC code to work with ocaml 3.08.3:
http://www.mit.edu/~jfc/ocaml-3.08.3-sparc64.tar.gz

There are two changes from the 3.08.1 version:
1. The 64 bit startup code did not allocate a large enough stack
   frame, causing crashes in garbage collection in some programs
   due to register window saves overwriting of the zero word that
   terminates the chain of stack frames.  If you want to fix this
   without upgrading, change 176 to 208 in the save statement at
   asmrun/sparc-sparc64.S line 319.
2. ocaml does not compile on Solaris because otherlibs/graph/.depend
   contains references to /usr/X11R6; the install script deletes
   these dependencies.

As before:

This only affects native code, ocamlopt.

Although the patched ocaml recognizes other 64 bit SPARC operating
systems, I only have access to Solaris 9.

Floats are still boxed in 64 bit code but are properly aligned,
potentially improving performance.


Here are run times for three of the microbenchmarks we discussed on
the list recently, from left to right lorentzian 200, sieve 10000000,
sort 10000:

      lore siev sort
ML 32 6.78 1.52 2.87
ML 64 7.41 1.18 2.72
C  32 2.81 1.93 2.54*
C  64 2.92 3.50 

ML 32 = ocamlopt 3.08.3 32 bit version with -march=v8
ML 64 = ocamlopt 3.08.3 64 bit version
C 32 = Sun C++ 5.5 -xO3 -xarch=v8plus except * = gcc 3.3.2
C 64 = Sun C++ 5.5 -xO3 -xarch=v9
