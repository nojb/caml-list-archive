Good idea. However, I think it is too late for such a discussion.

First, it already happened. Do you remember Bedouin? Although this
debate was about the general design of web applications, there was also
a "branch" targeting the low-level stuff, especially CGI and other
connectors. This branch was Ocamlnet.

Second, Ocamlnet exactly defines the "minimal set of services" (besides
including several implementations). The interesting point is that it is
possible to do implementations outside Ocamlnet by just defining
compatible classes. This was a design idea from the very beginning,
realized by using classes instead of functors everywhere. Because
Ocamlnet has several layers, the developer of a new connector is even
free to choose the level of the implementation, often giving one the
chance to reuse code.

I am quite astonished at seeing that many CGI implementations. I only
knew the implementation of de Rauglaudre and Filliatre, and its
limitations were one the motivations to develop Ocamlnet. Except
mod_ocaml, which is somehow a different thing, the other libraries seem
to have the same limitations: Non-modular design, missing features like
upload of large (> 16 MB) files, or internationalization. I don't say
Ocamlnet is perfect, but it is a step into the right direction.
