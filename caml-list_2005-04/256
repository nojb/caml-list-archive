Some applications really need stream based processing: loading the XML 
document into memory is out of question (because it is huge) and/or 
processing needs to happen as soon as data is available (e.g. for the 
Jabber protocol).

I'm afraid it will be hard. To start with, do we want mutable trees, 
upward pointers ?  Do we want to keep locations, namespace declarations, 
comments, entity references ... ?  Which whitespace to remove ?

Anyway, a tree representation can easily be built on top of an 
event-driven interface. The difficult part in parsing XML is really 
lexing. We can try to agree upon one or several standard tree 
representation, but I believe we should start with an event-driven 
interface.

Is someone willing to set-up a mailing list for this discussion ?
