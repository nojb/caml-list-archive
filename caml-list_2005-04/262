   ------------------------------------------------------------
    Twenty first International Conference on Logic Programming
                               ICLP'05

                          2-5 October, 2005
                      Sitges (Barcelona) Spain

          Co-located with the International Conference on
     Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP'05)
    ------------------------------------------------------------

                 http://www.iiia.csic.es/iclp2005/


  [* Please note that ICLP'05 has a doctoral consortium for the first
     time as well as a special industrial paper session (details
     below).
   * Note that ICLP05's dates intersect with a solar eclipse visible
     in Barcelona ].


The Conference
--------------

The 21st  International Conference on  Logic Programming will  be held
near Barcelona (Spain) from October  2nd to October 5th, 2005. ICLP'05
will be colocated  with the International Conference on Principles and
Practice of Constraint Programming (CP'05).

Conference scope
----------------

Since the first  conference held in Marseilles in  1982, ICLP has been
the premier international conference  for presenting research in logic
programming.  Contributions (papers  and  posters) are  sought in  all
areas of logic programming including but not restricted to:

       Theory                       Implementation

   Semantic Foundations          Compilation
   Formalisms                    Memory Management
   Nonmonotonic Reasoning        Virtual Machines
   Knowledge Representation      Parallelism

      Environments                 Alternative Paradigms

   Program Analysis              Constraint Logic Programming
   Program Transformation        Abductive Logic Programming
   Validation and Verification   Inductive Logic Programming
   Debugging, Profiling          Answer Set Programming

      Language Issues                Applications

   Concurrency                   Semantic Web
   Objects                       Software Engineering
   Coordination                  Web Tools
   Mobility                      Internet Agents
   Higher Order                  Artificial Intelligence
   Types                         Deductive Databases
   Modes                         Natural Language
   Programming Techniques


Specific attention will be  given to work providing novel integrations
of these different areas, and to new applications of logic programming
in  general. Contributions on  applications will  be assessed  with an
emphasis on their  impact and synergy with other  areas, as opposed to
technical maturity. Applications of  logic programming to the Semantic
Web are especially encouraged.

The technical program will  include several invited talks and advanced
tutorials, in addition to the presentations of the accepted papers and
posters.  A  special  session  on  industrial  applications  of  logic
programming  is also  planned and  several workshops  will be  held in
parallel with the  conference. For the first time,  a doctoral student
consortium will be organized as part of ICLP.

Papers
-------

Papers  must describe original,  previously unpublished  research, and
must not  be simultaneously submitted for  publication elsewhere. They
must be  written in English and  not exceed 15 pages  in Springer LNCS
format.  The  authors are encouraged, although not  obliged, to submit
their  papers already  in  Springer LNCS  format. General  information
about the Springer LNCS series  and the LNCS authors' instructions are
available     at     the      Springer     LNCS/LNAI     home     page
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html).

Papers should express their  contribution clearly, both in general and
technical terms.  It is essential  to identify what  was accomplished,
describe its significance, and explain how the paper compares with and
advances previous work.  Authors should make every effort  to make the
technical content understandable to a broad audience.

The primary means of submission  will be electronic, in pdf format. If
electronic submission is not possible, five hard copies should be sent
to one  of the program  co-chairs. More information on  the submission
procedure will be available at http://www.easychair.org/ICLP2005/submit/

Industrial Papers
-----------------

A special  session on industrial applications of  logic programming is
also planned  during the conference.  Papers accepted in  this session
will  describe   innovative  applications  of   logic  programming  to
industrial problems.  The application's innovativeness  and industrial
impact will  be the main criteria  used for judging  the paper. Papers
accepted  for this  session will  be published  in the  proceedings as
shorter, (up to) 10 pages papers.

Posters
-------

Posters  provide  a forum  for  presenting  work  in an  informal  and
interactive setting.   They are ideal for discussing  current work not
yet  ready for  publication,  for PhD  thesis  summaries and  research
project overviews.   Accepted posters will  also get a 10  minute slot
for presentation  during the conference.  Extended  abstract (2 pages)
of each accepted poster will be published in the proceedings.

Posters  must be  submitted  electronically. More  information on  the
submission       procedure       will       be      available       at
http://www.easychair.org/ICLP2005/submit/

Doctoral Student Consortium
---------------------------

The  Doctoral  Consortium will  provide  an  opportunity for  students
pursuing their doctoral thesis  in logic programming and related areas
to explore their  research interests under the guidance  of a panel of
distinguished experts in the  field. The Doctoral Consortium will also
offer  invited speakers  and discussion  groups.  The  Consortium will
allow participants  to interact with established  researchers and with
other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel
discussions, and invited presentations.

A  separate call-for-participation  will  be issued  for the  doctoral
consortium. About 6 to 8 students will be selected for the consortium.
Selected  students will  also  present their  research  in the  poster
session.  The  abstract  of  the  poster  will  be  published  in  the
conference proceedings. Financial support for selected students may be
available.


Publication
-----------

The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag
in the LNCS  series. The proceedings will include  the accepted papers
and the abstracts of accepted posters.


Sponsoring and prizes
---------------------

The conference is sponsored  by the Association for Logic Programming.
The ALP has funds to assist financially disadvantaged participants.

The ALP  is planning to sponsor  two prizes for ICLP'05:  for the best
technical paper and for the best application paper.
