Alas, this does not work for me. This is for an OCaml-only module, in=20
which the "other" types are all instances of one polymorphic mutable=20
record type, but the number or exact values of these instances are not=20
known within the module and may be pretty much anything.

Fortunately, I have an easy workaround in my case, but it can't really=20
be generalized. The polymorphic record type contains a "node" field=20
(which is a non-polymorphic mutable record). I know that two records=20
cannot share the same physical node, so I basically use the node as a=20
unique identifier for the records:

type ('a, 'b) my_record_type =3D { ... ; node : node_type ; ... }
let my_eq : ('a, 'b) my_record_type -> ('c,'d) my_record_type -> bool =
=3D
  fun x y -> x.node =3D=3D y.node

Obviously, this method only works if you have such a unique identifier=20
for every object you have to compare. If this node field hadn't been=20
there, I would have been stuck with either cheating with the Obj module, =

or artificially adding a unique identifier to each record (like an int=20
or a unit ref). The latter would have been quite frustrating, because it =

would cost execution time + memory + readability only to get around the=20
arguably artificial typing limitation of =3D=3D .
