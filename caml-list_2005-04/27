Indeed, all of your posts to *that thread* are "redacted"... but 
magically, people responding to you were able to quote you. :)

Not knowing how the automated machinery of the Caml list actually 
functions, I could hazard a guess - were your posts to the thread in 
question perhaps formatted as something other than plain text and/or 
for some other reason appeared as attachments?

If there actually was a conspiracy involved here, it was somewhat 
localized - random checks of other "richard jones" threads seem to all 
be present and accounted for. :)
