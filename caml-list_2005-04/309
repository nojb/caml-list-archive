Hello, OCaml-programmers,

I have to announce a tool which is useful in sorting/listing/moving files.

It's name "pftdbns" is a short hand for "put files to directories (sorted) by name structure".

It takes filenames, maps each char of the filename into a char, representing
the charclass of it (a..z and A..Z -> "l" (letter), 0...9 -> "d" (digit" and so on).

Thsi yields to an easy way of sorting files by names, based upon file-naming
with certain filenaming-conventions.

So, for example  "hello.txt" and "ballo.txt" are part of the same name structure,
as well as "1001.txt" and "8251.txt" but also "8251.jpg" are of the same name
structure.

The default behaviour is to move files into directories. The names of the directories
are choosen from the string, which represents the name structure.

But since version 0.2.2 this defaulkt behaviour can be overriden, so that the
files will not be moved, but only the names (or names and the namestructure strings)
will be printed.

So, I hope you enjoy this program, and I think if you have to handle a lot
of files, this will be very helpful.

You can find the tool here:
    	ftp://www.belug.org/new/user/ob/Programs/Tools/pftdbns/ 

There also is a README in this directory, so that you can read more details.

A description can also be found here:
   http://www.belug.org/~ob/ftp-area.html 

pftdbns uses the GPL-license.

Best Regards,
     Oliver Bandel
