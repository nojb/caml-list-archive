Lex and yacc are amazilingly powerful tools that are let down by the
fact the code they produce is C code.

Ocaml(lex|yacc) extend on the very powerful lex/yacc concepts but produce
Ocaml code whick hoos in very nicely with a powerful functional/imperative
OO language.

The thing that amazes me about the original lex and yacc is that all
the tutorials I've seen for using them only deal with trivially simple
parsing problems when they are capable of som much more.
