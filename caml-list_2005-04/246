Another kind of library which would benefit from such effort is
XML parsing. I know about pxp, expat, xml-light, ocaml-xmlr, tony, 
xmllexer, and there might be others.

It would be great to have some common interface. An event-driven 
interface is probably easier to agree upon. There are many points to 
address (external entities, encodings, namespace processing, ... even if 
the features are not available in all the parsers).

Anyone interested in this discussion ?
