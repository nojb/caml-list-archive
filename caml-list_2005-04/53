I take issue with this statement, not because of some personal vendetta,
but because it dismisses some very useful tools.

When I am developing software, I often find that at the beginning, static
typing is a burden that I would rather not be bothered with for the simple
reason that I don't know what types are to be used.  Later in development,
once I know more about my problem space, I will migrate to using some
language that uses a static (preferably strong) type system.

Saying some programming tool isn't nice because it isn't "statically
checked" is short-sighted and I'd rather not see a novice come away with
the impression that if a language/tool is not statically checked, it's
somehow inferior.
