In the mean time I have learnt a bit more about the RRD-libraries of
some languages and it seems to me the only addon (I might be wrong) is
that you can create rrd-graphs on the fly using a cgi.

That is not really what I need.

This is about what I want to do with exim-related logs.  And it seems
that it is only necessary to create output that can be directed as
input to RRD-commands which will do the rest.

I am a newcomer to RRD and programming is more a hobby than a career
to me.  I will enjoy looking at what you have done to learn from it
and probably use the knowledge to create custom-made tools for my
situation.

As far as the sponsoring is concerned I apologise for my lack of
resources :)

Enjoy your day.
