Hello,

after working on it again, the mailbox-cleaner-tool,
which throws away doublettes of mails (comparing
body-contents), is now available on ftp as
version 1.0.0.

It's a small tool, but if you have mutiple copies of mails in your
mail-folder, it is helpful to you.

It reads from stdin and writes to stdout.

You can download it here:
  ftp://www.belug.org/new/user/ob/Programs/Tools/mbox-cleaner/mbox-cleaner-1.0.0.tar.gz

Have fun with it. :)

Ciao,
   Oliver Bandel
