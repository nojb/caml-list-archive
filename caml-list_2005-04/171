Has anyone had luck using oprofile to profile ocaml-generated executables?=

I've played around with it, and it's quite nice, and seems to have some rea=

advantages over gprof (works sensibly in the presence of threads, works=20
without overhead or instrumentation, etc.) The one thing I haven't been abl=

to get working, though, is call-graph analysis. To me, it looks like the=20
call-graph information isn't available for ocaml executables. Has anyone ha=

any luck with getting this to work?
