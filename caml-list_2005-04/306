Hello,

Well, not a real general wrapper, but in a program that I wrote and that
I rewrite from scratch to have a more sophisticated functionality, I
also want to add code that creates RRD-tool output.
Maybe it would make sense to do it as a library. But this is not planned
now.


The program I mentioned was a sendmail-loganalyzer and it goes through
a whole sendmail-logfile and creates outputs like these:

It is an Ocaml program with some hundreds lines of code (including
many dead code segments and a lot of comments and many empty lines)
which reads in *a complete* sendmail-logfile and throws out the above-like
stuff.

The new version (had started the project, but did not worked on it very often)
of this program will be able to read in the maillogs-files (normally two files,
which will be both read, if the logrotation has renamed the files) and
does it analyze not necessarily as a complete file.... it will be able
to read in the necessary data for time intervalls, so that one can say:
give me the maillogs-data for every 15 minutes or every hours.

And it is intended to then write the results in an rrd-like format,
or maybe even database creation and such stuff will be done by the
program.

Because of the verbose comments in the files and some dead code
eve in this version, the code base has now about 700 lines.
It's not completed, but I can throw out a lot of stuff.

I didn't included the RRD-code right now, so this is something that
will be added late on.

But the rrd-interface is already planned.


Maybe this is not what you are looking for, but you asked for RRDtool and
that is something that is at least intended to use in this sendmai-oganalyzer.

IMHO rrdtool is cool. And if you have a patient way of living (or if
you are interested in sponsoring me ;-)) then your problem will be solved very quickly. :)
