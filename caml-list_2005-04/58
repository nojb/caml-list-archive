Actually, I don't quite think so - buffering can often be regarded an
optimization and select could be implemented just by checking the
buffer in advance (as others have suggested).  I also suppose there is
at least some kind of buffering even inside UNIX OS kernels with a
"select" (or "poll" in Solaris) system call.

I rather want to avoid multi-threading if select could be easy enough,
because the former is often too tricky due to the possibility of
deadlocks and races.
