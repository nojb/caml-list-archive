This is sort of what I thought.  I also thought that perhaps my posts
contains an [X-]No-Archive header.  Although I don't have the original
messages --- they are sitting on the hard drive of a computer with a
zapped motherboard at the moment --- I'm fairly certain that neither
is the case.  I use mutt, and I don't add any fancy headers.
