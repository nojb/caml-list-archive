Yes, RRDtool will be used via commandline intefcace, and so it is not much effort
to write data into it. It could also be done via a call tu the function "system"

Well, unfortunately that programming is a hobby for me is now the situation
I'm in... looking for a job.

Well, it will need some time, because I do not always work on the program
and do a lot of different things.

Well, that situation is the same, when looking at my ressources and
this was the reason to mention the sponsoring. ;-)
