Right, it is one of the difficult cases, but in general I just had
simple element-wise operations (of type 'a -> 'a -> 'a) in mind.

Yes, I agree polymorphic equality can be more useful in practice,
though I'm not very sure about polymorphic inequalities (perhaps
except for the purpose of ordering when implementing containers such
as sets, trees, ...), in particular concerning abstract types as
somebody else mentioned...?
