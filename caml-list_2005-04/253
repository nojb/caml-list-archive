Probably just an oversight. Since Labltk is poorly documented and not 
very widely used, there are few people in a position to find the bugs.

following workaround:


Actually, that's not where you want to make the change. The code you 
modified was automatically generated from a file called Widgets.src, 
which you will find in $OCAML_SOURCE/otherlibs/labltk.

What you need to do is to open up Widgets.src and find the blocks that 
start with

   subtype option(arc) {

and so on ... there's one for each canvas item type. Just add "State" to 
the options in each of those blocks. Once you see it it should be pretty 
obvious.

I'd suggest you make the modifications as I described, rebuild OCaml and 
make sure it works, then submit your request (with a patch or at least a 
description of the fix) to the OCaml bug tracker. It may take a while, 
but unless there's some good reason for not including that option (can't 
imagine what reason there would be), it should eventually get into the 
distribution.
