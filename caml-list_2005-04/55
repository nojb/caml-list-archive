I think that current VM is optimized for speed and doesn't do more bytecode
checking than strictly necessary. That means that someone could forge some
bytecode file that would take control of the VM and then can call the whole
C api. Tricky, but feasible.
You might need to add load-time or runtime bytecode checks in order to
secure the VM.
