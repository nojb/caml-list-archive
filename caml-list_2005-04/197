Hello to the list.

Is CamlGI still actively maintained?  I'm writing a CGI/FastCGI program 
using it, and have been having some trouble with the library.

My CGI program is designed to be a more flexible way to index web 
pages.  It's not finished yet, but a not-very-polished toy example can 
be found at http://capricorn.dnsalias.org/mike/index/ .  (I may as well 
mention that "not very polished" means, among other things, "not known 
to work in browsers other than Firefox, and known to display wrong in 
Safari").

When used as a FastCGI, the indexing script hangs, either usually or 
always, after writing out exactly 8KB of data (that is, 8192 bytes, no 
more, no less).  After 30 seconds, mod_fastcgi times out the 
connection, but mysteriously writes out the rest of the script's 
output.  It is quite clear that the script has finished by the time the 
hang occurs and that all its output has been written with Unix.write, 
as it displays even if killed with signal 9 while hanging; therefore I 
think it may be a formatting error in the output routines of CamlGI.

The script also sometimes breaks its output pipe to the server, which 
stays broken it until it is restarted manually (eg sudo killall 
index.fcgi).  This may or may not be a separate bug.

The plain CGI version works just fine, if a bit slow, but some of the 
features of the script only work in the FastCGI version, such as 
thumbnailing.

Has anyone familiar with CamlGI seen either of these issues before, or 
have any idea how to resolve them?

Thanks for your time,
--Mike Hamburg
