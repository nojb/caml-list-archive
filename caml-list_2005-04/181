SCOPE

 Web Services technology aims at providing standard mechanisms for
 describing the interface and the services available on the web, as well
 as protocols for locating such services and invoking them (e.g. WSDL,
 UDDI, SOAP). Innovations are moving towards two main directions:
 The first one tends to the definition of new standards
 that support the specification of complex services out of
 simpler ones (the so called Web Service orchestration and choreography).
 Several proposals have been already set up: BPML, XLANG and
 BizTalk, WSFL, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, etc...
 The second approach consists of the design of new (meta-)Web Services to
 be exploited at run-time by other Web Services: e.g. managing
 the cooperation of Web Services or acting as dynamic registry services.

 Formal methods, which privide formal machinery for representing and
 analysing the behavior of communicating concurrent/distributed systems,
 may potentially play a fundamental role in the development of such
 innovations. First of all they may help in understanding the basic
 mechanisms (in terms of semantics) which characterize different
 orchestration and choreography languages and to focus on the essence=20
 of new features that are needed. Secondly they may provide a formal=20
 basis for reasoning about Web Service semantics (behaviour and=20
 equivalence): e.g. for realizing registry services where retrieval=20
 is based on the meaning of a service and not just a Web Service name.=20
 Thirdly also studies on formal coordination paradigms can be exploited=20
 for developing mechanisms for complex run-time Web Service coordination.=
=20
 Finally, given the importance of critical application areas for=20
 Web Services like E-commerce, the development of the Web Service=20
 technology can certainly take advantage from formal analisys of=20
 security properties and performance in concurrency theory.

 The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working
 on Web Services and Formal Methods in order to activate a fruitful
 collaboration in this direction of research. This, potentially, could
 also have a great impact on the current standardization phase of Web
 Service technologies.

LIST OF TOPICS

 The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

   - Protocols and standards for WS (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, etc... )
   - Languages and descripion methodologies for
     Coreography/Orchestration/Workflow
     (BPML, XLANG and BizTalk, WSFL, WS-BPEL, WS-CDL, YAWL, etc... )
   - Coordination techniques for WS
     (transactions, agreement, coordination services, etc...)
   - Semantics-based dynamic WS discovery services
     (based on Semantic Web/Ontology techniques or other semantic theories)
   - Security, Performance Evaluation and Quality of Service of WS
   - Semi-structured data and XML related technologies
   - Comparisons with different related technologies/approaches

SUBMISSIONS

 Submissions must be original and should not have been published=20
 previously or be under consideration for publication while being=20
 evaluated for this workshop.

 Papers are to be prepared in LNCS format and must not exceed=20
 15 pages. Accepted original papers will be published in the=20
 workshop proceedings. It is planned to publish the proceedings=20
 in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)=20
 series ( www.springeronline.com/lncs ).

 As done for the previous WS-FM'04 workshop, we intend to publish a
 journal special issue inviting full versions of papers selected among
 those presented at the workshop.
