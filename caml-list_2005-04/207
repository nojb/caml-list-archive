It is worth noting that Baretta DE&IT has commissioned a full 
implementation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol from Gerd. The HTTP library will 
be based on Ocamlnet and will export more or less the same API as the 
Netcgi module. We chose this approach rather than FastCGI because the 
FastCGI project seems dead and did not look like a viable solution for 
our Xcaml application server.

Xcaml aims at being a Apache+Tomcat+JSP+Servlet replacement. The Xcaml 
virtual machine and API are already complete, but the performance which 
they achieve in conjunction with Apache is mediocre. Gerd's new HTTP 
connector Ocamlnet will give us top notch performance while without 
sacrificing the safety guarantees of the Ocaml language and VM.

The new library will be released to the community by Baretta DE&IT and 
Gerd Stolpmann jointly under the terms of the GPL. When the integration 
with the Xcaml server will be done, the full Application System/Xcaml 
will be released under the terms of the GPL.
