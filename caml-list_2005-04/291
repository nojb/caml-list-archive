Michael had just turned thirteen. He was pretty smart, or atleast that is the way he acted. He knew all about everything. Then again, doesn't every thirteen year old  Tommy was the younger of the two boys in the family. Still, at twelve he stood up for himself pretty good whenever Michael teased him. Most of the time.Both boys had been pushing each other trying to prove whowas the man of the house. It was hard on them when dad died and in a way it was their way of getting over it. Mom let them settle most of their own fights and arguments. When she did step in though it was only after she had warned them to settle it or else.That also meant that they were both in big trouble when she did have to take action. It also meant that neither of the two boys would be rushing to sit down in the near future. Mom always settled their disagreements and fighting with a paddle telling both of them that if they had to behave like little boys then she would treat them like little boys.  Tom!
