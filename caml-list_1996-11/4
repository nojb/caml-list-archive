Hi,

I have a textbox which doesn't wrap, and is disabled.  But when I put
in a line of text that is significantly longer than the width of the
textbox, the line disappears from sight!  When I select part of the
line, all text to the left of the cursor appears again, and it also
appears if I scroll (with the scrollbar) to the right, once the bar
gets to roughly .25 to .75.  I'm using the CamlTk interface for Tk4.0.

I hope you can help,

Thanks in advance,

Rob
