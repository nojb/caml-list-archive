I would like to announce the new release of caml2csl, which may be called
caml2ocaml.
Now, it translates Caml Light 0.7 programs to Objective Caml 1.03.
It is available by ftp at the following address:

ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/Usercontribs/caml2ocamlV2.0.tar.gz

As usual, comments are welcome.
