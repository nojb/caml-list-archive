    Bonjour,

Actually that is what Helmut Simonis was trying to do with his paper.
He considers :
- difficulty (= level of "complexity" of the filtering algorithm needed to
solve the problem without backtracking)
- minimality (= number of non-redundant information for each deduction)

> These are not formal definition ... yet, but using a representation of

Constraint programming is has a higher-level representation but I guess
the same could be achieved in SAT.
