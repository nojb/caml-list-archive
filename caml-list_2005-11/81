It was my considered opinion that Jon's revisions reduced the overall
quality of the article, and therefore I reverted those parts I found
detrimental. Others may disagree; this is a natural part of the
anarchistic editorial process on Wikipedia and eventually you must
grow accustomed to having changes reverted without being offended. But
I do affirm and repeat that a community effort to improve the OCaml
article on Wikipedia would be wonderful. End of OT discussion? -Mike
