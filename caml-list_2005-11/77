Wikipedia is a large, famous, on-line, reader-editable encyclopaedia with a 
page dedicated to OCaml:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocaml

The page gets a lot of hits and is, most likely, the first port of call by 
many people when trying to learn about OCaml.

Unfortunately, the quality of this page is substantially worse than that of 
the equivalent pages on SML, Haskell and so on. I have tried to improve the 
page myself but most of my links have been removed following complaints to 
admim by an anonymous, German-speaking, OCaml-using physicist with the IRC 
nic "tf" and all of my corrections were removed by Mike Lin. My code examples 
remain though.

So if anyone out there has a little spare time and wants to do something 
productive, please try to improve this page.
