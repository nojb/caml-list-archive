Dear All friends,
I use the GPack.paned for separating the two areas of my program'GUI. These
two areas are GPack.vbox. When I resize the two areas, there is a little
noise in the boundary of these two areas. But when I move the mouse in that
areas, the noise are cleared and two areas are presented well. It seems tha=
t
if the areas are refreshed, the noise in the boundary will be removed. I
don't know the reason of this problem. I sent email to the ocaml_biginers
and one person reply me I don't have this problem in my program. Maybe I
must do a special setting in my program.
does anybody has any idea?
thanks,
Mark
