Dear all,

In the same spirit of http://acm.uva.es/, I've set up a local and tiny
ocaml programming contest web site (with online submission and
evaluation).
Until now the only users are my students, but the contest is open to
everybody. So feel free to use it!

The compilation, in the evaluation system, is done by:
ocamlopt unix.cmxa str.cmxa nums.cmxa  -pp camlp4o file.ml

I update the problem set on a regular basis (about two or three new
problems by semester).

suggestions (new problems...), questions and comments are welcome!

a+
