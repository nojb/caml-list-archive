Hmm did you install a .server file in /usr/lib/bonobo/servers ? (I
guess so otherwise you wouldn't see the applet listed in the panel
menu).

The first time you install that file you have to log out/log in so
that bonobo-activation-server has a chance to read the file (you can
also simply kill it but that may confuse other apps). But after that
it should just work.

HTH,
