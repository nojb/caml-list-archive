Hello All,

If your system has a static version of libgtkgl (eg on Debian/Sid the
libgtkgl2.0-dev package provides /usr/lib/libgtkgl-2.0.a) you could
pass the "-cclib /usr/lib/libgtkgl-2.0.a" option (without the quotes)
to ocamlopt.

But for this particular library, I believe things are much less simple
in practice, because I think that gtkgl depends upon many other shared
libraries.

You might also consider passing the "-ccopt -static" option to
ocamlopt linking.

Again, GTKGL is not supposed (as GTK) to be statically linked...

Maybe the simplest solution is to find the suitable (rpm or other)
package of libgtkgl for your user!

Regards.
