Well, this is one single project, but it's a good attempt. :)

Why using bytecode?

If portability is not so important (for now?!),
why not using native code?

Well, the kernel is very important... if it is slow,
so the whole system is slower... this is different
to a fast kernel/operating system, where only one
application is a littlebis slower.

But: if the kernel is less used and the main time the
program is in usermode (not kernel mode), then the
speed of the kernel is not sooooo much a big problem.
But the kernel is the part of the system, which is
central... so IMHO it should be very fast!

well... IMHO graphic card drivers is not ideally done
in OCaml, and not in C... at least certain parts would
necessaryly be coded in Assembler...

...but if you can show the opposite, that's fine. ;-)

Ciao,
