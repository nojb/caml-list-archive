Hello,

I'm currently writting a graphical client for a server (demexp, in OCaml
with Lablgtk binding) and I'm realising that I lack most of knowledge to
structure an application in an correct object-oriented way.

So I'm looking for a good book (in French or English) showing how to use
object-oriented programming mechanisms to structure a GUI
application. For example, how to use OO mechanisms to have good
responsiveness, allow the undoing of operations, handle several
operations at once, etc.  I'm not interested in a book detailing the use
of a particular toolkit or language. Of course, a generic book with
examples applied in a given language/toolkit does not affraid me.

I've already read the Design Patterns book (Gamma et al.) and I know a
little about SmallTalk, C++, Java and Eiffel.

Many thanks in advance for any pointer,
Yours,
d.
