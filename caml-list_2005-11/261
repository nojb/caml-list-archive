Actually it's just a consequence of the internal representation of
classes, which is described in the C interface section.
That is, each object contains an array with all its methods, which are
function closures.
This is the reason you need the flag for closures.
And the condition with closures is quite explicit: this must be
exactly the same program. I also expect that, for native code, it must
be the same architecture.
