Okay, the problem was that Xcode by default tries to build a universal binary,
so of course doesn't like the power.o unit compiled for rhapsody when it gets
around to the i386 version. Also by default, Xcode sets different architecture
settings for the Project and the Target.

As an Xcode newbie, I found this confusing.
