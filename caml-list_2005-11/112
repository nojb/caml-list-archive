I have developed a tool that generates a module using Camlp4, and I
would like to be able to test the output. The structure is fairly small
and simple, so it should be sufficient to verify that a generated module
is equivalent to a certain hand-coded module ... but is there a reliable
way to do that?

If it makes a difference, the output consists mainly of two values: a
data structure which is of an abstract type, and an object. The former
is implemented as follows:

   type data = S of string | L of string list | D of t
   and t = {
     data : (string, data) Hashtbl.t;
     mutable locked : bool;
   }

and the latter is an immediate object, but it inherits from a class
defined in another module. The object is associated with two instances
of the above type, has public methods that get and set values, and may
contain one or more sub-objects similar to itself.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
