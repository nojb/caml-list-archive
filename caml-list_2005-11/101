The title of his user page alone will leave you speechless: Dr. Jon D.
Harrop BA MSci PhD. I've never met anyone who used both Dr. and Ph.D.
at the same time, and that includes very accomplished people.

Wikipedia has a policy against self-promotion and link spam. The
purpose of Wikipedia is to disseminate generally useful and objective
encyclopedic knowledge. Instead, Harrop uses it to make
self-aggrandizing claims and increase the Google ranking of and
traffic to his "company" to sell his book.

Leave his spam all over Wikipedia, and soon anyone searching for
"OCaml" on Google will be directed to Harrop's unscientific BS.
