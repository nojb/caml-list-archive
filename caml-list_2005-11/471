Yes...the preprocessor uses rules such as: if an indented block
follows a let, if, try, etc., it's a sequence -- if it follows an
indentifier, then it's an application. This is sound, as far as I can
tell. There is a restriction that a multi-line expression has to start
on its own line, which lets me get away without actually building a
full AST for the source. Ideally that's how it would eventually work,
but...80/20.
