This link wasn't really intended for public consumption, so it's been 
removed.  I forgot to put it in the robots.txt file, so it got out.  My 
apologies for the inconvience.

The good news is that the Pragmatic Programmers have expressed interest in 
publishing the book.  They have a "beta book" deal:
http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/faqs/beta_faq.html

I'll see how quickly I can get the book into the program.  I probably need 
to finish writting it first, however.  This is, however, my new job.

Thanks for the good feedback, however.

Brian
