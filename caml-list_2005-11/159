However all of this misses what I seek, which is a way
to *manually* add backtrace information.

In addition to the annoying errors leading to Not_found
exceptions, there are other exceptions which are supposed
to be caught and sometimes leak, and in addition, there
are exceptions which are thrown when there are USER errors,
and these are caught in the top level and reported.
That's where I want the backtrace .. I want to unwind
it manually.
