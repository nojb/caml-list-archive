As the Ocaml team people remain silent I am afraid your analysis is
correct. OK, we cannot easily do the job during the code generation but
maybe we can rearrange the source files? Say, if we have

[foo.mli]
val f1: ...
val f2: ...

[foo.ml]
let f1 = ...
let f2 = ...

could we transform them (with some camlp4-based source-level tool) to

[foo_f1.mli]
val f1: ...

[foo_f2.mli]
val f2: ...

[foo.mli]
open Foo_f1
open Foo_f2

[foo_f1.ml]
let f1 = ...

[foo_f2.ml]
let f2 = ...

Isn't it equivalent to the initial version but can be linked separately?
