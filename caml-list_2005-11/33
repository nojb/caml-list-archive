Hi all,

I'm currently using ocamlex and ocamlyacc but have recently
heard of parser combinators. Searching the net I found the
Pagoda Core Foundation library which has this:

   http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/pagoda/doc/cf/Cf_parser.html

Its obviously nice to have documentation, but its also nice to
have working examples. Anyone have any?

Erik

mood you can find all sorts of stuff that are peaceable, loving, 
kind. On the other hand, if you wake up in a foul temper then there's
plenty of hateful stuff to help you vent your spleen. In reality, 
if you believe the Quoran is the word of god then you have to take 
both on board. You can't pick and choose."
