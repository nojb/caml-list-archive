Still, you have sometimes to write C libraries, even if they can 
compromise the safety of the program. Using Obj in a OCaml library with 
an abstract interface in order to get additional optimizations can be 
useful, but only if you know what you're doing.

The original author was talking about some code generator that was 
targeting OCaml so I guess in that case especialy using Obj makes sense.
