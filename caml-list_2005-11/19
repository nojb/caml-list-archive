   I had occasion today to look through the pa_r.ml, and noticed the
   following (line 329 in OCaml 3.08.4):
   
     | "object"; cspo = OPT class_self_patt; cf = class_structure; "end" ->
         (* <:expr< object $opt:cspo$ $list:cf$ end >> *)
         MLast.ExObj loc cspo cf ]
   
   So a quotation expander was created for objects as ordinary expressions,
   but evidently there was something wrong with it. Anyone know what the
   problem was?
   
I believe the comment shows what the code should look like if
immediate objects would have been implemented in the quotation
expander q_MLast.ml. However, immediate objects are not yet in
the quotation expander, therefore the real code is what the
quoatation expander would have produced (if immediate objects had
been implemented).

Bye,

Hendrik
