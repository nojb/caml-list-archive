Mike has offered to reaccept your submission if it's more
encyclopedia-style.  However, I think your claim that you can do
completely without type annotations is a bit misleading.  You need
some (module) types to give structure to your programs, and some types
simply cannot be inferred (polymorphic record fields, for example).
