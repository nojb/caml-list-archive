I think I'm with Skaller here- Objects in Ocaml are much less powerfull 
than they are in (for example) Java or Python.  For example, objects in 
Ocaml can not have non-virtual (non-overloadable) methods, or static 
(global) methods.  So patterns like singletons are hard to implement with 
Ocaml objects.

But that's OK- because Ocaml provides other ways to provide those 
capabilities.  The problem I have with a lot of pure-OO languages is the 
need to make objects do everything.  The proper way to do a singleton in 
Ocaml is to use modules, not objects.  If you're not using the true power 
of objects- inheritance, virtual functions, and overloading- you shouldn't 
be using objects.  So the fact that Ocaml doesn't provide support for 
these non-objects isn't a problem.
