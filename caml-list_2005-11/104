I was a bit surprised when I started playing with Caml objects.  I
couldn't find a definite reference, but it seems that the object
system was indeed inspired by the "Objective" family of languages (the
"evolutionary approach" to add a Smalltalk-like object system
described by Brad Cox in the 80s, later picked up by NeXT).  Is this
really the case?  Or is the similarity just a coincidence?
