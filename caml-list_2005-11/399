If you have a shift/reduce conflict the default action is to shift. To 
get rid of the warning declare a higher precedence for the symbol being 
shifted. Say, there is a conflict when parsing FOO BAR - FOO could be 
reduced or BAR being shifted; declare in your Yacc file:

%nonassoc FOO
%nonassoc BAR

Nor BAR has higher precedence and gets shifted without creating a 
conflict. Obviously, this kind of conflict resolution requires some 
care.
