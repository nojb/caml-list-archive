Hi,

we'd like to announce the availability of "Sexplib", which is a
library for handling S-expressions.  It features a syntax extension
for OCaml using the Camlp4-preprocessor, which generates efficient
code derived from type definitions to convert OCaml-values to
S-expressions and vice versa.  Errors during conversions are reported
fairly exactly and readably.

This syntax extension supports all extensional type constructions
(tuples/products, sum types, record types, variant types) together
with polymorphism.  Other datatypes (objects; abstract ones) require
user-defined converters, which can be added very easily.

The parsing and pretty-printing functions for S-expressions together
with the automatically generated converters make this library very
useful for a variety of purposes, e.g. for representing datastructures
in human-readable form, for debugging, etc.  We are using it for
handling fairly large and complex software configurations, and have
found this representation and functionality extremely helpful in
practice.

The Sexplib-library itself was initially derived from Martin Sandin's
Tywith-library, and is available free of charge under the
LGPL-license.  You can download it from the following site:

  http://www.janestcapital.com/ocaml

We, the Quant-group at Jane St. Capital, are in the process of setting
up this site to publish free software developed at our company.  We
hope you will find a lot more useful libraries there in the near
future.

Best regards,
Markus Mottl for the Quant Group at Jane St. Capital
