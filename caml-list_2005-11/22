Ok, wow.  Didn't mean to make people mad.  It was more a rant that was
not meant for comment and was /definitely not a bash on LablGL/.  I was
just trying to say that I, in general and as a personal preference,
don't like labels.  It's not just an OCaml thing.  I don't use it in any
language that offers it.  I apologize if I was unclear.  I understand
the value but I just find them (incredibly) annoying.  Again, personal
preference.  I was /only/ using LablGL as an example of labled arguments
because it was a /relevenat/ libray that uses labels.  Sorry...
