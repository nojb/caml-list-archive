The constraint "a single digit by block" is named "all different"  in
combinatorial optimization literature. The problem is that your
implementation is too naive : the "optimal" version (in the sense it can
ensure you always make a choice that has at least one solution for the
'alldiff' constraint) needs a matching algorithm and some graph theory.

There is a nice paper by Helmut Simonis "Sudoku as a constraint problem"
with reference to the relevant paper for the algorithms.

    http://www.icparc.ic.ac.uk/~hs/

You could also try to write a solver with FaCiLe (which actually contains
the optimal algorithm for "alldiff" constraints)
