Sorry for the confusion, but I should have mentioned in my
announcement that it is available under the LGPL including the special
exception also employed by INRIA to work around the linking
restrictions.  In case you have downloaded the library, you may have
seen that it was already distributed that way.  Thus you don't have
any excuse now for not using the library ;-)

Regards,
Markus
