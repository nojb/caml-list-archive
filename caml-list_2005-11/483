Nice job, but I don't think it has something to do with Olivier's
remarks. Serious software written in OCaml exists (Astr=E9e, Coq, ..),
no one doubts that. What lacks is mainstream serious software, and it
makes OCaml not so visible.

People don't realize OCaml is a general purpose language: I was once
told on an IRC chan: "OCaml ? I only know one software written in
OCaml..." Also, people learn to write many fun real-world application
in C, but only "boring" scientific stuff in OCaml (when they're taught
OCaml). That's the kind of problems which was adressed.

Cheers.
