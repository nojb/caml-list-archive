Come on, this is not fair.

This is not fair, too. The links to his own pages can nevertheless be
objective. Actually, there are lots of scientific sites where very
well-known authors also sell their books (by including links to Amazon
etc.).

The point is that Wikipedia has no idea what quality is, and falls back
to a half-baked idea of "being objective = I must not advertise myself".
Very poor.

If his site has top-quality I don't have a problem with that.
