Have you tried that static analyser for exceptions?

If you can do this then it could also be used to implement my allocation 
profiling idea. I'm still learning camlp4 (I'll put up a web page on what 
I've done ASAP) and I'm not up to that yet, but I think it is entirely 
feasible. One problem would be the existence of many functions with the same 
name.

Non-tail recursion?
