In many cases this is completely inadequate. The AS/Xcaml application 
server, for example, cannot terminate on an uncaught exception in a 
program module. The main loop must catch the exception and do its best 
to report it, without aborting the execution of the server. This means 
that I need to get the backtrace within Ocaml code by applying some kind 
of function to the exception object. I tried to write a C function 
providing this kind of information, but I never managed to get it to work.
