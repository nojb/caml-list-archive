Has anyone looked at www.rubyquiz.com <http://www.rubyquiz.com>? I know tha=
t
its a takeoff from yet another site (or sites) but its interesting. Since
I've been interested in OCaml for a few years now, but haven't had an
problem that I could really use it on, I've decided to go through all of
these. Of course the solutions are in Ruby but it would be an interesting
exercise to try them in ocaml.
