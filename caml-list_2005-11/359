Hi from http://www.auroragames.com

For 15 billion years, planets, stars, and galaxies have formed and died amid the infinity of the expanding universe. Some of these lonely aggregates of matter, in their short lives as recognizable objects spinning through space, interact to produce the dynamic chemical processes necessary for life. In rarer instances, life does't end as a casualty of the chaos around it, but claws its way up the evolutionary ladder to sentiense and, sometimes, even the star.

Play in online space rpg on our site and become the real leader in evolution on your planet.
