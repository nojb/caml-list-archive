All our conferences are non-profit. They bring together the elite of the world science; so far, we have had seven Nobel Laureates speaking at the opening ceremonies. The conferences always take place in some of the most attractive places of the world. All those who come to our conferences once, always love to come back (because of the unique professional quality and the extremely creative atmosphere); lists of past participants are on the web, as well as the details of all future conferences.

These conferences are in line with the newest recommendations of the US National Science Foundation and of the EU research sponsoring agencies, to stress multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary research (M+I+T++ research). The speakers and activities at our conferences truly support this type of scientific interaction.

Among the main topics of these conferences are: "E-education and E-business with special emphasis on the Internet related research in technical and non-technical fields." All topics directly or indirectly related to current and future DARPA and NASA projects are also welcome (all papers from all past IPSI conferneces are stored by NASA).

Other topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Internet
* Computer Science and Engineering
* Mobile Communications/Computing for Science and Business
* Management and Business Administration
* Education
* e-Medicine
* e-Oriented Bio Engineering/Science and Molecular Engineering/Science
* Environmental Protection
* e-Economy
* e-Law
* Technology Based Art and Art to Inspire Technology Developments
* Internet Psychology
* Internet Phylosophy
* Humanities in General

If you would like to get more information on either conference, please reply to this e-mail message.

If you plan to submit an abstract and paper, please let us know that immediately for planning purposes. Remember that you can submit your paper also to one of the two IPSI Transactions journals.

Sincerely Yours,

Prof. Veljko Milutinovic, Chairman,
IPSI Conferences, Journals, and Tutorials
