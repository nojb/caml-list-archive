I don't know if this is the best place to have a Sudoku solver challenge,
But since many of you posted here, I guess I may also have a go on it :)
-- in other words, I'm sorry if you don't care at all about Sudoku ---

Well, if you are interested, you may wish to have a look at my:
- thirteen lines of Caml (though my lines are not so short)
- of a rather efficient sudoku solver
- that gives all solution for an input grid
- and uses only modules Pervasive and Array.
Thanks Caml !

You may find it here:

I haven't done any advanced benchmarking, but it looks like my code isn't too slow.
