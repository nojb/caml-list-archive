A little thing that I do not understand. Why the wikipedia page is not writ=
ten by the ocaml's team ? An encyclopedia has to been written by "expert" a=
nd in the wiki idea with the help and the comments of the communauty... and=
 a link (just one) to the ffconsultancy.com is not problem is there are man=
y other links even it is a firm. But other links to other compagnies should=
 also added? Why not in the rubric application, a sub-case "firm using ocam=
l" (that develop special applications with ocaml). And why, in this page, t=
here are so little links to applications in ocaml. For example, the soft ht=
tp://www.astree.ens.fr/ which is develop by academics people and using by a=
 firm ?
