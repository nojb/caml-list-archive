Fine.  So recompile it with something like this <http://www.acsa- 
admin.org/2004/abstracts/98.html>.  Buffer overflows are just one  
aspect of secure code, and there's no guarantee that a re- 
implementation of something like libcurl wouldn't be peppered with  
security flaws of a different color.

That's not to say it shouldn't be done.  And if it's a tool that you  
use a lot and that you think could be mode even better, then go for  
it, that's great.  Hell, I might even help out if the project  
interests me somehow.  But for now, if I need a one-off tool for  
doing something curl-esque, it's a much better use of my time to wrap  
an existing library.
