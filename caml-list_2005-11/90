Hello,

Perhaps it would be a good idea to create un page on Wikipedia to explain what 
is a high-level programming language, because its definition in all documents 
related to OCaml definitively do not fit the definition the penguins gave to 
me when I started to go in my lug, which was a language easy to learn and use 
designed for common users, and not only for programers and computer 
scientists. They told me about ABC which led to python which is comonly used 
in softwares as scripting extention for the users.
But OCaml do need some background knowledge to understand the official manual,
which is not true for PHP, Python or Ruby.

Cheers
