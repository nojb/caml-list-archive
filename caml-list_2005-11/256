If you're finding that your system's clipboard is giving you trouble,
emacs can submit the previous form to an inferior caml in tuareg mode
automatically.

Try using 'C-x e' in tuareg mode after doing 'M-x tuareg-run-caml' in tuareg
mode.  You should be at the end of the toplevel form you want to submit.

If it seems like the toplevel is only evaluating the first of a few forms,
when you paste, you might want to make sure that each toplevel insertion
is terminated with ';;' also.

exhibit no net motion. None the less, you may soon begin to notice that
something important is happening.
