Wikipedia is not for self-promotion. At least, it *does* smell a bit 
strange if there are far more links to ffconsultancy on the Wikipeda

That person is called Thomas Fischbacher, and could not reply to your 
private email in time and in deail as he right now is on a conference and 
only has limited network access. More - maybe, but I hope not - in a few 
days.
