Sure. But in Python/Boo, as you mention, you have duck typing. In my
books, that makes it easier to learn Python than OCaml, because that's
one less thing you need to know before starting your first program.

Of course, in OCaml, you have "static duck typing" for objects, but
that's a different issue.

Er... what is a row variable ? :)
Is that a polymorphic variant ?

Iirc, there's an OCaml Wikibook on the Wikipedia.
