Fine by me, though I note that LGPL with linking exemption
need not be restricted to Ocaml: if others adopted this,
for example for C packages, the OCAML would be a misnomer.
OTOH LGPL-OCAML is more suggestive in the case of Ocaml
codes.

BTW: for Debian GPL and LGPL licences do not have to
be provided in full, since they're installed automatically
in /usr/share somewhere. It would be nice if LGPLX/LGPL-OCAML 
was treated the same way.

Although GODI cannot do it yet, eventually it would be nice
to be able to constrain and/or report licences when building
packages -- which requires a licencing system with centralised
licences with recognized keys and behaviour rules.

Maybe INRIA, Gerd and Sven can get together and agree on
an acronym, and also get the licence certified by OSS?

IMHO this licence is a pretty good compromise: it prevents
'closed source' being distributed fully closed, but it doesn't
prevent closed source being used to generate closed binaries,
nor does it prevent closed source being distributed along
with open source (provided that open source remains open).

AFAICS it only 'infects' sources if one derives from
a combination of the open and closed source, then the
closed sources must be opened.
