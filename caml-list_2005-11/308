LOL. It seems that everyone on the caml-list just discovered and solved 
them. :-)

I'll add links from my page to everyone else's OCaml Sudoku solvers, if that's 
ok. :-)

I found the 1905-solution "Sky blunder" to be a good example (warning: 6' 
penis):

I'd be surprised if the functional data structure was responsible for a 100x 
slowdown, 10x maybe. I was going to optimise it but, because it solves 
puzzles in <1sec anyway, I decided to concentrate on making it concise 
instead.

My program uses bitfields to keep track of which digits are valid. That may 
make it asymptotically faster than a brute force approach. I haven't thought 
about it much though (obviously not as much as Pascal!).

On real Sudoku puzzles?

I found a brute force solver written in Lisp on the net. My implementation was 
much slower for valid Sudoku puzzles but just as fast for Sky's erroneous one 
and much faster at finding any solution from a blank board. Of course, I may 
well have been measuring nothing more than language start-up time...
