I really don't see the issue here.  Yep.  He posted several examples =
hosted
on his own server and referenced his own book.  It would have been
significantly more work for him to dig up and test links to examples he
didn't produce.  If more people would contribute, the diversity of =
websites
reference would increase, and the density of FFConsultancy links would
decrease.  Maybe this should be a call for other contributors to aid his
wikipedia work instead of an attack on him attempting to improve the
wikipedia article.

Cheers,
Tony
