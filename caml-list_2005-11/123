Why should it be? Why haven't YOU contributed some text?
The idea of a Wiki is that anyone can contribute.
Wouldn't the Ocaml team be a bit biased?

In fact there is a lot of misleading or missing stuff in Wikipoedia,
and there are also some excellent articles. Try 

Control Inversion (misleading crap about a Java idiom)
Referential Transparency (totally wrong)
Curry-Howard Isomorphism (Superb Article!)

to mention 3 articles I've looked at recently.
(I added a talk article critiquing the transparency article
in the hope some expert would rewrite the article)

Actually, the Ocaml article is not so bad, it just leaves
out some things of importance -- as mentioned there is no
description of some of the key extensions over ML, particularly
polymorphic variants and labelled arguments, nor of key
differences eg mutable fields.
