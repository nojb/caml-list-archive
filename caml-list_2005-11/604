True story: Intel screwed up when it shipped it's first copies of the 
documentation describing EMT64 technology.  See, the 64-bit Pentiums only 
have 36 physical address lines, while the Opterons have 40 (this makes a 
difference in the total amount of real memory that they can address).  The 
first generation of EMT64 manuals Intel shipped out said the chips had 40 
physical address bits.

Hey, Intel- you didn't quite finish filing the serial numbers off there...

Seriously, if it works on one, it'll work on the other (barring SSE3 
requirements).
