Well, yesterday was the first time I had contact to Sudoku at all.
I looked for pTeX, the japanese descendant of TeX and found this page:

  http://www.users.waitrose.com/~nihilist/sudoku.html

After I read that I thought, maybe to rewrite it in OCaml.

But it seems this work was already done.


Ciao,
