Do the authors of said scientific sites (Harrop's isn't one of them)
spam Wikipedia with links to their sites, while hiding behind
anonymous IPs (until they are discovered that is)?

The point is, if Harrop doesn't have megalomania, he sure acts like he
does. Look at some earlier versions of the Wikipedia article. He
spammed every section with a blatant link to his "ffconsultancy".

"Uses of Ocaml: 1. Something 2. Visualization {{link to
ffconsultancy}}. (No more uses) "
C'mon, Ocaml is a general purpose language.

He also diluted his spamming with "useful" info that incidentally
betrayed his less than stellar knowledge of the subject in the first
place.

The bad benchmark page is just an ad, really, a pretext to link-spam.

Look at his constant USENET spamming and trolling, if you don't see a
very old pattern here.
