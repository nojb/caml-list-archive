1. For the current implementation it's safe (use Data_bigarray_val(v) to
change the data pointer). I don't see any reason why it could become unsafe.
2. It is up to you whether to use this feature or not.

OCaml is a developing language, so IMHO nobody guarantees that nothing will
change in the future.
