No it can not. The moduler header must be contiguous and not rearranged by
linker. In absence of .cmx (and name -> mangled name table) OCaml uses the
header to call functions by position. Thus, as it is now, no part of
header can be eliminated, which in reality means that almost everything,
from linkers perspective, is reachable and can not be removed by 
--gc-functions.

Right rigth, that's exactly what's required
