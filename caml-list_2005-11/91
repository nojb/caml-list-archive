As near as I can figure, the definition is simple.  Assembly language is 
not a high level language.  Everything else is.

In other words, all languages are high-level, some are just more 
high-level than others.

OK, here's the thing: Ocaml is a different paradigm than Python, Ruby, and 
PHP.  If you know Pascal, C, Fortran, etc., then learning PHP isn't 
difficult, because it too is a procedural language.  If you know C++, 
Java, etc., then learning Python or Ruby isn't that hard, because they're 
Object Oriented languages too.  If you already know SML or Haskell, 
learning Ocaml wouldn't be that hard.  The problem is that most people 
don't know SML or Haskell.

Learning a new paradigm is hard.  As someone who has done it three times 
now (moving from the sphagetti code of Basic to the procedural style of 
Pascal, then moving to Object Oriented, and most recently Functional), 
trust me on this.  Learning a new paradigm makes learning a new language 
10 times as hard AT LEAST as learning a new language in the old paradigm.
