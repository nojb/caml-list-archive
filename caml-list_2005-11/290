     Bonjour,

What I understood in Helmut's paper is that most of the Sudoku instances
were backtrack-free when a combination of matching constraints was used
(same with card, cardinality matrix, etc.)

When shaving is allowed, forward checking or just bound consistency closes
almost all the instances without backtracking. That might be a better
advice for "ad hoc" solvers like Frisch's since he seems to be already
doing forward checking.

It shouldn't be difficult to add a simple search (generate) is it ?
