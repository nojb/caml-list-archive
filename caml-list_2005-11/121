My 2 cents:
   camlp4o pa_yourextension.cmo pr_o.cmo input.ml > auto.ml
   camlp4o manual.ml > manual2.ml
   diff auto.ml manual2.ml

Of course if you have a lot of automatic identifiers, that's not very 
convenient. But at least you will get the same indentation if your 
identifiers have the same length.
