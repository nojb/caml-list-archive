This has come up on the list before (even by me once), but
I'm was wondering if anyone (like the maintainers) would have any
interest in a patch to the 3.09 codebase to add strptime, strftime and
asctime?  It would probably work in the 3.08 code, too, but I figure
the most current version is the place to start.

The gmtime.c file seems like the logical place to put this, and I
don't think it would be a whole lot of work to do.  If there is
interest, I'll do it.  If this would be
wrong/problematic/foolish/duplicitive or anything
else then I would appreciate knowing that, too.

Thank you.
