While this perhaps would be a good thing, as one should expect the INRIA 
people to be able to present their work in a reasonable and balanced way, 
I'd think it's more their duty to work on the compiler than to do 
merchandising on non-scientific channels. Especially as Wikipedia is, 
well, Wikipedia. I think they are busy enough doing that kind of work for 
research grants, say.

Yes, sure. I would not have minded a single link, say to Jon's book (even 
though it might be considered bad taste if he had placed it of his own), 
on that one Wikipedia page, but if things go so badly out of proportion, 
that's a completely different issue.
