I rather suspect that Jon was making a joke here....

I think this really is a problem, although there are a few exceptions
(mldonkey and unison come to mind.)  But the lack of applications is not, I
think, for lack of suitability of the language.  The company where I work
(quick hiring plug: http://janestcapital.com/ocaml.html) has had quite a bi=
t
of luck building rather interesting and practical trading and financial
applications in OCaml, but those are all for internal use, so it doesn't
help much for OCaml's visibility.
