                           CONFERENCE GOALS

Modern information systems  rely increasingly on combining concurrent,
distributed, mobile,  reconfigurable and heterogenous  components. New
models,   architectures,   languages,   verification  techniques   are
necessary  to cope  with  the  complexity induced  by  the demands  of
today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a
successful approach,  in that  they provide abstractions  that cleanly
separate behavior from communication, therefore increasing modularity,
simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.

Building  on the  success of  the previous  editions,  this conference
provides  a  well-established  forum  for  the  growing  community  of
researchers  interested  in   models,  languages,  architectures,  and
implementation techniques for coordination.

                          PREVIOUS EDITIONS

The previous  editions of COORDINATION  took place in  Cesena (Italy),
Berlin  (Germany), Amsterdam  (Netherlands),  Limassol (Cyprus),  York
(UK), Pisa (Italy) and Namur  (Belgium). More details are available at
http://www.coordination2005.org.

                          TOPICS OF INTEREST

They include but are not limited to:

* Theoretical  models  and  foundations  for  coordination:  component
  composition, concurrency, mobility, dynamic aspects of coordination,
  emergent behavior.
* Specification, refinement,  and analysis of  software architectures:
  patterns and  styles, verification of  functional and non-functional
  properties.
* Coordination,  architectural,  and  interface definition  languages:
  implementation, interoperability, heterogeneity.
* Multiagent    systems   and    coordination:    models,   languages, 
  infrastructures.
* Dynamic   software   architectures:    mobile   code   and   agents, 
  configuration, reconfiguration, self-organization.
* Coordination  and   modern  distributed  computing:   Web  services,
  peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous
  computing.
* Programming languages,  middleware, tools, and  environments for the
  development of coordinated applications
* Industrial  relevance of  coordination  and software  architectures:
  programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and
  coordination models, case studies.
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination

                             PROCEEDINGS

Proceedings of previous editions  of this conference were published by
Springer, in the  Lecture Notes in Computer Science  (LNCS) series and
are available as  LNCS volumes 1061, 1282, 1594,  1906, 2315, 2949 and
3454. The intention is to continue this series.

                       SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers electronically in PostScript
or PDF  using a two-phase  online submission process.  Registration of
the paper information and abstract  (max. 250 words) must be completed
before 10 January  2006. Submission of the full paper  is due no later
than 17 January 2006. Further instructions on the submission procedure
will be published at http://www.cs.unibo.it/discotec06/Coordination06.

Submissions must  be formatted according  to the LNCS  guidelines (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) and  must not exceed 15
pages  in length.  Papers  that are  not  in the  requested format  or
significantly exceed the mandated length may be rejected without going
through the review phase.

Submissions  should  explicitly  state  their contribution  and  their
relevance to the theme of the conference. Other criteria for selection
will be originality, significance, correctness, and clarity.

Simultaneous or  similar submissions to other  conferences or journals
are not allowed.

                         CONFERENCE LOCATION

The conference  will be hosted  by the Department of  Computer Science
of the University of Bologna.
