You can, if you want, comment out the relevant lines in the Makefile for the 
godi-ocaml-src package (the ones that add '-no-pthread' to CONFIGURE_ARGS if 
your operating system is FreeBSD) in order to enable threads. I'm running 
FreeBSD 6 as well, and running this way hasn't given me any problems so far - 
I don't use ocaml-http, but Coq, which also doesn't compile without threads, 
runs fine.
