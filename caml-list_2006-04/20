My apologies for spamming the list, but I need to get ahold of Tom 
Hawkins, a fellow Ocaml programmer up here in Minneapolis, and have lost 
his email address.  Tom- I have a book of yours I need to return.  So we 
need to get together at some point so I can return that to you.  Watch 
your reply-to, let's take this off the list.

To everyone else, my apologies.

Brian
