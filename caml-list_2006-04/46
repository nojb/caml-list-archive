Hmm, that's interesting indeed.

And this also applies to MingW? If it worked with MingW, that would be
great. I read it's available with Cygwin .. so surely it'd extend to
MingW too?

The other option is that you limit ocamlmklib on windows to only
generate the static (or dynamic, depending on what would be thought as
best) versions? At least it'd give one a halfway house.

BTW: this stems from trying to build camlimages on Win32 with MingW. I
guess I'll google some to see if anyone indeed pulled this off.
