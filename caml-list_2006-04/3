Thanks to everybody who responded.

To clarify things:
I'm trying to _compile_ a list definition.
So, my .ml file looks like this:

---
let myList =3D [("first", ["some"; more]);
                   ("second", ["more"; "still"])]
---
except that there are 12,000 elements in the list instead of two as in
the example.
_ocamlc_ throws a Stack_overflow error while compiling this list. So,
I want to know how to influence _ocamlc_ to be able to compile this or
larger lists.

The suggestion of chunkifying the list into smaller lists is a
practical one; I may be forced to try it.

ocamlc.opt compiles the list fine but that reduces portability.
