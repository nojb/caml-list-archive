My research group and other groups in the vicinity stopped buying Sun
workstations circa 1994, as much better alternatives have been
available since then.  SPARCstations remained popular for a while with
our network administrators, as small servers, but I don't think I
could dumpster-dive and get any SPARCstation built in the 21st century.

Besides, resurrecting old hardware is time-consuming and generally
disappointing.  ("Oh my God, look at the dust cloud it coughed!  Hmmm,
that runs really slow...  The OS is five major versions behind!  Where
is my favorite open source software?  Ah, there's no CDROM in this
beast.  Where did I put my vintage external SCSI 1x CDROM?  (One
hour later.)  Damn, the internal disk is too small."  etc.)

Good idea.  It would look good in the machine room :-)
