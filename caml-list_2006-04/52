			      WRS06

	       The Sixth International Workshop on
	Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and Programming
	       http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~antoy/wrs06/

	      The Seattle Sheraton Hotel and Towers,
	       Seattle, Washington, August 11, 2006


Scope
    
    The workshop intends to promote and stimulate international
    research and collaboration in the area of evaluation
    strategies. It encourages the presentation of new
    directions,developments and results as well as surveys and
    tutorials on existing knowledge in this area. Reduction strategies
    study which subexpression(s) of an expression should be
    selected for evaluation and which rule(s) should be applied. These
    choices affect fundamental properties of a computation such as
    laziness, strictness, completeness and need to name a few. For this
    reason some programming languages, e.g., Elan, Maude, *OBJ* and
    Stratego, allow the explicit definition of the evaluation
    strategy, whereas other languages,e.g., Clean, Curry, and Haskell,
    allow its modification. Strategies pose challenging theoretical
    problems and play an important role in practical tools such as
    theorem provers, model checkers and programming languages. In
    implementations of languages, strategies bridge the gap between
    operational principles, e.g., graph and term rewriting,narrowing
    and lambda-calculus, and semantics, e.g., normalization,
    computation of values and head-normalization. The previous
    editions of the workshop were: WRS 2001 (Utrecht, The
    Netherlands),WRS 2002 (Copenhagen, Denmark), WRS 2003 (Valencia,
    Spain), WRS 2004 (Aachen, Germany), and WRS 2005 (Nara,
    Japan). See also the WRS permanent page at

Topics

    Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

    * theoretical foundations for the definition and semantic
      description of reduction strategies

    * strategies in different frameworks such as term rewriting, graph
      rewriting, infinitary rewriting, lambda calculi, higher order
      rewriting, conditional rewriting, rewriting with built-ins,
      narrowing, constraint solving, etc.

    * application of strategies to equational, functional,
      functional-logic programming languages

    * properties of reduction strategies and corresponding computations,
      e.g., completeness, computability, decidability, complexity,
      optimality, normalization, cofinality, fairness, perpetuality,
      context-freedom, need, laziness, eagerness, strictness

    * interrelations, combinations and applications of reduction under
      different strategies, e.g., evaluation mechanisms in programming
      languages, equivalence conditions for fundamental properties like
      termination and confluence, applications in modularity analysis,
      connections between strategies of different frameworks,etc.

    * program analysis and other semantics-based optimization
      techniques dealing with reduction strategies

    * rewrite systems, tools, implementations with flexible or
      programmable strategies as an essential concept or ingredient

    * specification of reduction strategies in real languages
      strategies suitable to software engineering problems and
      applications tutorials and systems related to evaluation
      strategies

Submissions

      Submissions must be original and not submitted for
      publication elsewhere. The page limit for regular papers is
      13 pages in Springer Verlag LNCS style. Surveys and
      tutorials maybe longer. Use the WRS06 submission page,
      handled by the EasyChair conference system, to submit
      abstracts, papers and to update a previous submission.

Publication

      Informal proceedings of accepted contributions will be
      available on-line. A hard copy will be distributed at the
      workshop to registered participants. Authors of
      selected contributions will be invited to submit a revised
      version, after the workshop, for inclusion in a
      collection. We anticipate the publication of formal
      proceedings in the Elsevier ENTCS series.

Invited Speakers

      Talks will be given at joint sessions with RULE by:

      * Dick Kieburtz, OHSU/OGI School of Science & Engineering
      * Claude Kirchner, INRIA & LORIA
