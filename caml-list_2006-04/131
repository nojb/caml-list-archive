Hello,

I don't think so. BTW, John Carr, from MIT, is maintaining a port of
native OCaml compiler to Sparc V9 architecture
(http://www.mit.edu/~jfc/) and he is working on Solaris system. As far
as I know, his patches have been contributed back to OCaml official
tree. So I would say that the Solaris is pretty well supported and
performance should be quite acceptable.

But the best way is probably to try it by yourself. 


Best wishes,
