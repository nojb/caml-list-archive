Ok, I wasn't aware of this. I don't have access to machines using AMD
or Pentium-M processors, unfortunately.

Anyway, the timing of the OCaml VM was just a side experiment for me:
I wanted to see whether the speedup provided by threaded code in the
OCaml VM was similar to the one it provides in a VM we develop for a
course. Now that I've answered that question, I think I'll leave it at
that.

Thank you for your suggestion about VTUNE, I'll think about it if I
ever need a detailed analysis tool.

Michel.
