One other option is to change the startup mode of the executable after
compiling and linking it. I did this years ago with <cough> Visual Basic to
make true console applications (the reverse of your problem). I can't find
the code archive, but IIRC it involves changing a single byte in the PE
header that indicates the subsystem to use. The concept of main and winmain
come entirely from C - the actual entry point of your image is independent
of its subsystem so this gets around your linking problem.

I can't get at the machine with the archive of the tool I wrote for doing
this at the moment <sigh>. However, Microsoft have some utilities for doing
this although I don't know whether they will only work for programs
generated with their compiliers - google for Visual Basic's Link utility and
MSVC++'s editbin tool.

Hope this helps,


David

And back to the task at hand: how do I specify a .lib file on the
command line to get this all to link? I can't figure out the
cclib/ccopt options to pass to ocamlopt =/
