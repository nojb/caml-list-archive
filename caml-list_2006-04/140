I finally fixed the problem on my own. I had to do several odd things,
not described in the installation doccumentation :-(

1- for lablgtk2 : create a /usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/lablgtk2 directory,
and put the META file provided inside.
2- for gmetadom2 : add to the META file provided directory="+gdome2" for
it to be correctly used by lablgtkmathview
3- the oddest thing : the mlvalues.h file was to be searched by the
configure script of lablgtkmathview in /usr/include/caml, so I had to
create a symlink from /usr/include/caml to /usr/lib/ocaml/caml.

Maybe I didn't read the right manuals, but isn't it a bit strange ? My
Ocaml installation was correct, I thought !

\bye
