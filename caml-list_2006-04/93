No, that would generate solutions shorter than the requested n elements.
What we want is something like

    | 1, []
    | 2, [] | 2, [_]
    | 3, [] | 3, [_] | 3, [_;_]
    ...
    | n, [] | n, [_] | n, [_;_] | ... | n, [_;...;_] (* n-1 times '_' *)
    -> []

Anyway, I think it's better not to use pattern matching but to use a
simple if-then-else to circumvent the warning.
