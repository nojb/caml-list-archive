FORMAT OF THE CONFERENCE

The conference program will include presentation of invited papers,
oral presentations, and poster/demonstration sessions. Papers will
be presented in plenary or topic oriented sessions.

Social events including a trip in the vicinity of Brno will allow
for additional informal interactions.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages
formatted in the LNCS style (including references). Those accepted
will be presented either orally or as posters. The decision about the
presentation format will be based on the recommendation of the
reviewers. The authors are asked to submit their papers using the
on-line form accessible from the conference website.

Papers submitted to TSD 2020 must not be under review by any other
conference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be
previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".  Papers that do not conform to the
requirements above are subject to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX or
LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final versions of
the papers that will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes.
Authors using a WORD compatible software for the final version must
use the LNCS template for WORD and within the submit process ask the
Proceedings Editors to convert the paper to LaTeX format.  For this
service a service-and-license fee of CZK 2000 will be levied
automatically.

The paper format for review has to be a PDF file with all required fonts
included. Upon notification of acceptance, presenters will receive further
information on submitting their camera-ready and electronic sources (for
detailed instructions on the final paper format see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings, Sample File
typeinst.zip).

Authors are also invited to present actual projects, developed
software or interesting material relevant to the topics of the
conference.  The presenters of demonstrations should provide an
abstract not exceeding one page. The demonstration abstracts will not
appear in the conference proceedings.

LOCATION

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic with a
population of almost 400.000 and is the country's judiciary and
trade-fair center. Brno is the capital of South Moravia, which is
located in the south-east part of the Czech Republic and is known
for a wide range of cultural, natural, and technical sights.
South Moravia is a traditional wine region. Brno had been a Royal
City since 1347 and with its six universities it forms a cultural
center of the region.

Brno can be reached easily by direct flights from London and Milan, and by
trains or buses from Vienna (150 km) or Prague (230 km).
