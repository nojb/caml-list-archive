Subject: Re: [Caml-list] (dune/opam) Proper way of vendoring a library
 inside an application?


Hi,

I want to maintain the property that Menhir depends on no external
libraries, as this makes it easier for some people (who do not use
opam) to install.

Also, this allows me to know exactly which version of fix I am
using, so two versions of Menhir that have the same version
number are guaranteed to work in the same way; that wouldn't
necessarily be true otherwise.

I don't see how it could cause any packaging problem; it should
be transparent. The copy of Fix embedded inside Menhir is used
when Menhir is installed and is immediately thrown away.
