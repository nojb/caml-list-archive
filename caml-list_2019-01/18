Subject: [Caml-list] FM'19: Second Call for Papers


==================================================================================================
Second Call for Papers

FM 2019 - 23rd International Symposium on Formal Methods - 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods

Porto, Portugal, October 7-11, 2019

http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt/
==================================================================================================

NEW: announcement of three invited speakers and confirmation of two special issues !!!

==================================================================================================

FM 2019 is the 23rd international symposium in a series organised by
Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is
to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software
development. Every 10 years the symposium is organised as a World
Congress. Twenty years after FM 1999 in Toulouse, and 10 years after
FM 2009 in Eindhoven, FM 2019 is the 3rd World Congress on Formal
Methods. This is reflected in a PC with members from over 40
countries. Thus, FM 2019 will be both an occasion to celebrate and a
platform for enthusiastic researchers and practitioners from a
diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas and share their
experience.

FORMAL METHODS: THE NEXT 30 YEARS

It is now more than 30 years since the first VDM symposium in 1987
brought together researchers with the common goal of creating methods
to produce high quality software based on rigour and reason. Since
then the diversity and complexity of computer technology has changed
enormously and the formal methods community has stepped up to the
challenges those changes brought by adapting, generalising and
improving the models and analysis techniques that were the focus of
that first symposium. The theme for FM 2019 is a reflection on how far
the community has come and the lessons we can learn for understanding
and developing the best software for future technologies.


Important Dates
================

Abstract submission: 28 March, 2019 
Full paper submission: 11 April, 2019, 23:59 AoE
Notification: 11 June, 2019       
Camera ready: 9 July, 2019
Conference: 7-11 October, 2019 


Invited Speakers
=================

- June Andronick (CSIRO/Data61 and UNSW, Sydney, Australia)
- Shriram Krishnamurthi (Brown University, Providence, RI, USA)
- Erik Poll (Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands)


Topics of Interest
======================

FM 2019 encourages submissions on formal methods in a wide range of
domains including software, computer-based systems,
systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, human-computer
interaction, manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart
cities, and healthcare. We particularly welcome papers on techniques,
tools and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We also welcome
papers on experiences of formal methods in industry, and on the design
and validation of formal methods tools. The broad topics of interest
for FM 2019 include, but are not limited to:

- Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools and experiences
demonstrating the use of formal methods in interdisciplinary settings.

- Formal methods in practice: Industrial applications of formal
methods, experience with formal methods in industry, tool usage
reports, experiments with challenge problems. The authors are
encouraged to explain how formal methods overcame problems, led to
improved designs, or provided new insights.

- Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification, model
checking, and testing with formal methods, tools integration,
environments for formal methods, and experimental validation of
tools. The authors are encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the
new tool or environment advances the state of the art.

- Formal methods in software and systems engineering: Development
processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for formal methods,
and method integration. The authors are encouraged to evaluate process
innovations with respect to qualitative or quantitative
improvements. Empirical studies and evaluations are also solicited.

- Theoretical foundations of formal methods: All aspects of theory
related to specification, verification, refinement, and static and
dynamic analysis. The authors are encouraged to explain how their
results contribute to the solution of practical problems with formal
methods or tools.


Submission Guidelines
=======================

Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere,
in Springer LNCS format, written in English, submitted through
EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2019

Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the
Programme Committee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are
strongly encouraged to make their experimental results available for
use by the reviewers. Similarly, case study papers should describe
significant case studies, and the complete development should be made
available at the time of review. The usual criteria for novelty,
reproducibility, correctness and the ability for others to build upon
the described work apply. Tool papers should explain enhancements made
compared to previously published work. A tool paper need not present
the theory behind the tool but should focus on the tool's features,
how it is used, its evaluation, and examples and screen shots
illustrating the tool's use. Authors of tool papers should make their
tool available for use by the reviewers.

We solicit two categories of papers:

- Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages, not counting references
  and appendices.

- Short papers, including tool papers, should not exceed 6 pages, not
counting references and appendices. Besides tool papers, short papers
are encouraged for any topic that can be described within the page
limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an extensive
experimental evaluation. Short papers will be accompanied by short
presentations.

For regular and tool papers, an appendix can provide additional
material such as details on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not
part of the page count and not guaranteed to be read or taken into
account by the reviewers. It should not contain information necessary
to the understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers
will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were
submitted.

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the
paper at the conference as a registered participant.


Best Paper Award
=================

At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors
of the submission selected as the FM 2019 Best Paper.


Publication
============

Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings to
appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science in the subline
on Formal Methods.

Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their paper to one of the special issues in "Formal Aspects
of Computing" and "Formal Methods in System Design".
