### About PACMPL=0D
=0D
Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL=0D
<https://pacmpl.acm.org/>) is a Gold Open Access journal publishing=0D
research on all aspects of programming languages, from design to=0D
implementation and from mathematical formalisms to empirical=0D
studies. Each issue of the journal is devoted to a particular subject=0D
area within programming languages and will be announced through=0D
publicized Calls for Papers, like this one.=0D
=0D
### Scope=0D
=0D
[PACMPL](https://pacmpl.acm.org/) issue ICFP 2019 seeks original=0D
papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions=0D
are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from=0D
foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The=0D
scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming,=0D
including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as=0D
languages with objects, concurrency, or parallelism. Topics of=0D
interest include (but are not limited to):=0D
=0D
  * *Language Design*: concurrency, parallelism, and distribution;=0D
     modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; type=0D
     systems; interoperability; domain-specific languages; and=0D
     relations to imperative, object-oriented, or logic programming.=0D
=0D

=0D
Submissions will be evaluated according to their relevance,=0D
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission=0D
should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms,=0D
clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is=0D
significant, and comparing it with previous work. The technical=0D
content should be accessible to a broad audience.=0D
=0D
PACMPL issue ICFP 2019 also welcomes submissions in two separate=0D
categories &mdash; Functional Pearls and Experience Reports &mdash;=0D
that must be marked as such at the time of submission and that need=0D
not report original research results.  Detailed guidelines on both=0D
categories are given at the end of this call.=0D
=0D
Please contact the principal editor if you have questions or are=0D
concerned about the appropriateness of a topic.=0D
=0D
### Preparation of submissions=0D
=0D
**Deadline**: The deadline for submissions is **Friday, March 1, 2019**,=0D
Anywhere on Earth (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth>).=0D
This deadline will be strictly enforced.=0D
=0D
**Formatting**: Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black=0D
and white on US Letter sized paper, and interpretable by common PDF=0D
tools. All submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template that is=0D
available (in both LaTeX and Word formats) from=0D
<https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions>.  For authors=0D
using LaTeX, a lighter-weight package, including only the essential=0D
files, is available from=0D
<http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format>.=0D
=0D
There is a limit of **25 pages for a full paper or Functional Pearl**=0D
and **12 pages for an Experience Report**; in either case, the=0D
bibliography will not be counted against these limits. Submissions=0D
that exceed the page limits or, for other reasons, do not meet the=0D
requirements for formatting, will be summarily rejected. Supplementary=0D
material can and should be **separately** submitted (see below).=0D
=0D
See also PACMPL's Information and Guidelines for Authors at=0D
<https://pacmpl.acm.org/authors.cfm>.=0D
=0D
**Submission**: Submissions will be accepted at <https://icfp19.hotcrp.com/=
>=0D
=0D
Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the=0D
submission deadline using the same web interface.=0D
=0D
**Author Response Period**: Authors will have a 72-hour period,=0D
starting at 14:00 UTC on **Tuesday, April 16, 2019**, to read reviews=0D
and respond to them.=0D
=0D
**Supplementary Material**: Authors have the option to attach=0D
supplementary material to a submission, on the understanding that=0D
reviewers may choose not to look at it. This supplementary material=0D
should **not** be submitted as part of the main document; instead, it=0D
should be uploaded as a **separate** PDF document or tarball.=0D
=0D
Supplementary material should be uploaded **at submission time**, not=0D
by providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository.=0D
=0D
Authors are free to upload both anonymized and non-anonymized=0D
supplementary material. Anonymized supplementary material will be=0D
visible to reviewers immediately; non-anonymized supplementary=0D
material will be revealed to reviewers only after they have submitted=0D
their review of the paper and learned the identity of the author(s).=0D
=0D
**Authorship Policies**: All submissions are expected to comply with=0D
the ACM Policies for Authorship that are detailed at=0D
<https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors>.=0D
=0D
**Republication Policies**: Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's=0D
republication policy, as explained on the web at=0D
<http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication>.=0D
=0D
**Resubmitted Papers**: Authors who submit a revised version of a=0D
paper that has previously been rejected by another conference have the=0D
option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous=0D
submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these previous=0D
reviews in the present submission. If a reviewer identifies=0D
him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and wishes to=0D
see how his/her comments have been addressed, the principal editor=0D
will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her=0D
previous review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies=0D
of the previous reviews.=0D
=0D
### Review Process=0D
=0D
This section outlines the two-stage process with lightweight=0D
double-blind reviewing that will be used to select papers for PACMPL=0D
issue ICFP 2019.  We anticipate that there will be a need to clarify=0D
and expand on this process, and we will maintain a list of frequently=0D
asked questions and answers on the conference website to address=0D
common concerns.=0D
=0D
**PACMPL issue ICFP 2019 will employ a two-stage review process.** The=0D
  first stage in the review process will assess submitted papers using=0D
  the criteria stated above and will allow for feedback and input on=0D
  initial reviews through the author response period mentioned=0D
  previously. At the review meeting, a set of papers will be=0D
  conditionally accepted and all other papers will be rejected.=0D
  Authors will be notified of these decisions on **May 3, 2019**.=0D
=0D
Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with=0D
committee reviews (just as in previous conferences) along with a set=0D
of mandatory revisions. After four weeks (May 31, 2019), the authors=0D
will provide a second submission. The second and final reviewing phase=0D
assesses whether the mandatory revisions have been adequately=0D
addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final=0D
accept/reject status of the paper. The intent and expectation is that=0D
the mandatory revisions can be addressed within four weeks and hence=0D
that conditionally accepted papers will in general be accepted in the=0D
second phase.=0D
=0D
The second submission should clearly identify how the mandatory=0D
revisions were addressed. To that end, the second submission must be=0D
accompanied by a cover letter mapping each mandatory revision request=0D
to specific parts of the paper. The cover letter will facilitate a=0D
quick second review, allowing for confirmation of final acceptance=0D
within two weeks. Conversely, the absence of a cover letter will be=0D
grounds for the paper=E2=80=99s rejection.=0D
=0D
**PACMPL issue ICFP 2019 will employ a lightweight double-blind=0D
  reviewing process.** To facilitate this, submitted papers must=0D
  adhere to two rules:=0D
=0D
  1. **author names and institutions must be omitted**, and=0D
  2. **references to authors' own related work should be in the third=0D
  person** (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather=0D
  "We build on the work of ...").=0D
=0D
The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an=0D
initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it=0D
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to=0D
try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the=0D
submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult=0D
(e.g., important background references should not be omitted or=0D
anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate=0D
their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally=0D
would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the=0D
web or give talks on their research ideas.=0D
=0D
### Information for Authors of Accepted Papers=0D
=0D
* As a condition of acceptance, final versions of all papers must=0D
  adhere to the new ACM Small format. The page limit for the final=0D
  versions of papers will be increased by two pages to help authors=0D
  respond to reviewer comments and mandatory revisions: **27 pages=0D
  plus bibliography for a regular paper or Functional Pearl, 14 pages=0D
  plus bibliography for an Experience Report**.=0D
=0D
* Authors of accepted submissions will be required to agree to one of=0D
  the three ACM licensing options: open access on payment of a fee=0D
  (**recommended**, and SIGPLAN can cover the cost as described next);=0D
  copyright transfer to ACM; or retaining copyright but granting ACM=0D
  exclusive publication rights.  Further information about ACM author=0D
  rights is available from <http://authors.acm.org>.=0D
=0D
* PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. It will be archived in ACM=E2=80=99=
s=0D
  Digital Library, but no membership or fee is required for=0D
  access. Gold Open Access has been made possible by generous funding=0D
  through ACM SIGPLAN, which will cover all open access costs in the=0D
  event authors cannot. Authors who can cover the costs may do so by=0D
  paying an Article Processing Charge (APC). PACMPL, SIGPLAN, and ACM=0D
  Headquarters are committed to exploring routes to making Gold Open=0D
  Access publication both affordable and sustainable.=0D
=0D
* ACM offers authors a range of copyright options, one of which is=0D
  Creative Commons CC-BY publication; this is the option recommended=0D

### Artifact Evaluation=0D
=0D
Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase=0D
of the review process will be encouraged (but not required) to submit=0D
supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. These items will then be=0D
reviewed by an Artifact Evaluation Committee, separate from the paper=0D
Review Committee, whose task is to assess how the artifacts support=0D
the work described in the associated paper. Papers that go through the=0D
Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of=0D
approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers=0D
will be encouraged to make the supporting materials publicly available=0D
upon publication of the papers, for example, by including them as=0D
"source materials" in the ACM Digital Library.  An additional seal=0D
will mark papers whose artifacts are made available, as outlined in=0D
the ACM guidelines for artifact badging.=0D
=0D
Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and will not=0D
influence the final decision regarding paper acceptance.=0D
=0D
### Special categories of papers=0D
=0D
In addition to research papers, PACMPL issue ICFP solicits two kinds=0D
of papers that do not require original research contributions:=0D
Functional Pearls, which are full papers, and Experience Reports,=0D
which are limited to half the length of a full paper. Authors=0D
submitting such papers should consider the following guidelines.=0D
=0D
#### Functional Pearls=0D
=0D
A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to=0D
functional programming. Examples include, but are not limited to:=0D
=0D
  * a new and thought-provoking way of looking at an old idea=0D
=0D
  * an instructive example of program calculation or proof=0D
=0D
  * a nifty presentation of an old or new data structure=0D
=0D
  * an interesting application of functional programming techniques=0D
=0D
  * a novel use or exposition of functional programming in the classroom=0D
=0D
While pearls often demonstrate an idea through the development of a=0D
short program, there is no requirement or expectation that they do=0D
so. Thus, they encompass the notions of theoretical and educational=0D
pearls.=0D
=0D
Functional Pearls are valued as highly and judged as rigorously as=0D
ordinary papers, but using somewhat different criteria. In particular,=0D
a pearl is not required to report original research, but, it should be=0D
concise, instructive, and entertaining. A pearl is likely to be=0D
rejected if its readers get bored, if the material gets too=0D
complicated, if too much specialized knowledge is needed, or if the=0D
writing is inelegant. The key to writing a good pearl is polishing.=0D
=0D
A submission that is intended to be treated as a pearl must be marked=0D
as such on the submission web page, and should contain the words=0D
"Functional Pearl" somewhere in its title or subtitle. These steps=0D
will alert reviewers to use the appropriate evaluation=0D
criteria. Pearls will be combined with ordinary papers, however, for=0D
the purpose of computing the conference's acceptance rate.=0D
=0D
#### Experience Reports=0D
=0D
The purpose of an Experience Report is to help create a body of=0D
published, refereed, citable evidence that functional programming=0D
really works &mdash; or to describe what obstacles prevent it from=0D
working.=0D
=0D
Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:=0D
=0D
  * insights gained from real-world projects using functional programming=0D
=0D
  * comparison of functional programming with conventional programming=0D
    in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum=0D
=0D
  * project-management, business, or legal issues encountered when=0D
    using functional programming in a real-world project=0D
=0D
  * curricular issues encountered when using functional programming in educ=
ation=0D
=0D
  * real-world constraints that created special challenges for an=0D
    implementation of a functional language or for functional=0D
    programming in general=0D
=0D
An Experience Report is distinguished from a normal PACMPL issue ICFP=0D
paper by its title, by its length, and by the criteria used to=0D
evaluate it.=0D
=0D
  * Both in the papers and in any citations, the title of each=0D
    accepted Experience Report must end with the words "(Experience=0D
    Report)" in parentheses. The acceptance rate for Experience=0D
    Reports will be computed and reported separately from the rate for=0D
    ordinary papers.=0D
=0D
  * Experience Report submissions can be at most 12 pages long,=0D
    excluding bibliography.=0D
=0D
  * Each accepted Experience Report will be presented at the=0D
    conference, but depending on the number of Experience Reports and=0D
    regular papers accepted, authors of Experience reports may be=0D
    asked to give shorter talks.=0D
=0D
  * Because the purpose of Experience Reports is to enable our=0D
    community to accumulate a body of evidence about the efficacy of=0D
    functional programming, an acceptable Experience Report need not=0D
    add to the body of knowledge of the functional-programming=0D
    community by presenting novel results or conclusions. It is=0D
    sufficient if the Report states a clear thesis and provides=0D
    supporting evidence. The thesis must be relevant to ICFP, but it=0D
    need not be novel.=0D
=0D
The review committee will accept or reject Experience Reports based on=0D
whether they judge the evidence to be convincing. Anecdotal evidence=0D
will be acceptable provided it is well argued and the author explains=0D
what efforts were made to gather as much evidence as=0D
possible. Typically, more convincing evidence is obtained from papers=0D
which show how functional programming was used than from papers which=0D
only say that functional programming was used. The most convincing=0D
evidence often includes comparisons of situations before and after the=0D
introduction or discontinuation of functional programming. Evidence=0D
drawn from a single person's experience may be sufficient, but more=0D
weight will be given to evidence drawn from the experience of groups=0D
of people.=0D
=0D
An Experience Report should be short and to the point: it should make=0D
a claim about how well functional programming worked on a particular=0D
project and why, and produce evidence to substantiate this claim. If=0D
functional programming worked in this case in the same ways it has=0D
worked for others, the paper need only summarize the results &mdash;=0D
the main part of the paper should discuss how well it worked and in=0D
what context. Most readers will not want to know all the details of=0D
the project and its implementation, but the paper should characterize=0D
the project and its context well enough so that readers can judge to=0D
what degree this experience is relevant to their own projects. The=0D
paper should take care to highlight any unusual aspects of the=0D
project. Specifics about the project are more valuable than=0D
generalities about functional programming; for example, it is more=0D
valuable to say that the team delivered its software a month ahead of=0D
schedule than it is to say that functional programming made the team=0D
more productive.=0D
=0D
If the paper not only describes experience but also presents new=0D
technical results, or if the experience refutes cherished beliefs of=0D
the functional-programming community, it may be better to submit it as=0D
a full paper, which will be judged by the usual criteria of novelty,=0D
originality, and relevance. The principal editor will be happy to=0D
advise on any concerns about which category to submit to.=0D
