I just wanted to thank you for the suggestion and confirm that it worked
quite well. I downloaded the binary for my platform and installed it in my
private bin directory as 'opam1'. When I want to use it, rather than the
system-provided opam (version 2), I create a symlink in my bin
directory.

Then I just had to do:

opam init --root=~/.opam1

and everything wored fine.

Bets wishes,

Sébastien.
