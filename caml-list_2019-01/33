Title: Smart Contract Languages for permissioned Blockchains & Distributed =
Ledgers

Enterprise: Accenture Labs Sophia Antipolis
Research Laboratory: UCA-Inria Sophia Antipolis-Me=CC=81diterrane=CC=81e, K=
airos Team,
Where: Sophia Antipolis 06903, France
Location: Accenture Labs Sophia and Inria Sophia Antipolis Me=CC=81diterran=
e=CC=81e, Kairos Team.
Duration: 3 years
Recruitment date: As soon as possible
Application deadline: As soon as possible
Function: 3 years PhD candidate position in Accenture Labs Sophia (CDD). Th=
e position will be part time between Accenture Labs Sophia and at Inria Sop=
hia Antipolis Me=CC=81diterrane=CC=81e, Kairos Team.
Research topic (no confidential): Semantics of programming languages, permi=
ssioned blockchain, smart contract, formal verification, distributed ledger
Context:

Bitcoin [1], Ethereum [2] and the increase popularity of blockchains and de=
centralized distributed ledgers brought two main innovations: 1) the capabi=
lity of building decentralized peer-to-peer ledgers that record and store o=
rdered transactions without the need of trusted and centralized third parti=
es and 2) the introduction of complex applications involving having digital=
 assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary=
 rules, known as Smart Contracts [2].

Also, if the Bitcoin protocol implements a first concept of =E2=80=9CSmart =
Contract=E2=80=9D [3], the terms got popular with Ethereum and with its imp=
lementation of Smart Contract. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, that processes=
 and executes Smart Contracts, made possible the creation of Decentralized =
Applications and extended the blockchain capabilities that were considered =
only as digital cash system. Distributed Applications, that doesn=E2=80=99t=
 require a middleman to function, opens numerous opportunities: automatic s=
ettlement, treasury applications, voting systems and many others.

While public blockchains were getting more and more popular (and numerous) =
and new platforms were proposing their implementation of Smart Contracts, m=
uch of the interest in the blockchain space was going towards the use of th=
e blockchain technology for the enterprise world. We saw in the recent year=
s the development of different platforms that focuses on the so-called priv=
ate (or permissioned) blockchain(s) and digital ledgers. Some of the permis=
sioned blockchains platforms are fork of public blockchain adapted to the e=
nterprise needs (e.g. Quorum) while others have been designed and built fro=
m scratch (e.g. Corda, Digital Asset, Hyperledger Fabric, etc.). Almost the=
 totality of private blockchain(s) present their own implementation of Smar=
t Contact: for example DAML [4] supported by Digital Asset, Chaincode [5] i=
n Fabric, Kotlin/Java [6] supported by Corda and many others.

Between public and private blockchains we are observing a wide variety of d=
ifferent languages with different capabilities and limitations. Both public=
 and private blockchain often lack maturity and a formal semantic as they h=
ave been under pressure of the sudden and rapid explosion of Blockchain pop=
ularity.

Research Objectives:

The Ph.D. student will first focus his research on studying, understanding =
and assessing the state of the art of Smart Contract Languages (SCL). The c=
andidate will focus on building a multi-dimensional framework to understand=
 and classify SCLs landscape considering public and private blockchains. Sm=
art Contracts should be evaluated considering their context and their effic=
acy by taking in account a wide range of parameters (e.g. terminology, auto=
mation, enforceability, semantics, security, scalability, formal verifiabil=
ity, extendability, turing completeness, etc. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ).

In the second phase the candidate will focus on proposing and building exte=
nsions of existing SCLs and/or proposing new SCLs and their respective exec=
ution environments to overcome limitations and rigidity of existing languag=
es and extend the current capabilities. As well the focus could also be ori=
ented to experiment programming languages paradigms that has not been appli=
ed before to Smart Contracts (e.g. typed/untyped, compiled/interpreted, obj=
ect-oriented/functional, etc.). The focus should be on permissioned and pri=
vate blockchains.
