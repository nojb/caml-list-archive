About PPDP
----------

The PPDP 2019 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative
programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic,
answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to
stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing,
performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms
for concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.

Scope
-----

Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from
principles to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to

-   Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency,
    parallelism, and distribution; modules; probabilistic languages; reactive
    languages; database languages; knowledge representation languages; languages
    with objects; language extensions for tabulation; metaprogramming.

-   Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time
    and run-time optimization; memory management.

-   Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics.

-   Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation;
    control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource
    analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation;
    debugging; testing.

-   Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification
    tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers;
    certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and
    outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports
    and industrial application; education.

The PC chair (Ekaterina Komendanstkaya <e.komendantskaya@hw.ac.uk>) will be
happy to advise on the appropriateness of a topic.

Submission Categories
---------------------

Submissions can be made in three categories: regular Research Papers, System
Descriptions, and Experience Reports.

Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM style
2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be
submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions). Research papers
will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and
readability.

Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose
description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed
10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must
be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality,
significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published,
refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional,
logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must
not exceed 5 pages **including references**.  Experience Reports must be marked
as such at the time of submission and need not report original research results.
They will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Supplementary material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix beyond the
above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study any material
beyond the respective page limit.

Format of a Submission
----------------------

For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the "Current
ACM Master Template" which is available at
<https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>. The most recent version
at the time of writing is 1.48. You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings
template as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in
other formats. In case of problems with the templates, contact ACM's TeX support
team at Aptara <acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com>.

Authors should note ACM's statement on author's rights (http://authors.acm.org/)
which apply to final papers. Submitted papers should meet the requirements of
ACM's plagiarism policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy).

Requirements for Publication
----------------------------

At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to
attend and present the work at the conference. The pc chair may retract
a paper that is not presented. The pc chair may also retract a paper if
complaints about the paper's correctness are raised which cannot be
resolved by the final paper deadline.
