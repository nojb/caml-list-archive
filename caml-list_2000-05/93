Hi,


I'm currently writing kind of a middleware, but I face strange
behaviors. I've got a client C and a server S, both
(bytecode-)multithreaded. They communicate with TCP sockets. When C
connects to S, S sends (by marshalling it, with the Marshal.Closures
parameter) some data (actually an empty list) to C. On S' side it works.
But C fails when doing a 'from_marshal' with a Sys_blocked_io exception.
The doc says:

exception Sys_blocked_io

     A special case of Sys_error raised when no I/O is possible on a
non-blocking I/O channel. 

I find this strange because, as far as I know, TCP sockets are
*blocking" channels.

Anyway, the problem is that my program fails *sometimes*. Some other
times, it works very well. And when it fails, it happens that my xterm
goes nuts, and refuses any operation involving the network (such as a
rlogin).

Has anybody met that kind of behavior? How did you handle with it?

Regards,

dc
