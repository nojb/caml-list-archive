You don't really need such a feature, since the ocaml compiler is very
fast. Thus,  you can "recompile" and "next-error"  very often, without
wasting time waiting for the compiler (With slow compilers, like JDK's
java compiler, you really need such a feature!) And thanks to the true
separate compilation of ocaml's  modules, you only recompile few files
each time. 

I agree that ocaml's native-code compiler may be quite slow sometimes,
but due to the consistency between the two compilers, you can developp
with the  bytecode compiler,  which is really  fast, and then  turn to
native-code when you are done with the development-phase and start the
test-phase.

However, I guess that there are also difficulties in finding more than
one error in a strongly typed language...
