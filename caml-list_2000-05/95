Hello,

I would like to announce the first release of Starfish:
http://dsl.cs.technion.ac.il/Starfish

Starfish is a fault-tolerant distributed system for running both MPI and
serial applications.
Starfish has been implemented by using OCaml and there is a partial
implementation of
MPI on OCaml (OCamlMPI library).
