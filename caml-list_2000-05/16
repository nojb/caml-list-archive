Hello to all, Bonjour =E0 tous

I cannot comment on the O'Reilly book, which I have not seen yet, although
I trust the authors to have made a good job. But in the current discussion
about translating it in english, I have seen no mention of the numerous
books on programming in varous dialects of Caml which have appeared so far,
some of them available in english. For instance:

"The Functional Approach to Programming" by Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny,
Cambridge University Press, 1998.=20

It is a quite good reference book on programming in Caml Light, close
enough to Objective Caml to be used as a standard beginner's textbook, even
if it does not cover modules and objects. It gives many serious programming
examples, and answers many of the questions that are routinely asked on
this list, such as how to program doubly linked lists (the "sweet"
implementation given by Xavier a few days ago is covered in section 4.4.5
for instance).
