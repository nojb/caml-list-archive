Works fine here (in OCaml 3.00).  Make sure you use OCaml version 2.03
or later, since the initial implementation of callback*_exn in 2.02
was buggy.

If that doesn't explain your problem, please write caml-bugs@inria.fr
or use the bug-tracking system on our Web site and send us a complete
example reproducing the problem.
