No.  The formula really gives the maximum array size that can be
supported by the runtime and garbage collector (about 4M fields, or
16MB on a 32-bit machine).  Maybe you should have a look a the
"bigarray" library, which was designed for huge arrays (of numbers).
Or you could get a 64-bit machine, they can handle more memory than
32-bitters anyway.
