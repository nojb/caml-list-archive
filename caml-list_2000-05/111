you can already do it with this gmake definition :

  OCAMLDIR = $(shell $(CAMLC) -v | grep Standard | sed -e "s/^.*: //")

or by shell script :

  STDLIB=`ocamlc -v | grep Standard | sed -e "s/^.*: //"`

A better solution would be for ocamlc & co to search in the $STDLIB place as
well as in the current dir and absolute path, this way you could just write :

ocamlc -I labltk foo.ml

this would include $STDLIB/labltk.
