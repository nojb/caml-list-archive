Hello list,

I was wondering if anyone has taken the trouble to make a
wrapper for the curses/ncurses terminal I/O library.

There's an example in the tutorial, but it is incomplete.
I could extend it myself, but it would be tedious, therefore I
would like to ask if anyone has already done this.

Thanks,

Stephan Houben
