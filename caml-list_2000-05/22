I have this book.  It's a good book, has a lot of great information in
it, and isn't too far away from O'Caml.  Unfortunately, it isn't a
great book for introducing people to the O'Caml language.  (It might
be more appropriate in a classroom setting.)

I should probably try to get a copy of the new book imported so I can
at least see how it's organized before I decide that it's better--but
as it's oriented towards the programming language O'Caml and not
functional programming in general (just happening to use Caml Light),
I suspect it will be better.

Besides--it's always easier to sell people on reading O'Reilly books.  :)

John.
