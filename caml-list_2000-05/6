Hello,

Bad news: I have just received an answer from O'Reilly concerning future
translations of the French OCaml-book. Unfortunately, there do not seem to
be any intentions to do so... (see below). Maybe people want to "push it" a
bit at the French branch (address also below)? ;-)

If nobody asks, nothing will move...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
