At the University of Pennsylvania we are using OCaml for our
first-year undergraduate course, with about 300 students a year, and
have been suffering because of the lack of a suitable textbook.

I've been corresponding about the new book with Xavier Cazin in the
French editorial offices of O'Reilly.  He says there are no plans at
the moment to make an English translation in-house, but he seems very
receptive to the idea of someone taking on the job of producing one
(which could perhaps even be distributed freely, though that's a point
that needs to be discussed, of course) for the non-francophone
community.
