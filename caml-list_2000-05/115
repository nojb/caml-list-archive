Indeed a -where option would be useful, I also have lots of makefiles
using the same script as you, in particular for the install procedure.

But in this precise case, I would prefer the approach suggested by
Sven Luther: to have an abbreviated notation for paths under the
standard library directory.

For instance we could have
        ocamlc -I +labltk

Remark that now that we have the autolink mechanism, package path +
library name is all you need to link in a library.
(findlib is certainly more powerful, but it needs some form of
meta-information, which is better handled outside of the compiler)

I should have made more evident in the manual that you _must_ use
ocamlbrowser (if labltk works, it works!). Then looking for function
types is trivial. (Don't forget to configure your path to include
the labltk directory.)

.cma files do not contain typing information, you have to look inside
.cmi files for that. And this is what ocamlbrowser does.

Cheers,
