I've just sent mail asking "when will an English edition of ... be
available?" with a short explanation about why I think it would be
worthwhile to translate it.

I wonder what would happen if a group of people offered to act as
translators/polishers.  I've noticed that automatic tools like
Babelfish tend to do a much better job on technical writing than, say,
poetry, and would be willing to spend the time it would take to refine
at least a chapter or two of such a work.


Speaking of babelfish, I just took a look at the book's web page
through it and was very pleased by the following expression:

"Diffused freely by its creators of the INRIA ..."

I don't know whether this is just a babelfish artifact, or a straight
translation of the French, but "diffusion" rather than "distribution"
of open-source seems like a pleasant metaphor to me.

John.
