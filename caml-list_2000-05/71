You might want to take a look at work by George Necula for Proof Carrying
Code (PCC), in particular his Touchstone compiler.

One of the optimizations performed by the compiler is the removal of
null-pointer checks. In cases where the compiler does not have enough
local information to remove the check, a precondition can be written that
will be used during optimization.

More about the compiler and PCC in general can be found at his website:
