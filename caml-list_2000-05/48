Since you  didn't open the  Unix module with  "open Unix" you  have to
qualify any identifier  from that module with "Unix."  (as you did for
stat, read, ... by the way), including the field name st_size.

So you should have written "file_info.Unix.st_size".

As you are probably going to  say, it becomes quite heavy. Thus, since
you use many identifiers from  the Unix module, you should rather open
it, like this :

======================================================================
open Unix

let main () =
      let file_info = stat Sys.argv.(1) in
      let fd = openfile Sys.argv.(1) [ O_RDONLY ] perm in
      let buffer = ref "" in
      let bytes_read = read fd buffer file_info.st_size in
      <snipped>
======================================================================
