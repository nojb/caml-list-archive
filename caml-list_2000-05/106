Dear ocamlers,

I have been trying labltk since ocaml-2.99 first with: labltklink
and now with: ocamlc -I$STDLIB/labltk labltk.cma foo.ml

* First, it made me think that an ocamlc -where option
(similar to that of camlp4) would be useful to get $STDLIB from ocamlc.

This would make it possible to use:
ocamlc -I `ocamlc -where`/labltk foo.ml

Remark 1: currently, I get $STDLIB from: (ocamlc -v  | some scritpt) which is
a pain,
Remark 2: I would rather not hard code STDLIB since I have several versions of
ocaml available.

* Second, since the documentation for labltk is short I often find myself
using the toplevel
just to check the type of say Tk.pack or Scale.configure.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could just say:
ocamlc -sig labltk.cma
to get the same output as with ocamlc -i
or maybe just use option -i itself as in:
ocamlc -i labltk.cma

That way it would not be necessary to ship libraries and .cmi files with
related .mli files

By the way, I am not a specialist of ocamlopt, what about this feature with
.cmxa files ?

Any comment ?

Cheers.

Thierry Bravier
