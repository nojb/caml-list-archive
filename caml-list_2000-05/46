	Hi,

	I have a short question about error messages.  I've notived that
ocamlc will often quit after detecting the first error.  I find it much
more useful to get a number of errors (at least 3-6), even if some of
them may be spurious.  Is it possible to implement such behaviour?

Thanks,
Amit Dubey
