That depends on how you use them. It is well possible to do this in such a
way that you actually increase performance.

For example, when inserting elements into a binary tree, the naive version
always copies the "spine" of the tree, even if the element is already a
member.

But if you use exceptions, you can "jump back" and can thus prevent the
spine from being copied. This normally reduces the load of the garbage
collector and yields some percent more performance.
