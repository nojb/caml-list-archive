Unfortunately, this is not quite the book we need at Penn (neither is
the new O'Reilly book, from what I've heard, but I'm hoping that parts
will be useful) -- it's an excellent book for second- or third-year
students with some programming background, but it seems too hard for
complete beginners or for (U.S.) college freshmen.  (If anyone has
evidence to contradict that claim, I'd love to hear it!)
