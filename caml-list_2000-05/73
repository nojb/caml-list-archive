It is indeed possible to have a type system that can be used (misused? ;)
to prove just about any property of your program - nearly...

A language that implements this is Cayenne:

  http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~augustss/cayenne

The type system of Cayenne is equivalent in power to predicate logic
(pretty expressive).  However, this expressiveness is bought with
decidability: it is, of course, impossible to automatically prove
everything without sometimes sending your type checker to Nirvana (or
worse: do something unsound)...
