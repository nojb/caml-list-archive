Hi,

   However, I should admit that you will still be facing another
   stupid limit (no more than 2^30 words in a big integer, which means
   approximately 9 * 2 ^ 30 decimal digits on a little machine, once more
   far far away from infinity). 

OK, I see you are in sarcastic mood ... I am actually negotiating
with John Skaller the foundation of the "Got bitten by Pierre
Club", anybody else who wants to participate?
;-)

   Sorry for this unsatisfactory answer, due to stupid limitations in the
   language.
   
Then I would like to suggest to add a new feature to a future
version of the format module: "do_never_print_ellipsis". Perhaps 
(set_max_boxes -1) could be interpreded this way.

Problems like "The most interesting problem repaired by the
Judges was that one entry nested Objective Caml's Format boxes
too deeply ....", quoted from [1], would then belong to the past.


BTW:

   set_max_boxes max_int;;
   
   On a regular machine this allows to simultaneously open no more than
   4611686018427387903 boxes, which could be large enough to pretty print

I have 

# max_int;;
- : int = 1073741823

so what's a regular machine??


Thanks anyway for the unsatisfactory answer,

Hendrik
