You seem to be talking about the original BSD license.  Note that in that
license, the requirement to keep the copyright notice makes it incompatible
with the GPL license (which is why there is a revised BSD license which
does away with the "keep the copyright notice" part).

This goes to show that using the old BSD license does not really save you
``from determining what is and is not allowed, and which code may be linked
or distributed with which other code.''
