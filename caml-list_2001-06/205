Once one gets used to it, it's really fun so don't give up...

The reason is obviously the use of "\n": this is a "real" newline, which
disregards indentation levels. The pretty printer will still assume that
it hasn't broken lines if you use this, which makes further output look
really strange.

You'll have to use "@\n" instead or also "Format.force_newline ()"
if you want to force a newline without confusing indentation levels.

The Format-module is very powerful! In most cases it will suffice if
you use hov-boxes (the default with "@[") + indentation annotations as
required. Try this for instance:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
open Bigarray
open Format

let print2d ppf a =
  fprintf ppf "@[<2>[|";
  for i = 0 to Array2.dim1 a - 1 do
    pp_force_newline ppf ();
    for j = 0 to Array2.dim2 a - 1 do
      fprintf ppf "%f;\t" a.{i,j}
    done
  done;
  fprintf ppf "@]@\n|]"

let _ =
  let ar = Array2.of_array float32 c_layout [|[|1.; 2.|]; [|3.; 4.|]|] in
  printf "%a@\n" print2d ar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
