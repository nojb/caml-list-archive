- block structure with lexical scope

C derived languages are relatively flat; yeah you can have nested scopes
but you can't nest function definitions. I hate that. Pascal derived
languages are much nicer in this respect, but they always have
restrictions on what you can do with functions. So ML style closures will 
be a lot nicer than Java style closures faked with objects since you don't 
have to explicitly make the local variables into arguments. 

I'll post an example if you wish, but I sent one to compl.lang.ml a few
months ago when some Python programmer was asking for examples of what
you could do in ML that you couldn't easily do in Python. I think Python 
is fixed now, but Java is still broken. So is C++ (sorry Chris, couldn't 
resist ;-).
