Hi,


Is there a list (or discussion) of code optimisations performed by the
caml family of compilers? I'd be interested in both the different
optimisations and their ordering. I had a quick look at the source,
but a higher level view would be much simpler.

I'd appreciate pointers, papers, etc.

Thanks,
  Laszlo

PS. I know the papers in caml.inria.fr/ocaml/papers (in particular the
ZINC paper). I also had a look at the archives, but only found a few
comments regarding particular optimisations.
