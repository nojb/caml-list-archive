I think that it is the right topic division, but I also think that this
list is yet a low volume list, so we don't need such kind of splitting.
I follow (really "lurk" is a better verb :) this list from 1 year and I
really like the discussions about caml internals and also like
announces.

But, if we will reach a volume like hundreds mail a day ... go and split
the list, please! :-)

Cheers.
