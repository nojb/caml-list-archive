Hi,

I just wanted to let everyone know that I have been doing some OCaml
modeling of signal processing chains. One of these is block convolution
processing using overlap-add of huge signal streams (GByte in length).

While this was only a modeling attempt I was amazed to find that the code is
able to keep up in realtime with stereo processing at 16 KHz sample rates on
a cheapo 500 MHz Pentium III running Win/98SE 256 MB RAM, with lots of disk
activity.

The speed is so good here that I am reluctant to recode this whole thing
into C for what I believe will be only a 20-30% speedup. The OCaml array
handling mechanism is very fast indeed.

I have run into problems with address space limitations given a 32-bit
architecture and a roughly 21 bit limit on maximum index of normal
(double-precision) arrays. When are we going to have readily available
64-bit architectures!?
