I agree, but that would also mean having CamlP4 in the base ocaml tarball. 
That isn't a complaint, I'd be perfectly happy with CamlP4 in there. Keeping 
the size of that tarball down ceased being an issue with me since 2.99/3.0 
or thereabouts, when the gzipped tarball became slightly bigger than a
double density floppy. And besides, I like P4 and Revised.
