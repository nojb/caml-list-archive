I think a good "Theoretical OCaml" course could be constructed from John
Harrison's notes (updated for OCaml) followed by your APPSEM notes. There's
some overlap, but that seems right to me.

Great, please announce the updates to the list, since I think it is of
general interest.

The beginners without much theoretical background is a very large group. 
Now that Jason Hickey's compiler course notes are available, the pressure 
for more extensive beginner docs, like the O'Reilly translation, are
reduced, but I think that such a doc should be available on the web in a 
format where it can be modified by volunteers. OCaml continues to evolve, 
but a static document will fall behind. Both the O'Reilly book and the 
CalTech notes are already missing discussion of some of the latest
features.

That's OK, the APPSEM notes are too scary for the raw beginner audience. 
Once they ride the camel, their curiosity surpasses their fear and they 
realize that they want to understand this beast in order to ride better,
and that's when theory steps in.
