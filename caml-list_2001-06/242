Have you read the special paragraph devoted to Format in the FAQ ?

http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/FAQ/format-eng.html

It says somewhere:

Practice
When writing a pretty-printing routine, follow these simple rules: 

[...]
4.Don't try to force line breaking, let the pretty-printer do it for
you: that's its only job. 
5.End your main program by a print_newline () call, that flushes the
pretty-printer tables (hence the ouput). (Note that the toplevel loop
of the interactive system does it as well, just before a new input.)
