Hello John,

First thanks for the manual. I've founded that I had previously downloaded your manual in those days I was
lost trying to catch something in Caml rapidly. So I started to search for additional information sources
and found your manual. I gave me the time to understand
some of the theory behind and bang! it was the real
beginning learnig Caml. I recommend to beginners also
take a while reading this manual as it is very usefull
to take real advantage of the language.

Best regards
Arturo
