As the proud owner of a new G4 Macintosh running OS X, I
think I'd agree. I've spent a day or two playing in
Objective-C and Cocoa and am quite impressed. In contrast to
C++-torture, ObjC is a marvelous experience - if you really
need to do C. It's still not OCaml. :)  One of the most
interesting aspects of Cocoa/OpenStep is the Interface
Builder ... you can build, prototype, & test the GUI pieces
without any of the background code written. Being relatively
new to both Cocoa and OCaml I have no idea how hard it would
be to build that interface, but I'm sure willing to give it
a go.
