	So much for 'free software'. :-(

Python is (effectively) public domain!

	.. messy .. it does weird things, like most X windows

I cut and paste a line, I get 'bad character' errors.

	I've tried that and couldn't get it to work.
That goes for about half the C/Ocaml packages I've tried,
including, of all things, CamlImages.

	Only if it is done in the standard distribution,
or in CDK (I'm using the CDK distribution). I don't want to 
patch around, and then have my fiddling undone by the
next distribution I build.
