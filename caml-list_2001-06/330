I'm missing a few things, in the nostalgic sense this time...

Slightly OT, does anyone have a cinkeys/indent definition for vim?

Is there a separate "indent" program?  I've got camlp4, but the printer
doesn't seem to have any configurability.  On that note, apart from the
style guide on the hump, are there other acceptable styles (like K&R, GNU,
et al for C programming)?

Also, how stable is the current syntax; set in stone?  Will the revised
syntax (or bits and pieces of it) be making it into the official ocaml
releases?

thanks
