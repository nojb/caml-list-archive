I have just been told that things work smoothly with dual-processor
machines under Linux, and it also turned out due to more experimentation
that the behaviour of native threads under Solaris is comparable to
a lottery: when running very long, it seems that multiple threads are
used. Sometimes. But sometimes you can also get bus errors. It's really
unpredictable. Better don't bother with native threads under Solaris...
