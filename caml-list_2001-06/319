	Hang on! I already have libreadline.
I don't want INRIA to distribute it, just detect if I already
have it. If I do, I would like to be able to link it in
to the top level.

	Alternatively, why not build the toplevel
with ledit?

	I am the one linking it into the toplevel, not INRIA.
It will have no impact on me, since I do not use the top
level for producing code (only for testing the occasional
small fragments).

	It's doubtful if the FSF licences mean much
anyhow. Python uses readline by default in its top level,
if available. There are lots of Python programs out there,
being run with a binary with readline linked in, which
are not licenced GPL, Python itself being an example.

	Please don't.
