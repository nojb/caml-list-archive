No, the "revised" BSD license (BSD license without advertising clause)
removes the condition that you have to state "this product contains
source code of Stefan Monnier".  Especially for huge software products
like the *BSD operating systems this clause became unweildy.

Keeping the copyright/license notice is probably the only thing that's
required by all licenses.

(I might have misunderstood you though, but I'd like to make this point
clear for the benefit of those who don't know the BSD license.)

That's certainly true, you always have to read licenses and understand
their legal implications.  It's just much easier to read and understand
the 20 lines of the BSD license than the endless pages of the GPL or
the LGPL.

P.S.: I also don't like the ideology behind the GPL, but that's
      a different matter.
