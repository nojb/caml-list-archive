If anyone would care to amuse themselves, I've posted a (nicely
highlighted, thanks to ocamldoc) copy of my first ocaml program to the web,
and I'm looking for some feedback on what I'm doing wrong, poorly,
inelegantly, the hard way, etc.  (My identing isn't consistent, I think;
let me know which is preferred :)

I'm going to be changing it so the robot has different modes, depending on
circumstance, but that's more about program design than language usage.

much thanks
