I respectfully disagree!  OCaml is a wonderful name.  Consider how much
easier it is to find OCaml resources via a search engine, compared to
C#, or C--, for example :-)

It is strange but this same idea just popped up on comp.lang.tcl ... "Tcl
isn't popular ... it must be because the name isn't sexy!"  (See thread:
http://groups.google.com/groups?ic=1&th=62d53dbb9f3ebba1,32)

I think it is far more important to have good marketing, good
introductory materials, some killer apps/libraries, and a vigorous
and helpful user community.
