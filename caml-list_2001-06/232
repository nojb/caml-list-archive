Hi,

I just started to try using the LablTk stuff and I find that it breaks
enough of my old Tk code that I feel somewhat helpless in getting started. I
downloaded that tarball of OCaml sample code and it too uses the old Tk
stuff.

Does anybody have any simple LablTk code that could show me how to get
started, including binding events?

I would be most grateful to you for the code, or a URL that points to some.

Cheers,

- DM
