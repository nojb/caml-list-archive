See the following URL (there's a link to the manual near the bottom):

Most of the CAML tutorial material here was compressed from an earlier
lecture course I gave based on CAML. You might also find the notes for
this course interesting:

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Teaching/Lectures/funprog-jrh-1996/index.html

This starts with basic lambda calculus theory before getting into real
CAML programming, so it might not appeal to many programmers. (Indeed, it
didn't appeal to most of the students, as I recall.) But this approach
does help to emphasize the fundamental theoretical simplicity of core ML.
And there are some quite nice programming examples near the end.

John.
