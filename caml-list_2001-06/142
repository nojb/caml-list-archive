I had just thought of a similar solution myself, but I wouldn't be so strict
as to disallow any use in an expression. Rather, as long as only one such
function call exists in any one expression it would be okay. That would
allow things like

let ans = prev_ans + process_tail() in ....

It does sound like an easy solution, so knowing myself as I do, I am
wondering what I don't understand about the details... If it were so easy,
then why hasn't it been done yet?
