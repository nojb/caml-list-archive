Waitaminute.  The Caml toplevel doesn't *link* with the Caml runtime
system and bytecode interpreter -- just like a shell script doesn't link
with the Bash shell.

That is, we have a piece of LGPL'd C code (the Caml bytecode
interpreter and runtime system) that links with whatever C libraries
happen to be LGPL-compatible and interprets bytecode for a QPL'd
program (the toplevel) produced by a QPL'd compiler (ocamlc).
What can possibly be wrong with that?

(Unless a GPL'd library cannot be linked with a LGPL'd program, which
would be a surprise to me, but you never know with those FSF licenses :-)
