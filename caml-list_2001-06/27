....well, I hate to say this... but I did recode the innermost loop in C and
it now runs more than 5 times faster... Straight recoding into C bought 4x,
and using better math brought that up to 5x.

I think the big thing here is that the OCaml code was producing huge amounts
of garbage, despite preallocated buffers with which all the processing was
reading and writing data. The ancillary closures and tuple args were just
eating my shirt...
