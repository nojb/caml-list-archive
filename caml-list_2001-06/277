Earlier, when asked `which language do you use for it?' I used to
answer `Objective See Ay Em Ell', but people often thought I meant
`Objective C', then :-) Now I say `Objective Camel'.  It means a bit
more to them than just `Oh-Camel'.  Unfortunately, they get the
impression that it's some obscure object oriented language like
Smalltalk now, so I add `a functional language'.  When I typed the URL
caml.inria.fr into the browser of a British coworker of mine, he
pointed at the `fr' part and shouted `NO, NO!  UNACCEPTABLE!!' :-)
