Excuse me, but why not to use Camlidl to define all interface C
funtions/data types (Camlidl user's manual claims that you can even use
.idl files from Windows SDK with some modifications) and then generate
necessary stubs and C<->ocaml conversion functions automatically? This will
make your life a way easier ...

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
