I'd wager that 90% of the reason Perl is so huge is due to _Learning Perl_.
Neophytes can start writing interactive programs on page 7.  I went from
near zero programming ability to writing an IDL parser/EDI data tranlator
in about a month or so using that and Programming Perl -- for which the OCaml
manual is a semi-reasonable, if terse and dry, match.  Is there hope for
the coming O'Reilly translation, or does it too think that I/O (i.e. doing
something useful and interesting) is something best left for the later
chapters (or the reference section)?  It's hard for me to believe that
OCaml can be both so good, and so unpopular (read: badly documented (read:
no friendly tutorials)).  From whence _Learning OCaml_?
