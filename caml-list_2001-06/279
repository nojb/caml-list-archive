I think all the published documents (manuals, the Web site, the
O'Reilly book) use the official name, which is "Objective Caml"
(pronounced: "Objective Camel").  I often use "Caml" for short when
talking about the core language.

The "OCaml" name that you dislike so much just spread among users by
itself, in particular on this mailing list, but there is not much that
we can do about it...  (Granted, the compiler commands are called
"ocaml<something>", but that was needed to distinguish them from the
"caml<something>" commands of Caml Light...)

I'll pass on "Leroy" -- flattery will get you nowhere :-)  Of course,
"Caml" is fine.  "Camel" is the pronounciation, but we're quite fond
of the "ml" spelling.

And then it gives them the impression that it's some obscure
functional language like Haskell? :-) :-)

Meanwhile, Blair is manoeuvering the British to switch to the Euro, so
I'm not too concerned here...  Still, you can use www.ocaml.org instead;
your coworker will like it more, but Tore will like it less.
Not www.caml.org to my great regret, since the caml.org domain is
registered already by the "Cruel Angel Mailing List" (no kidding)...
