I was probably the one.
All I did was an embryo of interface, entirely hand written.
So if you are courageous, go ahead. There will be no duplication.
If you're curious, I can send you my attempt.

I see perfectly the point. The trouble is that C++ is rather hard to
interface to, due to the staticness of its compilation. You may have
to write several wrappers for methods, depending on the position of
the class in the hierarchy... Gtk's dynamic model is easier.
Anyway, Qt is a wonderful toolkit, and having an interface to it would
be nice.

Another interesting work to do is building an interface for Cocoa
(Nextstep by its old name). This might prove much easier, since
Objective C is more dynamic, and a closer match for ocaml's OO.

Cheers,
