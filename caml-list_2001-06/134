I suspect many of the jobs done with Ocaml occur when the customer doesn't
really care how the system is implemented as long as it works. I guess the
reason this doesn't happen more often is a self-reinforcing one: if the
system ever needs maintenance, the customer's unlikely to be happy about
it being in a "marginal" language.
