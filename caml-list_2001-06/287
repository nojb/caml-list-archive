Sorry for that I was just a bit tired by a more than 5 hours long
meeting. I was also taking it for granting that everybody would
understand that I was joking: could you imagine opening so much boxes
that it could overflow a limit which is as large as a number that has
``9 * 2 ^ 30 decimal digits'' ? Could you imagine anything real (such
that a computation or something that you can count) that can overflow
such a huge number (much much bigger than even a google) ?

Also, I don't know if we have to permanently be calm and solemn when
posting to this mailing list. Well, I guess it's the best way given
the medium ...

This way of interpreting negative numbers seems a bit strange to
me. Also this would add a lot of particular cases, just for people who
need more than 1073741823 simultaneously open boxes (just have a look
to this number, it is really huge indeed).

OK, you win. Then I would prefer to set pp_max_boxes to max_int at
creation time of the ``formatter''. This is simpler and more
logical...

Sorry for that also, you need some context to understand that one: a
``regular'' machine is a kind of nickname we used here to name our 64
bits alpha machines, I suppose that this is a way to insist on the
fact that there exist other processors than Intel's ...

You're very welcome.
