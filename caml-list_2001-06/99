	I find that a strange comment. I know C++ pretty well,
but I only use a subset of it. Indeed, I claim that this is
_because_ I know it so well. Preferably, the empty subset :-)

	I use a subset of Ocaml for a different reason:
the subset seems adequate for what I need, and I don't
understand some of the higher level constructions well enough
to rely on them. In this case, I'd love to learn more ..
which is why I read this list :-)
