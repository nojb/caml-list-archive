Hi there,

I wouldn't like to be patronising in this, so please forgive if I don't use as many
emoticons as I should be doing... ;)

I gather you are learning the language... If it is because you want to try
something new or want to check some of the publicised "good" qualities of FP, why
don't you try to code your type in *both* styles, one using constants and the other
sum types and then make a better-informed decision?

As long as you are at it, also, why not make it into a tutorial for the coding of
such types? We seem to be short on tutorials in Ocaml...

Regards, and best of luck... I hope you see the light (and start coding in Ocaml!
:) )
