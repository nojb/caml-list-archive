Would it make sense to split up caml-list into a few new lists?  A lot of other
language projects offer three lists, a devel list, an announce list, and a users
list.  For ocaml, this would be:

caml-announce:
    announcements of new versions of ocaml and ocaml-related packages
caml-devel:
    discussion of ocaml bugs and internals
caml-users:
    general questions about ocaml usage and problems

Such a division might make it easier for people to ask newbie questions without
troubling the core ocaml team.  On the other hand, caml-list is fairly low
volume, so it might not be worth it.
