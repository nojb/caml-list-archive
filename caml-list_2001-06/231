It depends on the group that you're targeting for the tutorial, of course. 
I think writing from scratch is a fine idea. I think a tutorial should be 
aimed at getting (C++/Java/Perl) programmers up to speed quickly so it 
would probably be a bit boring for the type theory heavy crowd.

Borrow from good SML tutorials like Robert Harper's too I say.

This is in French, which would be a problem for a lot of programmers that
I know. Interestingly, I seem to have picked up enough written French from
reading this list (with a dictionary and some phrasebooks of course) that 
I could read almost all of this. If Didier would like to make the TeX
available, I could take a stab at translating this. He has also written 

http://cristal.inria.fr/~remy/cours/appsem/

which I think is just wonderful, but I don't think its for the beginning
OCaml'er. It's for a more sophisticated programmer, and delves into type 
theory issues.

I believe with perfect faith in the coming of OCaml.

That's true, but there were certainly some pretty major cleanups in 
Python with respect to its scoping that I think make it a much better
language. Of course, it's not OCaml, but it's clearly popular enough that 
lots of people want it on their resumes. OCaml is not there yet.

There are a few places where I think improvements can be made. From what
I've read, INRIA is working on all of them.

I was thinking more of writing free, web available tutorials to increase
the user base. That needs to happen to bring more people on board. Only
then will there be a big market for OCaml books in Anglophone nations. 
In other words, 

	Ask not what the OCaml community can do for you, ask what you 
	can do for the OCaml community.

I feel your pain. It's tough to go back to C++ or Java, isn't it?
