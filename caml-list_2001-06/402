Subject: [Caml-list] linking ocaml with java

Hi,

I wrote a very simple tautology checker in ocaml - I have an existing
application in java that could benefit from it.  I suppose I could go from
ocaml to COM and from jintegra into java and the other way around; however,
I would much prefer to have ocaml and java work together without an
intermediary.

I am under the impression that some versions of ML already have translators
to java byte code - I am assuming that this is the case for ocaml although I
didn't see anything on the caml web page that confirms my impression.

If it is possible to link ocaml with java, could someone point me to some
documentation or provide the instructions.

Thanks.
Robert
