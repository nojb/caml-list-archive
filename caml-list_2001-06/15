We already do: Alphas are pretty affordable, and
you can get a 64bit SPARC for about $1000, even
running Linux if you like.

I think widespread adoption of 64bit machines will
make a huge difference for polymorphic and dynamic
languages, however.  32 bits is kind of tight for
numbers+type bits or pointers+type bits, but
in 64 bits, you can put both numbers and type bits
without feeling squeezed.  That should eliminate
the need for a lot of static analysis and runtime
tricks.

Tom.
