To follow up on my previous post, which hasn't shown up here yet, the
advantage of a really popular language is that the libraries have been
thoroughly hammered by users.  In contrast, there are quite a few
libraries for Ocaml, but typically I pick one up and start using it
and quickly run into bugs.  Any feature the author isn't using is
likely to need work.  This is somewhat annoying to me, and quite
disconcerting to a less experienced programmer.

I'm just saying that popularity is a good thing for a programming
language.
