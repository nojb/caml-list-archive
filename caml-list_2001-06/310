Whow, even Xavier wants to have fun interpreting the GPL.

As long as you distribute the special runtime containing readline
separately from the toplevel, this reasoning is OK. But the first man
making a custom toplevel is dead: having both in the same file won't
do. Even distributing libreadline inside the ocaml distribution might
be a problem: the intent of using readline inside the toplevel is
clear enough that the whole thing can be seen as a whole work (cf
paragraph 2b).

I don't know either :-)
