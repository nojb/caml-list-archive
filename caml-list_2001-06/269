Unless you dual license like TrollTech finally did for Qt.

This said, i am not asking for a GPLed version of ocaml, please don't take it
so.

That said, i have just checked, the toplevel directory is under the QPL, i
suppose it links also to all the LGPLed part of the ocaml runtime, altough a
quick glance at the corresponding makefile don't show that clearly.

Would a LGPLed version of the toplevel files solve this, i don't know, i just
aksed the debian legal mailing list about this, will forward what they tell me
about it.

Friendly,
