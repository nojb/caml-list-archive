Indeed, these notes were aimed at an advanced audience (master level or
more). 

Actually, I have just finished a first revision of these notes (thanks,
Brian for your support). Mainly, I fixed some typos, improved the
presentation and added exercises. The size also increased by 40%.

I might do a second revision in the fall.

Conversely, the ISIA notes were written for Ocaml beginners without much
theoretical background.  I included some of this material into the APPSEM
notes and I may add more in the future.

This would not be a problem for me, but there could be redundancy with my
APPSEM notes.
