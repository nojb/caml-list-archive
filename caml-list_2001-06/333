Dear caml users,

I'm new to ocaml and want to play with signal processing of audio
signals mostly, also video (will depend on performance), I use to
do that with C (http://philou.ch/libdsp.c) but never liked to code
as much memory management stuff around the real thing, I'm not
a programmer, or a very lazy one :)

OCaml catched my attention of finally something new and clever on
the programming language side, with both high-level paradigm and ability
to do lower level plumbery in case. performance seems good, even close
to C on quite some benchmarks.

I browsed a lot to find signal processing free ocaml code without much
sucess, while at the same time crossing post of peoples doing DSP developpement
on this mailing list.
Isn't the time to share some DSP code into a library?

Personnaly, I'm looking for fft, dct, wavelet processing mostly.

kind regards, and kudos to the caml developpers!
