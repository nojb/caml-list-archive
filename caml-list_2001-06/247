It looks like you've got the wrong subject line.

To what? To the caml toplevel? And the bytecode compiler since it is
included? I'm in no position to answer, but if the goal is only to use
GNU readline, then I do not really see the point. There are many
alternatives avilable. Only very few libraries are distributed under
the GPL, and most of them you would not want to include by default in
the ocaml toplevel. (It might be OK to link with them as long as
you do not distribute the result, but I'm no expert in GPL.)

> Anyone written/writing a wrapper?

I don't know of any. Again, GNU readline, while being a useful tool,
is not unique, and making ledit into a library might be more
interesting.

Best regards,
