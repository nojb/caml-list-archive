Congratulations, lots of us have been waiting for such an extension. It's 
a bit of a pity that one of the current limitations of the system is 
that it doesn't work with objects, but I suppose you are saving that for
the final merging when you can name the whole thing GO'Caml, which will 
perhaps please some people who aren't satisfied with the current name, 
and opens up lots of opportunities for logos (fan's yelling  "Go Caml
go!", a clever looking Caml playing go, etc :-)

Enough joking, time to play with this new toy...
