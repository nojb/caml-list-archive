I use LabGL every day on windows.  I did need to do some slightly wacky stuff to get it to work right, but nothing major.  I use it with LablTk usually, but I also got it to work with LablGtk.

I'm out of town right now, but I'll do some diffs upon my return (next week, send me a reminder) and contribute the changes back to the source (I'm actually in Tokyo right now, and Jacques is in Kyoto, but alas, I was unable to get down there or we could have merged them directly from my laptop!).
