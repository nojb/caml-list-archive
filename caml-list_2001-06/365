I don't think, just because usually they are included this way:

caml-announce is included in caml-users that is included in caml-devel

Developpers should know everything that is said on each list (anyway they can
filter e-mails).
It's the reverse way, core ocaml team won't trouble newbie with obscure
metaphysic thought ;)
