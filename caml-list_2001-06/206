I had the choice of "try to get the formatting working for no other reason than curiosity" or "write more real code on my game", so the latter edged it out.  :)

This works better, thanks!  I swear I tried something exactly like that...

There's a tiny bit of weirdness with the tabs after the first column, but it's way better than what I had.  I definitely tried the @\n, but I admit I was randomly typing at that point.  The docs could stand to be a bit clearer on newlines versus breaks.  Perhaps your print2d would make a good complementary tutorial to the expression printer in the FAQ...

Thanks,
Chris
