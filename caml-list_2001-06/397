This is currently not supported, and would actually be quite hard to
implement.  The backtrace mechanism is highly dependent on standalone
executables, with the debugging info being "linked in" the executable.

I'm very, very surprised by this.  It works fine here.  If you can
reproduce the problem, please report it (along with a recipe for
reproducing it) to caml-bugs@inria.fr.

scott@chronis.pobox.com suggested:

This won't do.  At best, it would report a stack backtrace when the
ocaml toplevel itself dies on an uncaught exception (which should
never happen), but not backtraces for user-defined code.
