Subject: [Caml-list] Repeat: is there a Qt binding for OCaml?

It was last asked midway through 2000: is there a Qt binding for OCaml? 

Within the KDE community there are several developers who would really be 
interested in working on Qt -- and KDE -- bindings for OCaml, but there's no 
sense in that if they already exist. In particular, there was mention of a 
partially working Qt binding -- perhaps the author of that could give me a 
ring?

What's the point, you ask, of Qt bindings (as opposed to Gtk bindings which 
we all know exist already)? It's probably a religious thing. But I know C++ 
gets me down some days, and I'd like to do something functional and OO at the 
same time. Besides, I think OCaml + Qt is a good choice vs. Clean + w98, but 
that's a whole other flamewar.
