Note that the proper quote from which, I believe, this semi-derives is:

The Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman was once asked by a Caltech colleague to 
explain why spin 1/2 particles obey Fermi Dirac statistics. He responded, 
"I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But a few days later he returned 
and said, "You know, I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman 
level. That means we really don't understand it."

This is quoted in _Six Easy Pieces_, _Six Not So Easy Pieces_, and, I 
believe, _Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman_.  A web search via Google with 
"Feynman" and "lecture" will reveal more.
