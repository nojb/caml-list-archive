Yes, I'm not sure why. I also forget why ACT created the GNAT modified GPL 
instead of just using the Library GPL (which predates the Lesser GPL), it 
might have something to do with GNAT's generic instantiation scheme which
is macro-like rather than shared. I could try asking Robert Dewar or
Richard Kenner.

Well, if I remember correctly it is intended for the case where there is
already a competing library under another license. Otherwise, RMS would 
rather have you use the GPL. In fact, ACT releases it's XML libraries for 
Ada under the full GPL, not LGPL. I understand the motivation, but I side 
with Dave Berry on this one; its not worth it for many companies to change 
their business model just so that they can use a library. LGPL and GMGPL 
allow more companies to participate in the free software world and
hopefully will allow them to slowly migrate over.
