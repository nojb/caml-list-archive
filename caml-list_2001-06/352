I was worried this would incur a slow down (in Python, nested function 
objects are instantiated when a function is called and destroyed when it 
exits; the code object isn't destroyed, but there still is the additional 
overhead of creating a function object from it.)  I assume now, since it's a 
feature so widely used (I see it anytime I look at others' OCaml code) that 
it doesn't.  Thanks for pointing that out.

Jeremy
