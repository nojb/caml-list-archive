I have my students/friends read Cardelli's "Typeful Programming", mentioned 
below, before teaching/introducing any language with typing.  It is the 
most readable summary of the topic that I know.

My HHGTTG entry for OCaml (or other languages with similarly strong type 
systems) would be "bad things don't unexpectedly happen when your run the 
program".  That seems to be good enough to interest the friends that I 
continue to convert.

Best,
Joe
