	For Ocaml, I agree, but then I don't have that much
old code I care about.

	I like your positive approach  

	"When Ocaml becomes so popular .." :-)

	But Python too is severely constrained by backwards 
compatibility requirements. It is the main reason I gave up on it
as a serious language: it is beyond fixing.

	OTOH, Ocaml doesn't really _need_ fixing :-)

	I'd love to, but the language isn't popular enough for me
to make enough money selling books on it: I'd make a respectable income
from C++ books, but I have lost enthusiasm for promoting it.
Blame Ocaml for that. Catch-22.
