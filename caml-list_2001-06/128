Is Ocaml's acceptability at Pixar independent of its use in the larger
marketplace? If so, I'm surprised. (I believed that the opposite was the
case for Lisp, from your comments on cll.) The more people who use a
language, the more useful it is through the availability of tools, libraries
and trained programmers. And yes, the more politically acceptable it is to
decision makers. Which is fair enough - what if INRIA does stop supporting
Caml?

There's also the larger question of our professional responsibility to
society. Software quality is a key (though usual buried) problem for the
modern world. Tools that can improve it are good. Ocaml has significant
potential to do that. I'd hate to see it under used to the extent that CLOS
and Smalltalk are.
