Yes.

I think the answer is that the ``effect''ness isn't simply captured in
the type.  So the current type-inference engine would not be able to
do it.  It would require a bit of ad-hocery in the compiler.  That
doesn't mean that it's unsound, just that the existing compiler
mechanisms couldn't do it.
