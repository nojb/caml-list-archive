	I don't agree. It does take time to learn to use
recursion and inductive data types effectively, but they
exist in C++ too.

	The really BIG culture shift, in my opinion,
is something much simpler: syntax. I think humans,
particularly experts, can read programs by high speed
unconscious pattern matching that is _highly_ sensitive
to syntactic form, and even lexicology. 

	Just try reading C++ or Ocaml which is not sensibly 
indented to see what I mean, or switch the colours around
in your favourite colourizing editor to get immediate
vertigo and loss of comprehension.

	Or have a look at the arguments about which
operator to use for some feature. Syntax is more
important than most of us think.
