I'm not denying any of that.  It would be easier to push Ocaml around here if it
had the kind of visibility that Python or Perl enjoys.  I don't feel like
there's much I can personally do to advance Ocaml globally at the moment,
though, so I'm more immediately interested in what I can do locally.

I've been wondering if I was the only one that reads cll and caml-list. ;)

So would I.  I'm focusing on making my own little dent at the moment.

A little buzzword compliance doesn't hurt, of course, which is why I was
wondering if anyone is working on SOAP libs.
