I sorta agree with Tore Lund opinion about the name of the language 
(though i think that all he'll get callin it Camel is being sued and
asked for billions of $$$$ by a great amercian tobacco firm :-)) )

Indeed i'll try to bring the newbie point of view :
Ocaml is funny, the logo is tremendously attractive but...all that is
kinda complicated, and I think that it is not the better name to make it
spread all over the world.

I mean, people get lazier and lazier each day  (hissin things like
"Java,C++,PHP"  between two beers like good sofa potatoes.. :-) )
so they need a short ad-ictive funny name...I personnally think  you
should organize a great contest for the best play on words with ML in it
(like RiML, puML, and many more goodies).
