And ledit needs camlp4, right, but i gues syou could preprocess it or
something like that ?

But they could distribute them without libreadline being used.

Sure this would mean more work, but i think if someone contribute a patch for
supporting it, they would gladly accept it.

That said adding ledit or something similar to ocaml would be nice.

Did not some incarnation of caml-light had some kind of librealine like
functionality ? what happened to that ?

Or was it just librealine and it was removed, because of the licensing issue ?
