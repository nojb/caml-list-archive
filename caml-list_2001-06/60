Thank you very much for your informative replies. I understand more
clearly now, I think.

I have one more question to do with patternmatching on modules.

Currently, I have this:

module Deque = RealTimeDeque(struct let c = 3 end);;
type 'a deque = 'a Deque.queue

type tree = CompTree of tree deque * tree deque;;

let dcons = Deque.cons;;
let dhead = Deque.head;;
let dtail = Deque.tail;;

let dsnoc = Deque.snoc;;
let dlast = Deque.last;;
let dinit = Deque.init;;

...

let rec lastTree t acc = 
        match t with 
(*              CompTree(Deque.empty, d2) -> acc *)
        
                CompTree(d1,d2) ->
                        let newTree = CompTree(dinit d1,
                                               dcons (dhead d1) d2)
                        in lastTree newTree (newTree::acc)


I'd like to match the empty Deque, but this gives me a syntax error when i
uncomment the third line. What should I be doing here?

Apologies for asking so many simple/silly questions. I'm still coming to
grips with Ocaml.

Regards,
Mark
