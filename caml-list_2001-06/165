	In principle, the Felix type checker would prevent this:
side-effects are not permitted in functions. In practice,
I had to relax the syntax permitted in functions, and the current
translator doesn't check for side effects yet. You can also
cheat, by wrapping C functions as Felix functions: there's no
way to check if the C function has side effects or not.

	The reason for relaxing the rules is that it is very ugly
and insecure to write things like:

	val x : int; // uninitialised variable!
	fetch(&x, &state_object);

instead of

	val x : int = fetch(&state_object);

I can't think of good way around this though.
