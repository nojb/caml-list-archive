No. What I said was that you won't convice sceptical colleagues that you're
right in choosing ocaml until you ship. Until then, you're burning up
political capital and your job/VC/Project is at risk - much more so than if
you're using a mainstream technology like C or C++. You certainly won't
convince anyone that ocaml was the right choice by saying that you're
developing faster "from day one" as you claimed. People make claims that all
the time. They're usually wrong. In fact, making claims like will reduce
crdibility - unless you've got unusually tight metrics to back you're claim
up. From your comments, I'm pretty sure you've never been a lead on a
commercial project.

The point here isn't to give up on promoting Ocaml. It's to do it in a smart
way - by understanding the barriers to adoption of the language

Hmm. No one I've ever met uses GnuSmalltalk. My understanding from people
who have tried is that its only marginall usable. The standard open source
smalltalk is Squeak. Ruby, a Smalltalk cousin, is probably alos worth
looking at  - and is spreading like wildfire. You can find more Smalltalk
stuff at www.stic.org
