mmm,

did not the kde guys take the version of libreadline that was distributed with
libc6 (which is under lgpl i think) and work from that ? But then it was
during the horrible kde/qt vs FSF war, so ...

Also notice, i think to remember, would need checking though, that if you
allow a program to link to a GPLed library as an alternative, then there is no
problem, so some people may be able to build ocaml with libreadline, and other
without, without further complication on the ocaml lincencing status. Not sure
though. 

If the ocaml team want to have more information on this issue, i can ask
advice on debina-legal, if you want ?

Friendly,
