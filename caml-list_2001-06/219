Have any of you ever considered using a wiki as a collaborative
documentation tool for OCaml? I have set one up at

http://deathonastick.org:8000/OCaml/

to demonstrate what I have in mind. I hope others are interested, feel
free to use the swiki I set up, though I may change the domain if it
becomes popular, any data you put there will be available indefinately. I
intend to use it if nothing else for some tutorials I've been planning.

Feedback is appreciated,
--Brock
