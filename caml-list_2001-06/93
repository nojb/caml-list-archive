C++ is certainly a pathological worst case, and I can't really think of another
language as baroque and confusing (certainly not Ocaml).  I suppose the biggest
hurdles for programmers new to Ocaml are type theory and functional thinking.

Software development is an essentially complicated task these days, so good
tools will probably necessarily be somewhat complex too.  I certainly intend to
keep using and advocating Ocaml.  I'm mainly interested in finding out what
other working programmers are doing to sell it to their colleagues.
