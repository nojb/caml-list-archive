I think this is an excellent idea.  At Penn, our research active
internetwork has two publicly available implementations: one in Java, and
the other in Ocaml.  Despite the fact that the Ocaml implementation is more
flexible, better documented, faster, and still maintained, most users go for
the clumsy, slow, poorly documented, unmaintained Java implementation (even
after trying the Ocaml one) because they balk at learning Ocaml.  Making the
language easier to learn (and your suggestion above seems like a good start)
would be a boon to the community I think.
