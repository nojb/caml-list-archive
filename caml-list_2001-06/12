I think SISAL is *the* premiere example of why scientific computing
is still avoiding modern languages and favors FORTRAN instead:

It was a one shot project with no long term perspective, even the
code is gone and none of the official distribution sites do exist
any more. The lifetime of the language didn't even span the
lifetime of a typical high energy physics experiment.  A physicist who
had bet his professional success on SISAL would be turning burgers
at McDonalds by now.

Yours, Florian Hars.
