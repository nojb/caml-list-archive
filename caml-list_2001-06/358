I'm afraid the documentation is ahead of the source :-(  
ThreadUnix will be deprecated as described above, however this
couldn't be completed in time for the 3.01 release.  I probably forgot
to "de-update" the documentation.

But, yes, the solution to Nicolas' need is to get rid of ThreadUnix
entirely.
