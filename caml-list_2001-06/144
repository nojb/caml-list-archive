Earlier, I stated that there were no reference vars in the program. That's
strictly true only of the OCaml portion of the code. However, the C/C++ core
does maintain a mutable state and that is the reason for evaluation order
dependencies.

It would seem that the compiler could automatically spot side effecting
functions and propagate that attribute by noticing when reference vars are
modified, when arrays and structures are mutated, etc. Hence explicit
declaration should be unnecessary -- except! for those declared "external"
routines that have side effects. Those need to be flagged explicitly to the
compiler.
