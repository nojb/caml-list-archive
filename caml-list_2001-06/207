Subject: [Caml-list] enums in OCaml?

What's the right way to make something like C's enums in OCaml.  I found a
couple references to sum types online and in the manual and caml light
tutorial, but none of it was really what I'm looking for: alias a number
with a name, hopefully conveniently.  Should I just make some named
variables?  That seems a bit verbose and un-clever.
