Actually, I bet that firm is dying (cough, cough) for any kind of positive
advertisement, so I doubt they'd sue. More likely the humorless do-gooders 
will lynch you here in the USA if you try to use the Joe Camel logo. I
like it a lot myself, even though I don't smoke. 

Anyways, IMO the name is fine, the logo is good, the language is great, I
must be dumb because most of the libraries seem to work great for me, etc, 
ad infinitum, ad nauseum. I'd rather fight than switch. Oops, wrong
brand...
