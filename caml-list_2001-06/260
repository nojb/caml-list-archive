Yes, setting the default value to the maximum possible value is
conceivable. However, this (reasonable) limit is there as a kind of
alert to tell the user that the number of boxes the programs opens is
now considered large (hence you may consider having a look at the
printing program to see if it works properly). This is the performance
problem you may have (not in the library but in your printing
routines). However if this is generally agreed, we can do it ...
