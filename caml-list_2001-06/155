I am going to strongly disagree with this statement.  I think that
more libraries are extremely important, and I also think that the fact
that many good things are unpopular doesn't imply that all popular
things are bad, or that something becomes worse when it becomes
popular.

I also believe that the "right thing for the wrong reason" beats the
heck out of the wrong thing in most cases.
