But, we've got someone willing to do the work for everybody, so it seems a shame not to use it just because we can't figure out what the 100% Right Thing is.  

How about putting a nested ASCII (or ISO_Latin_1, or whatever) module inside Char, and putting the ascii specific functions in there?  That way it's clear what they're doing and what they support, and we still get to use the fruits of his free labor.  ;)

And then you can add a Unicode one, when we find somebody to do that, etc.
