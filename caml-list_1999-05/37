Hi,

there is a new TEST version of the O'Caml link DB:

	http://www.npc.de/gerd/testdb/

It has an extended data model, which allows it to distinguish between
original links maintained by the authors themselves and reported links
entered by anybody else. It is now possible to classify the entries,
and the list of categories is extensible. There are some more new
fields.

The user interface has been improved, both the versions with and without
frames. 

Most important, the structure of the program has been revised, the core
is now a persistent object model supplemented by some reusable
components, such as a universal record editor.

Please test the new version and send your comments back to me, this
would help me very much.

The productive version can still be found at http://www.npc.de/ocaml/linkdb.

Gerd
