Actually I am not using daVinci, but dot from AT&T's graphviz package.

I start dot with open_process and pipe my graph descriptions into it,
reading back its layout with ocamllex/ocamlyacc generated parsers.
I then adapt the layout to my own needs and integrate it into
the HOPS GUI, where the user can manually change the layout.

I kill dot every 10 or 20 graphs, because it seems to have a space leak.
