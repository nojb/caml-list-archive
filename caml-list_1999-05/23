As a part of my diploma (and a part of some larger project) i'm implementing the
Directed Graph Drawing Algorithm which can be found at
http//www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz. 
It will be tool to show the control flow graph of the C program. 
I'm implementing it with pure OCaml and Tk library.

My tool is far from complete so you can't download it from anywhere :)
Anyway i could help you with some tips and tricks about that.


SY, Nicholas
