Call for Papers of Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing
Special Issue on =E2=80=9CAI Drives Our Future Life=E2=80=9D

SUMMARY
While =E2=80=9CArtificial Intelligence=E2=80=9D (AI) becomes the mainstream=
 of application
techniques breakthrough, its impacts to our future life is unprecedented.
AI becomes increasingly important for understanding complex data and
offering intelligent processing to foster innovative business applications,
self-driving cars, voice recognition, drug design, and new medical
applications in the future. Recently, new technologies with explainable AI,
such as federated learning, meta-learning, active learning, multi-task
learning, inductive graph learning, transfer learning, and ensemble
learning, have emerged and attracted considerable interests from both
academic and industrial communities.
Meanwhile, the rising prominence of AI has dramatically transformed a
variety of domains. For intelligent wireless networks, due to privacy
constraints and limited communication resources, distributed multi-agent
reinforcement learning and federated learning are employed to solve complex
convex and nonconvex optimization problems and collaboratively learn shared
prediction models for user clustering, resource management, and
interference alignment. For smart automatic driving, robust deep learning
models that are capable to avoid adversarial examples are developed to
analyze world state representations and behavior models, as well as
forecast and control the car trajectory according to various sensors (e.g.,
cameras, HD maps, inertial measurement units, wheel encoders, LiDAR).
Moreover, for immersive VR and AR, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
have been widely adopted to address scene segmentation, depth estimation,
realistic 3D modeling, image fusion, whereas effective gaze estimation and
prediction algorithms are designed to reduce the computation time for
immersive view rendering. For health and digitized education, AI is also
the cornerstone to infer indicators of disease activities for early
detection of emerging outbreaks, and to facilitate knowledge tracing for
online courses. To support the above applications, domain-specific software
and hardware co-design in DNN accelerators is crucial to boost the
performance and energy efficiency for various computation and
memory-intensive tasks, making these models usable on smaller devices at
the edge of the Internet. Researchers and practitioners are jointly
devoting efforts to develop solutions for related problems using various AI
methods. Therefore, this special issue aims to bring together recent
advances in AI for various domains to share new findings among the
community and bridge the gaps between research and practice.
