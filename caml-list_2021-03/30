Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2021 will be a venue for researchers to present
and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe
results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.


Industrial track and topics of interest

This year's edition of IFL explicitly solicits original work concerning
*applications*
of functional programming in industry and academia. These contributions
will be reviewed by experts with an industrial background.

Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:

* language concepts
* type systems, type checking, type inferencing
* compilation techniques
* staged compilation
* run-time function specialisation
* run-time code generation
* partial evaluation
* (abstract) interpretation
* meta-programming
* generic programming
* automatic program generation
* array processing
* concurrent/parallel programming
* concurrent/parallel program execution
* embedded systems
* web applications
* (embedded) domain-specific languages
* security
* novel memory management techniques
* run-time profiling performance measurements
* debugging and tracing
* testing and proofing
* virtual/abstract machine architectures
* validation, verification of functional programs
* tools and programming techniques
* applications of functional programming in the industry, including
** functional programming techniques for large applications
** successes of the application functional programming
** challenges for functional programming encountered
** any topic related to the application of functional programming that is
interesting for the IFL community


Post-symposium peer-review

Following IFL tradition, IFL 2021 will use a post-symposium review process
to
produce the formal proceedings.

Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft papers will
be
screened by the program chairs to make sure that they are within the scope
of
IFL. The draft papers will be made available to all participants at the
symposium. Each draft paper is presented by one of the authors at the
symposium.

After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a full paper,
incorporating feedback from discussions at the symposium. Work submitted to
IFL
may not be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must
adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy. The program committee will
evaluate these submissions according to their correctness, novelty,
originality,
relevance, significance, and clarity, and will thereby determine whether
the
paper is accepted or rejected for the formal proceedings. We plan to
publish
these proceedings in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the
ACM Digital Library, as in previous years. Moreover, the proceedings will
also
be made publicly available as open access.


Important dates

Submission deadline of draft papers:           17 August 2021
Notification of acceptance for presentation:   19 August 2021
Registration deadline:                         30 August 2021

### Submission details

All contributions must be written in English. Papers must use the ACM two
columns conference format, which can be found at:

Peter Landin Prize

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the
symposium every year. The honoured article is selected by the program
committee
based on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize
carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.

o bring together researchers actively engaged<br>in the implementation and =
application of functional and function-based<br>programming languages. IFL =
2021 will be a venue for researchers to present and<br>discuss new ideas an=
d concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results<br>related to th=
e implementation and application of functional languages and<br>function-ba=
sed programming.<br><br><br>Industrial track and topics of interest<br><br>=
This year&#39;s edition of IFL explicitly solicits original work concerning=
 *applications*<br>of functional programming in industry and academia. Thes=
e contributions will be reviewed by experts with an industrial background.<=
br><br>Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:<br><br>* =
language concepts<br>* type systems, type checking, type inferencing<br>* c=
ompilation techniques<br>* staged compilation<br>* run-time function specia=
lisation<br>* run-time code generation<br>* partial evaluation<br>* (abstra=
ct) interpretation<br>* meta-programming<br>* generic programming<br>* auto=
matic program generation<br>* array processing<br>* concurrent/parallel pro=
gramming<br>* concurrent/parallel program execution<br>* embedded systems<b=
r>* web applications<br>* (embedded) domain-specific languages<br>* securit=
y<br>* novel memory management techniques<br>* run-time profiling performan=
ce measurements<br>* debugging and tracing<br>* testing and proofing<br>* v=
irtual/abstract machine architectures<br>* validation, verification of func=
tional programs<br>* tools and programming techniques<br>* applications of =
functional programming in the industry, including<br>** functional programm=
ing techniques for large applications<br>** successes of the application fu=
nctional programming<br>** challenges for functional programming encountere=
d<br>** any topic related to the application of functional programming that=
 is interesting for the IFL community <br><br><br>Post-symposium peer-revie=
w<br><br>Following IFL tradition, IFL 2021 will use a post-symposium review=
 process to<br>produce the formal proceedings. <br><br>Before the symposium=
 authors submit draft papers. These draft papers will be <br>screened by th=
e program chairs to make sure that they are within the scope of <br>IFL. Th=
e draft papers will be made available to all participants at the <br>sympos=
ium. Each draft paper is presented by one of the authors at the symposium.<=
br><br>After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a full pape=
r, <br>incorporating feedback from discussions at the symposium. Work submi=
tted to IFL<br>may not be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submiss=
ions must <br>adhere to ACM SIGPLAN&#39;s republication policy. The program=
 committee will <br>evaluate these submissions according to their correctne=
ss, novelty, originality,<br>relevance, significance, and clarity, and will=
 thereby determine whether the <br>paper is accepted or rejected for the fo=
rmal proceedings. We plan to publish <br>these proceedings in the Internati=
onal Conference Proceedings Series of the <br>ACM Digital Library, as in pr=
evious years. Moreover, the proceedings will also<br>be made publicly avail=
able as open access. <br><br><br>Important dates<br><br>Submission deadline=
