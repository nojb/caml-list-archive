Subject: [Caml-list] [CFP] Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and

=============================================================

 Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice
                            LFMTP 2021

                        Pittsburgh, USA, 16 July 2021
                         Affiliated with CADE-28

                     http://lfmtp.org/workshops/2021/
=============================================================
        Abstract submission deadline: 19 April 2021
        Paper submission deadline: 26 April 2021

Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for
representing, implementing and reasoning about a wide variety of
deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their
design, implementation and their use in reasoning tasks, ranging from
the correctness of software to the properties of formal
systems, have been the focus of considerable research over the last two
decades. This workshop will bring together designers, implementors and
practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and
utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable
binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the
expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.

LFMTP 2021 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art
techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:

* Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming
languages,
  logical systems and related formally specified systems.

* Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable
  binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about,
  datatypes defined from binding signatures.

* Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and
  associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher
  dimension in homotopy type theory

* Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry,
  equational reasoning and category theory.

* New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks,
  contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting
  binders, functional programming over logical frameworks,
  homotopy and cubical type theory.

* Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures,
proof
  exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.

* Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming
  languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming
  languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.

LFMTP 2021 will hold a special session in honour of Frank Pfenning. 

Important Dates

Abstract submission deadline: Monday   April 19
Submission deadline:          Monday   April 26
Notification to authors:      Monday   May 31
Final version due:            Monday   June 14
Workshop date:                Friday   July  16


Submission

In addition to regular papers, we welcome/encourage the submission of 
"work in progress" reports, in a broad sense. Those do not need to
report 
fully polished research results, but should be of interest for the
community 
at large. Submitted papers should be in PDF, formatted using the EPTCS
style
guidelines. The length is restricted to 15 pages for regular papers and
8 pages for "Work in Progress" papers.  Submission is via EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lfmtp2021

Proceedings

A selection of the presented papers will be published online in the
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).
