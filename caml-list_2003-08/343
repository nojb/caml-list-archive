Win32 doesn't have an exact equivalent to Unix signals, so software
ported from Unix (such as Emacs and OCaml, as well as Cygwin itself) 
do a best effort to emulate them, but that doesn't mean the emulations
work well together...

The native Windows port of OCaml goes to some length to trap the "ctrl-C"
and "ctrl-break" conditions (which can be generated at the keyboard or
programmatically) and turn them into SIGINT signals.  Apparently,
Emacs generates the right conditions in reply to C-c C-c.

The Cygwin build just relies on the Cygwin runtime environment to
emulate Unix signals, and I have no idea on what Cygwin does exactly.
