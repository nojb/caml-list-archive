> In such case what about ocaml port for palm pilot?

François Rouaix did a Palm port of Caml Light (the "lean and mean"
ancestor of OCaml) a long time ago.  

The main problem was that the data segment of a Palm OS program had to
fit in 64K, which is quite tight for Caml Light and definitely not
enough for OCaml.  (The remainder of the RAM was either read-only code
blocks, or PalmOS "databases" that must be accessed through system calls.)
I don't know if this limitation was lifted in later versions of PalmOS.

Problem number 2 is that text-only apps aren't very usable on a
handheld, so you'd need to interface a large chunk of the GUI toolkit.
