I agree.

Also, we already have the same problem now with respect to array syntax for 
strings and bigarrays (and hashtables and ...).

I think it will improve a lot of things, if something like generics is in the 
language. However, there is another issue lurking here, about whether the 
Array element is boxed or not. In the Clean language the distinction is in the 
type system.
