I must point out that skaller's claims are factually wrong in his post that I 
replying to. tkinter is the python bindings to tk. It's normal that it isn't 
included in that standard lousy 1 CD red hat installation.

Debian package:
python2.3-tk - Tkinter - Writing Tk applications with Python (v2.3)

tcl/tk is *not* the same thing as tkinter.

In fact, tcl/tk is pretty standard in all linux distros. The "deep" GUI to gdb 
insight developed at Red Hat exclusively uses tcl/tk/itcl/itk. tcl/tk is also 
perfect for cross-platform applications. It runs solidly on both windows and 
unix families on OSs incredibly well.

Besides, Red Hat is *not* the de facto linux distro. There are maybe 100 
distros right now.

GTK on the other hand, isn't the top notch toolkit out there. The technically 
superior toolkit is Qt *grin*
