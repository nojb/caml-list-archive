OK, but what's your point?  I'm guessing that the above options mean
that the ocaml exectables built in your debian packages are linked
with the tcl and tk libraries.  Does that have any bearing on my
experiment with Gerd's proposed distribution tools?

Perhaps you're informing me that ocaml with tkinter is already
available in your Debian packages.  If so -- so noted.  I do prefer to
use Debian packages when they have what I need.  One trouble is that I
tend to be a late-adopter of new Debian releases, and Debian releases
are notoriously slow to pick up current upstream package versions as
it is; so I have to build more from source distributions than I would
like.  I wish it were easier to install the latest Debian packages in
older releases (a problem not particular to Ocaml).
