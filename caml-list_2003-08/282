Greetings, OCamlers--

The fourth alpha version of the GD4O library has been released.
Significant new developments include:

  * partial support for extended TrueType rendering (gdImageStringFTEx
    in the C API). Multiline text is supported, but double-byte character
    strings will require an alternative to the standard string type,
    which is currently used to pass string arguments to the TrueType
    rendering methods.

  * new SAFER compile flag enables conditional compilation of safety
    measures such as strict argument checking in the C wrapper code.

I have also created a SourceForge project for GD4O. The project home
page remains at
  
  http://havenrock.com/software/gd4o/

but package downloads have been moved to SourceForge, and the CVS tree
will be moved to SourceForge within the next few days. If you would like
to visit the SourceForge project page, its URL is

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gd4o/

And if you are interested in joining the project, please let me know.
Developers with experience in interfacing OCaml with C are particularly
needed.
