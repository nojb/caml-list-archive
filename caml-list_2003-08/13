It requires this patch to OCaml 3.06:
http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200307/msg00346.html

It still doesn't run because of issues with Dynlink which AFAICT
basically doesn't function properly if called from within a C shared
library. The current error when you start up Apache is:

Failure("error while linking /home/rich/d/merjis/test/mod_caml/eg_print_trans.cmo.
The external function `mod_caml_request_uri' is not available")

Maybe someone can look into this and find out why because mod_caml
could be a seriously useful program for me and others.

Rich.
