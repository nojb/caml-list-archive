It might help to create a file (mods.ml) with your favorite additions 
and modifications to the standard library.  Then you can open Mods
in any files where the modifications are needed.

# module Array = struct
   include Array
   let filter f a = Array.init (Array.length a) (fun i -> f a.(i))
  end;;
# Array.filter (fun x -> x * x) [| 1;2;3 |];;     
- : int array = [|1; 4; 9|]

Hope this helps,
