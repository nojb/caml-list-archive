Okay. I trust that you know what you are talking about, but I still
don't really understand. By saying "there are already ..." are you
implying that the "typical Windows problems" become worse when using
MinGW? And further, are these problems that can actually be solved,
or simply worked around.

I thought that MinGW came with gcc, gnu make, and so on. Am I mistaken,
or are they poorly implemented, or what?
