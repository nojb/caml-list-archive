	It is doable, though.  Look at LispMe (http://www.lispme.de), a
Scheme interpreter for PalmOS.  The author got around the memory 
problems by finding a way to use databases as the memory space of the 
interpreter.  Also, the newer ARM-based Palm devices should have fewer 
limitations.  Moreover, since the LispMe source is available, most 
likely any GUI code you wanted could be lifted from that.  I'm not 
volunteering, of course, but I think it would be doable (I've looked at 
the problem in connection with thinking about writing a Prolog 
interpreter for PalmOS).
