You certainly can handle * rules by just concatenating results from the 
different children.  You could also do something like:

    match weight with
        "medium" ->
            let t = get_style tree.medium ... in
            match t with
                _ :: _ -> (* we have at least one font *) t
                | [] ->
                    (* try getting something in bold *)
                    let t = get_style tree.bold in
                    ...
