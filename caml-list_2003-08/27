     CALL FOR PAPERS

     Workshop on 
     High-Level Approaches to Parallel and Distributed Computing

     held in the context of the

     Fourth ACIS International Conference on
     Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, 
     Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD'03)

     October 16th - 18th, 2003

     Luebeck, Germany

     http://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de/snpd03/Workshop/ws02/index.htm

==========================================================================


Scope and Topics:
==================

Today parallel and distributed computing systems are readily available
and provide a continuously improving price/performance ratio. However,
this technological breakthrough in hardware is not accompanied by 
similar progress in software technology. Parallel and distributed
programming is still dominated by low-level techniques such as explicit
message passing. This low level of abstraction makes programming these
systems exceedingly difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone.
Hence, parallel and distributed computing requires new programming models
which liberate programmers from low-level concerns and increase programming
productivity while maintaining reasonable trade-offs between level of 
abstraction and runtime performance.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to
 - methodologies for high-level parallel programming,
 - parallel programming languages,
 - high-level libraries for parallel computing,
 - compilers and runtime systems for parallel computing,
 - implementation aspects of high-level parallel programming environments,
 - compiler-based optimization and parallelization,
 - experience with high-level parallel programming environments,
 - support for debugging and performance analysis,
 - concurrent array programming,
 - programming concepts for the grid.

This workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners 
interested in the design, implementation, and evaluation of 
high-level parallel programming concepts. It aims at creating
some focus within the otherwise broad spectrum of the SNPD'03
conference.
