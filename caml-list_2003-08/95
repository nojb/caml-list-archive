No. But in case of MinGW/MSVC you have a bunch of other problems: no
configure scripts, different Ocaml compilation process (manual editing of
config files, makefile.nt instead of makefile) etc. As GODI has come from
UNIX world, cygwin (or maybe MSYS) is the only chance to use it under
Windows.

AFAIK sh needed to run configure scripts simply does not exist in the
"native" form (as well as many other gnu utilities). Its design is based on
fork() syscall that cannot be easily emulated under Win32.

Of course, a packaging tool entirely written in Ocaml would be preferable,
but it will probably require too much efforts. So UNIX-style tool is better
than nothing.
