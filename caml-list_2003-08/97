My personal preference on this subject would be to do cross compilation
from linux. Debian includes a nice mingw32 cross compiler, which enabled
me to produce smallish C and gtk+ 2 programs, which run fine under both
win32 and wine. Well wine has some problems with the fonts, but under
windows they work well. They need the gtk+ dlls though.

What would be nice is to be able to use ocaml in this cross compiling
environment, so you could use all the nice unix development tools, and
then produce windows executables for the people who need it, preferably
in a nice tarball including the needed dlls, or even a windows-installer-magic
thingy.

Friendly,
