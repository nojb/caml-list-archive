Hi list,

GODI, the O'Caml source distribution in progress, is available 
in a new version:

http://ocaml-programming.de/packages/godi-bootstrap-20030826.tar.gz

PLEASE READ THE FILE "README"!!!

Further links:

- http://ocaml-programming.de/programming/godi.html
- https://gps.dynxs.de/

Besides that this version installs 3.07beta2 by default, there are a
number of major changes:

- The bootstrap process has now a second stage. After the first stage,
  the fundamental packaging tools are installed (all written in C).
  The second stage automatically installs a minimum O'Caml environment

- After the second stage has finished, there is a new management 
  tool on the system: godi_console (see below).

- I have worked through all of the *.mk files, and deleted everything
  that is not needed, either because it is not applicable to an
  O'Caml installation, or because godi_console does it already much
  better. I hope this improves the maintainability.

- The version number ordering has been improved, now 3.07beta2 < 3.07.

The installable packages themselves have not changed very much, although
many bugs could be fixed (thanks to everybody who sent me feedback).

godi_console is the user interface of GODI. It is possible to select
packages from a list, or to deselect packages. godi_console resolves
dependencies, and gives interactive feedback. Last but not least it is
also a monitor for the build process.

For a number of reasons, godi_console has a curses-based user interface,
but the package handling functions are collected in a library, so
another type of interface could be created with not too much effort.

godi_console currently cannot handle binary packages, and some functions
are a bit slow, but after intensive testing I am convinced that it has
good quality.

BTW, pxp does not work currently. This seems to be an incompatibility 
between wlex and the lastest changes in the O'Caml lexer.

Waiting for your comments and feedback,

Gerd
