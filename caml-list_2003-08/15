I agree with this.  Requiring a case-sensitive filesystem will be a show
stopper for an increasing number of systems.

One question is, does GODI really require that?  HFS preserves the case
of filenames, and usually you can't tell it is case insensitive.  Only
if you try to create two filenames that differ only in case do you
notice the problem.
