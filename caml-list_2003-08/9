If there is a way to [interactively] select components to install, with all 
dependences transitively added, a one big package may be better. (bandwidths are 
wide and our disks get larger, nowadays...)

It would be a big plus to have a binary installation, not depending on cygwin. 
Though my main development platform is u*x, I found that it is quite easy and 
straighforward to develop apps with MSVC and OCaml. (that is the chance that you 
deadly need cygwin to port your app to win32 is less than one would expect.)
