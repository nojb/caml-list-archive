Yup. However, meaningless is not the same as wrong.
The extra case arose because I had a bug and 
wanted to print a diagnostic. When I commented the
print out, I got the error: I wanted to leave the
pattern match there as a stub.

I have had some other perplexing problems with
multiple tags, perhaps if you fix the above problem
they'll go a way .. sorry, I worked around them
so don't have an example at the moment.
