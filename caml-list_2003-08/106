I do. First, it isn't threadable. Second, whilst the
widgets it supports are good, its widget set is not only
small, it doesn't have certain crucial widgets.
There is no tree widget, for example, you need Tix for that.

The extension model is unusable. No one can write
Tk extensions. In the whole of its life, hardly any
have been written.

OTOH, there is wide community support for Gtk.

Yeah, Gtk 1 was pretty bad. Some widgets didn't work
properly. That's the case in 2 as well :(
The edit widget is not good, compared to Tk's.
Morons are trying to copy Windows :(
It still doesn't edit correctly.

The tree widget doesn't work properly in your demo
by the way: when you delete an item it just clears
the line, doesn't redraw the tree properly.

The whole of my desktop uses Gnome/Gtk.

That was my question: whether there will be a move to Gtk.
Whilst labltk doesn't need to have support dropped,
I can't see it being worth doing continued work in it:
it becomes a deprecated tool.

Lots of nice things could be done with OcamlBrowser,
for example. You can't do that work twice. You have to pick
which model to extend. That's Tk now, until Gtk version
is up to scratch, and Gtk itself is up to scratch.

Some of the work is just too hard in Tk. For example
it doesn't reparent correctly. Gtk does. There is a 
workaround in Tk, but it only works 'to some extent'
and that workaround defeats some of its functionality.
[Basically all Tk widgets have to be top level names
or they can't be reparented: HWM is all about reparenting :-]
