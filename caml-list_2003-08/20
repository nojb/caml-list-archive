In all of the programs I have worked with on case-preserving
case-insensitive, only a few have ever failed.

  - Old versions of perl generated both a 'makefile' and a 'Makefile'.
    This has long been corrected.
  - OpenCM creates directories 'A', and 'a'.  It actually works, since
    the filenames probably won't collide, but the resultant tree can't
    be moved to a case-sensitive filesystem.

I have heard of one other, and it was fairly trivial to fix.

I'm guessing that there is nothing in GODI that cares.
