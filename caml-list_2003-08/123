With GTK, I would worry about its object model, library design, hack-ability, 
platform-independence.... The design of gtk seems fairly "backwards" to me. I 
remember how bad the C++ bindings were and I don't think the situation has 
changed much. This is not to say Qt would be a better "choice" for ocaml 
because that too is designed with an imperative PL with a not-very-cool type 
system: C++. However, it is more effective in that domain as evidenced by 
existing code...

It is now going to sound "bold" to you people, but I don't understand why you 
can't write the ultimate portable GUI toolkit in ocaml itself. With a 
language as generic as ocaml it should be a no-brainer to efficiently 
abstract over peculiarities of windows systems.

Besides, you will find that the limitations of those C/C++ based systems will 
be severe. I can make an educated guess because I was designing an ocaml 
binding for KDE... If you decide on some kind of binding to a "high level" 
toolkit like gtk it's going to be some abstraction layer over black boxes 
with a lot of quirks, it's not going to be pretty.
