I am more thinking of server installations without X windows, so the
split is X/non-X. camlp4 is part of the main ocaml package, there is
really no need to have it separate.

Maybe a solution of the configuration problem is to run the configure
script again for labltk, but only to use the labltk-specific results
(i.e. tkdefs, tklibs). This is more user-friendly than the current
solution, and there is no danger to configure the various parts in an
incompatible way.

Meta packages: nice idea, but the question is what the users want to
have. Maybe they are more interested in "distribution sets" for tasks,
i.e. a graphics set, a web set, a database set, ...
