Many of you provided very useful feedback on the pre-release 3.07 beta 1
of OCaml.  Thanks!  Since this beta-test worked so well, we're now
making available a beta 2 pre-release of what should very soon become
the next stable release of Objective Caml.  It is available for
testing at

        http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib-3.07beta2.html

The modifications since beta 1 are almost exclusively bug fixes.  The
only programmer-visible change affects the typing of polymorphic
variants in pattern matching (see change log below).  So, we're
especially looking for testers who intensively use polymorphic variants
in their code.

As usual, this is a source-only release, and feedback is much
appreciated: bug reports to caml-bugs@inria.fr, and "everything is OK"
messages to caml@inria.fr.

Barring major problems, the final 3.07 release should be essentially
identical to this beta 2, and released second week of september.

--------------------------------------------------

Changes since 3.07 beta 1:

Type-checking:
- The typing of polymorphic variants in pattern matching has changed.
  It is intended to be more regular, sticking to the principle of "closing
  only the variants which would be otherwise incomplete". Two potential
  consequences: (1) some types may be left open which were closed before,
  and the resulting type might not match the interface anymore (expected to
  be rare); (2) in some cases an incomplete match may be generated.

Toplevel interactive system:
- Look for .ocamlinit file in home directory in addition to the current dir.

Standard library:
- Module Lexing: added function Lexing.flush_input.

Emacs mode:
- Improved display of inferred type information produced by ocamlc -dtypes.
