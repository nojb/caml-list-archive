The reason for not supporting Apache 2 is simply that I don't know
much about how to port Apache 1.x code to Apache 2. Also I'm a bit
worried about threading issues. (I've CC'd this to the caml-list -
can anyone comment?)

Yup. Actually initialize isn't needed because you get that anyway when
you just put code at the top level of the module, but a shutdown or
on_unload function would be very useful.

Unfortunately Dynlink doesn't provide a way to unload modules (can
anyone on caml-list comment?).

If the concern is to free memory used by large structures, or to close
database handles, then the module could register some sort of timer
perhaps and do this themselves? The model I had in mind for database
handles would have a central Dbi module which would manage handing out
and reclaiming database handles, probably by handing out a temporary
value which represents the handle and reclaiming with a finaliser or
explicit "close" function.

Rich.
