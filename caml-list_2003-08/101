Well, the idea is to hve a native cross compiler. It should be able to
be done, the real problem is that ocaml uses various levels of
bootstraping, and thus tries to use the compiler to compile, which would
naturally not work in a cross compiling environment, unless you use
wine, that is.

The ocaml team is not interested by such a thing though.
