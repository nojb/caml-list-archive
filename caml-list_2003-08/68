I think that my issue with the class system is that IMO it doesn't quite fit 
well with the rest of the language, as a class shares some properties with 
modules, and some with records, and has a few of it's own, but doesn't permit 
pattern matching syntax. 

With a few extensions to records (a new kind of records, dual to polymorphic 
variants as sum types are to records), modules (first class modules?, mixin 
modules?), and core ML (yes, I'm still rooting for G'Caml extensions :) that 
even OOP fans would find it classy sans class. 

Even without those extensions, I find the core language + modules sufficient to 
do almost everything nicely, but my pre "ML epiphany" tastes ran towards 
Modula-2/3 and Ada 95 rather than C++ so I may just be warped...
