I mean they can't be installed from the GUI package manager 
at all AFAICS: There's no option for it. 

You'd have be a nerd and use the RPM command line tool.

Most office workers and home users therefore will not
have the package on their system no matter what options
they ticked during installation, and that is probably
true for many programmers too .. obviously including me.

Its also not clear this can be 'tacked' on to Python.
Last I looked, the build for Tcl/Tk was wrongly designed,
it put the symbols in the wrong place, making dynamic loading
in an unprepared client (such as Python) impossible.

[At least partly this is due to poor dynamic linker design 
(read: they didn't bother to actually design it) 
on Unix systems]

meaning: even if you could install Tk onto your 
system Tkinter et al wouldn't work anyhow.
