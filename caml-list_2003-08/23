Just to say that in debian, the tcl/tk library are accessed not with
plain -ltk -ltcl, but that they have the version appended in order to
have multiple versions of tcl/tk. So maybe your troubles building Gerd's
stuff may be related to that, but then maybe not.

Err, i don't know about tkinter. the debian packages are mostly plain
upstream sources, with some collection of added fixes, mostly taken out
of CVS.

You are aware of Stefano's backport repository, which was reptedly
announced here, are you not ?
