RedHat is free to decide whatever they want, but Tk is still the
simplest way to develop some software. Tcl/Tk itself is in version
8.4, it had unicode support earlier than Gtk, and is still under
active development, and I see no need to kill it.

I suppose a move to Gtk will eventually take place.
For this Gtk2 is a requirement (Gtk lacks some essential widgets
present in Tk). But LablGtk2 is now usable enough we can start to
think about it.

So yes, I see a change ahead, but certainly not in 3.07!

And of course labltk/camltk support will not be dropped.
