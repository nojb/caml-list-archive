What about looking at Cairo (Ex Xr/Xc) and either bind to that, or
reimplement their protocol in ocaml. Cairo is early enough in its design
that it can still be influenced enough if someone looks at it, and
points them problems related to doing ocaml bindings.

For those who don't know what cairo is, cairo can be found at :

  http://xr.xwin.org/

And is a : Cross-device Rendering for Vector Graphics.

Basically it is a vector rendering framework, linked to SVG graphics,
and which should enable to have a vector rendering model (on top of the
X RENDER extension i think), but which can target various graphic
systems, including X, local image buffers and Postscript and PDF as
planned output support. I don't know about windows support, but MacOSX
support should not be all that difficult to add, and since they also
have an OpenGL rendering path, it should run on every OpenGL supported
plateform.

That said, it is not a windowing toolkit, just the rendering library,
so i guess writing a proper ocaml toolkit top of it would be nice, and
it would have vector graphics like MAcOSX toolkit. Also, there is
already some work that has been done on vector graphics and ocaml, like
the (non-free) MLGraph library, and the associated publications.
