Yes, when I first downloaded otags, I carelessly copied its executable 
to my ~/bin directory without knowing that I also needed to install the 
pr_*.cma files.  When it gave an error message, I was too lazy to track 
down the problem so I wrote my own tagger.

Your message inspired me to try again, so I installed otags the right 
way, using "make install."  It works fine now.

It just occurred to me that it would be nice to have tag files 
containing only module names for .mli files.  If the file you're editing 
contains "List.map" and you want to know what it does, you put your 
cursor on top of "List", press ctrl-] , and then search for map.  This 
will take you to the right place more quickly than digging through a 
bunch of entries for "map" that are in other modules.  Here's an 
implementation:
