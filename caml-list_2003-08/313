Here's another revision.  Enjoy!


Changes for version 1.2:

o Handling of .ml files having no .mli counterparts
o Handling of files containing no lines without slashes


 From the README:


Why write another tagger?
=========================


  Taglet makes a tag file that just lists all the .mli files, which
  reduces the number of redundant tags and helps you get the
  documentation you want more quickly without having to dig through a
  bunch of identical tags.


  With otags, if I want to look up List.map, I put my cursor over
  "map", press ctrl-], and look through a bunch of other map functions
  until I find the one I want.  With Taglet, I put my cursor over
  "List", press ctrl-], and am immediately in list.mli.  Then I search
  for "map" in list.mli.  Often, if the .mli file is short, I can find
  what I need without having to page down.


Why not just add Taglet's functionality to an existing tagger?
==============================================================


  Taglet is tiny and is useful alone, so it's nice to have it as a
  separate program.  I would like add its functionality to otags, but I
  haven't yet figured out how to do it.  Even if I do, Taglet will still
  be useful and easy to understand on its own.
