Hello world,

As Mr. Kawanaka mentions, several volunteers including myself are also
translating the OCaml _book_ (http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/) from
English (or French) to Japanese.  Although we have set up the
collaboration environment and completed initial translation of several
chapters, we are still far in short of manpower and time.  So, if you
feel like contributing to the international OCaml community, please
contact me (sumii@saul.cis.upenn.edu) and join us as well!

	Eijiro Sumii

P.S. Please feel free to circulate this message to whoever may be
interested (with my "apology for multiple copies").

> There are many peaple in Japan using and/or studying OCaml, but there are

> book "Developing Applications with Objective Caml" into Japanese now,
> however the OCaml manual, maybe the most important document, doesn't seem
> to be translated by anyone yet.
> 
> I have already received an official agreement of the translation 
> from the development team, so I have created the site,
> http://wiki.ocaml.jp/ (all in Japanese), to manage the translation.
> 
> If you are interested in this project, please join us.
> 
> # I also made the OCaml information site http://ocaml.jp/ (all in Japanese) 
> # for Japanese OCaml users. If interested, access it please.
