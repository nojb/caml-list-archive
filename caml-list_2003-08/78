Dear all,

There are many peaple in Japan using and/or studying OCaml, but there are
few Japanese documents. I know Eijiro Sumii is translating the O'Reilly
book "Developing Applications with Objective Caml" into Japanese now,
however the OCaml manual, maybe the most important document, doesn't seem
to be translated by anyone yet.

I have already received an official agreement of the translation 
from the development team, so I have created the site,
http://wiki.ocaml.jp/ (all in Japanese), to manage the translation.

If you are interested in this project, please join us.

# I also made the OCaml information site http://ocaml.jp/ (all in Japanese) 
# for Japanese OCaml users. If interested, access it please.

Thanks.
