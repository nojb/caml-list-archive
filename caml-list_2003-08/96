Hi All,

And in general, the developers (/porters) environment is different from one 
where the application is supposed to run. It is quite reasonable to assume (and 
therefore insist :-) that some easily available tools are present within the 
former, and it is also reasonable [to try to] not to depend on them for the 
latter (in favor for mingw, in this case).
