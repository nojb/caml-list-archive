Simple answer: It is unwise to do the second step before the first.
Using Cygwin means that you have a full POSIX environment (Unix tools,
libraries), but there are already typical Windows problems, e.g.
filename conventions, CRLF, etc. Solve these first!

For the build environment, it is unlikely that we ever get rid of
Cygwin. It is possible, however, that the runtime environment (i.e.
O'Caml itself, and the tools for binary packages) are MinGW-based while
the build tools are still Cygwin-based. (A very typical setup for
MinGW.) That would allow us to create a binary MinGW distribution.
