Hello, everyone--

I am pleased to announce the first alpha release of GD4O (that's an 'O',
as in OCaml), an OCaml interface to the GD graphics library. It's
available at:

    http://havenrock.com/software/gd4o/

GD4O is based on OCamlGD 0.7, so most of the credit for this package
belongs to Shawn Wagner; so far I have added only a few functions,
created a more thorough test program, and created a new Makefile that
installas GD4O as a Findlib package. My goal is to provide a complete
and up-to-date interface to GD.

I should explain briefly how this project came about. I have spent a
good deal of time searching in vain for a comprehensive raster graphics
library for OCaml, and I have gotten the sense from a recent discussion
on this list (see the thread entitled "Graphics Frustration") that
others are interested in the same thing. I had noted with interest the
existence of OCamlGD, but also noted that it is quite incomplete and has
not been updated in the last year. A couple of weeks ago I emailed Shawn
Wagner to ask what his plans were for the package; he responded that he
didn't expect to continue developing it, at least not in the near
future. Since then I have emailed him again to ask if he would object to
my taking over the project, but I have not heard from him again. So,
technically speaking, this project is a fork--hence the new name. But
I don't see any reason to expect a competition here.

I'd also like to say that I am not really the best person to be doing
this sort of work, since I really don't know C very well. But since
noone else seems to be motivated enough to do it ...  Anyway, I expect I
will be needing some help in order to make this a quality package. So I
welcome constructive criticism, patches, and so on from all of you.
