Why Cygwin, rather than MinGW?

I confess I don't have a very good understanding of the issues--
I've tried Cygwin, but only read about MinGW--but it seems to
me that in general MinGW should be preferred for its lightweight-
ness and because (apparently) it enables you to create native
Win32 executables.
