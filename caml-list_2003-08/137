That's neither true (configure your Tcl/Tk with --enable-threads) nor
necessary for GUI stuff. I'm quite happy with after and fileevent
mechanism.

Text widget and canvas widget are great.

With Tk it's much easier to create a GUI than with gtk (and even
labtgtk). There is a project called Gnocl (gtk for Tcl)> It tries
to combine the best of both toolkits: (loosly) modeled after the
Tk API, but based on the better looking and more complete gtk.

Christoph
