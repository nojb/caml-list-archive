Hi,

a short update, adapting to 3.06 was not very difficult but
somehow triggered a few bugs in the code.

Simple examples like "fib" work fine, ocamlc.opt crashes in
parsing/linenum.ml so I am slowly adding debugging support to
code generation to find out details.

One of the bugs had to do with register reloading, pseudos
that was allocated hard register in previous version ended
up as stack slots (somehow a0 often isn't used for allocation
where it previously was). Emitting code didn't take this
possibility into account in some places generating assembly
code.. most likely the register constraints aren't good enough.

Does anyone have a test suite? What kind of problems had other
architectures between 2.04 and 3.06?

Richard
