On the links below you'll find mod_caml 0.4. You'll also need the
associated patch against the clean ocaml 3.06 tree.

The version still doesn't work. This time, following advice from David
Gurr, I put the C primitives from the .so file into the table of
primitives (by hacking Dynlink again to call Dynlink.set_prim_table).
OCaml now recognises them but doesn't bind them to the correct values.

I can't understand how this binding happens with external references.
I tried breakpointing various obvious candidates, eg.,
dynlink.c:lookup_primitive, build_primitive_table; but these never
seem to be called as far as I can see.

The result is that when the code tries to call the external C function
mod_caml_request_uri, it jumps to an apparently random address and
crashes.

Ideas?

Rich.
