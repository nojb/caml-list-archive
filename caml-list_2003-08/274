Is there a way to do a CAMLreturn without the return?  From looking at
memory.h it appears not, but it appears it would be easy to make a
macro to do it (#define CAMLendblock local_roots = caml__frame; or
something like that should work).

In other words, I want to have a loop that calls back to caml, but I
don't want to keep shoving more stuff on the roots list, since I don't
care about the previous loop's allocations:

for(i=0;i<n;++i) {
   CAMLlocal(foo,bar);
   // use foo bar
   // callback to caml with foo bar, maybe somebody stores them somewhere
   CAMLendblock();  // want this
}

Make sense?

Chris
