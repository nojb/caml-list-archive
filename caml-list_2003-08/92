That might make sense. Didn't Nicolas Canass (sp?) say his Osiris
project was going to be ported to non-Windows platforms? I wonder
how that's coming along?

Other options that might be worth looking at are wxWindows and FoX;
both, however, need libraries that are not standard on any platform.

I would guess, though, that the political issues may be harder than 
the technical ones. People in the Python community have been saying
for at least four years that something other than Tkinter should be
the standard GUI toolkit--yet Python still ships with Tkinter. 
Maybe because everybody hates it equally (except for a few weirdos
like me who actually *like* it).
