It is true. Tcl is reentrant and threadable, Tk is not
and never will be .. and that's quoting its author.

If you happen, for example, to run GUI apps using
threads in Python you're in for a rude shock.

Of course most people don't run this model, even though
its by far the best way to handle certain GUI things.
Certainly better than the idiotic event loop/callback 
mechanism.

Agree. Tk has some superb widgets, text and canvas being
particularly excellent. But there is no tree widget,
which in todays world is untenable (yes, there is Tix).
