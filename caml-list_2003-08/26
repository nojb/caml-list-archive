Hi list,

there is now an improved version of GODI for download:

http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/godi-bootstrap-20030805.tar.gz

The most important change is that godi_build announces its build plan
before it starts, making the build process more transparent. The build
plan also shows hints which options in godi.conf have an effect on which
package.

Further improvements:

- For Linux systems, many of the system commands can now be found in
  both /bin and /usr/bin. There does not seem to be a standard, so
  GODI now searches the commands.

- The bootstrap script tries to pre-configure labltk. It looks into
  much more locations that the O'Caml configure script. I think this
  was one of the biggest problems in the first release.

- For BSD systems, not all of the bootstrap tools are built.

- I have tested GODI on:
  * Debian Linux
  * SuSE Linux
  * Solaris 8
  * FreeBSD (ancient version)
  Note that you will have problems if there is only tcl/tk 8.4; this is
  an O'Caml 3.06 problem.

This release of GODI still supports only 3.06. If it is usable, I will
go on with 3.07beta.

Gerd
