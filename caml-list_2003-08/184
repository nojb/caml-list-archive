I'm pleased to announce the first working version of mod_caml, the
OCaml bindings for the full Apache 1.3 API.

You can now write CGI "scripts" in your favorite type-safe language,
and have them run inside the Apache webserver for maximum efficiency.

You can also write handlers for some stages of the Apache request
cycle (I will be completing this support in the next release).

Scripts and handlers have access to internal Apache structures such as
request_rec and internal Apache API calls.

This release works with unmodified OCaml 3.06, but probably won't
work with 3.07beta1. I'm releasing this mainly to get feedback about
compiling/installation issues, so please try it out.

mod_caml is a set of Objective CAML (OCaml) bindings for the Apache
API. It allows you to run "CGI scripts" written in OCaml directly inside
the Apache webserver. However, it is much much more than just that:

 * Bind to any part of the Apache request cycle.
 * Read and modify internal Apache structures.
 * Share modules of code between handlers and scripts.

mod_caml is distributed under the GNU Library General Public License
(see file COPYING.LIB for terms and conditions).

mod_caml was mainly written by Richard W.M. Jones
(rich@annexia.org). See file AUTHORS for other contributors.
