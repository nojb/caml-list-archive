Hi Xavier,

I've got this bug in the bug tracking system

http://caml.inria.fr/bin/caml-bugs/feature%20wish?id=1482

Could at least the memory free portion of that could be fixed?

Also, I consistently get this message for make bootstrap to fail o
Cygwin:

make[2]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/Blair/Cygwin/Ocaml/ocaml-3.07beta2/ocamldoc'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/Blair/Cygwin/Ocaml/ocaml-3.07beta2'
make compare
make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/c/Blair/Cygwin/Ocaml/ocaml-3.07beta2'
boot/ocamlc ocamlc differ: char 137, line 2
Fixpoint not reached, try one more bootstrapping cycle.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/Blair/Cygwin/Ocaml/ocaml-3.07beta2'

I've been seeing this since 3.06.

Best,
Blair
