they may well be: it might be better to say you don't think
they've made it a high priority. As you youself point out
building a cross compiler isn't a trivial exercise: building
a hosted compiler that works on many platforms is hard enough.

Still, eventually it should just be a matter of plugging
in a different code generator, represented by a dynamically
loadable shared library .. of course, Ocaml doesn't support
that yet for Ocaml code, so my guess is that dynamic loading
is probably a pre-requisite, and also more generally useful.
