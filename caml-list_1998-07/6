The current documentation of these fields is ambiguous.  In future
versions, it will read:

-     [minor_words]  Number of words allocated in the minor heap since
             the program was started.
-     [major_words]  Number of words allocated in the major heap, including
             the promoted words, since the program was started.

I hope this is clearer.
