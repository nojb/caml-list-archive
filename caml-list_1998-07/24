Travis wanted to know how to use Fortran libraries with ocaml or
SML/NJ.  I've knocked together a documented example of using lapack to
invert a matrix---see

	http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/students/williamc/ocaml-fortran/

The explanation is in README, and example.tar.gz has everything tarred
up for downloading.  It works on Solaris and Linux (at least), but
note that I've used GNU Make.

And of course the ocaml docs on foreign functions:
