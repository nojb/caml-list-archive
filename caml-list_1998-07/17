hello there -

I am using caml-light for Windows 95 - and need to compile a stand alone
program I have written so that I can use it separately from the caml toplevel
loop. 

I have done this sucessfully by doing a camlc -custom on my files ... the
problem is: the standalone compiled program only works under DOS ... if
I run it from windows, I get a "general protection fault" ... 

Can anyone help me with this? Please email suggestions to the address at
the bottom - I have not yet subscribed to this list ... Thanks in advance,

Iman
