Jenga is quite flexible, so you could write your jengaroot either way
(to demand or not demand explicit source file lists.)  Our internal
jengaroot does not require explicit source file lists.

Not to confuse people, though, Jenga isn't really suitable for people
just picking up and using yet.  We haven't yet written a suitable
jengaroot for general use yet (though there is a version of our
internal jengaroot that we've released, but it's not yet ready for
prime time.)  So Jenga is interesting as an option to discuss, but not
yet a practical option we want to encourage casual users to try.
