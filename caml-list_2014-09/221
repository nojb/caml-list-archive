Wow. Those are some harsh words, Jeff. Honestly, I don't see where you're
coming from with these comments.

What I would tell Brian though is the following: with 6 months of
experience in ocaml, you may not have the ability to sell ocaml and its
functional paradigm to a company that has a preconceived notion of what
programming should be like. You'll encounter some difficulties - the same
as with any language - and without the experience to deal with these
hiccups, it'll be tough to convince your bosses to shift to a different way
of thinking about programming. Tough, but doable.
