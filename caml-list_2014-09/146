We could go a bit further and say that assembly, brainfuck and malbolge
are not proper languages for build system and that only the
implementations are wrong.

Sounds satiric? Maybe a bit bit.
But I regularly hear the same for C and buffer overflows: it's not the
language, it's the code. Not wrong but...

The point is that in any case, if you want to make your makefile from
scratch, you're going to be missing some things. OCamlMakefile is a few
thousands lines; you can be sure that you're going to be missing stuff
in your 30 lines Makefile.
And it is not a packager's role to rewrite build systems for features
(there's already enough to do with bugs).

There's a funny game though (at least I find it funny; people say it
makes me sound bitter): you show a custom build system, I find practical
issues with it. To be honest it's probably not a good thing to start on
the ML.


Also, Drup got things a bit wrong: the build system of the compiler uses
makefiles and it works most of the time. As far as I know, people still
get issues when building in parallel; less than before but it appears to
not be reliable.
The main issues with the compiler build system are: age, size,
duplication between directories and windows/unix.
