I'd suggest oasis, based on my limited experience (I don't compile C
bindings nor to js_of_ocaml, but I write libraries, sub-libraries, and
programs that use ocamlfind).

I like oasis a lot, especially the fact that every information related
to a project is written down in a single file. It can generate
documentation, libraries, executables, ocamlfind-related files (META...),
configure/Makefile, and run tests. Even if oasis isn't blessed as the
canonical build system, its project description should be a good model
for the winner.

In the case of oasis, it already relies on ocamlbuild, so both could be
merged somehow (and the redundancies, hopefully, removed)...

full disclosure: I don't have any interest in promoting oasis, nor have
I been paid (sadly) to do so ;)
