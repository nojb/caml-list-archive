While there was no 'conclusion' to this thread, if I had to come up with
one, it would be that we have a bunch of build tools which are all not
amazing at this point in time. We have some DSL-based build tools and some
ocaml-based build tools, and all of them need a lot of love to get to a
good state.

My personal view is that we (as a community) should work at getting at
least one DSL tool to be really great. I'm sure Jenga (an ocaml-based tool
which seems more like a build-tool engine) will continue to be developed by
Jane Street no matter what, so is there a DSL-based build system that we
can converge on to use and improve? The contenders for this slot appear to
be omake, obuild, and ocp-build. I'm more than willing to switch to one of
these if I know that other people will as well, and that it will be
actively developed (preferably on github). More users =3D more invested
parties =3D more development potential. Conversely, continuing to spread the
community's attention between these tools (as well as ocamlbuild, which
seems destined to stagnate) before any one of them is top notch seems to me
to be detrimental to ocaml's health as an ecosystem.

BTW Anil: is assemblage supposed to be an entire build toolchain, or is it
only supposed to write makefiles (as the description in the readme states)?
