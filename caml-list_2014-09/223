Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 4.02.1 is coming soon

Dear OCaml users,

The rather large amount of changes in the newly released 4.02 inevitably ca=
used some issues in the very first minor release. We shall have a 4.02.1 bu=
gfix release coming soon, hopefully in early October.

Among the few issues that have now been fixed, there are a few regressions =
in the new, type-safe format implementation (Printf/Scanf/Format) -- for ad=
vanced formatting features.

There was also a regression in the *compilation time* of the distributed OC=
aml compiler, which is sensibly slower than 4.01 on multi-module programs. =
This is already fixed in the development version of the compiler and will b=
e part of the bugfix release.

Any additional testing to find and report other regressions is more than we=
lcome. If you have not yet tested your programs with 4.02, now is the time =
to give it a try!


-- Damien
