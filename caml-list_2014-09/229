Subject: Re: [Caml-list] improve omake [was One build system to rule them
 all]

No joke.  The switch required a fair bit of cleverness on our part.
We actually had some clever intermediate stage when we were building
jenga build description files (full of s-expressions, not OCaml code)
from omake build rules, as a way of bridging the gap as we did the
conversion.  Flipping a big codebase is not for the faint of heart.
