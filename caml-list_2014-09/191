Hello, 

Some time ago I set up a cross tool chain from linux to windows. The project was using lablgtk2, camlimages, xml-light, lablgl and cairo. None of these packages were ready for cross-compilation, and I had to patch them. 
My experience : 
Makefile (small ones) : was ok 
oasis (for my own packages) : was not possible to cross-compile 
ocamlbuild through Makefiles (for my own packages) : ok 
autotools + ocaml-autoconf + Makefiles (lablgtk2, cairo) : my preferred 
oMake (camlimages) : seemed obscure to me, and did not succeeded in patching it. In the end, I reverted to a previous version of camlimages using autotools + ocaml-autoconf + Makefiles 

In the end, to my point of view, I found ocamlbuild to be nice for small to medium ocaml projects, though documentation was bad. Then, when C sources were required with cross compilation, or for bigger projects, I found autotools to be nice. 

Finally, I also tend to think that the best tool is the one used by most people :-) 

Just to get fun, I designed two polls : 

"best tool" :

"most used tool" :
