Yes ocp-build is broken for many corner cases, I've been trying to push it
to its maximum; look at that ugly shell script:
https://github.com/hammerlab/ketrew/blob/master/please.sh that even has to
create a yojson library out of the one in ~/.opam to please ocp-build's
assumptions.

Also, like every build system based on flat files (oasis, obuild), it is
fundamentally broken. You'll always need a programming language to extended
your build (adding targets, like build documentation/websites, special
tests, .merlin files, code generation...).

- omake did that with yet another obscure and weird language (I guess the
goal was to "look" like `make` but with even more broken string escaping).
- ocamlbuild and jenga picked the right language.
    - ocamlbuild's API is very limited, there is not even a clear way to
replace all the crazy small files required everywhere (_tags, mllib, ...)
with function calls within a myocamlbuild.ml plugin. It is also painfully
slow.
    - Jenga is not for "normal" projects. It takes half-an-hour to build
jenga itself, and it's dependency tree is not very portable. The API is
very convoluted even for simple projects.

Look at https://github.com/samoht/assemblage/ certainly going to in the
right direction.
