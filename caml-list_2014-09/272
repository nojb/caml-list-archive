Subject: [Caml-list] CAV Call for Papers

Call for Papers
27th International Conference on
Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2015)
July 18-24 2015, San Francisco, California
http://i-cav.org/2015/

Aims and Scope

CAV 2015 is the 27th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the 
theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for 
hardware and software systems.  CAV considers it vital to continue 
spurring advances in hardware and software verification while expanding 
to new domains such as biological systems and computer security. The 
conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete 
applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the 
algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. The 
proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer LNCS 
series. A selection of papers will be invited to a special issue of 
Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

*    Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations
*    Hardware verification techniques
*    Deductive, compositional, and abstraction techniques for verification
*    Program analysis and software verification
*    Verification methods for parallel and concurrent hardware/software systems
*    Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology
*    Applications and case studies in verification
*    Decision procedures and solvers for verification
*    Mathematical and logical foundations of practical verification tools
*    Verification in industrial practice
*    Algorithms and tools for system synthesis
*    Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification
*    Verification techniques for security
*    Formal models and methods for biological systems

Paper Submission

Submissions should contain original research and sufficient detail to 
assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. We welcome papers 
on theory, case studies and comparisons with existing experimental 
research, tool papers, as well as combinations of new theory with 
experimental evaluation. Similar to last year, we welcome both long tool 
papers and short papers of any kind.

Tool papers should describe system and implementation aspects of a tool 
with a large (potential) user base (experiments not required, rehash of 
theory strongly discouraged). Papers describing tools that have already 
been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant 
and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.

Submissions reporting on case studies in an industrial context are 
strongly invited, and should describe details, weaknesses, and strengths 
in sufficient depth. Papers reproducing and comparing existing results 
experimentally do not require new theoretical insights. Examples of 
contributions of such papers are evaluations of existing results in a 
superior experimental setting and comparisons of methods that have not 
previously been thoroughly experimentally compared.

Papers can be submitted in either a regular or a short format.

*    Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format, not 
counting references.

*    Short Papers should not exceed 6 pages, not counting references. 
Short papers are encouraged for any subject that can be described within 
the page limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an extensive 
experimental evaluation. Accepted short papers will be accompanied by 
short presentations.

An appendix can provide additional material such as details on proofs or 
experiments. The appendix is not guaranteed to be read or taken into 
account by the reviewers and it should not contain information necessary 
for the understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers 
will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were 
submitted, there will be no demotions from a regular to a short paper.

Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or 
submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not 
allowed.

The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors 
will have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may 
solicit further reviews after the rebuttal period.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format. Submission is done via EasyChair.
