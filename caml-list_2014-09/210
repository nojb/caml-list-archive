CALL FOR SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATIONS (deadline September 24!)

ACM SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, Mumbai, India

Wednesday, January 14, 2015

Co-located with POPL 2015

PLMW web page: http://plmw15.iisc-seal.net/

After the resounding success of the first three Programming Languages
Mentoring Workshops at POPL 2012, 2013, and 2014, we proudly announce
the 4th SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW),
co-located with POPL 2015 and organised by Derek Dreyer, Aditya Kanade,
Ruzica Piskac, Alan Schmitt, and Ross Tate.

The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate students
and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in programming
language research. This workshop will provide technical sessions on
cutting-edge research in programming languages, and mentoring sessions
on how to prepare for a research career. We will bring together leaders
in programming language research from academia and industry to give
talks on their research areas. The workshop will engage students in
a process of imagining how they might contribute to our research
community.

So far, we have the following speakers confirmed to speak at the
workshop, and we expect about 7 additional speakers as well:

- Adam Chlipala (MIT)
- Sumit Gulwani (Microsoft Research)
- Mike Hicks (University of Maryland, College Park)
- Shriram Krishnamurthi (Brown)
- Matt Might (University of Utah)

We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students to
attend PLMW.

This workshop is part of the activities surrounding POPL, the Symposium
on Principles of Programming Languages, and takes place the day before
the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the POPL
conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that participants will
stay through the entire conference.

A number of sponsors (listed below) have generously donated scholarship
funds for qualified students to attend PLMW. These scholarships should
cover reasonable expenses (airfare, hotel, and registration fees) for
attendance at both the workshop and the POPL conference.

Students attending this year will get one year free student membership
of SIGPLAN, unless they prefer to opt out during their application.

The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative
sources of funding are welcome.

APPLICATION for PLMW scholarship:

The scholarship application can be accessed from the workshop web site
(http://plmw15.iisc-seal.net/application). The deadline for full
consideration of funding is WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24. Selected participants
will be notified by OCTOBER 1 or earlier, and will need to pre-register
for the workshop (i.e. declare intent to attend) by OCTOBER 10.  Note
the early date!!

The reason for this early pre-registration has to do with obtaining
visas for travel to India.  To apply for a =E2=80=9Cconference visa=E2=80=
=9D, all
attendees of POPL and PLMW must register their intent to attend the
event by October 10.  More details concerning the visa application
process will be provided soon.
