With great care is right :) But seriously, work stealing is a huge
undertaking in this model, and may not be feasible at all as far as I can
tell. Every private heap object accessed by a thread has to be copied
either to the shared heap or to the stealer's heap. This is the downside of
not having one shared heap for everything. Of course there are huge upsides
as well, but I don't see how work stealing could work efficiently. The only
exception would be for a thread that hasn't started running at all, or has
allocated very little.
