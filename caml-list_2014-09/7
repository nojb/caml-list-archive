Hello,

I’ve been using your installer for a few years now. It fits my use case
quite well and I thank you for that.

This use case is simple: I want to be able to produce standalone, native
win32 versions of my programs which are developed on Linux.

So basically, what's important for me is that it installs the toolchain
and the Cygwin environment. I do install Emacs for the occasional case
where I want to test a quick patch without transferring files from Linux
to Windows. I usually re-run the Cygwin installer to install Git and
SSH. The hard part is installing libraries. Then I use make, ocamlbuild,
ocamlfind, from the MinGW terminal.

On Windows I’ve never used labltk, ocamlwin, ocamltop, activetcl,
camlp4, Merlin, odb. I’ve used LablGTK and OcamlSDL, both being rather
tricky to install correctly. Other libraries are usually easier to
install as they contain less bindings, although sometimes they do
require some tweaks in the build process. Sometimes they have a lot of
dependencies for no good reason and without a package manager it can get
rather annoying — opam would probably help a lot here.

Soon I will need to produce 64bits executables as well.

Cheers,
