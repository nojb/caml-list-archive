conferences, accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2015 is the
eighteenth event in the series.

-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --

ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers
and tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the
proceedings and have presentations during the conference.

ESOP and FoSSaCS accept only research papers. TACAS has more paper
categories (see http://www.etaps.org/2015/tacas).

A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one
of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original
research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same
contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden. The
proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing
and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.

Papers must follow the formatting guidelines specified by Springer at

http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

and be submitted electronically in pdf through the EasyChair author
interface of the respective conference (HotCRP for ESOP).

Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately.


- Research papers

FASE, FOSSACS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pages for research
papers, whereas CC, POST allow at most 20 pages and ESOP 25 pages.

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication
in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page
limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers
must be understandable without them.

In addition to regular research papers, TACAS solicits also case study
papers (at most 15 pages).

Both TACAS and FASE solicit also regular tool papers (at most 15
pages).


- Tool demonstration papers

Submissions should consist of two parts:

* The first part, at most 4 pages, should describe the tool
    presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and
    provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of
    the tool. (This part will be included in the proceedings.)

* The second part, at most 6 pages, should explain how the
    demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including
    screen dumps and examples. (This part will be not be included in the
    proceedings, but will be evaluated.)

ESOP and FOSSACS do not accept tool demonstration papers.

TACAS has a page limit of 6 pages for tool demonstrations.


-- SATELLITE EVENTS (11-12 April, 18 April) --

Around 20 satellite workshops will take place before and after the
main conferences.


-- HOST CITY --

London, the capital city of England and the UK, is a leading global
city, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment,
fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research
and development, tourism and transport all contributing to its
prominence. It is one of the world's leading financial centers and a
world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as
measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city
airport system measured by passenger traffic. In 2012, London became
the first city to host the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.


-- HOST INSTITUTION --

ETAPS 2015 is hosted by the School of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science of the Queen Mary University of London.

The main campus is located in the Mile End area of the East End of
London.
