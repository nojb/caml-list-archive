Subject: Re: [Caml-list] One build system to rule them all?

I think the conclusion is that we're not "as a community" going to
settle in on a single solution before there's one that's ready.
There's a lot of work on competing approaches, which I think is
healthy.  Even those people who are working on competing approaches
are cooperating pretty effectively (e.g., Thomas is working on
Assemblage and at the same time looking into Jenga to see where the
two can connect.)

Rather than exhort everyone to focus in on a solution, I recommend you
pick the one you think looks best, and see if you can contribute to
it.

I think consensus should follow code, not the other way around.
