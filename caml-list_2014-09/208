Hi Aleksey,

Quickly grepped the opam-repository, I am the one who has released the most
packages require omake. I can be a maintainer, though I have no brilliant
idea to enhance it for now...

As you obviously know, OMake have not had a proper maintainer for a few<br>
years now - while I did not completely abandon it, I did not have time<br>
to devote to even little things (like pushing out a new 0.9.8.6 release<br>
which I have been hoping to call &quot;version 1.0&quot;, and which have be=
en<br>
lingering in &quot;release candidate&quot; mode for almost four years).<br>
<br>
It is clear that there are quite a few people on this list with good<br>
ideas on how to improve OMake (e.g. ability to write rules in OCaml<br>
instead of/in addition to the OMake language seems like a good idea) -<br>
so I am wondering - is there somebody who would be willing to take over<br>
as the omake maintainer - ideally somebody whom people on this list<br>
would trust with this role?<br>
<br>
If there was some sort of consensus on this list about a new maintainer,<br>
I would be happy to pass on this role (redirect <a href=3D"http://omake.met=
aprl.org" target=3D"_blank">omake.metaprl.org</a><br>
accordingly, etc).<br>
<br>
