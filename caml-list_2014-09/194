Yes that seems much more sensitive. I'm currently working on the API and ev=
erything will be exposed to allow you to do that. We'll just need to figure=
 out a way so that you can easily take a handle on the project description =
value.

Usually I don't comment or advertise unfinished things but I'd also like to=
 point out that the goal with assemblage is also a little bit larger than j=
ust generating a build system. I'd like to be able to express most of the p=
ackage release and installation process inside it (or at least provide help=
ers to do so) in order to replace all the ad-hoc scripts that is use now (e=
.g. topkg), to make quick and flawless releases by gathering information fr=
om the right places, tags in the vcs for version information, synchronizing=
 opam file with correct package dependencies, opam-submit integration etc.=
=20=20

Some people do find my release process complex, I basically apply a functio=
n on a git checkout and do ugly things like a global key value substitution=
 on all the files, but at least it is flawless and traceable. For example p=
ackage never lie to you about their current version, even if you pin them. =
The only way to get that flawlessly is to automate it =E2=80=94 can't count=
 the number of times opam lied to me about its version because its version =
number needs to be bumped manually.

Last year I tried the other new build systems and to influence them in that=
 direction (e.g. generating .install files) without much success. I guess m=
ost people don't understand these problem as they only publish one package =
or two and can afford to spend some time to do their releases or hack an in=
stall process. I can't. That being said, I think we should not rush on that=
 one, it will be ready when it is ready, (I personally soon won't have the =
time to work on this as I'll have to earn my life for the winter, I can't s=
peak for Thomas though).

> I think consensus should follow code, not the other way around.
Yes. That whole discussion is largely pointless. Some people don't get that=
 healthy online communities self-organize.
