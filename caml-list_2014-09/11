Subject: [Caml-list] Cryptosense is hiring!

Cryptosense produces software that finds vulnerabilities in the
cryptographic systems used in banks and other security-sensitive
environments. We specialise in security analysis. Based in downtown
Paris, we use OCaml as our core language because it's the right tool
for the job, though we also occasionally use other languages when
appropriate (e.g., C, Java, Javascript).

We are expanding our team and need an outstanding engineer with a
taste for difficult algorithmic problems and performance engineering
challenges. The ideal candidate will have a masters or PhD in a
related area and some experience of at least one of: formal
methods, model checking, cryptography or machine learning.

At Cryptosense, we encourage developers to be autonomous and take
ownership of problems as well as fostering a culture of team
spirit and knowledge sharing. We are building a strong internal
training programme to bring you up to speed in every area.

The remuneration package includes a salary commensurate with
experience as well as stock options. For info, Cryptosense is a
spin-off of Inria created in 2013. We recently closed a seed
funding round with one of the best-known VC firms in Paris.

You can find out more about Cryptosense on the company blog

http://cryptosense.com/blog/

and more about working for us on our jobs page

http://cryptosense.com/working-at-cryptosense/ =E2=80=8E

Let me know if you are interested or know someone who might be
interested. Romain Bardou and myself will be present later this week
at ICFP if you want to chat about what we do.

Thomas Braibant
