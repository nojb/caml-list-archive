Hi,

Is there a plan to include the Thread module in the native compiler
framework?  Or is there a work done with native concurrent ocaml?

I am trying to make a distributed version of ocaml, building a (software)
distributed shared memory using, which allows sharing arbitrary ML data
including closures.  On top of the DSM, we would like to provide a
primitive for remote spawning of closures, for instance:

	spawn_at : place -> (unit -> 'a) -> unit

"Spawn_at" copies the closure to the remote host identified by the
"place" and starts a new thread that runs the closure.  For this purpose,
we need a light-weight thread library.

Any help or comment is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Ken
