This is an instance of a general problem, the design of a programming
environment for the Caml family of languages with the various tools=20
operating on abstract syntax rather than concrete syntax, so that they can
be used for all dialects through proper preprocessing. If you use an Emacs
editing support tool such as Tuareg you will have problems if you try to
adopt non-archaic syntax.=20

For ocamldep the problem may be circumvented by some magic "pr_depend"
module written by Daniel for use with camlp4. Here is my own Makefile
depend entry, which should be adaptable to other syntax variants :

depend: $(SOURCES)=20
	> .depend.new
	for i in $(SOURCES); do \
	camlp4r my_own_syntax_extension.cmo pr_depend.cmo -- -I . $$i >>
.depend.new ; \
	done
	mv .depend.new .depend
