Hello Steve,

Last year I wrote in OCaml a software that had to deal with multiple
output/input files of a commercial tool, and hence needed up to six lexers
and parsers. The different formats were rather close (both lexically and
syntactically), but I wasn't able to share the lexers and the parsers
rules because:
  1) ocamllex generates an "open <Parser module name>" directive;
  2) ocamlyacc doesn't allow rule sharing.
Nevertheless, I shared a lot of semantic actions (defined in standalone
modules).

The first point could be solved if ocamllex produced a functor whose
argument signature would constrain the abstract syntax tree, but I am not
sure the underlying implementation of lexer buffers would then behave
soundly.

Best regards,


Christian
