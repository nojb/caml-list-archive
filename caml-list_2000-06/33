FYI: the lack of a standard preprocessor is a minor obstacle to
commercial use.  By 'standard' I mean "supplied with the
main distribution" and the implication is for ease of
configuration, and integration with other tools.

As it happens, the lack of a preprocessor doesn't concern _me_,
since I use a powerful literate programming tool as a code
generator; however, ocamlyacc is annoying, since it isn't so
easy to generate #line directives (and it isn't clear these would
be respected in the generated code). This is mandatory for
use with any code generator (including my LP tool).
