 But, sure, it is completely legal, for example, in Russia. And license
conditions which prohibits reverse engeneering, like M$ license, is illegal ;)

 No. But I can't see a way to make it hard.

 Yeah, like it was in Linux kernel: kernel from US, and concrete cryptographic
functions from Europe.

 It is possible, but it is completely uneffectife.

 Java reverse engeneering is not much harder than Elisp ;)
So, it'll be the same for OCaml. 

P.S. [offtopic] Fundamental science is just a reverse engeneering and violation
of God's intellectual property. ;)
