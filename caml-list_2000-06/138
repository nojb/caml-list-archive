To my knowledge the reason for this is that you might otherwise have
difficulties with linking, because some library may contain a module
with the same name. By requiring correct order of files during linking,
it is possible to "override" the names provided in libraries or earlier
on the command line. E.g., if you want to use a different implementation
for sets, just link against some other set.cmo: it overrides whatever
was used before.

Maybe a tool that prints out a correct order for a set of files would
be helpful. This should be fairly easy to do - possibly just grab the
code from ocamldot.
