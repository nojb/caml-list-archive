As a counter-example, look at comp.lang.python.  There is very little spam,
and the quality of postings is extremely high.  I suspect that people who
like nice languages like ocaml (and python!) are more likely to be
well-behaved than the average usenet poster :-)  Also, I think it's less
intimidating for beginners like myself to post to a newsgroup with a silly
question than to a mailing list.  comp.lang.ml has always had a strong SML
bias (due, no doubt, to this mailing list providing an alternative forum),
and a very low volume, perhaps due to the moderation.  I would rather see
comp.lang.ml.caml or comp.lang.caml than just redirecting news to
comp.lang.ml; how many of us actually read it?  Also, I fear pointless SML
vs. CAML flame wars might develop if all the caml traffic were to go to
c.l.ml.

However, a "caml-announce" mailing list would be a very good thing.
