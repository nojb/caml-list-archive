Subject: Multiple Yacc-style Parsers in one application?

Good morning.

I'm interested in hearing experiences from people who have used
multiple yacc parsers in one application. I assume that they would
share one lexer buffer (but maybe not). Do you have to manipulate the
lexical world to deal with the one-lookahead?

Any experiences, stories, etc, greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

steve
