I'm in the process of reading "The Functional Approach
to Programming" (Cousineau & Mauny).  This book is not
strictly OCaml (it's based on CAML-Light), but it's
teaching me the basics I need.  It's also quite a good
book for learning functional programming techniques
in general.  It's not a bad price, either.  I found it
for $32 at Borders.com.

BTW -- Although it is a translation of a French book,
it is quite well-written.  Their editor/translator was
quite talented.  I can find very little in the way
of French syntax in the volume ;-)

Hope that's helpful,

-Brent
