I had the same problem with our active networking software, in which we use
the camlp4 ifdef syntax.  Therefore, to do dependency generation, we use
camlp4 with pr_depend (provided with the distribution), e.g.:

camlp4 pa_ifdef.cmo pr_depend.cmo -- $(INCLUDES) $(IFDEF_FLAGS) file1 file2
  ...

If you aren't using camlp4 for your preprocessor, then your suggestion above
would be more appropriate.
