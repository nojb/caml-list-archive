I'd also be willing to translate a chapter or two.  I'd like to raise
three questions:

1.  Would someone (possibly Benjamin Pierce?) be willing to take on
    the job of negotiating with O'Reilly to make this possible?

2.  Would someone be willing to collect volunteers to help in this
    project?  

3.  Who else would be willing to join as a volunteer?  

I myself would not be good at 1.  However, I'd be willing to take on
role 2, unless someone else would be better suited to it.

Of course, success depends on getting a significant number of
volunteers, at least a dozen, probably more because some people will
have to drop out for one reason or another.  I suppose that, with this
many participants, we'll also need someone to play the role of editor,
and make sure that the translations are uniform in style and in choice
of terms.

If you would like to volunteer, please send email directly to me
<guttman@mitre.org> rather than cluttering the Caml list; I will
report status to the list.  Other comments on the idea should be
directed to the list.

Thanks --
