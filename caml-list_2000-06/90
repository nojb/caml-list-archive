It is possible to block spam from a newsgroup:

- create a "moderated" newsgroup, with an e-mail address for submissions
- put a spam filter on the submission address
- gateway the submission address directly to the newsgroup (with no manual
intervention)

I think the comp.lang.dylan/info-dylan newsgroup/mailing list works like
this.  I know the list is gatewayed to and from the group, and I'm fairly
certain it isn't actively moderated.

It might be possible to filter out cross-postings as well.

Dave.

Absolutely. This way I would not have the burden to answer directly to
naive questions, that can be sent to the news group.

IMHO, you're absolutely right.

Yes, but I would like a slightly more general mailing list, opened to
suggestions (libraries and language design improvements). The rest
(including comparison between Caml and whatever) being freeely posted
to the unmoderated newsgroup.
