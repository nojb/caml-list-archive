Hello,

Following the recent conversation over whether the caml mailing-list shoul=
d become a newsgroup, I suggest people to take a look at =22egroups=22 (ww=
w.egroups.com in english / www.egroups.fr in french). egroups hosts mailin=
g lists with a variety of moderation policies. Members can choose to recei=
ve emails just as they would with a normal mailing-list; they can choose t=
o receive a digest from time to time; or they can choose to consult them o=
nly online.

Among other tools, file sharing directory is provided, as well as live tex=
t- and voice-chat, and community polling capabilities. Management is done =
on-line through a html form-based interface.

This is a free service hosted by a californian company, which in return ap=
pends a one-line ad to each message sent.

Of course this would mean less direct control by the inria over informatio=
n, and stepping out of the =22free stuff=22. But given the difference of e=
xpectations between the different users of this mailing list, I think this=
 is at least worth considering while similarly powerful tools for mailing-=
list handling have not yet been developed by the free software community. =
A little integration work would also need to be done so that the current s=
earching / archiving facility for the mailing list still functions.

 mailing-list.
