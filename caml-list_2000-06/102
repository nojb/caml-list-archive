A number of companies put restrictions on the use of newsgroups,
making them much less convenient than mailing-lists for their
employees.

Personnally I also prefer the high quality mailing-list we have now.
If a newsgroup is created, I would suggest that selected posts are
redirected to the list and that all message to the mailing list are
automatically redirected to the newsgroup.
