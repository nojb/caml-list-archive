		Festival Workshop in Foundations and Computations

                             Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh

                             Sunday 16 July-Tuesday 18 July 2000

This workshop is a part of a research festival at Heriot-Watt
University, Edinburgh, during parts of the summer of 2000.  During the
festival, international and national researchers spend short/long time
at Heriot-Watt during which a lively research environment will take
place. There will be many seminars during the festival details of
which are advertised separately. When the visits coincide with a
particular theme, a workshop will be held on that theme. If you like
to take part in the festival and/or give a talk, contact
fairouz@cee.hw.ac.uk. Grants are available for parts or all of the
registration fees and accommodation. Contact fairouz@cee.hw.ac.uk for
details.

The first workshop in the festival is a workshop on foundations and
computations. If you have a relevant talk, submit a three page
abstract to fairouz@cee.hw.ac.uk by 25 June 2000. You will be informed
of acceptance by 5 July 2000.
