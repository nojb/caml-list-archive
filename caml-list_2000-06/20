Subject: Problems with ocamlopt under windows?
Date: Tue, 6 Jun 2000 00:30:29 -0700 
X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2651.58)
Sender: weis


I'm wondering if other people are experiencing problems with ocamlopt under
windows.

I have a program that works fine as bytecode, but it runs out of stack space
when 
compiled with ocamlopt. I'm suspecting an infinite loop.

I can't seem to narrow down the problem for now, since changing the amount
of print output
masks the error.
