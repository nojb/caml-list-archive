Hello,

for those of you who are still not satisfied with the ease of building
OCaml-projects:

I have just released an updated version of "OcamlMakefile", which exploits
new features of the OCaml-tools and adds some functionality, namely:

  * the new library building semantics (libraries "remember" their link
    flags)

  * greatly improved dependency handling: exploits the recently introduced
    "-native"-flag of "ocamldep" and stores generated dependencies in
    a much more transparent way - *the* perfect solution?

  * supports easy installation of libraries

  * and, and, and... (see the updated Changes + README of the distribution!)

Unfortunately, I haven't yet managed to implement a target that makes you a
cup of coffee, but I'm working on that... ;-)

Here the link (get "ocaml_make.tar.gz" as usual):

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
