I am personally an adept of newgroups (at least as reader), but for
various reasons, amongst which the fact almost all postings seem to be
SML related, I generally refrain to post on comp.lang.ml, except for
software announcements.
I'm not even sure all ocaml announcement were there.

If we keep all of the current caml-list in the digest, I'm afraid it
will be rather indigest.
What about splitting it in 2 or 3:
  * caml-list, and an optional caml-announce for moderated discussions
    and announces
  * caml-users for free questions and unmoderated discussion.
In a transition phase, the moderator could choose to repost things to
caml-announce and caml-users when he thinks that this fits there.

Having several lists, with a good web interface (the current one seems
buggy, and does not support presenting results in pages), and
automatized registration procedure, may indeed be an alternative to a
newsgroup.

I feel it much easier to casually go and see what is happening on a
newsgroup, rather than register and unregister from a mailing-list,
but the web interface can somehow play this role for casual readers.
Even better if it would remember which messages you have read and
which you didn't (cookie specialists around ?).
