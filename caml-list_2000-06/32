The issues raised so far (where I work and use Ocaml) were:

	1) no one here knows it
	2) possible licence restrictions

Since I use the native code compiler exclusively,
there's no current problem involving bytecode.

BTW: people here read books. An English Ocaml book would provide
very strong support for industrial use.
