The comp.lang.ml newsgroup is gatewayed to and from the ML mailing list.
These were set up to discuss all dialects of ML (that's why the newsgroup is
called comp.lang.ml instead of comp.lang.sml, and the same for the mailing
list).  So you wouldn't be "seizing power", you would be like lost sheep
returning to the fold.  The number of postings would clearly show which
implementation is the more active.

That's understandable ;-)

I wouldn't mind using a newsgroup. However, there is already one called
"comp.lang.ml", which has very low traffic: seems that people who are
interested in OCaml (= not SML) have all signed up to the mailing list... :)

Instead of creating a new one, the more imperialistically minded among us
might choose to seize power over there...

But I think that the volume on our list is acceptably high to open a
separate newsgroup. This would definitely lead to much more publicity.  The
direct comparison of traffic on both newsgroups would then also allow
people to recognize the better choice ;)

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
