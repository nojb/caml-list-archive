What would be the problem with two mailing list, one moderated, the other not. 

Then on top of this two, you add a news bridge, so people who want news style
access can get it. and people prefering mails can have that too.

Beside, most good mail reader/mail setups have facilities to sort mail in
different mail boxes, and to offer threaded mail reading, which much
facilitate the lecture of high traffic mailing lists.

One thing that would be nice to do though would be to clearly labelate the
mail comming from the caml lists, since this is not done as of today, and i
have to have lot of differentrules in procmail just for caml-list :

:0                      # Caml
* ^ Resent-To: .*caml-redist@pauillac.inria.fr
lists/caml
:0                      # Caml
* ^CC: .*caml-list@inria.fr
lists/caml
:0                      # Caml
* ^Sender: .*Pierre.Weis@inria.fr
lists/caml
:0                      # Caml
* ^Resent-To: .*caml-redistribution@pauillac.inria.fr
lists/caml
:0                      # Caml
* ^Cc: .*caml-redistribution@pauillac.inria.fr
lists/caml
:0                      # Caml
* ^To: .*caml-redistribution@pauillac.inria.fr
lists/caml

a X-Mailing-List or something such should be fine.
