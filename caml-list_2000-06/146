Dear Caml Developers/Users,

(sorry that I don't know French)

This might be an FAQ, but could someone please give a rationale to the
polymorphic (in)equalities such as = and < in Caml?  While they have a
parametric polymorphic type 'a -> 'a -> bool, their semantics is ad
hoc rather than parametric with respect to the type 'a (for example,
they are undefined for functions), which I found confusing to some
users---at least, a friend of mine was confused, and chose Haskell
(which has type classes) over Caml!
