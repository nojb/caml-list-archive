Well, the problem is that comp.lang.ml is a moderated newsgroup, and
that it is directly tied to the SML mailing list. I see no point in
changing that.

If Pierre is for a newsgroup, it is probably because the flow on the
caml-list is becoming very time-consuming to moderate. So it would
probably be nice to have a non-moderated comp.lang.caml.

Also I'm not sure that people who don't like newsgroups would really
enjoy reading such a non-moderated caml-list, with the flame-wars and
spam one can expect.

What about keeping a moderated caml-list mainly for announcements, the
newsgroup being there for questions and discussions?

I know it's always hard to distinguish, but for me news and mailing
lists are complementary, and I would prefer to have mailing lists
directly pour in my inbox, rather than have to discriminate them to
avoid overflow.
