That's understandable ;-)

I wouldn't mind using a newsgroup. However, there is already one called
"comp.lang.ml", which has very low traffic: seems that people who are
interested in OCaml (= not SML) have all signed up to the mailing list... :)

Instead of creating a new one, the more imperialistically minded among us
might choose to seize power over there...

But I think that the volume on our list is acceptably high to open a
separate newsgroup. This would definitely lead to much more publicity.  The
direct comparison of traffic on both newsgroups would then also allow
people to recognize the better choice ;)

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
