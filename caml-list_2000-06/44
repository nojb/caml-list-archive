That's part of the problem. People here are short of time:
while education in functional programming techniques is 
useful, a description of Ocaml is more pointed: remember,
Ocaml is _not_ a functional programming language, but an
Algol like language with functional, procedural, and object
oriented components... just like C++. 

In ocaml, the 'orientation' is more functional, but the biggest
obstacle isn't the functional paradigm as such, but the actual
concrete syntax used.
