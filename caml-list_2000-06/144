I personnally consider that it would be a good idea, but there is a little
problem. Let's consider:
   a.ml depending on c.ml (a.ml contains e.g. open C)
   b.ml independant
   c.ml independant

Let's suppose that you write:
    ocamlc a.cmo b.cmo c.cmo

Do Ocaml has to do:
    ocamlc c.cmo a.cmo b.cmo
    ocamlc b.cmo c.cmo a.cmo

The first solution respects the initial relative order "a.cmo b.cmo" but
not "b.cmo c.cmo". It is the contrary in the second solution.

If Ocaml chooses for you, it can be a problem if you want to make side
effects in some order while executing these modules.

Well, it could be an option of Ocaml...

I have been inspired by this question by my genealogy software GeneWeb
when I have to sort children by birth dates when not all of them have some.
