This is certainly true. As a 'silent lurker' who enjoys caml
but does not use it on a daily basis, I still appreciate the
quality of the posts and the list as a way to stay in touch
with the community.

For me it is. Also I use some simple filters to keep all the list
mails in a separate folder which I can ignore when I'm too busy to
read them. Not ideal, but no more work that scanning a newsgroup
when I have time to clean them out.

All the best,
Niall
