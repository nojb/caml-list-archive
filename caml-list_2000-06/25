Hello,

Congratulation for the last version of Ocaml ...
Finally OCaml introduces structural inclusion for variant types ...

---

Actually i develop a functional language with regular types (for XML
data
types introduction)and i try to detect  partial functions during the
type checking
pass !

X. Leroy suggests the introduction of these detections during the
compilation
in "The ZINC experiment, an economical implementation of the ML
language"
technical report and this is done during the OCaml pattern matching
compilation
pass ...

Why this is not done during the typing pass ?
. Non conventional type checking rules ?
. Not a task for the type checker because it's a control based on
possible data flows ?
. No structural inclusion for classical variant types ?

Thank you ...

D. Plaindoux
