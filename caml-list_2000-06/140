> Is there Qt binding for Caml?

That would be very nice, but i'm afraid there is none.
I really thought about making one at some time, and even started to
write an experimental interface by hand, but this is so much easier to
do with GTK...

The big problem is how to interface with C++, and particularly how to
subclass C++ code, since this is a requisite with Qt. I know that this
is possible with the Perl and Python interfaces, but I'm not sure they
bother very much about safety.

Anyway, if you're interested I can send you my experimental
prototype. This works up to tutorial 5.
