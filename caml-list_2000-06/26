I had a problem like this a couple of months ago that I never reoprted.
Changing an action in ocamlyacc from

foo:  ... { my_ref := true; () }

to

foo:  ... { my_ref := true }

actually changed the behaviour of the program, from stack overflow to
correct behaviour.  At the time I couldn't get a small program illustrating
the error, and so didn't file a bug report.  I was using 2.02.

Cheers,
Don

I'm wondering if other people are experiencing problems with ocamlopt under
windows.

I have a program that works fine as bytecode, but it runs out of stack space
when 
compiled with ocamlopt. I'm suspecting an infinite loop.

I can't seem to narrow down the problem for now, since changing the amount
of print output
masks the error.
