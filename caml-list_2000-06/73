I think this is an excellent idea.  I much prefer newsgroups to mailing
lists because newsgroups don't clutter up my inbox on subjects I'm not
interested in (or only slightly interested in), and it's easy to go back
and read messages later.  One suggestion: keep an archive of the newsgroup
postings on the Caml web site so we don't have to rely on DejaNews for
older posts :-)
