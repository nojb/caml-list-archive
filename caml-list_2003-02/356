Perl doesn't have hierarchical namespaces.  There's no relationship
between a module OUTER and the module OUTER::INNER.

Given that Perl's done pretty well for itself in having a broad set of
modules with non-hierarchical namespaces, it doesn't look like a requirement
for Ocaml that it be modified to have hierarchical namespaces, while that
may be nice.

It seems to me we just need to put into place a standard package
namimg scheme, such as using `_' as a separator.

So instead of having a module Pxp_reader, would could have XML_PXP_Reader.

Best,
Blair
