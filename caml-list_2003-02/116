Here's my problem with a matrix module: when I see a module named Matrix,
I immediately think linear algebra- BLAS.  A full-on BLAS implementation
might be usefull, but probably way more work than most people think it 
would be to do right.  Oh, doing it the obvious way would be simple enough 
for anyone who passed linear algebra.  Doing it right gives you a 10x or 
better speed up.

Two papers anyone who *wants* to do a full-on Ocaml BLAS should read 
(IMHO) are:

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/luj00oolala.html
(BLAS isn't the only, or necessarily even the best, interface)

http://www.irisa.fr/bibli/publi/pi/1994/803/803.html
(Shows the importance of blocking *and* copying in matrix operations)

Throw in vectorizing kernels using SSE-2, and you've got yourself a fair 
bit of work there.
