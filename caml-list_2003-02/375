Well, sure, that is ok if you use autoconf, but ./configure can be any
manner of selfmade shell script or whatever. Also many people prefere to
have a configure target in the makefile, which is ok with me.

And it is in these cases that DESTDIR need to be supported. Also the
point of it is to have a DESTDIR which you can change in the make
install, and which is different from the one you configure to.

Will have a look.

BTW, does make install-byte and make-install-opt install to the same
bynary name ?
