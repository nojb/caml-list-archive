As a new ocaml user, the two biggest missing features appear to be 

  1) a.) no multi-threading support where threads would migrate
         between processors 
     b.) ... which has underlying it: no MT-safe (and efficient)
         garbage collector 

  2) ocamlopt-generated programs cannot dynamically load
     ocamlopt-generated code.

Please correct me if I'm wrong about these two.  I don't know whether
people are already working on this or even if anyone cares about these
features.  I gave a presentation on ocaml to a linux user group
recently, and these two are the only shortcomings I could identify.
Everything else was radient praise.
