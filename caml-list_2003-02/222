I think collecting these functions is a great idea and it might enhance 
the usability of our favourite language (I have conflicting emotions 
about this claim being true. Still...).

But if *we* (I am including all OCaml programmers here) think it worth 
building such a library, why bother the OCaml team by piling *more* work 
on them? As somebody in this lists has pointed out, they are already 
doing *harder* work on the (may I have my interest included here) module 
recursion problem & downcasts and whatnot and I trust their capability 
(and willingness) to work in whatever problems they think it worth.

Why not (self?)appoint, say, three persons (I don't care about many more 
with decision power to come to an agreement about anything) to receive 
would-be code and maintain a "big-s(c)ale library"... This may find its 
way into the Standard library or it may not, but would definitely make 
happy all these people wanting to contribute differentially to the whole 
OCaml effort...

Just an idea... Something to discuss...
