I have 3 sourceforge projects, and I think that while it

is clumbsy at doing some things it does have a lot of support
and reasonable management tools. I can't speak for savannah.
Sourceforge downside: FTP is not supported BAHHHH HUMBUG don't these
people know that HTTP is unreliable? :-) Also the release mechanism
is exceedingly clumbsy, and they don't allow computations on the
main shell accounts -- last I looked the computation farm required
manually moving stuff around.

On licence: given the goal to extend/round out the standard
ocaml library, I think our feelings on the licence are fairly moot.
We should simply use the same licence as the library we're extending.

ON worthy subgoal would be to *eliminate* the other licences:
I believe the Str module is archaic and has 'other licence'
and we might try to eliminate it -- the Ocaml team itself is
working on that isn't it?

[Sigh: my FSA code already replaces Ocamllex, but it's FFAU:
more work is needed, but if other contributions were LGPL
I wouldn't be able to use them unless I rethought my licence policy]
