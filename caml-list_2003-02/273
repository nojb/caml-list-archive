I agree with this as well.  Like the other point about packagin, I think 
worrying about getting the code into the main distribution and packaging 
and whatnot is premature.  Let's just start a sourceforge project and get 
some code together.  If it's useful, we'll solve the distribution problems 
as they come up.
