This is a known issue with the PowerPC code generator of ocamlopt,
however it should normally be fixed in OCaml version 3.06.
If you're not using 3.06, I suggest an upgrade.  If you are already
using 3.06, I'd be interested in obtaining the sources in order to
reproduce the problem.  (Please send them to me directly.)
