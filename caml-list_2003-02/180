It's been forever since I've played on the Power Architecture.  But IIRC, 
the Power/PowerPC architecture conditional branchs have a maximum range of 
like 64K (IIRC).  For conditional branchs longer than that, you need to 
branch over an unconditional branch (which jumps a lot farther).  This 
looks to be what you are hitting.
