Here are two papers i am aware of (sorry, i don't have the urls at hand =20=

now, but a search
on the web should give them to you) :

* J.ohn Reekie. "Visual Haskell : a first attempt", TR 94.5, U. =20
Sydney,, 1994.

* Joel Kelso. "A Visual representation for functional programs", TR =20
CS95-01, CS Dept, Murdoch Univ, 1995.

You can also have a look at Reekie's subsequent work on dataflow signal =20=

procesing (including his phd thesis)

@phdthesis{ reekie95realtime,
     author =3D "H. J. Reekie",
     title =3D "{Realtime Signal Processing: Dataflow, Visual and =20
Functional Programming}",
     address =3D "University of Technology at Sydney, Australia",
     year =3D "1995",
     url =3D "citeseer.nj.nec.com/article/reekie95realtime.html" }

or on the work

* of Launchburry on Hawk (www.cse.ori.edu/PacSoft/projects/Hawk)
* at Chalmers on Lava (http://www.math.chalmers.se/~koen/Lava),
* O'Donnell on Hydra (http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jtod/Hydra/)

The laters all use FP to describe hardware systems.

Finally, you could also have a look at

* Camlflow =20
(http://wwwlasmea.univ-bpclermont.fr/Personnel/Jocelyn.Serot/=20
camlflow.html)

a system i developed to describe data-flow graphs as caml programs.

HTH,

Jocelyn
