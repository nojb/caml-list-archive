> Regarding license ... I suppose LGPL could be fine.

The new "user code library" is a good idea, but GPL
and LGPL are both bad ideas.

GPL eliminates commercial usage.  LGPL is currently
deprecated even by the Free Software Foundation.  It's
too murky -- what constitutes a 'derivative work' or
'library linkage' is highly debatable.  Many projects
use a modified LGPL for this reason; wxWindows and
FLTK are two examples.

The best choices would be either the Academic Free
License or the Mozilla Public License.  The Academic
Free License is modern 'best practice' and was drafted
by OSI lawyers.  The MPL came about through extensive
user discussions over a long period of time (as did
wxWindows which is also OSI-approved).
