I have worked on both needs myself. The two projects are 
still at a very early stage, but both work pretty well and 
have already been used in a commercial project. I plan on 
releasing the two packages as soon as my new leased line is 
up and my web site will be accessibile. This might take 
another month, but if you're in a real hurry, I can mail you 
a tarred distro.

I hope my work will be able to address such concerns as yours.

Have fun.

Alex
