>I don't agree with you: a Matrix module would definitively end

I just reviewed 10384 messages to caml-list from the past 2 years.  Of 
around 40 separate questions containing the word "matrix", only 3 (or 5 
being incredibly generous) would even be affected by having a Matrix 
module, and it's not clear they'd be answered.  And that's ignoring any new 
questions that might be generated by the module's existence itself if it's 
implemented.

The point is that a) there are just not many questions pertaining to this 
topic, and b) any Matrix module you guys implemented would either be a toy, 
or it'd take forever to write and still not please people who really use 
matrices for real work (which account for 90% of the questions referenced 
above).

As far as I can tell (unless I'm missing a bunch of caml-list messages), 
the questions relating to this on the caml-list are simply not worth a 
Matrix module that takes even just a couple days of the core caml team's 
time.  I can name probably 20 equivalently sized tasks that would help way 
more people who are trying to use caml and answer way more future 
questions, and that only the core team can do.

Now, if you just have a hankering to write a matrix module, that's cool, go 
for it.  But if you goal is to spend 2 days and solve as many caml 
programmers' problems as possible, this is not the place to spend it.

How about this as a counterproposal:  I will personally, promptly, and 
tirelessly answer any and all matrix related questions on the caml-list for 
the remainder of 2003 if you will work on something more important?  :)

The key thing is that anybody on this list could write the Matrix 
module.  There are lots of things that only the core caml team can do.

Okay, I'm done wasting your time.  Sorry if this came off as rude, I didn't 
intend it that way.

Thanks,
Chris
