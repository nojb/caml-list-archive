I think it is a good idea to learn how Jakarta project on www.apache.org
is organized.

It is based on centralized repository. There is a tool that runs several
times per day and builds every project (latest dev version) to ensure
that they are building correctly. Dependency tracking is implemented
via build files (which are much similar to makefiles).

So, if there would be centralized repository for ocaml projects, it
would
be easier to keep them working together.

There are many questions on how to do it exactly, but the most
important is the following: first, it is unknown if ocaml developers
would like to support centralized repository like ApacheGroup does;
and second, it is unknown if existing projects will decide to move into
this repository, like many open-sources java projects are moving under
Apache umbrella.

ps. Apache group projects also share the same license. Less time spent
on legal stuff and more on development.
