Hi,

My application makes use of the Unix module and currently runs on Linux x=
86. =20
Is there an easy way to native cross compile to other processors and=20
architectures like Cygwin, FreeBSD, and Mac X?

Also, I'm trying to port to Cygwin, but I have a very small piece of code=
 that=20
needs to change for the port to work.  What is the best way to handle thi=
s in=20
Ocaml?  I never liked #defines.

Thanks,
Tom
