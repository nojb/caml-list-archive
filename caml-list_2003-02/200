Hello,

I have added a profiling-output of a logfile-analysator.
One of my first Ocaml-projects, which will be used as
a tool (and not as a learning project).

Because of time consumption I looked, how the profiling
can help. Well, ocamplopt doesn't created a call-graph
for gprof. But in the reference manual I found the comment,
that this is not supported on all platforms.
(It's Linux on Mac G4).


I wonder about this section in the profiler-output:

let entry_contains_reject entry =
   (* 63273 *) List.exists (fun stri -> (* 1066296 *) Str.string_partial_match reject_regexp stri 0) entry


There is a function called by List.exists, which is called
about 16 times as often as the calling function.
There are 63273 Elements in the list. Why is the
unnamed function (or Str.string_partial_match)
called 1066296 times?


TIA,
   Oliver
