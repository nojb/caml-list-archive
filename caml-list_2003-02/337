The problem is that every package has a different build system,
configuration system (Makefile targets), installation directories,
etc. Of course it is "easy" to package them : just issue the right
(Makefile or whatever) commands, set the right Makefile variables,
etc. The problem is that you have to spend some time figuring out
these commands. Ideally, it should be as simple as :

  perl Makefile.Pl
or
  python ./setup.py build

One more point is that ocaml is multi-platform : so this build system
should be able to run on unix, Windows, MacOS. Packages that wraps C
libraries will probably be platform-specific but it think it would be
nice if pure ocaml programs could be built the same way on every
platform supported by ocaml.
