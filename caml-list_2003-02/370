Yes, but notice that this may also be true for the source version, which
sometimes need to be changed between sucessive ocaml versions. Also,
this does not take into account the fact that the libraries you may use
will change also from time to time.

I have been confronted with this problem quite a bit, and i think we
need to move to something where each library (and ocaml suite) can
advertize its compatibility version. Something akin to the sonames used
by C shared libraries.

I began this move for the ocaml debian package in december, by moving
the libdir to /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06, and have planes to have fully
parallel instalable ocaml packages by the time 3.07 and debian/sarge are
released.

The libdir is only one thing, but there are also the binaries to take
into acount, most important among them is ocamlrun. I would encourage a
move from ocamlrun to ocamlrun-<version> in the standard install, or at
least a configure option to add the version number to all binaries.

The aim of this is to be able to still keep bytecode executables around
which were compiled for older versions, even when you are working with
the new version.

You know that there are at least 3 BSD ports of debian, not yet
official though. There is also work on debian/mingw, and debian/djpp
(for plain dos).

Yes, i agree with you on that.
