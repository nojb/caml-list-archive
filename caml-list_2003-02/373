Yes, ...

I know i am repeating myself, but please consider adding the following
points also :

  o support the DESTDIR prefix to your install directory. distribution
    need to install into different directories than the ones the
    package will unpack into.

  o support separate compilation for bytecode and nativecode. I build
    bytecode versions of my packages on my i386 box alongside the native
    versions. The bytecode package is arch: all, and will be
    installeable on every arch, including slower arches like m68k, where
    building huge ocaml bytecode executables is a waste of time if it
    can be done quicker on my box.

This are the two parts most people don't ever think about, and for which
i need to patch the makefiles myself every time. I could double or
triple the amount of stuff i package if this was easier handled.

Friendly,

Sven luther
