See Hashtbl.fold, which supports traversing all entries of a hashtable
and build a result of any type.  For instance:

let keys h = Hashtbl.fold (fun key data accu -> key :: accu) h []

There would be disagreement as what the return type of these functions
should be: lists, sets, etc.  But you can easily write them with
Hashtbl.fold.
