Your loss, ...

BTW, why don't you use the packages ?

Well, we could be using alternatives or diversions, but i think it is
not worth it. I believe that having only ocamlrun with the appended
version should be enough for running older bytecode executables. That
and the dll.so files, naturally.

That said, you are aware that a bytecode executable built on your system
will not run on another system with ocamlrun placed in different place.
