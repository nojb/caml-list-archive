Hi,

I've made a caml algorithm for solving some combinatorial problems.
I've made a little user interface with camltk in order to launch many
times the solving procedure.

I ran it, and I clicked on the start button one time, the computing
time was about 30s. When I clicked a second time, the computing time
exceeded 60s !!

The programm doesn't store in any data structure the results of the run,
and all the variables values remain the same as before the run.
The outputs of the two runs are identical, just the running time is
different.

I guessed that it was a problem about memory management, garbage
collector, so I tried Gc.full_major and Gc.compact, but it didn't work.

Is anyone has any ideas or suggestions to help me ?


Thanks,

Vincent
