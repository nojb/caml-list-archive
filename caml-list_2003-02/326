I have gotten into the habit of using apt-get for all the Perl modules
I need to install, rather than going to CPAN.  The Debian maintainers
have done the hard work of specifying the dependencies, install
scripts, etc. so that it's easy to install and uninstall them.  I'm
sure I get only a small subset of CPAN that way, but the quality
control has been worth it, and I haven't needed anything that wasn't
already Debianized.

This is mainly valuable because it is the *same* apt-get tool used for
everything on the system, not a parallel tool just for Perl.  It makes
it easier for Perl applications to be mainstream rather than marginal,
because other packages can easily and robustly specify dependencies on
the Perl apps.

For these reasons, a parallel tool just for OCaml would be less useful than
packaging the relevant libraries as Debian packages (like Sven Luther and
others have done -- thanks!)  But that doesn't help non-Debian OCaml users.
