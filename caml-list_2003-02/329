Stefano, do you have authority to make changes to the Ocaml 
standard library distribution? I don't. The best I can do is 
distribute my ocamllib-addons, as I call them, and let the 
Ocaml team pick whatever they like for the sake of inclusion 
into the standard library. The addons package only contains 
whatever code isn't already in the standard distribution, 
and as the caml team takes functions from this package for 
the standard library, such functions will be purged from the 
addons package.
