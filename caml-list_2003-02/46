By the way, it looks like the 'format' type has changed (4 args
instead of 3). This is a bit problematic, since some softwares must
use the CVS version of ocaml, only when compiled on Mac OS X (because
of the signal bug), but cannot stay compatible with the 3.06 distrib
because of this change in the format type. Will there be a new
official release soon ? It's not that important, the configure script
can detect and correct that, but it would be nice to have a
Jaguar-compatible official distrib of ocaml...
