I'm certainly willing to do the scut work.  And contribute code.  The only
thing that's causing me to slow down is that this wasn't originally my
idea.  I've lost the messages which started this thread, so I can't give
proper attribution.  And I think it's bad luck to start a project by 
torqueing people off :-).
