Hello,

when I create a program with ocamlc
and give it to other people, who want
to use it - will they be able to run
it on another computer, even if they
do not have the necessary libraries?

Or do they have to install them?

So, the questions goes into the direction
of linkage - dynamic or static.

Both has advantages. For portability I
would choose the way, to include all necessary
libs, and for filesize-issues I would
prefer a dynamic solution.

How does Ocaml do it?
Or are both ways possible?

Ciao,
   Oliver
