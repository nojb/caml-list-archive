It takes a lot of time and work to collect function 
signatures and code, validate the former, test or prove 
correct the latter, cut and paste the code into the cvs 
version of the library, revalidate and retest the whole 
thing, and finally distribute it.

I have my own ocamllib-addons findlib module which contains 
my additions to the standard library. I think this approach 
wins. Some of us could maintain an ocamllib-addons project 
for everybody else. Anyone wishing to use the extended 
library would simply have to download and install one 
findlib package.

The ocaml team could then use the addons code as a basis for 
extensions to the standard library, if and when they deem a 
function or a module of sufficiently general usefulness and 
of adequate quality. The addons maintainer(s) would then 
remove the equivalent code from the addons package.
