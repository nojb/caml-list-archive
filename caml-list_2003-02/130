Hello,

Your "problem" is due to the fact that when you use the function make_vect =
m agent_init, Caml creates an array where all element are pointing at the s=
ame object which is agent_init : in your whole program, there is only one i=
nstance of agent_init in memory.

I think that the only solution is to make the initilization of f by hand :

let agent_init () =3D { initial =3D 0 ; courant =3D 0 ; longueur =3D 0.; li=
ste_parcourue =3D [] ; =E0_visiter =3D make_vect n 1 } ;;

let f =3D make_vect m (agent_init ());;

for i =3D 0 to ((vect_length f)-1)
do
f.(i) <- agent_init ()
done

The use of a function which takes a unit argument is important because each=
 time you call it, it returns a NEW record.

I hope this helps.

Samuel.
