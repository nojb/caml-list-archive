I think that Benjamin has an excellent point here.
As much as I curse CPAN on a regular basis (e.g. for forcing 5.8.0 on=20
me), I wouldn't even touch Perl or Perl based apps if it wasn't for=20
CPAN and the easiness that it brings for the installation of apps and=20
libraries that have non-trivial requirements.

I'd say that the discussions on licences are a waste of time; I think I=20=

can predict that with more than 40 OSI approved  licenses around and=20
more non-OSI licenses available, there will never be a strong majority=20=

to agree for a specific license for a hypothetical extended OCaml=20
library.

What could be done is exactly what Benjamin suggests. To some extent,=20
the hump has a few of these functonalities. I'd push for "standard=20
installation procedures" as being part of the minimum.

My $0.02...
