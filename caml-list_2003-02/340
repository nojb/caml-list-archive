I haven't too, but coding something with the _idea_ that it will be well
suited to be included in the ocaml standard library is completely
different than coding a new library.

For example, if you are planning do improve the standard library you
surely have to get more in touch with the ocaml team to know what they
think of a stdlib.

Cheers.
