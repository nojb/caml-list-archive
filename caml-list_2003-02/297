That's a great idea! There are a few things that would need to change, of 
course, like transforming tupled arguments to curried ones, and probably 
changing interCap function names to caml_style_underscore_separated ones
but I think just staying as close as possible to the SML Basis makes a lot of 
sense for a number of reasons.
