As the source of this post-fest let me restate what was my original
idea that definitely collide with sourceforge project and similar ...

My idea was not to start a new ocaml library project full of a lot of
really useful functions but split away from the ocaml team ocaml
distribution. We already have many of them and no one of them managed to
succeed in be widespreaded enough (CDK is surely the best example!).

What I proposed was to collect a set of additions to the ocaml
_standard_ library so that ocaml implementors can take suggestions
and/or code from the ocaml programmers. This code was supposed to
_be_part_of_the_ocaml_standard_library_, not a fork.

In order to be part of the ocaml standard library functions should be:
- a few and not tons
- with interfaces and names similar to functions that already exist in
  the standard library
- addons and not implementation of new impressive data structures, they
  don't need to be part of a standard library
- recyclable as single units and not only as a whole library so that
  memebers of the ocaml team could pick single functions
- with a license compatible with ocaml sources, the beter obviously is
  the same license of the rest of ocaml sources

Anyone can be useful following this idea submitting small whishlist bug
reports including implementations of functions for the stdlib, but
creating a group which agree on a set of common functions is probably
better.

If someone is interested in working on such an approach please mail me
privately so that we can share ideas and code to propose to the ocaml
team.

Cheers.
