Yes, sure, i was hit by this problem also in september, when the new
glibc hit unstable.

However, woody and testing have the same glibc, the new glibc is
currently only available in unstable, that is way there is no problem
using the woody backport on testing. If it were not so, you could use
the unstable packages on testing without problems.
