I see a difference between a kernel which definitely can be made proprietary
from language or core library extensions, which I see are just tools to
make proprietary code.

I wouldn't have an issue with this.  I see getting improving the core language
to be more important than license issues.  After all, these libraries are
not 

I would use the C++ Boost library as an example of people contributing to
a high quality library.  Parts of the Boost library may be accepted by the
C++ standards body for future standardization.  I would guess that many
people would be proud to get their code into such a library

Here are the submission guidelines for Boost

http://www.boost.org/more/lib_guide.htm

Quoting:

     The license must meet the license requirements below. Restricted licenses
     like the GPL and LGPL are not acceptable. 

Here are their license requirements

    Must be simple to read and understand. 

    Must grant permission to copy, use and modify the software for any use
    (commercial and non-commercial) for no fee. 

    Must require that the license appear on all copies of the software source
    code. 

    Must not require that the license appear with executables or other binary
    uses of the library. 

    Must not require that the source code be available for execution or other
    binary uses of the library. 

    May restrict the use of the name and description of the library to the
    standard version found on the Boost web site. 

I would have no problems contributing to a library with these license
requirements, and suggest using Boost as a library to module Ocaml
libraries after.

Best,
Blair
