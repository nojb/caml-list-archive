I agree with that point of view.

Actually the C++ STL ( although C++ is not perhaps the better sample when
talking about programming languages... ) is distributed and developped
seperatly from compilers. Of course there is several compilers but...
Indeed perhaps we ( the ocaml programmers interested in developping the
"ocaml -extended- standard library" ) should only need a separate mailling
list ( to discuss about implementations choices such as tail recursive
calls ) and perhaps a CVS tree... so maybe a sourceforge project would be
nice here.
I would be more than happy to join such a project.
