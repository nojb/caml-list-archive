Ahhh ... Windows.  Oh, yeah, I guess, well, yeah, you're probably out
of luck until somebody decides (like ActiveState did for Perl and
Python - and note until they came along, that you were equally
out-of-luck with Perl/Python) to port all the Caml tools nicely.

Until then, well, hmmmm ... I wonder how easy it would be to use
Cygwin ...

Regardless, I think that solving this problem on UNIXes is already
sufficiently valuable that more-or-less standardizing on OCamlMakefile
and findlib would be a big step forward.

It isn't that I'm trying to be bigoted against Windows.  Just that,
well, there are UNIX tools, and Windows tools.  And you aren't going
to find the Windows tools on natively Unix, any more than you'll find
the UNIX tools natively on Windows.

E.g., note that you don't get Visual C++.Net on Unix anywhere.  And
you don't get full xemacs on Windows, except under Cygwin.
