   BTW, why don't you use the packages ?
   
Because they are years behind. Until last week I had
Debian/Potato. It comes with Ocaml 2.04 from November 1999! Now I
upgraded to unstable (which is enough bleeding edge for me) and
there I find 3.04 from December 2001.

   That said, you are aware that a bytecode executable built on your system
   will not run on another system with ocamlrun placed in different place.
   
Yes. But this applies to the ocaml packages in the same way. I
don't know any system administrator how would install ocaml under
/usr/bin. 

Bye,

Hendrik
