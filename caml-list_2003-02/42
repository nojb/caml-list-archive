Hi everybody,

I don't refuse to develop Camlp4, I would be happy to continue improving
it, fixing bugs and helping users. I just say that, for internal political
reasons, I want that Camlp4 is distributed separately from OCaml.

If this condition is accepted, you are going to have the better Camlp4
I can do, and all requests from users are welcome. If it is not, I
stop developping it and you are going to get a Camlp4 loosing its
qualities little by little, because nobody knows Camlp4 like me.

Therefore, if you want that Camlp4 be good and better, ask Michel
Mauny from the Cristal Project of INRIA, to accept the separation.
Camlp4 was developped separately the years before and everything
went well.
