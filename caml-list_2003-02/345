Well, if they want non GPLed code i wrote, they are free to reach an
agreement with me for a copy of it under whatever they choose. I Believe
this already happens for members of the ocaml consortium which have
access to the ocaml code under separate licencing schemes.

If they don't like it, then they don't use the code, or stay with the
xGPL. And any other objection only hides hidden agendas or something
such. There is no way they can force me, or someone else, to licence the
code under a licence i don't like, and trying to force the issue like
you do is ethically wrong, and more akin to racket or intimidation.

Why, there is really no reason i could not dual licence it.

Well, sure, the GPL does, but not the LGPL, and that is the whole point
of it. Also the main point of the xGPL is to protect the customer, to
make sure that they will be able to run the code even if the customer
doesn't see a reason for upgrading to the new glibc for example or
whatever. Ever tried using the closed source flash player on a sid
debian system for example ?

Please enlighten me, what did MS give back concerning the TCP/IP stack,
and what about all the protocol hijacking they have been doing in the
past ? And Apple still doesn't give enough information on their chipsets
to be able to have working agp drivers.

Can you back this, and what precisecly it is you have against the
current licencing ? Apart from FUD, that is ?

No problem, sorry if i responded strongly, but like said, just opinions,
nothing personal in it and don't take it badly.
