I noticed the recent posts about various OpenGL bindings.  The cross-platform Fast Light Tool Kit (FLTK) is very tightly coupled to OpenGL; OCaml bindings for FLTK would be wonderful.

FLTK does not absolutely require OpenGL -- it runs on Win32, X11, and Mac OS X native graphics.  It is an emulation toolkit with native look and feel (theming) support in version 2.  However it can also run inside OpenGL proper, like GLUT.  If you are running native graphics, it can create OpenGL windows.  So it has maximum configurability with respect to OpenGL.

Philosophy
http://www.fltk.org/doc-1.1/intro.html#2_1
It has always been Bill's belief that the GUI API of all modern
systems is much too high level. Toolkits (even FLTK) are not what
should be provided and documented as part of an operating system. The
system only has to provide arbitrary shaped but featureless windows, a
powerful set of graphics drawing calls, and a simple unalterable
method of delivering events to the owners of the windows. NeXT (if you
ignored NextStep) provided this, but they chose to hide it and tried
to push their own baroque toolkit instead.

Widget callback modification example
http://cscdev.lvc.edu/fl_connect/fl_connect.pdf
FL Connect is an extension to the FLTK [old version 1.1] gui library,
providing more modern callback support. By including <FL/fl
connect.H>, the application programmer gains access to an easy to use
but extremely flexible callback mechanism for FLTK?s widgets.
