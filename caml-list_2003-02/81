It seams that you have broken cygwin\usr\include\sys\param.h

This file should contain lines like this:

/* All known win32 systems are little endian.  */
#define BYTE_ORDER	LITTLE_ENDIAN

I've checked Cygnus CVS
http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/winsup/cygwin/include/s
ys/?cvsroot=src and found that there are no either sys\param.h nor
sys\types.h required to check endianess.  So configure willn't work on
this version.

MinGW doesn't seam to have such a problem.

Hmmm... well spotted! There is definitely something going badly wrong 
with the configure script. Not sure quite what to do - I manage to get 
an older install of cygwin off another machine and it compiled OK - but 
got an error on first running about "pervasives.mli". 
Not sure what to do next - at the moment, I'm sticking with the native 
windows port, but since I don't have VC++ I can't compile optimised 
code, which is a pain. 
Has anyone else had configure errors under the latest cygwin? Can anyone

test this? 
Thanks!
