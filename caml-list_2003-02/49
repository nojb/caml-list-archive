I don't say that there is no drawback (with "nightmare", you exaggerate).
Just consider the drawbacks of the different solutions.

The streams could be put back in the OCaml distribution as they were
before. If the separation is accepted, I can put them in the OCaml
archive with, better, some small code to avoid the problem of missing
of tail recursion which was there before.

Human reasons are political reasons. I am not a machine to produce
code and what I ask is not too much. As the creator of Camlp4, I
have the right to speak about my conditions of work and the right
to say how my work have to be distributed. If you ignore it, it
is normal that I stop working.
