A worry that never even crossed my mind :-).

The proper solution for this, IMHO, is shared libraries.  Yeah, the 
library is huge, but there is only one copy of it for everyone.

But I'm inclined to cross that bridge when we come to it.  I'm much more 
concerned that the library won't get used because it's "inconvient".

I say, let's start gathering code, then worry about how to package it.
