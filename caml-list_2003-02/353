Have you tried OCamlMakefile?  I gotta say -- I do a lot of weird
stuff with Caml (preprocessing with a custom-written #define
processor, amongst other weird stuff), and it's worked more-or-less
like a charm.

Indeed, I'd like to encourage others to use this puppy.  It *works*.

A combination of OCamlMakefile, and "findlib" (Thanks, Gerd!!!!)
really, really, really (did I mention really?) works to eliminate
almost all my building and packaging hassles.

I suspect that some sort of Makefile-generating facility, written in
Caml (of course), combined with OcamlMakefile, and producing findlib
modules, would be *near-ideal*.
