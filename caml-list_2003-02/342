When Haskell got to the same situation (ie. people began to collect
miscellaneous libraries into a coherent whole), one of the first things
to be done was to extend the module system of the language to
hierarchical namespaces:

<http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/libraries/libraries.html>

This sort of thing is done in Java, it is done in Perl, and it probably
ought to be done in just about any language that plans to support lots
of libraries. Naming conflicts are icky. I would very much like O'Caml
to have hierarchical namespaces as well.

The standard hierarchy layout presented in the above URL is probably
also worth pondering.
