Sure, sure, but still if nobody has plans to steal it, it should be ok
writing a licence that ensures that and nobody should complain.

Sure, but the problem is that it will not be apple which will do it,
and your argument will have a lot less impact if you give your boss the
name of some obscure little company he knows nothing about.

sure, but you do not say under what licence you are licencing it.

Most people don't even read the licences, just the name of them. Sure
the LGPL is similar to the GPL in name, but there is no reason to be
afraid of that until you have hidden agendas. And anyway, i think the
best way to do this, is to start the licence thingy by "We use the same
licence as the ocaml runtime, ...", and nobody will have problems with
that. Again, there was a huge thread some time back, just read it. Also,
maybe the ocaml team should have named their licence, so this would not
be a problem. It would be the ORPL (Ocaml Runtime Public Licence), and
everyone would be happy with it, the people not reading licences would
know it is the licence used by the ocaml runtime, and the people readin
licences would notice it is just the LGPL and be happy.
