Not sure if this issue from an earlier discussion was fully resolved or 
not. But I seem to have the same problem as discussed by Markus Mottl 
(see attachment below) on Mac OS X 10.2.4 on a dual processor G4 
machine. An earlier message in that thread mentioned that there was no 
such problem on dual-processor Linux machines.

I have two questions:

1. Has anybody else figured out how to get parallelism using native 
threads on Mac OS X?

2. Will I get the parallelism if I switch to LinuxPPC?

Thanks,

PS: Does ocaml work properly on LinuxPPC?
