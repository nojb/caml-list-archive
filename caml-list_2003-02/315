The kind of licence Boost uses is one I like, BUT it would
be tricky to derive an extension to the OCaml std lib with
that licence since it is LGPL.

I doubt that Boost library *contents* are entirely appropriate
for Ocaml though: stuff like Lambda etc are template hackery
designed to emulate lower order facilities which are primitive
to Ocaml: "we already got that in the core language".

OTOH it might be useful to USE some of the code, for example
the RE stuff is better than PCRE: its reentrant, will almost
certainly be ISO Standardised, pay more attention to I189 issues,
and there are no licence problems :-)
