Mmm, do you have any idea of the feature set included in 3.07 ? Are they
mostly all already in the CVS version, and will there be things which
may break with regard to 3.06 or incompatible changes. I would hope that
the next debian version ships with 3.07, but this may be too just if
3.07 is released in early july. But then, debian releases are never a
fixed things, and even 3.08 may come out being in time for it.

BTW, What do you think about changing ocamlrun to be ocamlrun-<version>,
so that when we upgrade from one version to the next, bytecode
executables built for the previous version will not try running with the
new version, which is not guaranteed to work. But if we embed the
version number in the ocamlrun name, then we can just keep the old
ocamlrun and its libraries around, and still run older bytecode
packages.
