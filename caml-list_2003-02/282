Notice, that if we want the stuff to be includable in the standard
library some time from now, we should maybe track the individual
submissions and see if they agree to it being able to be lincensed under
another licence. I think ocaml is also provided under a proprietary
licence to the ocaml consortium people, so they would need to be able to
do that with the code they integrate also, or they may not be willing to
integrate it. 

This is a point where it would be nice to have feedback from the ocaml
team about it, but maybe re-using the LGPL + exception of the ocaml
runtime and then adding a further paragraph or such saying that if part
of the library is in the future integrated in the ocaml package, it is
ok to relicence it, as long as it stays within the ocaml package. It
needs clearer wording though.
