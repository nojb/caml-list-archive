BTW, i have much been thinking of generating a version of knoppix
(single CD debian distros, which boots directly from the CD), which
would include advi and all other parts needed for it to run, and maybe
have a script that would generate a CD image including your
presentation.

Such a CD should boot on every hardware out there without much problems,
so you would just need to go to your conference insert the CD and reboot
the box.

As for other stuff, well, you could just use debian and use our packages
which solve most of the dependency issues, with more to come in my next
upload of the ocaml_packaging_policy. I think you could also use the
mingw cross compiler or something such to automatically build win32
packages out of the debian packages, but i didn't look much into this.

Friendly,
