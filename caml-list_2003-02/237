    Camlp4 does provide a conditional compilation facility, and more
    generally some preprocessing ability. I find it very useful (and
    hope that Camlp4 will continue to evolve, perhaps even by being
    more tightly integrated into the compiler. Actually, I would like
    it to become the standard OCaml parser).
