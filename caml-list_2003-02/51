What are the technical reasons why it is better to develop it
outside OCaml that inside?

You already raised this problem in the past and it is pretty clear
that most users wanted to see it shipped with OCaml because they
think you can't separate them.
How about leaving political reasons aside and pleasing users
with living with the current situation?
Users don't have to be witnesses of your personal problems, IMHO.

Cheers,
