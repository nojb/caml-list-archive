It would also improve the accuracy of the statement if the phrase "and 
don't give anything back" were elided.  Apple has released the source 
code for the Darwin OS, i.e. the BSD kernel and userland applications 
ported to Apple's not-quite-a-microkernel-anymore variant of the Mach 
microkernel that serves as a foundation for Mac OS X.  There are Darwin 
OS developers who are not Apple employees.  They have their own 
agendas, and they consider their interests served by cooperating with 
Apple in the development of the core of Mac OS X.

The primary difference between the BSD License and the current Apple 
Public Source License is that the latter sports a layer of legal armor 
designed to ward off frivolous IP lawsuits against a publicly traded 
corporation with billions of dollars in liquid cash assets.
