Configure thinks your machine is big-endian?  What exactly do you have 
Cygwin installed on? :)  PCs are little endian.

(This is where my configure output begins to differ from yours.  Perhaps 
you could look into the big endian/little endian test that configure is 
performing to see why it is getting so confused.)
