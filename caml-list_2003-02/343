Dear Sven,
     actually, in the latest version of DemoLinux (a Live CD pretty
older than Knoppix, distribution-independent, even if now based on
Debian) distributed with the CD of free software from
Inria, there is advi, whyzzitex and ocaml preinstalled and
you are pretty welcome to download it from www.demolinux.org
(I had to edit a bit your packages to make it suitable for the Debian
installed in DemoLinux, but it was rather easy work...)

Now, it is a long time since DemoLinux did not go through a major upgrade,
partly because I still dream of rewriting all the configuration/detection/
installation stuff in Ocaml, but I did not convince myself to really start
the real work... But if some people is interested ... :-)

--Roberto
