I am afraid I am not familiar with the whole SML/NJ library (rather
than SML Basis Library which is quite sparse), the only thing I can
truly say is that :

- SML/NJ library already copies in some points Caml standard library :

e.g. The pretty printing (smlnj-lib/PP) is a port of Pierre Weis one

- SML/NJ library may not be the best library to copy since :

smlnj-lib/Regexp is not superior to March=E9's Regexp (classical RE lib,
compiled to dfa or directly interpreted), Vouillon's LibRE (lazy
automata building), or to Galax (Glushkov construction)
(I have not yet seen Leroy's Str new implementation)

smlnj-lib/Util is not really superior to the data structures already
avaible in Caml (standard library, JCF's Patricia trees, ...)

smlnj-lib/HashCons is mostly equivalent to JCF ones (I remember having
read somewhere that JCF actually used some tricks found in the SML/NJ
library)

smlnj-lib/Doc is not superior to OCamlDoc

Concerning SML-Basis, if a common naming for all SML libraries was a
good idea, I am afraid SML-Basis is really not enough, just providing
some quite trivial minimal interfaces. And I do not really feel that
SML-Basis has done, even for the few functions it provides, the 'best'
choices avaible.

I agree that looking in other libraries for ideas is a good thing,
but this seems to have already be done concerning SML libraries.
