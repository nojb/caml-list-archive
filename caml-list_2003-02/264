This is by far the best idea.  This means we don't have to relicense the 
software to move it between the user library and the standard library.  
Relicensing is a bitch, to put it simply.  If the two licenses are 
congruent from day one, no relicensing is needed (and moving code is loads 
easier).

This argument would have convinced me to use a different license thant he 
LGPL.
