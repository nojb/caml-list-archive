I think it is the first time I've seen a post completely
anonymous in this list :) What are you afraid of ?

So, why do you restart it ?

I agree with you. GPL code has a goal which does not always meet the
needs of business companies. And so what ? Why should somebody provide
free code to your company, and receive nothing from you ? GPL is just
an exchange: I give you my code, but you have to give your code to me
too. Nothing prevents a company from rewritting everything to get rid
of the licences (and that's what they do). That's also the reason why
you are paid for coding, and not most GPL code writters.

I love using GPL code at home, when I need to write a small useful
tool. At work, I cannot use it, I rewrite what I need. But I'm paid
for it. And if my company does not want to waste money for me to
rewrite existing code, they can simply release the code as GPL. That's
the way it works.

You know good guys at Sun and IBM ?

That's just my opinion too, and in no way should be understood as the
official opinion of my company.
