The problem with that is that anyone can take your work, modify it, and
don't give anything back, look at apple for example, they took the BSD
kernel, and don't give anything back. I think licencing is the main
reason they choose a BSD kernel over a linux one back then. I suppose
some people (including me) would not be willing to contribute code under
these circunstances, so i don't think it would be best for the project,
since the aim is to put in common the code.

Also, the main argument, is that it gains you nothing more, since you
have to link with the ocaml runtime anyway, which is licenced as LGPL +
exception.
