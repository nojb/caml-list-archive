I strongly agree on this point too. 

As far as I'm concerned, I (try to) carefully package my libraries and
applications  so that  they  compile with  "./configure  && make"  and
install  with  "make  install".  (Libraries  are  installed  in  ocaml
standard  library  place, which  is  determined  automatically by  the
configure script; presence of a  native code compiler is also detected
automatically; etc.)

OcamlMakefile or findlib are surely great tools, but I can't see why I
should use them to contribute to a COAN.

I find the concept of a COAN really nice, by the way; I think Jacques'
idea  of a  central repository  with  meta informations  is the  right
compromise  between  the  current  situation  (humps)  and  the  heavy
solution of a centralized sources repository.
