Indeed, something not too far away from what you want exists today in the 
compiler; look into /utils/clflags.ml: 
 
let dont_write_files = ref false        (* set to true under ocamldoc *) 
 
This flag is used for avoiding the production of a cmi file (look 
at file typing/typemod.ml: 
 
      if not !Clflags.dont_write_files then 
        Env.save_signature sg modulename (prefixname ^ ".cmi"); 
 
when the module is used in conjunction with ocamldoc. 
 
My guess: 
 
It should be enough to 
-make this flag "accessible" by a compiler switch, and 
-to add a similar test in 2 or 3 places, for avoiding any file production 
by the compiler. 
 
I argue also in favor of such an enhancement.
