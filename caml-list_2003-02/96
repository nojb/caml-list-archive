Somewhere deep in the Cash (http://pauillac.inria.fr/cash/) documentation,
there's an 
   Oops: the SRFI-13 librar[y is] not implemented for now
This line is (nearly) obsolete.  As this library is of general interest, I
distribute it separately.  So:

I'm pleased to announce the first release of Cstr (numbered 0.80), a
full-featured string and charset library.  It is a Caml implementation of
SRFIs 13 and 14 (http://srfi.schemers.org).

Short description:
 This library contains procedures that create, fold, iterate over, search,
 compare, assemble, cut, hash, case-map, and otherwise manipulate
 strings.  They are provided by the String13 module.
 It also provides a set-of-characters abstraction, which is frequently
 useful when searching, parsing, filtering or otherwise operating on strings
 and character data.  This is provided by the Charset14 module.

The documentation is incomplete; only the String13 module has documentation.
While waiting for some time to do it, I put an srfi-14.txt file in the
sources, containing the starting spec of Charset14 (srfi-13.txt is there
too).

Bug reports, comments, doc typos, and contributions are very welcome:
drop me a mail at Bruno.Verlyck@inria.fr.

I hope this will answer to some recurring requests to have more features in
the standard String module (on which Cstr doesn't depend).

Enjoy,
Bruno.
