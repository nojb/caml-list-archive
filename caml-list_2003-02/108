I don't agree with you: a Matrix module would definitively end
questions and requests on trivial functionality about matrices. This
is a tremendously important goal to achieve, since answering to those
questions is indeed a waste of time for us: there are way more
important things to work on than answering to silly questions and
remarks on the Caml list about matrices (including induced remarks
about what is (or is not) an important thing to work on).
