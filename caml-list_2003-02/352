Will I need to install wonderful programming langages such as perl or python
on my Windows box ? Without any flames, why are always unix users wants to
make things so complicated ? :)
I will much more prefer something like :

ocaml Makefile.ml

And then the build system will be multiplatform since you're using ocaml...
assuming that're using Unix functions supported on both MacOS & Windows (
theses are documented ) and not calling any command-line function (nor using
paths such as /user/ocaml/and_much_more ).

I think the best is to have such a fully-caml-written tool for both
compilation (ocamake is already doing this, but right now there is no
support for C stubs compilation) and installation which does not rely on
OS-specific problems such as path organisation and so on... Such problems
could be handled in the "install" tool configuration file.
