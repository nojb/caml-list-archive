    Hi Brian (and list),

    I mentioned earlier on the list that I'd get a Sourceforge account.
I've already done this.  I wasn't very creative with the name, so it
is simply (and perhaps, unfortunately) called ocaml-lib.sourceforge.net.

    I've got two a conference deadlines on Wednesday, so that's why
I've been quiet on the list, but if all willing volunteers get
sourceforge announts, I'll figure out how to allow them to do
CVS checkout/checkins.

    I took a few mintues to get the extlib from the CDK and make
a couple additions, but I haven't submitted this to the CVS yet.
(Maxence - were you suggesting that we should maintain the whole
CDK there, or just the extlib?)

    The license is LGPL, but I am convinced by Sven's comments,
and I think LGPL + OCaml runtime extensions is probably best (if the
goal is to eventually convince the core team to include it with
the distribution).  Should I try to contact the sourceforge people
to ask for a change before any work is done?

    -Amit
