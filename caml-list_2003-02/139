That can't be, you upgraded to either woody or testing. unstable has
3.06, and the only reason it hasn't entered testing yet, is because it
was built with glibc 2.3.1, which is not (yet) ready for testing.

Stefano announced woody backport of the debian/unstable packages on this
list on September 22. These should work for either testing or woody. here
is the apt source he posted :

deb http://people.debian.org/~zack/ocaml unstable main contrib non-free

Just add it to your /etc/apt/sources.list before the standard sources,
and you should get all the ocaml 3.06 stuff.

I don't really know if a similar potato backport would be possible, it
would be a pain to maintain, and potato is really old as you may have
noticed, but i think maybe Georges Mariano did something such. If in
doubt, you can always try building the debian packages yourself, apt-get
source -b should allow you to do that.

Finally, you can try installing unstable stuff on a woody/testing box
with :

apt-get install -t unstable ocaml

but i guess this will pull in the new libc and tons of other stuff.

In conclusion, if you really run woody or testing, use Stefano's
backports, if you run potato, upgrade to woody, if you run unstable,
something is really wrong, since you should have the latest packages.

Yes, this is a bit of a problem, i think.

Not sure, but it is always possible to run ocamlrun on it yourself.
