Subject: [Caml-list] [OT]: Looking for german Ocaml-users => user meeting

Hello,

to all german speaking ocaml-users I want to ask,
if it will be possible to get in contact, and maybe do a meeting.

We may learning from each other Ocaml-stuff, changing
experience in programming and working-/research-area, talking
about using Ocaml in real-world applications and
maybe drinking some coffe, beer or wine (and eating pizza :)).

All Ocaml-users in germany (or more general: the german-speaking
area) are invited to mail me, and we can look, if it is possible
to initiate a german-speaking Ocaml-party-weekend,
maybe in Berlin or any other country.

Ciao,
    Oliver
