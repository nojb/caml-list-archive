Mmm, if i am not wrong, camlp4 was developped separatedly, but had a
dependency on the ocaml source to build. I don't personally use camlp4,
but i feel that build depending on the ocaml sources is a nightmare for
package maintainers like me. So my personal preference on this would be
to keep it in the ocaml package, or remove it but in a way that imposes
no build dependencies on the ocaml source. That said, it is a long time
ago, and i was not the camlp4 maintainer, so i may be wrong in
remembering that.

Anyway, would you care to give a bit more details about the practical
results of the separation ? What about the streams ?

Is it really not possible to resolv your political differences (with
political, i guess you mean caml politics, not the other ones :)).
