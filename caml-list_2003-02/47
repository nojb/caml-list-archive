Is it not possible to have it both way ? Have camlp4 stay in ocaml as
usual, and have a second camlp4 which could be used as a drop-in
replacement, which Daniel could make evolve more accordying to his
wishes, and were parts can be folded back into the ocaml camlp4 version
as they mature, prove themselves, whatever. This would met both yours
and Daniel's wish, and also be a good thing for the users who could
choose between both version for their own code. This kind of dual
developpment track has already shown it works for other project, as for
example the XFree86/DRI dual developpment trees, and there is no reason
it would not work for ocaml also. Sure it would mean a bit of
fragmentation, but i guess most code that needs to get shared does not
use camlp4 anyway, or at least could be coded in a compatible way.
