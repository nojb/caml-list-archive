Well, I think that choosing the way where ddr will stop working on
camlp4 (thus keeping camlp4 in its current state instead of allowing it
to progress [which is the real interest in the field of software
enginnering research]) is also a step backwards.

I don't think that it is a too huge price to pay if the "freedom" of ddr
is the price of the camlp4's progress... In those days, I have to manage
approximatively more than 600 pieces of software to keep my computer
doing what I want

Well, not really but it doesn't really matter since I'm suspecting that
we are not totally informed (from both "sources" ;-) about all aspects
of the «crisis»... 

(sorry) I can't remember if the following way has been exposed on this
list :

Can we imagine a kind of camlp4 fork ?  That is, ddr freely working on
its own "camlp4+" and the OCaml maintaining the "current" camlp4 inside
the distribution ?  
Daniel, what do you think about this ??


Cheers
