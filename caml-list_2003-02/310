Agreed. But some licenses are better than others... (and some core
libraries could have a dual-license if so needed).

Regarding installation procedures, I wish that ocamlfind (ie findlib)
becomes part of standard Ocaml. Or otherwise, so similar tools.

I also wish that the standard Ocaml distribution provides the ability
to query the actual installation option, in particular: does Ocaml has
been compiled with pthread support (etc..)?

Regards.
