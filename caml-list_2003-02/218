Yes, the ocaml standard library is full (i.e. empty) of a lot of
functions that could be written easily in 1 or 2 lines of ocaml code.

The same functions are the same that you find yourself rewriting in all
the applications you are writing (or linking an "helper" module written
once for all), this is really frustrating and I think make OCaml
standard library less appealing than other languages standard libraries.

I'm collecting from time to time a set of functions that can be easily
added to the standard library to fill this gap. Probably a lot of other
OCaml programmers are doing the same. Is there any chance to see this
functions in the standard library?

Better stated: if we, ocaml programmer, collect a set of functions that
are widely felt to be missing, could the OCaml team review the
corresponding implementation and add them to the ocaml standard library
in the next ocaml release?

Thanks for your attention,
Cheers.
