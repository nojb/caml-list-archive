Thanks to Matt for sharing the code, by the way.

I didn't really read the code, but I noticed the End_of_rows exception
and I'd like to know folks' opinions about it.

I know that's analogous to End_of_file, but since an infinite number
of rows would be a lot more exceptional than a finite number, isn't
this a strange use of exceptions?  I would guess that iteration or
recursion would be more efficient and expressive.
