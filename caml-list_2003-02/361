It is a difficult task. What about doing a survey, something web based
where you can tell about your ocaml usage, and which would generate a
daily statistic page or something such based on that data. We had
something such for calculating usage of linux/m68k back in those days.

The ocaml documentation would strongly suggest that people register
there or something such.

That would miss all the people getting ocaml from other sources, like
distributions, CD included in ocaml books, etc.

As for debian, we have no way to know how many people download our
packages, what with our extensive mirror network. That said, there is
the popularity-contest package, which gathers info on your system's
installed debian packages and send them weekly in addition of helping
detecting unused packages. Result are shown in :

http://people.debian.org/~apenwarr//popcon/

but not everyone takes part of this survey, and it may cause security
concerns for some or something such.

I think not, what about the publication numbers of the ocaml books ?
