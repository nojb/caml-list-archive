Uhm, perhaps I'm not paranoid enough, but whe're just talking about an
extension to the Standard OCaml Library...
The goal here is to provide to every caml developper all the data structures
he will ever want to use - and corresponding algorithms. Who is going to
steal it ? and for what purpose ?

If tomorrow Apple steal it and start developping serious software in OCaml,
I think it would be a good thing for the whole community since you'll be
able to tell your boss that "ocaml is great : Apple is using it" , or to the
guy who's hiring you " i'm writing such good code that Apple itself can't
help stealing it " :)

As a programmer, I'm proud to licence software that I'm developping, but
this is gonna be a big common melt in the first times, I keep my pride away
and give my code for the sake of the community.

You gain a clear license for users not familiar with the LGPL :  I think
that the "GPL" part in "LGPL" can sometimes be mistaken by frilous users.
