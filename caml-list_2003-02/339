Sure, you just need to correctly read the README or INSTALL file, where
it usually is written, together with the build depends.

Well, the debian way is to have the maintainers do a (little) bit more
work, and have everyone else just rely on apt-get. Also, we separate the
configuration, building and installation phases. Also, some parts need a
bit more complicated things, like separating arch-dependent from
arch-independent parts, eventually installing stuff in policy mandated
places and other such.

I think it is not really all that much work, once the
bytecode/nativecode makefile targets are well written and that DESTDIR
is supported.

Again speaks the non-package user. I personally don't care all that
much, as you may guess, and i believe that i could manage to build
packages of ocaml stuff for win32 and macos directly from the debian
packages. What more do you need ? I think there was even a
debian/solaris port some time ago, but i don't know what did become of
it. Anyway, i am running linux on my sparc box.
