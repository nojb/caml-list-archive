Sure, but they don't release low level information on their hardware, in
particular not some stuff needed by the XFree86 developpers, altough
they are happy enough to integrate the XDarwin server in MacOS X.

Anyway, maybe it was not the best idea to take Apple as example, give me
another try. There is log of BSD code in windows NT, and Microsoft sure
didn't give anything back for it, they even tried to hijack the open
standards and such.

But they could have changed that in early 98 when Steve came back to
apple. I am sure one strong argument against it was the licencing.

Speak for yourself, as a debian developper, i have to pay close
attention to licencing issues, and think i know at least something about
it. I am not sure a lawyer not specialized in computer licences would
know more about it than me.

But anyway, this is more a political decision than a legal one, and
again, please let's take this discution to some other place, i will no
more post on this subject here.
