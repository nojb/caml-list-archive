I believe the SAC language

  http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sacbase/

automatically parallelises matrix operations to take
advantage of SMP machines.  I believe this does at
least part of what you're interesting in.

The alternative is to have no synchronisation, wich is
essentially what Erlang does.  Message passing is the
only way threads can communicate, and messages are
asynchronous and lossy.  An Erlang process is purely
functional so there can be no race conditions.
