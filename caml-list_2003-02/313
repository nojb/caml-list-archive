Doh.  Apple has release all their changes to the BSD kernel
under an open source licence.  If the kernel had been under GPL,
that wouldn't have changed much for them.

It was NeXT that chose a BSD kernel.  Darwin is the son of NeXTStep.
Back then, Linux didn't exist, so the choice was not hard to make.

The problem with these license discussions is that nobody knows
what they are talking about.  We're not lawyers after all.
