I think this is true, and was my motivation for "voting" for the SF project 
to be created.  I figured once we got the SF thing going, we could turn it 
into a kinda cheapo version of this.  We mirror a bunch of library code 
from other open source caml projects in the tree, in some pseudo-standard 
layout.  Somebody writes a really simple xml schema describing what's up 
there and the dependencies.  Somebody writes a really simple thing to parse 
that and suck down the latest version (either from cvs or by talking to the 
cvsweb client) from the command line, like apt-get or ActivePerl's ppm, and 
attempt to install it.  It would be lame, but it would work for simple 
stuff.  I think getting something/anything started will be a step in that 
direction.
