Hmmm... well spotted! There is definitely something going badly wrong 
with the configure script. Not sure quite what to do - I manage to get 
an older install of cygwin off another machine and it compiled OK - but 
got an error on first running about "pervasives.mli". 

Not sure what to do next - at the moment, I'm sticking with the native
windows port, but since I don't have VC++ I can't compile optimised
code, which is a pain.

Has anyone else had configure errors under the latest cygwin? Can anyone 
test this?

Thanks!
Simon
