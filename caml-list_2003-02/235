Subject: [Caml-list] Can't do closed-source camlp4 programs, can I?
Message-Id: <20030221204209.C759181A8@lobus.fungible.com>
From: tim@fungible.com (Tim Freeman)

Precedence: bulk

If I'm reading the license right, camlp4 is part of "the Compiler" as
defined in the LICENSE document.  In particular, camlp4/etc/pr_o.ml is
part of "the Compiler".  If I write a nontrivial preprocessor
for OCAML code with camlp4 and I use pr_o.ml, then my executable file
is derived from pr_o.ml and therefore I have to distribute source for
my preprocessor if I distribute the executable.

Is my reasoning valid?

I seem to be working from the November 14 CVS, so I could easily be
wrong if the license or copyright notices have changed since then.
