Hi,

 I got the MLgraph.tar file to obtain plotting/hardcopying capability
in caml-light 0.6. But this file is binary only (.zi and .zo) and was
compiled for version 0.5 for some unix machine. Can I use these binary
files if re-install version 0.5 on my PC386? I tried using them with
0.6 but caml dumped core! I changed all of the font file names (using
names2dos script) so that they are ok for dos. Are the sources to
MLgraph available somewhere? 

Thanks in advance,

Osman
