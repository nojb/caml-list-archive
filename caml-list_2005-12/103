I'm not sure if it's the good place to talk about this, but here's my 
thoughts. If the law proposal was possible to apply, I would be worried. 
The fact that it's simply impossible to apply it in practice make it 
void (which is not "unit" :). Also, it might even be anticonstitutional 
since OS programs are words , just like news articles for instance. I'm 
not a lawyer but I think we shouldn't be worried about this.
