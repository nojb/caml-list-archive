Yes, I looked at it through Dbi[1]. There is however an issue: it seems
that everything is stored as a string in an SQLite base. Returned data
after Dbi query are typed as string.

It might be an issue with Dbi itself (I haven't looked to the SQLite
binding themselves) but after looking at SQLite documentation, it does
not seem to be the case[2].

I could work around this small issue by easily converting strings to
integer, float, etc. but it seems a bit awkward to me. Beside that,
you are right the SQLite is quite interesting: full SQL database but
without the need to setup an SQL server.

Best wishes,
david

      SQLite is "typeless". This means that you can store any kind of
      data you want in any column of any table, regardless of the
      declared datatype of that column.
