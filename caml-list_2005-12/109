If it is, how you write,
then that's a good day for bureaucracy.

Better would be, to register each such registering-operation too. ;-)

That's recursive and self-referential and infinitve,
and so the load will be much higher than to be expected
by the lawyers.

So: it will not be possible to use laws in genreal, even if they are
meant general. But it can be used for certain things (here: THIS or THAT
software (or anything else), at will.

So... is it good to do that? well...

Looks like self-disabling of the lawyers by trying to achieve anything. ;-)

This will not work in general, but can be hinderance to certain projects,
if people insist on this bureaucracy. :(

Ciao,
