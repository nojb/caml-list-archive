You know, I realize things have been tight. But this is a really good
chance to get something of luxurious value at a reasonable price.

When I saw this e-shop, it made me conjure up an image of you.

You seldom order yourself something. You surely deserve one of these

I would be happy to see you showing one off!

Since you've been so considerate to me, I wanted to let you know this
really good deal I discovered on this website.

This is one of my favorite shopping sites. It's safe and convenient.
