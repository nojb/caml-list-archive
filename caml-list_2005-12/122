Does the law for books mean that pamphlets that just contain the
agenda for a conference must be registered?  I leave it as an exercise
to the reader to imagine other types of documents that are provided to
the public but for which it would be silly to register (e.g. bus
schedules, newsletters, take-home restaurant menus, etc.).  I would
hope that there must be some lower bound beyond which books don't need
to be registered.
