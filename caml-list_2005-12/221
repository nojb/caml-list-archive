For my Special  Garek,

You will probably say, "No, I shouldn't." There is no reason to. These
imitations may look like the real thing, but they cost one one hundredth of
the real thing. You work so hard to make the expendable cash to pay the
bills and get ahead, often putting off your own desires. Today is your day
to splurge on yourself. This is  a little surprise.

Make sure while you are at the hosting-site, that you also get the little
box to keep it in. 

You'll love the online-site. They have really good service and really good
monitoring


With my most sincere love, 

Seki
