ICEECS Call for Papers
11th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems
Co-located with Computational Systems Bioinformatics (CSB 2006) 

Sponsored by: 

IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Technical Committee on Complexity in Computing
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Software Engineering Laboratory
Stanford University, CA, USA, 10-14 August 2006.

With the ever expanding range of computing platforms and applications, system 
complexity is on the rise. Increasing intelligence and autonomics in today’s 
systems requires innovative approaches to address these concomitant complexity 
issues. At this cross-section of volume and complexity, current technologies are
 often ineffective at coping with the demands for quality computer systems. 
Manifold dependencies between the critical software, hardware, communications, 
and human elements now drive computer system and software architectures. 
Complexity of software systems has grown significantly, pervading several key 
application areas including Manufacturing, Communications, Transportation, 
Internet, Entertainment, Mobile, Healthcare, Aerospace, and Energy. 
These systems are frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks, involving
Internet technologies. Inundated by temporal constraints, boundless functionalities, 
complex algorithms, distributed and mobile architectures, security constraints,
reliability, high performance, interoperability, security, and the like, these 
complexities are further weighing down development and  evolution of today’s 
software systems and ultimately the organizations they serve.

The goal of this conference is to assemble industrial, academic and government 
experts, from a variety of user domains and software disciplines, to examine key 
complexity problems and effective solutions. Researchers, practitioners, tool 
developers and users, and technology transition experts are all welcome. 
The scope of the interest includes long-term research, near-term complex system
requirements and promising tools, existing systems, and commercially available tools.

Topic Areas: 

Papers are solicited in all areas related to complex computer-based systems,
 including the causes of complexity and means of avoiding, controlling, or coping with 
complexity. Topic areas include, but are not limited to:
-System and software architecture and system engineering 
-Tools, environments, and languages for complex systems 
-Formal methods and approaches to manage and control complex systems 
-Integration of heterogeneous technologies 
-Software and system development and control processes for complex systems 
-Human factors and collaborative aspects 
-Interoperability and standardization 
-Systems and software safety and security 
-Industrial automation, embedded and/or real time systems 
-Content production and distribution systems, mobile and multi-channel systems 
-Software complexity visualization 
-Virtual environments for managing complexity 

Paper Submissions: 

Research papers, case studies, lessons learned, status reports,
 and discussions of practical problems faced by industry and user domains are all 
welcome submissions. 
For review, submissions are divided into two categories: Technical Papers 
and Experience Reports. 
Submitted papers should be formatted in the style of IEEE-Computer Society Format: http://www.computer.org/cspress/instruct.htm. 
Submitted manuscripts must be in English and should be no longer than 4000 words 
or 10 formatted pages. 
Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign a copyright release form. 
IEEE Computer Society Press will publish the proceedings. 
Submission Procedure: Please email your manuscripts in PDF format to the 
program chairs listed above. 

Panels and Special Sections: 

Proposals (1 page) for organizing panels and special 
sections should be sent to the general and program chairs via email. In both cases, 
the list of confirmed people involved should be included.
