The second public release of the LablPCRE OCaml binding for PCRE is 
now available, featuring a new "module" interface with expanded 
functionality and supporting PCRE releases 6.1 - 6.4 (current).

LablPCRE still provides simple and easy to use access to regular 
expression pattern matching - while a richer module-based interface is 
now standard, the original "object" interface is available for those 
who prefer that style.

While I have been pleased to incorporate feedback on the interface 
layout, I am still very interested in expanding the platforms 
supported "natively" in the Makefile, and welcome any contributions, 
patches, or suggestions in this area... not only will these help 
LablPCRE advance to "1.0" status, they will greatly facilitate the 
release (and usefulness) of other projects to the OCaml community.

With a distribution incorporating pre-built Windows binaries, LablPCRE 
is released under the "new" BSD license, and may be downloaded here:
