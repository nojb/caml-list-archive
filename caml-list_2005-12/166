This is more or less the message I sent out in October, but I wanted to
make a few clarifications based on inquiries I received. First, I wanted
to make it clear that there are both internship and full-time positions
in the offing.  Another important thing to note is that we can't
practically hire summer interns who do not already have the right to
work in the US.  We also now have a page discussing OCaml-related job
opportunities at Jane Street:

   http://www.janestcapital.com/ocaml.html

Here's the actual announcement.  As usual, please feel free to forward
it on to students or others who would be interested.

-----------------------------

Jane Street Capital (http://janestcapital.com) is a proprietary
trading company located in Manhattan.  We're looking to hire people for
full time positions as well as summer internships for 2006.

Jane Street is an open and informal environment (you can wear shorts
and a t-shirt to the office), and the work is technically challenging,
including systems programming, machine learning, statistical analysis,
parallel processing, and anything that crosses our path that looks
useful.  One unusual attraction of the job is that the large majority of
our programming is done in OCaml.  Here's what we're looking for from
candidates:

 - A commitment to the practical. Both development and research are
  tightly integrated with our trading operation, and we work very
  hard to keep our work relevant. One of the big attractions of the
  job is the opportunity to apply serious ideas to real-world
  problems.

 - Great communication skills. We need people who can explain
  things clearly and cogently, who can read dense academic papers
  and write clear documentation.

 - Strong programming skills.  Most of our programming is
  in OCaml, so being a solid Caml hacker is a big plus.  Extra points
  for deep knowledge of OCaml internals and experience wrapping
  thorny libraries.  But we're also interested in great programmers
  who we are convinced will be able to pick up OCaml quickly, so
  anyone with high-level of proficiency with functional languages
  would be a good match.

 - Top-notch mathematical and analytic skills.  We want people who
  can solve difficult technical problems, and think clearly and
  mathematically about all sorts of problems.

 - Strong Unix/Linux skills --- We're looking for someone who knows
  their way around the standard Unix tools, can write makefiles,
  shell scripts, etc.  We're also very interested in people with
  serious systems administration and architecture experience.

For those interested in summer internships, interns are paid quite well,
and we can help out with housing costs if you don't live nearby. If
you're interested in either the internships or the full-time positions,
please send a cover-letter and resume to:

 yminsky@janestcapital.com

Note that we can't hire people for internships that don't already have
the right to work in the US.
