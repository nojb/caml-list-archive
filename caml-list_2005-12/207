Hi, Jonathan

  We are looking for a tiered model now, because we
are using a Client-Server architecture. However, in
future, we will try a cluster-based solution. Is there
any extension\library that works in both settings with
minimum changes? In case of separated solutions, what
are the possible options for each setting?

  Cheers,
  Alex
