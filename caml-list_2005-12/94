Dear Alain,

Both of your suggestions are valid of course, and that may be the future 
direction that I will take (see message 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners/message/5127).
The fact is that none of the one-file syntax extensions that I am aware of 
are in GODI at the moment, including one of yours :-) (pa_openin)

I definitely don't have time to manage these syntax extensions as GODI 
packages manually, let's be realistic. So an option would be to create 
GODI packages automatically, but:
- mega-packages don't work well (see CDK), so I don't think a 
godi-p4ck-all could exist unless it is a virtual package which points to 
godi-p4ck-*
- there is no version number in the syntax extensions, and the authors 
don't bother to create one. I don't want to deal with this.
- the files can fail to download|compile|install, I don't care because 
users can fix the database without me, so I take a vacation and 
still sleep well.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Martin
