the linux manpage for waitpid has this:

ERRORS
       ECHILD if the process specified in pid does not exist or is not a
child of the calling process.  (This can
              happen  for  one’s  own child if the action for SIGCHLD is
set to SIG_IGN. See also the LINUX NOTES
              section about threads.)

This begs the question: did you setup the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_IGN ? or
are you using threads ?

No, the process should stay as a zombie (unless you've set a signal
handler for SIGCHLD I guess)
