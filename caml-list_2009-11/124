                            DisCoTec 2010

              5th International Federated Conferences on 
                   Distributed Computing Techniques

                  Amsterdam, Netherlands, 7-9 June 2010

                       Call for Workshop Proposals


A workshop is intended to provide a forum for members of a focused research 
community to present preliminary research results and discuss position-style
papers. Workshops are alternative forums for presenting full research 
papers. As such, organizers are encouraged to adopt an format that fosters 
interaction and discussion, devoting less focus to individual, formal 
presentations.

DisCoTec 2010 invites proposals for one day workshops to be held in 
conjunction with the main events. Prospective workshop organizers are 
requested to follow the guidelines below and are encouraged to contact the 
workshop chair should any questions arise.


Important Dates

   Workshop proposal deadline: December 17, 2009
   Workshop proposal notification: December 23, 2009
   Workshop: June 10, 2010

Submission and notification deadlines of the workshops are at the discretion 
of the individual workshop organizers, however notification must be no later 
than the early registration deadline for the main conference.


Proposal Submission Guidelines

Workshop proposals must be written in English, not exceed 5 pages with a 
reasonable font and margin, and be submitted in PDF format via email to 
Marcello Bonsangue (marcello@liacs.nl).

Proposals should include the following information:

    * The title, theme, and goals of the workshop.
    * The targeted audience and the expected minimum and maximum number of 
      participants. We prefer that workshops remain open to participation 
      from any members of the community, but by-invitation-only workshops 
      will also be considered. Please explicitly state your preference.
    * The publicity strategy that will be used by the workshop organizers 
      to promote the workshop.
    * The participant solicitation and selection process.
    * Publication plan. Each workshop is responsible for managing its own 
      publication (e.g., pre- or post- proceedings), if any is desired.
    * Approximate budget proposal (see section Budget below for details).
    * A preliminary version of the call for papers. This CFP must include 
      important dates including submission, notification, and camera-ready 
      deadlines.
    * The equipment and any other resource necessary for the organization 
      of the workshop.
    * A brief description of the organizer's background, including relevant 
      past experience on organizing workshops and contact information. 

Review Process

Workshop proposals will be reviewed by the following committee:

    * Frank S. de Boer, CWI, NL (DiScoTec 2010 General Chair)
    * Marcello M. Bonsangue, University of Leiden, NL (Workshops Chair)
    * Immo Grabe, CWI, NL 
    * Stephanie Kemper, CWI, NL 
    * Alexandra Silva, CWI, NL 

Acceptance is based on an  evaluation of the workshop's potential for 
generating useful results, the timeliness and expected interest in the 
topic, the organizer's ability to lead a successful workshop, and 
potential for attracting sufficient number of participants.

Workshop Publicity

Workshop publicity is responsability of the organizers. In particular they 
are responsible for the following items:

   1. A workshop description (200 words) for inclusion on the DisCoTec site.
   2. Hosting and maintaining web pages to be linked from the DisCoTec site. 
      Workshop coordinators can integrate their pages into the wiki-page of
      DisCoTec 2010.
   3. Workshop proceedings, if any. If there is enough interest, the 
      organizer of DiScoTec 2010 may contact Elevier for having a common 
      volume of the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science 
      (http://info.eptcs.org/) dedicated to the workshops of DiScoTec 2010.
   4. Publicising the event. 

Budget

DisCoTec will provide registration and organizational support for the 
workshops. Registration fees must be paid for all participants, including 
organizers and invited guests.

To cover lunches, coffee breaks and basic organizational expenses, all 
workshops will be required to charge a minimum participation fee (the 
precise amount is still to be determined). Each workshop may increase this 
fee to cover additional expenses such as publication charges, student 
scholarships, registration for invited speakers, etc. All fees will be 
collected by the DisCoTec organizers as part of the registration, then 
additional funds will be redistributed to the individual workshop 
organizers.
