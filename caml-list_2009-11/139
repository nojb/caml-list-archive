            Second Workshop on Generative Technologies
                            WGT 2010

                     http://wgt2010.elte.hu/

                    a satellite event of the
               13th European Joint Conferences on
                 Theory and Practice of Software
                          (ETAPS 2010)

IMPORTANT DATES

- Submission of full paper: November 30, 2009
- Submission of tool demo paper: November 30, 2009
- Author notification: January 11, 2010
- Final version due: January 25, 2010

****************************************************************

SCOPE

Generative programming is an emerging paradigm aimed
at automating important tasks in software development,
compile-time and run-time code transformation, and the creation of
domain-specific languages and flexible libraries. The purpose of the
workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners working in
this area to discuss
state-of-the-art generative technologies and tools, and
exchange ideas about the future of generative programming.
Papers describing practical applications of generative styles,
and new research directions are expected. Suggested areas of
interest in the workshop include, but are not limited to:

- Generative programming, metaprogramming
- Separation of concerns
- Intentional programming
- Domain engineering and domain analysis
- Product-line architectures
- Feature-based techniques
- Compile-time and run-time code transformation
- Multi-stage languages
- Generic and Active library-development
- Analysis of language support for generative programming
- Semantics, type-systems of generative programs
- Case Studies and Demonstration Cases

****************************************************************

PAPER SUBMISSION

RESEARCH PAPERS  (full papers, 8-10 pages) as well as TOOL DEMO PAPERS (up
to 2 pages) should be submitted to the WGT 2010 organizers in ENTCS format=
=20
(http://www.entcs.org). Submissions should be sent by e-mail to=20
wgt@aszt.inf.elte.hu.

Accepted workshop papers are published in the local proceedings. After=20
the workshop the participants are invited for submission to journal ENTCS=
=20
(only research papers). The workshop organizers have intention to set the=
=20
deadline of this second submission being later then the notification on=20
GPCE papers. Hence authors have opportunity to send their paper to GPCE=20
and if rejected, send to ENTCS without violating usual resubmission policy.

Further information will be available at the WGT 2010 home page.
At least one author of each accepted submission must register
and present the paper at the workshop.

****************************************************************

PROCEEDINGS

After revision, final copies of the accepted papers will be
published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science
(ENTCS), Elsevier Science (http://www.entcs.org).
