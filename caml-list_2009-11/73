Dear all,

I've been learning OCaml, coming from a Haskell background. While I'm
familiar with functional programming, I am occasionally puzzled by
errors relating to the module system. I was wondering if there was a
comprehensive overview/tutorial of OCaml's module system. I couldn't
find anything on the OCaml Hump - but perhaps someone on this list
might know a good reference.

Thanks in advance,

  Wouter
