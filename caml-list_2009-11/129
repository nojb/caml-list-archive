      CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                           ICFP 2010
 15th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                    September 27 - 29, 2010
                      Baltimore, Maryland
             http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2010

The 15th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Baltimore, Maryland on September 27-29,
2010.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2010 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be more informal and focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and be fairly low-cost.  The preference is for one-day events, but
other schedules can also be considered.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission details
 Deadline for submission:     November 20, 2009
 Notification of acceptance:  December 18, 2009

Prospective organizers of workshops or other co-located events are
invited to submit a completed workshop proposal form in plain text
format to the ICFP 2010 workshop co-chairs (Derek Dreyer and Chris
Stone), via email to icfp10-workshops at mpi-sws.org by November 20,
2009.  (For proposals of co-located events other than workshops,
please fill in the workshop proposal form and just leave blank any
sections that do not apply.)  Please note that this is a firm
deadline.

Organizers will be notified if their event proposal is accepted by
December 18, 2009, and if successful, depending on the event, they
will be asked to produce a final report after the event has taken
place that is suitable for publication in SIGPLAN Notices.

The proposal form is available at:

http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2010/icfp10-workshops-form.txt

Further information about SIGPLAN sponsorship is available at:

following members of the ICFP 2010 organizing committee, together with
the members of the SIGPLAN executive committee.

 Workshop Co-Chair: Derek Dreyer (MPI-SWS)
 Workshop Co-Chair: Chris Stone (Harvey Mudd College)
 General Chair:     Paul Hudak (Yale University)
