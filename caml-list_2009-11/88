~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submission:            2 April 2010
Author response:  24 -- 25 May 2010
Notification:	        7 June 2010
Final papers due:      12 July 2010

Scope
~~~~~

ICFP 2010 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional
programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to
practice, from foundations to features, from abstraction to
application. The scope includes all languages that encourage
functional programming, including both purely applicative and
imperative languages, as well as languages with objects or
concurrency. Particular topics of interest include

* Language Design: type systems; concurrency and distribution;
  modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; relations to
  object-oriented or logic programming; interoperability

* Implementation: abstract machines; compilation; compile-time and
  run-time optimization; memory management; multi-threading;
  exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions,
  services, components or low-level machine resources

* Software-Development Techniques: algorithms and data structures;
  design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof
  assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling

* Foundations: formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type
  theory; monads; continuations; control; state; effects

* Transformation and Analysis: abstract interpretation; partial
  evaluation; program transformation; program calculation; program
  proof

* Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: symbolic computing;
  formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming;
  distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases;
  XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user
  interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system
  administration; security; education

* Functional Pearls: elegant, instructive, and fun essays on
  functional programming The conference also solicits Experience
  Reports, which are short papers that provide evidence that
  functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have
  kept it from working in a particular application.

Abbreviated instructions for authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By 2 April 2010, 14:00 UTC, submit an abstract of at most 300 words
and a full paper of at most 12 pages (6 pages for an Experience
Report), including bibliography and figures. The deadline will be
strictly enforced and papers exceeding the page limits will be
summarily rejected.  Authors have the option to attach supplementary
material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may
choose not to look at it.

A submission will be evaluated according to its relevance,
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. It should explain
its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly
identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work. The technical
content should be accessible to a broad audience. Functional Pearls
and Experience Reports are separate categories of papers that need not
report original research results and must be marked as such at the
time of submission. Detailed guidelines on both categories are on the
conference web site.

Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as
explained on the web at http://www.acm.org/sigplan/republicationpolicy.htm.

Proceedings will be published by ACM Press. Authors of accepted
submissions are expected to transfer the copyright to the
ACM. Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the
presenter consents by signing an additional permission form at the
time of the presentation.  Formatting: Submissions must be in PDF
format printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper and
interpretable by Ghostscript. If this requirement is a hardship, make
contact with the program chair at least one week before the
deadline. Papers must adhere to the standard ACM conference format:
two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline, with columns
20pc (3.33in) wide and 54pc (9in) tall, with a column gutter of 2pc
(0.33in). A suitable document template for LATEX is available from
SIGPLAN at http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm.

Submission: Submissions will be accepted electronically at a URL to be
named later. Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any
point before the submission deadline using the same web interface.

Author response: Authors will have a 48-hour period, starting at 14:00
UTC on 24 May 2010, to read and respond to reviews.

Special Journal Issue: There will be a special issue of the Journal of
Functional Programming with papers from ICFP 2010. The program
committee will invite the authors of select accepted papers to submit
a journal version to this issue.
