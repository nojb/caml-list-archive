Hi list,

A first testing version of Ocamlnet 3 has been released:
Ocamlnet-3.0test1 (download:
http://download.camlcity.org/download/ocamlnet-3.0test1.tar.gz)

The idea of this release is to make this version available to a larger
audience for testing, and to allow everybody to check whether code using
this library still works. It is not yet ready for production
environments.

List of major changes:

      * Port to Win32 (as outlined in the blog article
        http://blog.camlcity.org/blog/ocamlnet3_win32.html)
      * The new Rpc_proxy layer (as described in
        http://blog.camlcity.org/blog/ocamlnet3_ha.html)
      * Extensions of Netplex 
      * New implementation of the Shell library for starting
        subprocesses 
      * Uniform debugging with Netlog.Debug 
      * Exception printers (Netexn) 
      * Introduction of pollsets (Netsys_pollset); removal of
        Unix.select (i.e. more than 1024 file descriptors) 
      * The netcgi1 library has been dropped in favor of netcgi2

There are also a lot of minor changes. Some of the changes are
incompatible with code written for Ocamlnet 2.

Testers are especially encouraged to check whether Ocamlnet 3 still
works on all platforms, because a lot of new platform-specific code has
been added. I mainly tested with Linux and the MinGW port for Win32.

The library is not yet available via GODI. I'm working on this.

More blog postings will follow describing the highlights.
