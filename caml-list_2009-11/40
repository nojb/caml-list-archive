We are pleased to announce the open-sourcing of the XAPI toolstack, written=
 in OCaml, as used in the Citrix XenServer product line. The XAPI toolstack=
 is licensed under the LGPL v2.1 with a special static linking exception.

**context**

Xen [1] is an open-source type 1 hypervisor, providing the ability to run m=
ultiple operating systems, called virtual machines, concurrently on a singl=
e physical processor. Type 1 (or native, bare-metal) hypervisors are softwa=
re systems that run directly on host's hardware. They have been very popula=
r architecture since the CP/CMS, developed at IBM in the 1960s. Citrix XenS=
erver [2] is an enterprise-class, cloud-proven server virtualization platfo=
rm that delivers the critical features of live migration and centralized mu=
lti-server management for Xen based virtual machine. XenServer is an open a=
nd powerful server virtualization solution that radically reduces datacente=
r costs by transforming static and complex datacenter environments into mor=
e dynamic, easy to manage IT service delivery centers.

**xapi**

The xapi toolstack, which provides the core Citrix Xenserver's functionalit=
ies, is a set of libraries and programs written in OCaml. It is approximate=
ly 200k lines of code developed from early 2006. Within Citrix, more than 4=
0 people have already contributed to its source code.

What the XAPI toolstack has to manage covers a large range, from low-level =
(interface with kernel and hypervisor) to high-level (distributed data/lock=
ing management). It also need to have good performance because it may be us=
ed in an environment of thousands of virtual machines per cluster and has t=
o be able to run on systems with limited resources (embedded editions of Ci=
trix XenServer are distributed on an USB stick and run in highly customized=
 OS). Finally, as a major enterprise product, the XAPI toolstack evolves co=
nstantly, due to customer/business requests.

The OCaml language has been particularly good so far to help us facing all =
this challenges, and we can't think of a better language to use :-) We real=
ly appreciate that the compiler tools are stable, that the compiled code is=
 fast and small and that static-type inference makes our software robust to=
 changes.

**links**

The released code is the current development version ("trunk") and is under=
 active development. The repositories are here:

http://xenbits.xen.org/xapi/xen-dist-ocaml.hg - scripts and Makefiles to bu=
ild some external library dependencies
http://xenbits.xen.org/xapi/xen-api-libs.hg - internal libraries (e.g. for =
talking to xenstore)
http://xenbits.xen.org/xapi/xen-api.hg - the toolstack itself

The easiest way to build the code is in a specially-prepared VM, instructio=
ns are here:

http://xenbits.xen.org/xapi/install.html

>From now on, all development will take place on the xen-api@lists.xensource=
.com mailing list. In the future we plan to move relevant content such as d=
ocumentation, designs, roadmaps etc. onto the main xen.org wiki.

Comments, criticism and contributions are welcome!
