In the sense that, since Linux expands the stack as needed, one needn't =
worry about a program which uses x Mb of stack being any more likely to =
'crash' than one which uses x Mb of heap.

So, the total usage of a program (stack + heap) is the only metric =
needed. Unless (as you say) performance is to be considered.
