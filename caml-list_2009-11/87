			21st IEEE International Conference on 
		Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors
			     http://asap-conference.org /
				  July 7-9, 2010, 
			     Rennes, Brittany, France

The conference will cover the theory and practice of application-specific systems, architectures and processors. The 2009 conference will build upon traditional strengths in areas such as arithmetic, cryptography, compression, signal and image processing, application-specific instruction processors, etc. We especially encourage submissions in the following three areas: 

- Bioinformatics and computational biology - life sciences present a host of interesting problems that can benefit from application-specific solutions. 

- Architecturally diverse systems - systems that use varied computing resources such as FPGAs, GPUs, Cell processors, etc.

- Tools and Compilations Methods for Reconfigurable Computing.

The conference venue in 2010 is Rennes, which is a wonderful city to visit in its own right, with many sights worth seeing. This vibrant, thriving city is renowned for its cultural facilities, and world-class educational institutions.
