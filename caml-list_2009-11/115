             SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

             10th International Conference on
             Mathematics of Program Construction
             MPC 2010

             Québec City, Canada, 21-23 June 2010

             http://mpc-amast2010.fsg.ulaval.ca/

             Colocated with AMAST 2010 (23-26 June 2010)



BACKGROUND

The biennial MPC conferences aim to promote the development of
mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical
and effective in the process of constructing computer programs. Topics
of interest range from algorithmics to support for program
construction in programming languages and systems.

The previous conferences were held in Twente, The Netherlands (1989),
Oxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995), Marstrand, Sweden
(1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl, Germany (2002),
Stirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST '04), Kuressaare, Estonia
(2006, colocated with AMAST '06) and Marseille, France (2008).
The 2010 conference will be held in Lac-Beauport, a suburb of Québec
City, Canada, and will be colocated with AMAST '10 (23-26 June 2010).



INVITED SPEAKERS

Roland Backhouse, University of Nottingham, UK.
Others to be announced later.



IMPORTANT DATES

     * Submission of abstracts: 7 December 2009
     * Submission of full papers: 14 December 2009
     * Notification of authors: 20 February 2010
     * Camera-ready version: 20 March 2010



TOPICS

Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in
program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to
support for program construction in programming languages and
systems. Some typical areas are type systems, program analysis and
transformation, programming-language semantics, security and program
logics. Theoretical contributions are welcome provided their relevance
for program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome
provided their mathematical basis is evident.



SUBMISSION

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines)
must be submitted by 7 December 2009. Full papers (pdf) adhering to
the LaTeX llncs style must be submitted by 14 December 2009. There
is no official page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.
The web-based system EasyChair will be used for submission
(https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=mpc2010).

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. In
particular, they must not be submitted to AMAST 2010. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.

The proceedings of MPC'10 will be published in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series of Springer-Verlag.

After the conference, the authors of the best papers will be invited
to submit revised versions to a special issue of the Science of
Computer Programming journal of Elsevier.
