Maybe you can have a look at 
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/docman/view.php/77/34/VSYML-ocaml-meeting-2009.pdf

This is the slide of last year OCaml Meeting talk about VHDL simulation,
using OCaml. Maybe Florent Ouchet, the author, can give you more hint.

(I think VSYML is doing thing at symbolic level, so maybe it is the kind
of simulation you are looking for).

Maybe "OCaml for Scientist" from Jon Harrop can be a good start. There
some examples at the end that can help you (with code).
