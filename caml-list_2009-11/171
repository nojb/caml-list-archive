 On an Intel macintosh, you can get the list of exceptions leading to the=
 stack overflow from OCaml, and work through them to find the source of t=
he problem.

Yes, you can always use heap instead of stack, but stack allocation and
deallocation is faster (but sometimes hard to tell
how mush stack space a call cost, and some call can keep useless
pointers accessible if you are not carefull,
although quite rare in OCaml).

I do not understand what you mean ? stack size + heap size =3D maximum of=

available memory as in linux is the best ?
