Ah!  Yes, that's exactly the part I didn't understand and everything
works fine now.  Thank you!

I can't say I completely understand the byte-code case, but I don't
have an urgent need to.

ocamlmklib seems fine, but if it's just a matter of saving keystrokes,
"make" does a pretty good job of that (as long as I know what to tell
"make" to do).
