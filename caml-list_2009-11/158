The point is, in my humble opinion, that we do need examples, but we'd=20
better try to have a generic plugin that solves most of the use cases.=20
And *precise* documentation of ocamlbuild to be able to write such a=20
plugin, or other plugins.

For now, the pain/benefit ratio of writing ocamlbuild plugins is clearly=20
not worth it. Due to lack of documentation.

If you receive such examples, it would be useful to make them as generic=20
as possible. There's no point, from a tutorial point of view, in having=20
'complex' myocamlbuild plugins that you have to wrap your head around in=20
order to reuse. I'm thinking about examples on the wiki pages.

Yes. Exactly.

There's definitely a know how out there. I'm thinking of bluestorm who=20
helped me out with the ".inferred.mli" target for the plugin on the wiki.

http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Using_ocamlfind_with_ocamlbuild

I gave feedback, and its been since then on the wiki page above.

Maybe I'm mistaken, but this plugin hasn't evolved much since then. I'm=20
fairly disappointed that it has not been augmented to fit the needs of C=20
stubs in a generic way.

All the best,
