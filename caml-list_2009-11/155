Subject: solicitation for ocamlbuild examples to go in a new repository

Hello Ocaml-folk--


As the previous and many other posts on this list demonstrate, there
is a need for a collection of ocamlbuild examples which can be adapted
to various setting. I've started such a project (at Sylvain LeGall's
suggestion) at

http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/obuild-examples/

I hope that the community will take a bit of time to sumbit examples.

I'd be very happy if others were interested in joining the project,
but it might be easiest just to email examples directly to me.

An ideal "package" from my perspective would have
- a short description of what it does, just a sentence or two.
- a commented myocamlbuild.ml file
- the corresponding _tags file

I hope to get examples of all levels, from very basic to advanced.
However, I think that there is a distinct need for simple examples
which do one or two interesting things (a flood of 10 page
myocamlbuild files isn't going to help people get off the ground).


Thanks,

Erick
