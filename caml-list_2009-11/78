Hi,=0A=0AI'm creating a parser for a LaTeX-ish language that features verba=
tim blocks.=0ATo handle them I want to switch lexers on-the-fly, depending =
on the parsing=0Acontext.  Therefore, I need the state from the (Menhir gen=
erated) parser=0Ato influence the lexing process (I believe this is called =
the "lexer hack"=0Ain compiler lore).=0A=0APresently I am doing this by pla=
cing a module between the lexer and the=0Aparser, listening in on the flow =
of tokens, and using a crude state machine=0Ato figure out the parsing cont=
ext.  This solution is however error-prone=0Aand a bit wasteful, since I'm =
reimplementing by hand stuff that should be=0Athe sole competence of the pa=
rser generator.=0A=0AAnyway, since I'm sure this problem pops up often, doe=
s someone have any=0Aalternative suggestions?  I would preferably keep Menh=
ir, but I'll switch=0Aif some other generator offers a better approach(*).=
=0A=0AThanks + best regards,=0ADario Teixeira=0A=0A=0A(*) I've looked into =
Dypgen, and its partial actions may offer a way out.=0A    Does someone hav=
e any experience with those and with real-world usage=0A    of Dypgen in ge=
neral?  (In other words, is it stable enough for=0A    production use?)=0A=
=0A=0A=0A
