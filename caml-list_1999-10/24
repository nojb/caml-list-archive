	As a practitioner of monads you may find this Leibnitz's
	statement interesting:

	"Monads have no windows by which anything goes in or out" 

	Did he predict monadic IO here? :-)

	There are few statements in his "Monadologia" that may
	explain the reasons why the name "monad" was borrowed by the
	category theory.

	Generally, what he wrote about monads might seem laughable
	to us now, but I have some respect to his other philosophical
	thoughts, particularly about time and space (isotropic,
	anisotropic, absolute, relative?). Modern physics considers such
	questions relevant.

 	I also vaguely remember some old text (arabic?) which mentions
	monads as well. The concept of monads might have been much older
	than we think.
