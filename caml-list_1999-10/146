	Yes. it is to allow " ... (* ... " as a string in ocaml code,
which can be itself wrapped correctly in (* .. code .. *) comments,
to hide the code. That is, it is a 'hack' to allow comments to be
used for conditional compilation as well as documentation.

	One solution is to use Interscript as a literate programming tool,
instead of nuweb. See

	http://www.triode.net.au/~skaller/interscript

Interscript understands utf-8, and also permits other inputs
including latin-1. The correct way to support extended characters
is to use \uXXXX and \uXXXXXXXX escapes. You can also switch
to Omega/Lambda as a typesetter (Omega is a unicode version of TeX,
Lambda is the corresponding LaTeX). 

	Because Interscript is an extension of the powerful Python
scripting language, you can program custom documentation extraction
for embedded comments, thus side-stepping any problems with
ocaml comments. You can also implement conditional compilation
that way.
