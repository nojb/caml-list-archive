I have seen your solution, but I'd prefer not to rely on
this kind of thing in code which may be distributed: it's fragile,
depending on implementation dependent knowledge about the form
of the files ocamlyacc generates.

However, it seems like a good proof of principle, and I'm 
sure we're agreeing a _standard_ solution in the next
version of ocaml would be ideal.
