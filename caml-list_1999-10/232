I would like to point out that this has been done by Apple in their
AppleScript scripting language. It looks cool at first sight, but it
means that textual programs are no longer portable, since the machine
you're moving to may not use the same language as yours. So, only the
(binary) abstract syntax tree is portable, which is (IMHO) a very bad
thing, since maintaining compatibility across versions of the language
becomes very difficult.
