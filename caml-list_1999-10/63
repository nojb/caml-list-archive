Yes! Yes! I always begin my Caml code by writing iota, and I wish it
were included in the standard library. It's silly simple, and imprescindible.

let iota n =
    let rec aux l n =
        if n > 0 then aux (n::l) (n-1) else l
    in aux [] n

And then a "functional for" loop looks like

List.map (fun i -> ...) (iota n)

(Incidentaly, the name "iota" comes from APL, and stands for the
"Initial natural Interval".)
