One might presume that the definition that "'a nullOption === 'a
nullOption nullOption" isn't too hard to understand (although it might
muck up the inference engine.)  (Some (Some x)) would be the same as
(Some x) in this model, just as None would be the same as Some None.
Probably not suitable for a replacement of the option type, but a
useful additional type?

John.
