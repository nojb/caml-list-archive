Hi,

several people have been requesting features to be included in a
forthcoming O'Caml/O'Labl merge, so I thought I'd add a humble plea for
some support for untagged (presumably boxed) integers. I'm looking
mostly at camlidl, the documentation for which says: "Since the Caml int
type has one bit of tag, the conversion from IDL types int and long
loses the most significant bit on 32-bit platforms". I don't think
that's terribly satisfactory. If there isn't going to be a 32-bit type,
can anyone suggest a workaround (eg can I convince camlidl to map all
ints to floats)?

Thanks,
