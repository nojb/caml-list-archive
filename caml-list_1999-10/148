Actually, I think there is a more syntactic problem: ocaml uses 
special 'kinds' of bindings, for some reason that escapes me:

	type X = ..
	class X = ..
	exception ..
	let X = ..
	let rec X = 
	module X = 

which permit recursion with an 'and' option. Unfortunately,
this syntax does not permit these kinds of bindings to be
mutually recursive (quite aside from the semantic issues).
I find this syntax strange, I would have expected

	let X = 

be enough for all kinds of bindings, determined by the
kind of the right hand side. The distinction between
sequential and recursive bindings for functions
seems anomolous [let .. in can be used for that].
