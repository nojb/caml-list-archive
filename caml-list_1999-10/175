I think there's some people trying to give final coalgebra semantics to
objects, certainly to "states". I have only began to understand the issue (I
look at it from the perspective of labelled transition systems), but the
landscape looks beautiful (if daunting!). Have a look at J.J.M.J. Rutten's
page

 http://www.cwi.nl/~janr/

or specifically for objects B. Jacobs:

I think you'll find this interesting:

B. Jacobs, Objects and classes, co-algebraically. In: B. Freitag, C.B.
Jones, C. Lengauer, and H.-J. Schek (eds)  Object-Orientation with
Parallelism and Persistence Kluwer Acad. Publ., 1996, p. 83--103.

Il semble qu'on peut assigner une semantique de coalgebre finale aux objects
et ses classes. V. les URL cites en haut.
