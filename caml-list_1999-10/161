	I do understand the concern, but the decision on
the International Standards has been made. The transition
for ISO 8859-x clients will involve some pain. Better to
start going through the pain now :-(

	No, what you mean is that with _current technology_
there is plenty of support for 8 bit characters, using code pages,
so that Latin-1 is well supported.

	For example, there are a lot of text editors that
accept 8 bit characters, and even permit switching code pages.
There are almost none that work with ISO10646 or unicode,
let alone accept UTF-8 encoding. (Yudit is the only one I know of).

	You will have no problem with the right tools: the difference
will be transparent. Of course, you will need the right tools.
For example, you will need a browser like Internet Explorer 5,
which processes UTF-8 encoding correctly.

	I agree that this is a problem, but supporting
Latin-1, or any other archaic standard, is not going
to help move forward. It is bad enough that most vendors
only support Unicode, which is a small, almost filled,
16 bit subset of the full 31 bit ISO-10646 Standard.

	I believe people with international concerns can work
together no matter what their native language. Some English
speakers may be concerned, some, like me, are somewhat
embarrased to be non-fluent in _any_ other language.
[I speak a smattering of high school German]

	However, Australia, where I live, has migrants
from all over the world and support for many languages
is an important issue here. Particularly Asian languages.
And ISO-8859-x is not much help there :-)
