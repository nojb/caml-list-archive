	1 and 2 is good news! Now, Python does (3) by reference counting.
So it is always possible to do reference counting to get immediate
finalisation, there is an overhead in both time and space when
the garbage collector is used as well, and of course it doesn't
finalise unreachable circular references immediately.
But it is a good compromise, I believe Perl does something like this 
(reference count, and clean up with a GC at the end).
