Toby Moth has informed me (and given a semi-mystical exposition involving
the Holy Trinity :) of another notion of "monad" hailing from non-standard
real analysis, due to the logician Robinson, and in this case it appears
that the term was in fact derived from Leibniz's ideas. These monads of
course have nothing to do with the ones from category theory, which are the
ones relevant for denotational semantics and functional programming.
