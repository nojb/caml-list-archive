	Excuse me, but exactly what do you mean by 'foreign' characters?
Do you mean non Chinese characters? What? You aren't Chinese?

	I think that, at the moment, English is the 'lingua franca' <grin>
of the Internet. Spoken with an American accent :-)

	However, the Internet is growing fast, and the number
of English speakers will soon enough be a minority. It will probably
remain true that most of the _programmers_ will be able to use English.

	Yes. I think it is highly laudible that ocaml accepts more than
just plain 'ASCII': many students are more fluent with their native
language (even if they speak some English and/or are learning it),
and being able to program with it will enhance learning.
Internationalising
software that is actually worth sharing internationally is a lesser
obstacle that writing good software in the first place.

	In my opinion, a programming language should simply
give clients a _choice_. Cultures, people, and circumstances vary.
I don't think programming language designers should be in the
business of encouraging or discouraging use of a particular
language, but rather facilitating the implementation of 
the clients own wishes or requirements.
