Symbols and numbers in Spanish, "words" (be them identifiers or
keywords) as they are. Accent varies, but normally is Argentinian
English (I can speak acceptable English, with something of an American
English accent). 
This I do when reading programs aloud, or when doing mathematics.

For instance

"Let x be a real such that x >= 0"

is for me "Let <<equis>> be a real such that <<equis mayor o igual a cero>>"

Evidently, the linguistic structures I use for words and concepts are
separated. And I had never been misunderstood, and I never misunderstood
anybody doing this sort of things.

I think all this is fascinating ;-}
