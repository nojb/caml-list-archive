Thanks for the info: I suspected that this was the case,
quite apart from being easier to develop with.

My biggest problem using ocaml is that I'm still a naive user:
I cannot tell easily which operations will be fast and which will not.
In C/C++ I don't have this problem since I understand many of the
ways in which it is implemented.
