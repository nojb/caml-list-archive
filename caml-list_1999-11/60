Excellent news!

I've got a question. What would be needed (in terms of things to do,
effort &c) in order to port the native compiler to MacOS? I'm not
thinking of anything fancy, just an MPW tool producing MPW tools.

MPW has a good PowerPC assembler, and a good PowerPC linker. What else
is needed?

TIA, regards,
Matías.
