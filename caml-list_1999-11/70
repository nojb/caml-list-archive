Sender: weis

Despite OCaml 2.03 being intended as a bug-fix release, we managed to
introduce two relatively serious bugs (one in the OCaml-C interface
and one in the bytecode compiler with the -g option on), which didn't
show up in our tests.

As a consequence, there will be a 2.04 release very soon (by the end
of this week).

If you've already installed 2.03 and hit any serious problem, please
report it to us (caml-light@inria.fr) as soon as possible, so that we
can try to address critical bugs before 2.04 is out.

Thanks for your help and apologies for the inconvenience.
