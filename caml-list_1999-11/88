If you use ocamldot to generate program dependency graphs for ocaml
programs, and you are upgrading to ocaml-2.04, you may want to get the
latest version from my web site,

    www.cis.upenn.edu/~tjim.

(The old version does not work when compiled with 2.04.)


The README follows if you want to know more about ocamldot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ocamldot generates program dependency graphs for ocaml programs.

The dependency graph output by ocamldot can be rendered by a separate
program, dot.  Dot is freely available from

  http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/

Ocamldot is designed to process the output of ocamldep.  A typical use
would be

  ocamldep *.ml | ocamldot > dep.dot

or

  ocamldep *.ml > .depend
  ocamldot .depend > dep.dot

This will output a dot graph into the file dep.dot.  You can then use
the program dotty to view, edit, and print the graph.

Ocamldot has the following options:

  -fullgraph   draw the full graph (default is to draw only the kernel)
  -landscape   output in landscape format (default is portrait)
  -lr          draw graph from left to right (default is top to bottom)
  -r <r>       use <r> as a root in the graph; nodes reachable from <r>
               will be shown

(The transitive kernel of a dag is the smallest subset of the dag
whose transitive closure is the same as the transitive closure of the
dag.  For example, the kernel of A->B, A->C, B->C is just the two
edges A->B, B->C.)
