Hi,

Does anyone know how to core-dump a running program, reboot, and then
restart the program from where it was ?

I suppose it is impossible when the program has, like, opened files or so,
but when it's just performing a computation with only stdin and stdout,
shouldn't it be possible ?

Thanks for your help
