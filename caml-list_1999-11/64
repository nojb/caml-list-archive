Hi,
we're working on a system that performs checkpoint/restart of a serial
and
parallel application called Starfish (see
http://dsl.cs.technion.ac.il/Starfish).
We are implementing Starfish using Ocaml language.
We not yet release the source code of Starfish, but we can help you to
perform
you requirement of saving the process state and then restart it.

Best Regards,
    Adnan
