A quick comment on one my previous post, that somewhat moderates my

I wasn't thinking that during such a translation, collisions are likely to
occur between identifiers and keywords (identifiers that aren't keywords
in the first language syntax become so in the second one). You run into
problems then. My apologies for having made such a peremptory statement.
