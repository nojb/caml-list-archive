                       FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS 

                    ESSLLI-2000 STUDENT SESSION

            August 6-18 2000, Birmingham, Great Britain 
  
               Submission Deadline : March 15th, 2000


           http://www.loria.fr/~piliere/ESSLLI-2000.html

========================================================================

We are pleased to announce the Student Session of the 12th European
Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI-2000) organized
by the University of Birmingham and located at the same University in
August 2000 (http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~esslli). We will welcome 
submission of papers for presentation at the ESSLLI-2000 Student Session 
and for appearance in the proceedings. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE:

This fifth ESSLLI Student Session will provide, like the other editions,
an opportunity for ESSLLI participants who are students to present their
own WORK IN PROGRESS and get feedback from senior researchers and
fellow-students. It is desired that papers presenting creative and
innovative ideas will be submitted. The ESSLLI-2000 Student Session
encourages submissions from students at any level, from undergraduates -
before completion of the Master Thesis as well as postgraduates - before
completion of the PhD degree. We will not accept papers co-authored by
non-students. The ESSLLI Student Session consists of paper presentations
and has its own timeslot in the summerschool's schedule: 60 minutes
every day for two weeks, provided that a sufficient number of good
quality papers is accepted. Each presentation will last 30 minutes
(including 10 minutes of discussion). The accepted papers will be
published in the ESSLLI-2000 Student Session proceedings, which will be
made available during ESSLLI-2000.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

REQUIREMENTS:

The Student Session papers should describe original, unpublished work,
completed or in progress, that demonstrates insight, creativity and
promise. No previously published papers should be submitted.
Papers will cover topics within the six ESSLLI subject areas (Logic,
Language, Computation, Logic & Language, Logic & Computation,
Language & Computation). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FORMAT OF SUBMISSION:

Student authors should submit an anonymous extended abstract headed by
the paper title, not to exceed 5 pages of length exclusive of references
and send a separate identification page (see below). Note that the
length of the full papers will not be allowed to exceed 10 pages. Since
reviewing will be blind, the body of the abstract should omit author
names and addresses. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity (e.g., " We previously showed (Smith, 1991)... ")
should be avoided. It is possible to use instead references like " Smith
(1991) previously showed...". 

For any submission, a plain ASCII text version of the identification
page should be sent SEPARATELY, using the following format: 

Title: <title> 

Author: <firstname lastname of the first author>
Address: <address of the first author>
... 
Author: <firstname lastname of the last author>
Address: <address of the last author>

Short summary (5 lines): <summary>

Subject area (one of): Logic | Language | Computation | Logic and
Language | Logic and Computation | Language and Computation. 


The submission of the extended abstract should be in one of the
following formats: 

1) SELF-CONTAINED LATEX SOURCE (the most encouraged): The LaTeX source
should use the standard article document-class, with A4 paper size and
12pt font size. The source should not refer to any other external files
or styles, except for the standard styles for LaTeX2e. The bibliography
for a LaTeX submission cannot be submitted as separate .bib file: the
actual bibliography entries must be inserted in the submitted LaTeX
source file. 

2) POSTSCRIPT: PostScript submissions must use a standard font and A4 (8
1/4 " x 11 3/4 ") size pages. Please avoid the default letter page size
if submitting from outside Europe. 

3) ASCII text.

Submissions outside the specified length and formatting requirements
will be subject to rejection without review.


The extended abstract and separate identification page must be sent 
by e-mail to: 

Catherine.Piliere@loria.fr by March 15, 2000.
