I have found the error. While I updated the interface for the module
correctly, (that is, the class type) I did not update the 
abstract interface containing the more abstract class type
to which the 'self' is coerced in the indicated term: in the class type
'interpreter_t',
method 'run_file' has return type 'unit'. Because the inference engine
has not
yet deduced the type of 'run_file' for class type 'py_interpreter', it
uses
the information from the coercion to assume it returns 'unit', then
reports
an error when later finding it actually returns an 'int'.
