As some of you may have heard already, the first prize at the ICFP'99
programming contest was awarded to an OCaml program written by the
"Camls 'R Us" team, that is, Pascal Cuoq, Damien Doligez, Luc
Maranget, Alan Schmitt and yours truly, all from INRIA Rocquencourt.

For those of you who'd like more information, a detailed description
of our program is now available at http://caml.inria.fr/icfp99-contest/.
