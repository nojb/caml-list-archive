Subject: [Caml-list] Cannot find Stream Parser Documentation

Hi,

  currently I am finally trying to port my stuff from OCaml-3.02
to OCaml-3.04, and I am having problems related with stream parsers:
I am using the stream error catcher

  [< .... ?? HERE >]

--- the separator once was a single `?',
and had to be turned into `??' for OLabl, and now neither works!
 
  ocamlc  -I +labltk -pp camlp4o -c xmlParse.ml
  File "xmlParse.ml", line 101, characters 6-7:
  Parse error: '>]' expected after [stream_patt] (in [parser_case])
  Preprocessing error

    99      let pc c = parser n
   100        [< '  x when x == c
   101        ? (string_of_int n ^ ": pc '" ^ String.make 1 c ^ "'")
   102          >] -> ();;

The documentation for stream parsers that had been in the
``Language extensions'' chapter of the OCaml manual
seems to have disappeared, too.
I looked for it in the camlp4 directory,
but that directory doesn't even contain a README.

In the OCaml distribution, camlp4 seems to come with no documentation
besides the manpage!
(And on the camlp4 web pages, I couldn't find anything related
 to the implementation of streams.)

A related issue: Among about 50 modules, only one uses stream parsers.
But

  ocamldep -pp camlp4o *.mli *.ml > .depend

takes much longer than without camlp4.
How can I tell ocamldep to use camlp4 only for this file?

The ocamldep chapter has only includes in its example Makefile:

  # Dependencies
  depend:
          $(OCAMLDEP) $(INCLUDES) *.mli *.ml > .depend

Is there any trick that would force file-specific settings to ocamldep?


Many thanks in advance!
