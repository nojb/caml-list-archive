 What is a "better control"? OpenGL and DirectX have the same 
functionality, and I don't know any popular 3D-cards without OpenGL
drivers. And, some cards, like very popular NVidia, have much better
OpenGL then Direct3D.

 Sure. And I noticed, that many games works much better with OpenGL then 
with D3D (on my NVidia card).
