> Why do they use Ocaml?

Basically the obvious reasons: using a functional language with a nice
small core means that you can go directly into *programming* right at the
beginning of the semester.  We start with simple recursive numerical
algorithms, then move quickly into manipulating lists, trees, sorting,
searching, etc.  The final assignment in OCaml involves modifying an
evaluator for a tiny OCaml-core-like language.

> Why do they swithc to Java?

Basically the obvious reasons: to introduce objects (in a "conventional"
style), and so that students can get summer jobs.
