On http://caml.inria.fr, there's a section mentionning some applications
written in O'Caml.  I'm pretty sure this list is not quite up to date
(considering that a very nice application, Active DVI, is not included
there.)  I'd like to know, besides the application mentionned there and
Active DVI, are there other significant applications written in O'Caml?

Regards,
  Vincent

P.S.: I also meant to ask: does anyone know schools where students are
given programming classes with O'Caml?
