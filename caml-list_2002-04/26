I've been discussing programming idioms based on continuations with some
students, and I'd like to find a nice tutorial or compendium of examples
illustrating some of the useful and mind-bending things that can be done.

I know there are lots of tutorials from the Scheme community, but they
tend to depend on continuations as a *language* mechanism (call/cc),
which OCaml (which is the context of this discussion) doesn't have.  So
I'd prefer to find something that develops the same ideas in a more
concrete way, using an explicit continuation-passing style.  [Scheme (or
Haskell, SML, or whatever) syntax is no problem, as long as the
continuations are explicit.]
  
Pointers appreciated...
