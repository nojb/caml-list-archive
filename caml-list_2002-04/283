Sooner or later, 2D UIs based on 3D APIs and accelerators
are going to become widespread.

However, for a good 2D UI, you need pixel-accurate rendering
and some other features.  I think generic OpenGL doesn't 
quite offer all the necessary features.  Also, people like UIs 
that "scale down" to low-end devices; not every handheld can
run OpenGL well (yet).
