The debian ocaml package use the following method :

- the ocaml package contain an executable (ocaml-ldconf) which is in
  charge of the generation of the ld.conf
- it use a file (/var/lib/ocaml/ld.conf) that contain line which look
  like /usr/lib/ocaml/lablgtk  add     liblablgtk-ocaml
  that mean : the liblablgtk-ocaml package have add the
  /usr/lib/ocaml/lablgtk directory to the /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf file 
  (it also use the /etc/ocaml/ld.conf file for addition of new
  directory by the administrator)

so when a new package is installed, it run in its postinst script
things like
ocaml-ldconf -pliblablgtk-ocaml -a /usr/lib/ocaml/lablgtk

and when it is remove it run in its prerm script :
ocaml-ldconf -pliblablgtk-ocaml -r /usr/lib/ocaml/lablgtk

and the ocaml-ldconf take care of every thing else...

You may also add a dll/ directory with link to each dll...
