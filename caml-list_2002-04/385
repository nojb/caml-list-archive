There's a new release of CamlIDL at http://caml.inria.fr/camlidl/
that supports a "finalize" attribute to do just this, e.g.

        typedef [abstract,finalize(freeCow)] int cow;

The release also fixes some minor bugs with error reporting in
presence of import files, and with "const" qualifiers.  (Thanks for
Dmitry Bely for his extensive testing and bug hunting!)
