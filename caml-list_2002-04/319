Well, you can use OpenGL to draw bytemaps (mostly used to draw fonts) or other
such kind of stuff to use as bottoms, and it is then easy to get the mouse
click coordinates back in order to check if the button was pressed. Sure it
would be nicer if all this was done in a library, but it can be done. After
allm the berlin projects uses mesa for writing a X windows replacement, if you
want a proof of this conecpt.

Yes, that is true, but it can be done one time in a lib if you want it, and be
reused afterward.

Wellm maybe i don't understand you, but the lablgl binding already provide a
way to do OpenGL in Tk (using the togl widget) and the lablgtk bindings
provide a way to do OpenGL in gtk+ using the gtkglarea widget.

What do you want more ?
