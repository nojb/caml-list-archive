I commented out the initialiser in specElement and got this error:

File "tmp.ml", line 30, characters 22-41:
The type of this expression,
< get_ident : int; set_ident : int -> unit; _.. > countingObjects,
contains type variables that cannot be generalized

and here on line 30 you are making an instance object without
binding the type variable ..

let countingObjects = new countingObjects ;;

That seems suspicious .. countingObjects is generic
here .. this is at global scope .. the initialiser
which fixes the type is inside a class ..
this has to be wrong ..
