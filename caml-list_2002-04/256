This makes it a lot less interresting :(((

I think, not porting, but writing games directly to be multi-plateform is the
way of the future. This is the way that ID took with quake III, altough that
didn't go too well for the linux sales i hear (but then maybe more for
marketing reasons than for other things, you could play the linux game by
buying the windows version which was much more widely available, so counting
were not fair. A better test will be the forthcoming neverwinter nights
though, which is supposed to release on Windows, MacOSX, Linux and Be at the
same time. I think there will still be availability issues though.

Well, the new OpenGL 2.0 initiative should solve most of this in a
satisfactory fashion i think, but then, it still needs a little time.

Yes, if they are clearly isolated, which is something that ocaml makes easier,
then this could be done easily.

That said, i am curious of the use of the _you_ here, since you have no
intention of porting the games to Unix/Linux, does this imply that other
persons willing to do that may get access to the source code ?
