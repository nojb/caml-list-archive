There is an editor called Red which was developed as a component
of the IDE for the OO programming language Blue developed
at the University of Sydeny for teaching.

Last time I looked, Red needed some work .. but it is easily
the best general purpose "easy to use" text editor ever written.
Its key feature is that it is menu driven, but when you
pull down a menu you have the option of binding a key
to the operation by simply pressing the key, or learning
the default binding.
 
You might try finding Judy Kay from the staff
pages of cs.usyd.edu.au if you have any interest.
Its possible you could link ocaml into the IDE
instead of the Blue compiler... heh .. if you can
convince usyd to give up on OO and start teaching
FP it would be nice too :-)
