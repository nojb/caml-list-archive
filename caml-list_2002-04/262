This is actually very hard to do.  In general, there is a tight
integration between graphics and game-play engine.
Mainly, this is because realtime behaviour demand it:
even abstraction layers like D3D etc cause serious problems
due to to inadequate coupling .. Diablo II is a pefect example
of extremely bad interactive design precisely because
it didn't lock the frame rate down, or phase lock the
NPCs properly...the graphics were absolutely superb ..
but they had no idea what to do about non-constant rendering
times or how to synch the client and server properly in the presence
of internet lag .. Blizzard sold heaps .. but their reputation is
in tatters now ..
