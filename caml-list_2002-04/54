Thanks for the summary! A practically oriented page of cool continuation
tricks would be a very useful thing.

Lloyd Allison, who wrote an excellent, short introduction to denotational
semantics, has a few papers on practical uses of continuation passing
style, including one in Java (!) I think.

L.Allison. Continuations implement generators and streams.

I'm a bit surprised by this comment from Olivier Danvy

I guess he's saying that we shouldn't write CPS style code (I can't say
for sure), but I find some of the nice CPS examples (like his
functional unparsing one) really compelling. Oh well, I'll still be
anxiously awaiting those lecture notes.
