Well, we can always use wineX (and please no license flames about this

If I remember correctly, all versions will be released simultaneously in
a single box, so it will also be hard to count ...

I quote their faq:

8.04 Will there be a Mac/Linux/BeOs version?

The BeOS version of Neverwinter Nights will not be completed. However,
we are planning a simultaneous PC/Macintosh/Linux release for
Neverwinter Nights, with all three versions to be included in a single
box. On the PC, Neverwinter Nights will run under Windows 98, Windows
ME, Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, and Windows XP.

Sorry for the OT ;-)
