Yes, at work we use OpenGL also for 2D stuff, because it's just nicer
to work with than X/Motif.  In principle it works fine.  In practice
it took the people working on it (not me, thankfully) a very long time
to iron out the stability problems---our s/w would completely take out
not only Linux but also Solaris (on stock Sun hardware!), apparently
because of raciness if the user had a lot of OGL windows open.
Basically the implementations appeared to be fully mature only in the
common, single-3D-window usage ... however things do appear to have
settled down now.
