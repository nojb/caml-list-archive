It looks to me like this will never terminate, since "traversedir dir"
calls "traversedir dir".

I don't have any O'Caml code to do what you want, but I do have some
pseudocode (OK, it's python) to perform a depth-first traversal of a
directory hierarchy, performing some action on every file that satisfies
some predicate:

def dirwalk(tree, predicate, action):
    for file in os.listdir(tree):
        fullpath = tree + "/" + file
        if os.path.isdir(fullpath) and not os.path.islink(fullpath):
            dirwalk(fullpath, predicate, action)
        else:
            if predicate(fullpath):
                action(fullpath)

This could be transliterated into bad O'Caml trivially, and into
idiomatic O'Caml without too much work.  I'd do it for you, but I'm on
my way out of the office.  :-)

Notice that I ignore symbolic links.  This is necessary to avoid cycles,
since a UNIX filesystem is a directed graph and not a tree. 
(Alternatively, you could keep track of what canonical paths you've
visited and only descend down a tree that you haven't already marked.)
