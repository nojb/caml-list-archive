They are different with regard to typical contest rules, which are
simple (maybe too simple).

Those rules describe commands, which will be used to compile programs,
typically:

C        - gcc source.c
OCaml    - ocamlopt source.ml

The C program can use scanf, which is in libc. The OCaml program can't
use Str.

Str source code is mainly C, not OCaml.

scanf source is available too and it is probably C.

And I wouldn't say that implementing regular expression matching library
is easier than implementing scanf.
