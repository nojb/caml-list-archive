I think also that Ocaml is a good choice. When you're looking what's
happening in the industry, most of the companies are relying on home-made
script langages, with few features and lots of bugs. Some game scripting
langage have evolved and are now available for OpenSource, but most of the
time the design choice is to be "easier" than C ( no types ! ), which of
course reduce the potential range of application of such a langage.

That's why ocaml is good : you only need to have a slim C/C++ library to
work with and then you can code ALL your game - including tools - in OCaml.
