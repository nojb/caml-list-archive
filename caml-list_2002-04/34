The problem is that I can't be sure of which types could be stored there.  
This record is meant to implement an object for an object-oriented language 
I'm trying to write.  The problem field stores primitives like ints and 
floats for Integer and Float classes, but in the case that later on I would 
like to add new primitives like Num.num through extension modules (e.g., not 
by modifying and recompiling the entire language) a normal variant won't 
work.  I unfortunately am having problems with typechecking when using 
polymorphic variants, so for now I am just going to use normal variants.

Thanks,
