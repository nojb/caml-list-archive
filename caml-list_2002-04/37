NEWS: ENTCS issue planned for proceedings

			Final Call for Papers
	      Workshop on Types in Programming (TIP'02)
		   Dagstuhl, Germany, July 9, 2002
			Colocated with MPC'02
	http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/tip02/

Modern programming languages rely on type systems with static type
checking to detect common errors at compile time. While the benefits
of statically checked type systems have long been recognized, there
are some areas where the type systems of modern programming languages
are not expressive enough. Some interesting programs will always be
rejected, despite their semantical soundness.

There are several remedies to this situation, ranging from dependent
types (where types may contain values) through intersection types to
types with modalities. These systems are well-investigated from a
theoretical point of view by logicians and type theorists. However,
the impact of these developments on practical programming has been
small, partly because they are trading simplicity against
expressivity.

The objective of the workshop is to make researchers in programming
languages aware of new developments and research directions on the
theory side while at the same time pointing out problems arising in
practical uses to theorists.  Technical topics include, but are not
limited to:

* Type systems in all variants: polymorphic, dependent, intersection,
  modal, linear.
* Annotated type systems.
* Low-level type systems.
* Advanced uses and applications.

Original results that bear on these and related topics are
solicited. Papers investigating novel uses, applications, and
shortcomings of type systems in the broadest sense are especially
encouraged.  Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic
are welcome to consult with the program chairs at
<URL:mailto:tip02@informatik.uni-freiburg.de> prior to submission.

An extended abstract should be submitted electronically to
<URL:mailto:tip02@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>.  Acceptable formats are
PostScript or PDF, viewable by gv. Submissions should not exceed 5000
words, excluding bibliography and figures.

Submitted papers will be judged on significance, relevance,
correctness, originality, and clarity. They should include a clear
identification of what has been accomplished and why it is
significant. Informal workshop proceedings will appear as a technical report
at INRIA. It is planned to publish an ENTCS volume
<URL:http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs> with selected works, refereed to
conference standard, after the workshop.=20

  Deadline for submission:	27 April 2002
  Notification: 		1 June 2002
  Final papers due: 		29 June 2002
