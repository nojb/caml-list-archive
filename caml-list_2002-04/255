For the 1st point , I do agree, but actually Microsoft is really well
supporting DirectX , and sometimes it's better to have only one company
behind a product, because you don't have to care about driver compatibility
and all MCD/ICD/etc.... stuff of OpenGL which isn't very nice :)

For the 2nd point, I didn't want such a low-level interface.
