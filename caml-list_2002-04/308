Hello,


why does an stack overflow-error occur here?

let rec traversedir dir =
          try ( [Unix.readdir dir] @ traversedir dir ) with
          End_of_file -> [];;


I have not tried it with very deep directories, so
I did not expect such an error...

What is the problem here?


This function is a predecessor of later directory-
traversing processing stuff:
With this function I try to traverse directories.
Later versions of it should be expanded, so that
I can give as parameters a filetype and a function,
which will be applied to all files of a special
filetype => and that recursively.

(e.g.: moving all regular files or renaming all directories
or similar things)

How can I do such recursively filesystem-traversing?
How can I handle such things without running into
stack-overflows?

Ciao,
   Oliver
