Because the type of a global is being fixed by an implementation
detail of a class .. classes are supposed to encapsulate things.
If it worked before, it might be considered a bug in the ocaml
type checker: type inference shouldn't cross class boundaries like that.

In any case .. you have a global, and that is bad enough.
It should be passed as an argument to methods that use it,
including the initialiser.
