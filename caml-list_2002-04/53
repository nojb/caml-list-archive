It was not clear to me which e-mail is the most appropriate for
the notes below, so I decided to let everyone share the joy.

Here are some notes on installing OCaml 3.04 under Windows XP:
==============================================================

Installing OCaml on Windows
and Setting environment:
------------------------
Things did not work right away. Here is what I had to do
additionally:

1. Right click on My Computer
2. Choose 'Advanced'
3. Choose 'Environment' variables
4. Add C:\Progra~1\Ocaml\bin to PATH
5. Add OCAMLLIB and CAMLP4LIB (and CAMLLIB, OCAMLP4LIB for the paranoid).

Using quoted paths, 
such as "C:\Program Files\Ocaml\lib"; seems not to work with Cygwin.

Getting VC++ to work
--------------------
cl (the non-visual part of VC++)
complains that mspdb60.dll could not be found.
It appears to have been misplaced in Common\MSDev98\Bin
instead of VC98\Bin.

This problem is documented and trouble shooting is available at:
http://www.research.att.com/lists/uwin-developers/1998/12/msg00010.html

Include paths did not work. 
Editing the Makefile.win and replacing /I$(OCAMLLIB) by 
/I "C:\Program Files\Ocaml\lib" 
/I "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Include" 
did the trick.

camlopt
-------
The link to the assembler from the README was out-dated (a number
of other links are broken from the ocaml sites).
Instead Google got me to masm32: http://www.movsd.com/masm.htm
A small 5.9 MB download, followed by install and the above PATH
exercise.

camlidl/tests
-------------
The Makefile is unix centric (uses gcc, which may come with 
cygwin, but ...).

ocamlmklib
----------
Is this missing under windows?
My Linux installation has it, my XP does not.

Here are some more general notes
================================

Makefile
--------
The makefile from http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/Makefile_ocaml-eng.html
should be updated for 3.04, in particular include the relevant
macros for labltk, as described in the manual.

The hump
--------
caml.inria.fr seems down quite often, for example April 6'th.

Libraries 
---------
Several more features from the Hump 
can be added to CDK, such that for example cryptokit 
uses zlib from CDK and does not define it on its own.

Libraries that appear to be missing:

- XML SOAP 
- OpenSSL, OpenSSH interface or should we just re-implement ASN1 parsers,
  Spki interface, RSA crypto, SSL 2.0, 3.0, and TLS? OpenSSL also
  includes the usual block ciphers and hash algorithms.
- SMTP
- Mime tools
- XML SAX

Are there any organized more extensive wish-lists for the CDK?
