As the debian maintainer of the ocaml package, i can only suggest that you
switch over to debian, espacially as there will be a new release on may 1 if
all goes well. (Debian has been one of the two most early distribution
suporting ppc beside linuxppc, which if i guess correctly is now defunct).

But then, as said, i have a biased opinion myself, and don't use ppc
personnaly anyway.

Well, it is a simple patch. It would go as follows :

cd /where/you/build/ocaml
tar xzvf ocaml-3.04.tar.gz
cd ocaml-3.04
cat ../ocaml-powerpcfix.diff | patch -p1

follow the standard instructions in the ocaml INSTALL file as usual.

(alternatively, you could first do :

cat ../ocaml-powerpcfix.diff | patch -p1 --dry-run

to check that all goes well without really acting).

No, i think you don't should use the cvs version, but prefer the stable
release. That is why i had to extract the patch from cvs to apply only it, and
not a lot of other stuff. the cvs version would be nice for people doing
experiments, but not for common usage.

Also, you have to understand that, since there is only one devel tree in CVS,
the fix cannot be backported to the stable release, and mostly what did happen
in case of grave problems in the past, was to shortly do a new release.

Anyway, it is only a minor problem, which is fixed now, and will be included
in the next official release.

But again, simply use debian and install my ocaml packages, and you will get
stable version, not only for ppc, but for all the supported arches (well ia64
is still broken, but who already uses that anyway). (sorry f

The cvs location is available from the caml.inria.fr web site.
