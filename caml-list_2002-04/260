Well .. I think you may find that the requisite graphics interfaces are 
non trivial
and not so "slim" as you might want. Nevertheless, in my view, the graphics
and user interface, while important, are secondary: if you have a solid 
game engine,
you can always improve the pictures and UI later.

Actually, the best language for games is Felix .. since it generates
event driven code and has strong static typing like ocaml .. but
a slicker interface to C/C++... heh .. but its still experimental :-)
