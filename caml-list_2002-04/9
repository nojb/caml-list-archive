Your code is good and work perfectly but as you say : 
 According to the ocaml manual ... 
   Unix:
   This library is implemented under the X11 windows system. Programs
   that use the graphics library must be linked as follows:

   ocamlc other options graphics.cma other files

   For interactive use of the graphics library, do:

   ocamlmktop -o mytop graphics.cma
           ./mytop

	   or (if dynamic linking of C libraries is supported on your
	   platform), start ocaml and type #load "graphics.cma";;.


In other word no command specified for ocamlopt. So it seems to not
works properly with native compiler.

As far as my exprience, graphics is a pretty good library but as many
restriction. If you want other fault ( and it is with the bytecode ).
Try open_graphic... Unix.socket... Unix.select. For me the code crash
and give me an exception explaining an unknow error raised ( but it
works with no graphics opened ).

If i were you i try labltk or lablgtk... ( longer to code but more close
to system abstraction )
