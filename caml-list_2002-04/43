For debian packaging and US based servers, i have no problem, since all is
already in place in the debian archive to make the us regulators happy (and
flood them with too much information also by the way).

There may be other issues though, especially with regard to the french
legislation (which did change sometime ago, but i don't know to what extent)
and also with some patent issues which are different in the US and in europe.
