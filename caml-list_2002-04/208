(Sorry for previous post with confusing subject please ignore - here we go
again with proper subject but equivalent contents)

I have an idl file foo.idl that is used to produce foo.{h,c.ml.mli}.

However, when I compile foo.ml using the native code compiler I get a
foo.obj file and when I compile foo.c I also get foo.obj.

I of course need both files during the linking phase so 1) either I have
missed a detail or 2) I need to do a name changing stunt?!?

If the name changing stunt is the prefered way to go: How should I do it?
(I can for example rename the foo.c file before compilation and it seems to
work.)

Thanks,

- Jakob Lichtenberg
