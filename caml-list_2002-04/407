Well, module types are (a limited form of) dependent types. What
concretely triggers undecidability of subtyping in OCaml is the presence
of abstract module types, at least in combination with the
contravariance of higher-order functors.

Note that Russo showed [1] that you can actually get rid of dependent
typing and interpret ML modules (without nested signatures) as a lambda
calculus with higher-order polymorphism (i.e., definitely not
simply-typed). The basic idea is to view functors as functions
polymorphic over their type arguments. In this setting, adding abstract
signatures would at least require adding polymorphic kinds, I believe.
