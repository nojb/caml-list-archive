> I can't understand the meaning of the following code:

Filename.quote puts its argument between single quotes:
        foo.ml  -->  'foo.ml'
and if there's a single quote inside the argument, the following is
generated:
        foo'bar --> 'foo'\''bar'
i.e. the ' causes the current quote to be closed, an unquoted \' to be
generated, and a new quote to be opened.  This seems to work fine with
any Unix shell.

Can you provide a more specific bug report?  What is passed to gcc
that gcc doesn't like?
