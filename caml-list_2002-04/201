I ran into some old colleagues a while back, to whom I extolled the virtues of OCaml.  It turned out that "write it in ML" was a private joke between them, as in, "having trouble with that problem? write it in ML! ha ha ha"

They were shocked to discover that I, an inveterate CL/Scheme devotee back in the old days, had gone over to the dark side.

By the way, I scanned the new translated OCaml book and I have to say, it is a very impressive piece of work.  The publication of this and Benjamin Pierce's new book might help OCaml past the inflection point.

Maybe we just need to extol the "disruptive" nature of OCaml :)
