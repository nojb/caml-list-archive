CamlTk compiles under Windows !

You can have a look at SynDEx, which is written using CamlTk :
http://www-rocq.inria.fr/syndex/

It's true that it's a little difficult to compile with Cygwin, various reasons :
* you don't have the good version of Cygwin; I use the version 1.1.8-2 (one day I
tried another version unsucessfully)
* maybe you have a problem with the configure script; in this case you must
report to Pierre Weis and Jun Furuse who maintain CamlTk.

SynDEx is written with CamlTk, but no depends on cygwin.dll. Dmitry Bely and
Masakazu Fukuzawa made a patch of OCaml-3.03 to compile OCaml with mingw
(http://www.mingw.org/ ) which allows to compile under windows without to rely on
3rd party DLL; instead of using cygwin.dll, it use Microsoft's standard C runtime
library MSVCRT.DLL. We adapted this patch to the version 3.04 of OCaml. That's
what I use to compile SynDEx.

We have discussed with the Ocaml team to include this patch in the next version
of Ocaml, to be able to compile with mingw; I don't know if they took a
decision... Maybe it would be useful to distribute this patch on the Camltk web ?

It would be great for Ocaml users who work under Windows (it's not a shame) to be
allowed to use Camltk (it's a joke...)
