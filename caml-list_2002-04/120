Hello,

I am happy to announce the first (beta) release of mlTk, new Tcl/Tk interface
for O'Caml, version 1.00-beta1. 

mlTk is merged version of the two existing Tcl/Tk interfaces, the good
old CamlTk and the new cool LablTk.

CamlTk uses classical features only, therefore it is easy to understand for 
the beginners of ML. It makes many conservative O'Caml gurus also happy.
LablTk, on the other hand, uses rather newer features of O'Caml, the labeled 
optional arguments and polymorphic variants. Its syntax has much more Tcl/Tk
script flavor, but provides more powerful typing than CamlTk at the same time
(i.e. less run time type checking of widgets). 
These two interfaces have been distributed and maintained
independently.

mlTk unifies these libraries into one. Since mlTk provides the both API's,
both CamlTk and LablTk users can compile their applications with mlTk, 
just with little fixes. 

Before the official release of mlTk and the replacement of 
labltk+camltk => mltk in the O'Caml distribution in near future, 
I would like to release a beta distribution. The source archive is at

     http://pauillac.inria.fr/~furuse/mltk/

I would be very glad if you would try to port your CamlTk/LablTk
applications to mlTk and feed back you experience.

*** This mlTk project is financially supported by LexiFi (www.lexifi.com). 
*** I thank them for their kind help to contribute to the O'Caml society.

Regards,
