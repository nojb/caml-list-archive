Subject: [Caml-list] ocaml curses library?
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


Is there an "official" ocaml binding to the unix curses library?  I know
that curses is used in the manual as an example of linking c code to ocaml,
but it's incomplete and I was wondering if there was anything pre-packaged
that I could just grab and compile.
