 Hi!

 I'm having a big troubles packaging OCaml and 3rd party
libraries (like lablGL, lablgtk) in RPM. All the evil is in 
the ld.conf file - foreign libraries should add lines in 
it at the installation.

 The much better approach to the multi-package configurations
is introduced, e.g. in xinetd, new crontabs, and so on - all
external packages writes their configuration files or even
just a symlinks to the special directory. So, it'll be better to
have a special directory like ld.conf.dir/ with symlinks to
the actual dynamic library paths, which will be updated safely
when new packages are installed/removed. But, we've no directory
access functions in the Pervasives library, and Unix library is
not accessible from the runtime - we can't rewrite dll.ml to
use this approach. May be, it'll be nice to provide some basic
directory access functionality from Pervasives?
