Hi,

  Some people are sometimes writing or thinking about writing
  applications in OCaml without knowing it OCaml is suitable
  for the kind of applications they're writing.

  So my question is for what kind of applications isn't OCaml
  suitable for and better written in a lower lever language?

  What is the real cost (in CPU) of interfaces to C libraries
  since some processing have to be performed in order to convert
  lower level types to Caml types?

  Thanks.

  Regards,
