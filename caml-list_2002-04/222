I'm currently working at using OCaml as a script top-level for Direct3D. For
now it works just fine, and this summer our team will work on a big game
project almost entirely written in OCaml. Altough "game" things are perhaps
not the kind of projects for which OCaml was actually designed, I think we
can get some big payoff by using such a nice langage.
