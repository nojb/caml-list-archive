 I can't understand, what is it for?!? We don't have file names with
spaces...

 Sure, it works too fine...

(from camltk418)

$ocamlc -custom -linkall -o ocamltktop -I ../support \
    -ccopt -L../support -cclib -lcamltk -ccopt "" \
 -cclib "-ltk8.3 -ltcl8.3 -ldl " -ccopt " -L/usr/X11R6/lib" \
 -cclib " -lSM -lICE -lX11  -lm" \
 toplevellib.cma camltk.cma topmain.cmo

i586-alt-linux-gcc:  -lSM -lICE -lX11  -lm: No such file or directory
Error while building custom runtime system

 With '-verbose' option I got something like
gcc ... ' -L/usr/X11R6/lib ' ' -lSM -lICE -lX11  -lm' ...
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 gcc treats this as a file name, not as an options, thanx
to the single quotes.
