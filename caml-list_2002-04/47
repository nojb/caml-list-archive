Great!  It seems that _many_ people in Japan (including me) are
interested in translating this book into Japanese.  Would it be
possible if somebody (I, for example) is determined to organize
translators?

One major problem would be that, unfortunately, not so many native
speakers of Japanese understand French.  So, the translation process
would be (if possible at all):

 (1) translate the English version into Japanese

 (2) check the translation against the Frensh version with a few
     people who understand both French and Japanese (and OCaml)

Another issue would be, of course, about the copyright.

What do you think about this idea?  Suggestions and advice are
welcome.
