Thanks for sharing your experience, I'm sure some readers of this list
will find it useful.

> Installing OCaml on Windows and Setting environment [variables]

I hope this mess will be fixed by the next release.  The installer we
use is unable to position environment variables automatically (like it
should).  I'm working on a registry-based hack to work around this.

I wasn't aware of this reimplementation of Microsoft's MASM.  Good to
know.  Microsoft itself is distributing MASM freely now, but well
hidden in various huge downloads...

In 3.04, ocamlmklib is available only for Unix, because that's where
it was most needed (to hide differences in shared lib building across
Unix platforms).  I agree a Windows version would be nice, to help
writing portable Unix/Windows makefiles.

Our upstream provider experienced major network problems at the
beginning of this month, culminating with a full-day outage on April
9th.  Sorry about that.

Yes, cryptokit could have used either zlib or camlzip to implement
compression, but I'm wary of cross-library dependencies and wanted
cryptokit to be usable on its own (with a stock OCaml installation).

Sounds like fun :-)  I agree it's more reasonable to bind to OpenSSL.
François Rouaix tried that a long time ago, before OpenSSL was called
OpenSSL, and at that time the documentation of that library was too
incomplete.  Things are probably better these days.

I was wondering whether the HumpS should not include a "project
proposals" section, just to give ideas to Caml developers that have
too much free time on their hands :-)
