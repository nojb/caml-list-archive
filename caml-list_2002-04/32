well, I don't really see the interest of such things.

If you already know the types you can put in this field, you can use a
new variant type :

type multi =
| Float of float
| Int of int
| Int2float of int -> float
....

otherwise, it seem (to me) that you may find better way of doing it
that using a "void*" C-ism.
