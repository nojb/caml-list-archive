I agree the situation is a bit confusing: there are two OCaml GUI
libraries based on Tk.  One (Labltk) is part of the standard
distribution, and used by the interface browser.  The other (Camltk)
is distributed separately and used in the demo that didn't compile.

Sorry for the scary error message, but it just says that Camltk and
Labltk have different interfaces!

Camltk is (for the time being) Unix-only.  Although Cygwin does heroic
efforts to emulate Unix, it's not quite Unix and I'm not surprised
that Camltk doesn't compile right out of the box under Cygwin.

This mess should be cleaned up in the future, as there is an effort in
progress to merge Labltk and Camltk, and install both in the standard
distribution.  In the meantime, I agree a Labltk version of the
examples is in order.

I don't doubt that, but my experience (as a long-time Unix user who
installed quite a bit of garbage of the kind you mention) is that
installing Unix software on Windows machines, even with Cygwin, is
often surprisingly hard.
