Here at Caltech, the compiler design class is taught using ocaml as the
implementation language.  Also, a new course on type theory is being taught
this term, using the book "Types in Programming Languages" by Benjamin
Pierce, which uses ocaml for all its examples.  I teach a programming
languages/projects course, and two of my students are doing their project
with ocaml.  As one of them said "I have yet to meet a serious hacker who
learned ocaml and didn't like it."  I feel the same way.
