That is precisely what you cannot do. If different modules were allowed to
store different types into that field, type conflicts could occur. (Imagine
one module chooses to write `A of int, and some other module attempts to
read `A of int -> int. An integer would be cast into a function, leading to
a crash.) In other words, to preserve separate compilation, the compiler
forces you to restrict that variant to a certain set by declaring its type.
The problem does not arise in the toplevel evaluator (ocaml) because it does
not perform separate compilation.
