Dear Andreas,

I'm juping in the middle of the discussion (not following the
context)...

It IS a difficult problem, but there is actually a hope.  Solomon
proved in '78 that the equivalence problem between a limited form of
parametric types reduces to the equivalence between deterministic
pushdown automata.  The latter had been a long-standing big problem.
Very recently ('97), it was solved: decidable.  If you are interested,
look into these papers.
