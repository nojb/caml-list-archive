Yeah, that's a very good idea; you can use it to write
text in your native language and worry about translations
later (indeed, delegate the work, since few people know
all the world's languages ..)

One could even "reprocess" the original source
code to replace the literals in say French with
ones in say English.. so I could read the code
more easily. 

"""BTW: Python triple quoted strings
are an interesting idea"""
