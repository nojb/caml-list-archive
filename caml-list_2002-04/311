Yeah. The correct answer is to fix the stupid dynamic
loader hackery used in unix systems. Obviously,
there should be a way to load a library from
the directory in which the caller is installed:
that is, the filename

    here/dllpcre.so.0

should be allowed, where 'here' means
" the place that dllpcre.so" was found.
That way would always work provided
both libraries are kept in the same directory.
It is the moral equivalent of what most unix
C compilers do with

#include "relative.h"

where the file is searched for in the directory
in which the including file is located.

Another solution would be to bind the inode
number directly into the caller so that only
physically removing the library could cause
a load failure (and in this case, that would seem
desirable .. you could even consider shared libraries
as being like directories .. so that removal
would fail while there were references ..)

So .. when are the Ocaml team going to design
an operating system based on theory not
historical hackery? <j/2>
