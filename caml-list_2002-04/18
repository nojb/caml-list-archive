Thanks a lot to all translators.

My printer is doing it's job now. :-)
Nevertheless I hope to get a non-draft-version
one day as a book.

Now (or at least, when the english book is published
by OReilly) I think, OCaml has the chance to get
more widespread and more people are using it then.

I do some marketing for it... :)


So, thanks again to the translaters - and thanks to the
developpers of OCaml itself.

Ciao,
   Oliver
