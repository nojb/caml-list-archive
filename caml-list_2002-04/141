It appears finally that explicit calls to Gc.compact solve the problem (or
at least one of my problems).

Setting Gc.max_overhead to a given value (e.g. 50%) didn't work in this
case.
Symptom: compactions are performed until a certain point
(in my case, 67 compactions), and then no compaction is triggered anymore
for a very long (infinite?) time, resulting in a linear increase of the
memory.



Thanks to all those that sent me their suggestions.

Au passage, un grand merci à l'équipe Caml pour son travail de très haute
qualité.
