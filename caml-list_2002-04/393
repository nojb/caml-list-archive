I have a philosophy .. a bit extreme perhaps .. I NEVER read anything
other than lines (or whole files). Always parse in-core. So the 'asymmetry'
doesn't worry me .. the existence of useless functions does though.
I'd get rid of all input other than read line/read file. Similarly,
though I'm slightly less pedantic here .. output should be formatted 
in-core.
So you only need one output function (print string).
I'd get rid of all the others .. and also get rid of printf ..

I can only site an example .. an academic compiler that printed
terms out  .. I had to rewrite reams of code
to generate strings when I needed to reroute the output ..
there was also a need to generate 'potential' output ..
diagnostic information that needed to be gleaned
to print an error message .. before it was known
if there was actually an error.

In-core formatting/parsing is sometimes slower
than doing the same job on output/input,
and may use more memory .. but the contexts where this is important are
fairly rare.
