The department of information science in u-tokyo has been practicing a
rather ambitious curriculum involving functional languages, including
OCaml, for undergraduate students.

 - In the winter semester of the 2nd year, Scheme is taught, where the
   last assignment is implementing a meta-circular Scheme interpreter.

 - In the summer semester of the 3rd year, OCaml (and also Prolog) is
   taught, where the assignments include implementing a mini-ML
   interpreter with ML-polymorphic type inference (and also a
   mini-Prolog interpreter in ML).

 - In the winter semester of the 3rd year, students implement a
   compiler of a simply typed higher-order functional language.  This
   is linked with another class where students design and implement
   their own original CPUs, onto which a ray tracer written in mini-ML
   is compiled and its speed is competed.

These may sound like crash courses, but given enough help, most
students just do fine, maybe because our department is rather small
(there are only 30-40 students per year).
