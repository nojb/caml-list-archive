Looking at the Google results, operator overloading has come up 
as a frequently discuseed topic.  Still I didn't find anything 
very useful in the posts that Google brought up.  Can anyone 
recommend a way to work around OCaml's lack of operator overloading
when dealing with matrices, vectors, and spinors?  Is there a 
way to implement this with ocamlp4?
