Now I am determined, received an official agreement from O'Reilly, and
have access to the latex source of the English version.  So I hereby
recruit the translators.:-) (Although there are already some, it is
definitely nicer to have more.)

***********************  Call for Translators  ***********************

Dear all,

[Please circulate this message to any people who may be interested.  I
apologize if you received multiple copies.]

The book "Developing Applications with Objective Caml" (by Emmanuel
Chailloux, Pascal Manoury, and Bruno Pagano) is a _very_ nice book
about OCaml, containing numerous examples of interesting applications
as well as comprehensible introductions to basic concepts of the great
language.  It has recently been translated from French into English
(http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/).  So why not translate it into
Japanese?

Although there are already many people in Japan who are studying
and/or using OCaml, even more people---not only in the academy, but
also in the industry---are actually interested but have little access
because of the barrier of (natural) languages.  Thus, a good book in
Japanese will be of great help.

I have already received an official agreement from O'Reilly about
translating the book and publishing it on the web for free.
(Publication from O'Rielly as a real book is also under
consideration.)  I have obtained access to the latex source of the
English version, and am going to set up a collaboration environment
for the Japanese translation as soon as possible.

Basically, the more translators we have, the easier the translation
becomes.  Ideally, I hope that the number of translators be equal to
the number of chapters (about 22).  So, if _anyone_ is interested in
joining this project, please contact me!

Best regards,

Eijiro Sumii (sumii@yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp)
