Thread support in native code on Mac OS X is basically not there.  
That's because the POSIX threads library in Mac OS X 10.1 is 
insufficiently featureful.  I'm told by reliable source that the POSIX 
thread support in the next version of Mac OS X will be much improved.  
Whether and when that meanders its way into a working Ocaml kit is a 
hard guess.
