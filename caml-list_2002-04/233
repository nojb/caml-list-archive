I am attempting to write an ocaml program which acts as a script when a data
file for it starts with

#!/myscript option1 option2 ...

The problem is that I am using the included Arg module to parse the arguments,
but when myscript is called it only sees one argument consisting of all the
arguments stuffed together... which the Arg routines don't care for much.

So does anyone have any ideas to work around this?
