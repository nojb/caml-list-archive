Hello,

first time I saw Some- and None-Identifiers
in Sourcecode, answered to my questions,
I thought about it, that it's pseudocode.

I have not found any description in the
Ref-Manual (for 3.01).

Yesterday again Some/None apperaead in the answers to
my questions, and I again looked for it.
In the 3.04-Manual there is no entry for Some/None
in the Index.

After downloading the textversion (oh, I like plaintext :)),
I found Some/None, but not very detailed explained.

How are Some/None defined, what are they good for?

A small, simple example will help a lot.

I found a definition of type option (parametrized type)
in the ocaml-3.04-refman.txt, but the typesystem itself
is new to me, because I'm an Ocaml-beginner.

Can you explain me this type?
It's used in some of the answers to my filesystem-traversing-
question and to understand it completely, I need this
Some-/None-knowledge.

Thanx In Advance,
              Oliver
