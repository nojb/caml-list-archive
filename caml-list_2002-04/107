So would I. Ideally, such a section would allow some kind of
collaborative work, so that people can discuss and modify the various
proposals. Maybe a Wiki would be a good start? Or a solution similar
to Scheme's SRFIs [1] where a design document is authored by someone,
discussed through a public mailing-list, revised and then finalised
(although this might be a little too strict for project proposals).
