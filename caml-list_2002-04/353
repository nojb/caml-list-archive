This is similar in idea to NULL pointer in C. E.g. struct foo *ptr
is NULL iff ptr cannot be assigned any reasonable value of type foo.
You can use 'foo option' in ML the same way -- x : foo option is
None if no foo is the right value for x.

let head x =
  match x with
  | h::_ -> Some h
  | [] -> None

Here if no reasoable value of the head of the list can be returned
'None' is used.

I personally use mutable fields in records of option type. They are
initially None, and are filled at some step of computations. However
this is non-functional/ugly/etc ;)
