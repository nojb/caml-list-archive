Mmm, i understand, ...

But yyou need a widget to hold the OpenGL area or something.

You could also try doing GLU/GLX whatever directly with appropriate C stubs,
it should not be to heavy.

That said, another way would be to run OpenGL on top of fbdev, this way, you
don't even have X running, which would be nice, you could even imagine a CD
with a kernel, some  drivers, and running your game directly, a bit like a
console, nice, not ?

The problem is that DRI is rather dependant on X right now, and doesn't make
provisions for someone wanting to run accelerated mesa in something which is
not X. You would need your own windows and such stuff though.

Then have a look at the people working with fbdev, it should give you what
you want. This idea has been discussed various time on the linux-fbdev mailing
list (on sourceforge i think) and there are people who want things like that
there, have a look at the archive.

A native fbdev binding would be nice also, i have proposed such a project to
my student, but nobody was interested and i lack the time to do so myself,
but then, maybe i will.

(reverting advi to use again the graphics module and having a fbdev
implementation of the graphics module would go a long step in the way of
having an easy to show without linux and advi installed presenter.
