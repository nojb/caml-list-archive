The only thing that needs to be changed is setting the installation path
(OCAML_LIB_INSTALL) correctly before "make"ing the library (as described
in the INSTALL-file; please do me all a favour and read it _before_
installation ;)

The linker stores the path to this directory in the generated
OCaml-library so that it can find any associated shared C-libraries.

The only known problem so far with the installation of Pcre-OCaml is
portability on MacOS X: shared libraries are not (yet) supported there,
because "libtool", which is used by the shipped C-library, obviously
misbehaves on this platform. Just compile the library statically then
as also described in the INSTALL-file.

My suggestion on the bug tracker was to automatically update the path to
shared C-libraries at runtime so that it also contains the directory in
which the associated OCaml-library resides.  This would make things much
easier for me, but as Xavier noted, this could cause endless troubles
with portability, because some systems may react differently to this hack.
