Although that kind of question cannot be really answered - because it
depends of your needs , the usage you're making , your knowledge of the
compiler , etc... - all I can say is that OCaml is fast, fast enough to be
used in many kind of applications, even using bytecode compilation. If you
want some benchwark , you can watch the Doug's Bagley's ones at
http://www.bagley.org/~doug/shootout/

All I can say for sure - to my mind - is that OCaml worth it.
