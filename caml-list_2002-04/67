Hi,

Daniel de Rauglaudre <daniel.de_rauglaudre@inria.fr> pinpointed the problem:

Thanks!

However, there is nothing on
http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/tutorial/tutorial002.html
that indicates that even this might be legal ---
``when'' is not mentioned on that page.
Would it perhaps make sense to include an adapted version
of the old OCaml Manual section on streams
that tries to give a general description instead of
just a few selected examples?

(Also I have found it useful to leave two blanks after '
 in parsers since in some instances I obtained very strange
 (lexical?) errors.
)


Best regards,
