A chdir from "/" to ".." will set the pwd to "/".
But the catalog-entries are not infenite.
So this can not be the problem here, because
I'm not really traversing the directory.
My code only does give back the list of entries
of a directory (I gave the wrong name: the name
is for the whole function/problem, but I only solved
the part of the problem: to get *all* entries of a
directory).



But you are right with your hint, that I have
to take care of "." and ".." when really
traversing the directory-structure and performing
actions on "." and "..".

E.g. renaming of "." and ".." is not working,
and the jump to "." or ".." can cause problems
(in that I ran with my C-version of the program,
because I have not thought about that problem =>
possible bugs surely will be done... ;-)).

In the case of my problem the explanation with
expanding the terms (order of evaluation/expanding)
is the key.
