Hi all,

I'm writing a commercial application in O'Caml.  We
need to run on all the main platforms (Linux, Windows
and Mac) and we'd like to use the native code compiler
and threads.

My first question: does O'Caml support threads in
compiled code in all the above platforms?  (It's ok if
Mac support is pending but Windows support is
essential.)

My second question: how do I get threads to work?  I'm
currently developing on Linux and there is no
threads.cmxa in my /usr/lib/ocaml (3.04 via Debian). 
The O'Caml book suggests I need to download and
compile my own ocamlopt including pthreads support. 
Is this correct?  What do I do for Windows?

Thanks,
Noel

PS:  Markus, I know you'll be reading this.  I still
prefer Scheme!!!! ;-)
