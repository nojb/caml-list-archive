There is no restriction on exportation, but you need to fill a declaration or
something with the NSA (i think) about it.

I followed from far all the discution about it when debian decided to move the
crypto stuff from its non-us servers into the main archive which is us based,
so it would be no problem for me to package it as a debian package. There may
be french issues though, since it is distributed from inria's web site. But
then i think, due to the Bank's pressions on the governement, that most of
those restriction were lifted a year or so ago, not sure though.
