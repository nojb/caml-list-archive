 No way. I have the same results with it... ocamlc tries to pass
all libraries in the one QUOTED string. And, there is no
need in that quotation - so, it'll be better to remove it.

 It'll be better to quote a space '\ ' just like \'...

 I think, it'll be better to forbid this. We don't know how external
linkers will treat this options - as file name, as option, as a space
