Nothing. I want LESS. I do NOT want Tk there, nor Gtk.
And for a game, not even the window manager.

I have a friend committed to using OpenGL to do a game.
He's NOT interested in widgets or window managers
from some toolkit. He'll program the buttons to behave
exactly as he want them too directly with the low
level graphics interfaces.

I want to implement a new kind of window manager
called HWM. I can't even host it on X (except at low level)
since X's idea of a WM is archaic and precisely what
I'm trying to replace.

So neither of us is remotely interested in hosting
OpenGL inside a widget of some brain dead toolkit
living inside some brain dead window manager.
We want to use Open GL to REPLACE these
components.

Ideally, Ocaml would have an OpenGL interface
with a binding which works inside the native
window manager (in a window -- for testing) but
which could be replaced by another binding (transparently)
which took over the whole screen, either
directly (for performance) or via low level primitives
of the native system (X windows etc) for hosting
within an existing environment.

So for example, on Linux, I'd want a Mesa binding.
