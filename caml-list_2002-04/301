Tk is designed for interactive GUI-Applications. And, yes,
it provides graphical output with the canvas-widget.

But I think that OpenGL is designed for having 3D-animations
and similar stuff, and not to put buttons on the screen,
on which the user can click.
And I think you have to reinvent the "button-wheel" in OpenGL.

Maybe it would be a good idea to marriage OpenGL and Tk,
so that Tk provides easy GUI-design and OpenGL provides
powerful 3D-capabilities.

Maybe there should be a GUI-Lib for OpenGL, or a 3D-canvas-
widget for Tk (OpenGL-canvas for Tk).

Ciao,
