Hello,

I have tried to install OCaml 3.04 on a PPC-Linux.

I got problems (compilation-errors (Assembler-Messages))
when doing an "make opt.opt".
The I tried to do the opt-compilations separetly
and there were no problems.
After doing that I tried again 2make opt.opt" and it
failed again.

What is the problem? Isn't "makr opt.opt" the same
as "make ocamlc.opt; make ocamlopt.opt; make ocamllex.opt" ?

Is that a known problem?

Should I send the compilation-output to that list or to
a developper, who is specialized on PPC-platforms?

Here is, what I have done:
=========================================
./configure
=> OK

make world
=> OK

make bootstrap
=> OK

make opt
=> OK

make ocamlc.opt         # to build a native-code version of ocamlc
=> OK

make ocamlopt.opt       # to build a native-code version of ocamlopt
=> OK

make ocamllex.opt       # to build a native-code version of ocamllex
=> OK

make opt.opt            # to build all of them
=> COMPILATION-FAILURE
=========================================

Ciao,
   Oliver
