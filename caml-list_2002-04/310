Hi,

I have found a working version:

It works with

 let rec traversedir dir =
           try ( traversedir dir @ [Unix.readdir dir] ) with
           End_of_file -> [];;

...but I have to add the recursive traversing-call
(if Unix.st_kind is a S_DIR, I have to open that
 dir and go into it too... so I may add the
 opendir/closedir-calls into the traversedir itself...)

But I'm wondering if I better should have a list as
an addtional parameter, on which I append with readdir.

Any design-hints are welcome.


Ciao,
   Oliver
