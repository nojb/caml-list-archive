Subject: [Caml-list] no dynamic linking with Ocaml 3.04 possible...

Hello,

I have now installed Ocaml 3.04 and tried to use
loading-statements from within the toplevel.

The 3.02-Ocaml didn't say anything useful, but Ocaml
3.04 now says: dynamik linking not available.

What is the problem here?
On the machine where I have installed the new Ocaml,
it's running under linux.

If Ocaml uses the dlopen(3)-calls it should be possible
that Ocaml can use this feature here.

Maybe the configure-script does not detect this possibility.

I have not seen any comments on that matter in the
README/INSTALL-files, and configure didn't print
any help-message with "-h", "--h", "-help", or "--help"
commands on the command-line.

Any hints, how to use that feature?

Ciao,
   Oliver
