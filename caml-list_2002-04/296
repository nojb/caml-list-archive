Well, you are both right of course, but the real problem here was me.
There is no problem with pcre-ocaml if you tell it where to look for
its libraries. I had just missed setting OCAML_LIB_INSTALL correctly
when I installed pcre-ocaml.

So, it's my bad and I promise to _read_ the documentation instead of
just _looking_ at it next time ;)
