 I already knew that parameter, but it is not what I would like to have.
 Here comes the problem with more informations: when using findlib with
 libraries providing more than one .cma (e.g. lablgtk), I expect
 findlib to add to the linking phase every .cma and ocamlc to not consider
 all the unuseful ones. Since ocamlc still considers the linking options of
 the .cma, I can't no more use findlib in that way and I have to add
 O(2^n) rules to the META file to choose exactly which .cma to add.
 If I use the -noautolink option, instead, it effects every .cma
 (even the ones belonging to other packages) and I have to add many many
 linking options by hand (and so why should I use findlib or something
 similar at all?)

 I hope to have been more clear.
