No. Yes.:-)

Games are the ultimate application.
You need a very good language to write a decent game
and have it work. Ocaml is a superb choice.
It is well suited to it. Have a look at the complete
and utter rubbish the commercial sector generally offers:
most of them can't even get basic game logic right.

Oh yes, they have superb graphics ... elaborate scenarios ..

Please. Write a decent game. There isn't one.
