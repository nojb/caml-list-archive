The engineer students with a major in IT at the French University of Civil
Aviation (ENAC, Toulouse - www.enac.fr) are given OCaml courses during the
first year (it is the first programming language taught here), followed by
an algorithmic course with implementation in OCaml. They can use the
language in their final project (3rd year) as well.

Some first year students arrives here with a little practice learned during
the " classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles " (two or three years of
intense preparatory courses before entering an engineering school) if they
have chosen optional IT classes (or something like that, I'm not to sure).

BTW, our students often are eager to work abroad for their final training
period, if it's what you meant... (and those willing to developp with OCaml
are often the best ones :-)
