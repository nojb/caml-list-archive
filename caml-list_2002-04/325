Subject: [Caml-list] How to read three integers from a text-file... ?

Hello list,

Is there a clean way (a one-liner) to read a constant number of
integers separated by whitespace from a text-file (or stdin) ?

I mean something like 
scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c) in C, or
readln(a,b,c) in Pascal

I know I can use String.index, Str.split or read char by char (this
sucks), but you have to admit the Pascal or even C versions are more
appealing.


I am asking this question, because our students want to use Ocaml for
competing in various programming contests, where the comfort and speed
(of programming) are essential.

Moreover in such contests the use of external libraries (Str) if often
forbiden.


If the easy way of doing this is missing, may I suggest adding it to
the standard library?
