Francois Pottier, speaking of using a "Functional Unparsing" like 
approach (cps) to regexps writes:

That is not necessarily a bad thing.  The classic string-based regexp
syntax has often been criticized for unreadability.  Scsh's SRE
sexp-based regexp syntax may be an improvement.  I imagine that
something using this a cps approach could be an improvement, since the
"Functional Unparsing" approach to printing seems to provide a
reasonable notation.
