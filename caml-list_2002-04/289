It seems to me that you hadn't set the environment variable
"OCAML_LIB_INSTALL" to your installation directory before "make"ing the
library, i.e. it's default is "+contrib" now:

[snip]
> access("/usr/local/lib/ocaml/contrib/libpcre.so.0",0) ERR#2 'No such file or directory'
[snip]

The path leading to this directory is added to the generated OCaml-library
so that it can find the shared C-library. Usually things should also work
when you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately in your shell or even add
this path to your global /etc/ld.so.conf. However, the preferred solution
is surely to let the library now where to find things it depends on.
