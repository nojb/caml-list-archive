The newest version of Osiris which includes lots of new stuff (icons,
treeview, richedit, etc...) is now available here :
http://warplayer.free.fr/files/osiris_dev.zip
Lots of bugs found in the previous release have been corrected , but that's
still a "dev" version , where big pieces can still be changed before the
upcoming Release. If you have any suggestion on design or any particular
needs, please let me know. I'm also looking for people to help me writing
nice Osiris tutorials.
