Hello list,

At Warsaw University, first-year students have the "Introduction to
programming" course. Since last year a part of them (about one third)
- the volunteers - are taught the functionnal approach, using
Ocaml. They are doing fine, but one can see that most of them already
know C or Pascal.

By the way, it is a great pleasure to see how the understanding of
such functions like fold is slowly coming to them :-)

Later in the cursus (about the third-fourth year), there is a more
"serious" functionnal programming course. The practical things are
taught using Ocaml, SML or sometimes Haskel (with some deeper insight
on the laziness), depending on the person who does the course.

Cheers

Jacek
