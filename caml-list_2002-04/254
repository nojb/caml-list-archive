Our main target are Windows users, we have no plan on porting the game under
Unix/Linux.
It's true that OpenGL is portable, but Direct3D enable a better control of
the video card, and the latest features such as shaders are easily
accessible, it's also fully supported by most of the video cards, and
drivers for D3D are frequently updated.

But after all, a game is a game, and if it is well designed (hope it is :)
then you always can modify your low level calls to switch from D3D to OGL
and vice-versa.
