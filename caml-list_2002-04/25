I have an odd typing problem, odd because it occurs only when using ocamlc 
and not ocaml.  I've cut my code down to the following small snippet:

type 'a my_object = {
  partner : 'a my_object ref;
  data : 'a ref
};;

let rec object1 = {
  partner = ref object2;
  data = ref `PNone
}
and object2 = {
  partner = ref object2;
  data = ref `PNone
};;

That runs fine when passed to ocaml, but when I run it through ocamlc I get:

File "foo.ml", line 6, characters 18-66:
The type of this expression, _[> `PNone] my_object,
contains type variables that cannot be generalized

What's wrong with my code?  Thanks in advance!
