Almost correct answer: the problem is of course with libpcre.so.0, not
dllpcre.so. So if you put libpcre.so.0 in any place where the system
loader can find it (like /usr/local/lib, but also any directory in
LD_LIBRARY_PATH), things will work smooth.

More basically, I would say that pcre-ocaml is not packaged correctly:
for this kind of use, either the code of libpcre.so should be included
in dllcpre.so (not too hard), or libcpre.so.0 should be installed to a
public directory. Unfortunately the system loader does not provide any
interface to change the load path cleanly.
