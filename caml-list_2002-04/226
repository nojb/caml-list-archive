/me is bad (bis)

and worse, it seems I'm still missing something since subsumption is still not

What I now understand is that it allows to have 
  [ `E_rabbit | `E_human] T.energy

  [ `E_rabbit ] T.energy
which is needed to have the food tied to its eaters instead instead of
having the animal tied to its accepted_food.
