I did not mean that we are going to change the current printf into
a syntax extension. I just said that it is possible. The current
implementation is very practical, since you can manipulate format
variables, and though it supposes a strange typing. With a syntax
extension, you would not have this strange typing and that ability
to use format variables: it is just an interesting exercise. I
did it one day, but I did not terminated it.

About scanf as a Camlp4 syntax extension, I just looked at it: not
a so interesting exercice, actually. We need library functions reading
integers or strings (but not systematically reading a line), skipping
spaces and so on. With a good module with these functions, we are
very close to the result, and Camlp4 brings very few more.
