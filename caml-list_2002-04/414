Some answers for Diego's questions about the new "Project proposals"
section of the Caml Hump:

- Nature of the proposed work: I think everything goes, from short
projects (a few modules) to more ambitious, long-term developments
(interfaces with large libraries, design and implementation of
complete frameworks, etc).  Still, it's better if the project is
relatively self-contained and can be described relatively precisely.
E.g. "implementing the TLS protocol" is fine, but "design and
implement a new protocol for authentication and confidentiality over
the Web" is perhaps too imprecise (and too ambitious :-).

- Who can make proposals and how they are selected: everyone is
welcome to make proposals, either on this list or by mailing
hump@pauillac.inria.fr.  Maxence Guesdon maintains the Humps,
and asks us (the Caml team) if there are questions on the
appropriateness of a topic.

- How to make a proposal: a one-liner plus a link to relevant
documentation or specification is fine, e.g. "a library to handle MIME
encoding and mailbox parsing" with a link to the relevant RFC.  If you
wish to provide more details, you're most welcome to write a more
complete description on a Web page, and send us the URL.

- Should we include links to projects already in progress
(e.g. Bedouin): why not, if the organizers of these projects wish to
(maybe they have enough volunteers already).

Hope this answers your questions,
