Hi Noel,

Hopefully in the field of AI?

Still... - but not for long if you stay on this list ;-)

Only a few weeks ago I managed to convert some staunch CL-programming
colleague to OCaml (after one year of merciless proselytizing!).

Since then he has become a devote follower: whenever he runs into
a difficult programming task now, instead of helplessly exclaiming
"O God?", as he did before, he confidently prays "O'Caml!".

Now I am looking for my next victim, hm... :-)

Cheers,
Markus
