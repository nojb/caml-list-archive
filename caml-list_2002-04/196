I once proposed a sorted output for ocamldep that could be used as the
linking order. The output would be sorted such that files that come
early in the link order also come early in the output. A simple sed
script then could strip away dependencies to get just the file names for
linking.  I still like the idea but my patch for ocamldep that
implemented the topological ordering did not make it into the
distribution.
