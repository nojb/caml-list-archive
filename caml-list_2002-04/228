That's precisely where I learned the technique.  It's true I forgot the 
"phantom type" terminology, but the contribution I was trying to make to 
the list is that such types are frequently useful in representing 
complicated associations between related class hierarchies.

I don't think Pixel's exercise is really covered well by the 
"subject-observer" pattern, and I wonder if the pattern I used in my 
solution is one that is already identified by a better name than the 
"association-by-phantom-type" pattern.

Surely somebody has already published a paper on this by now, right?
