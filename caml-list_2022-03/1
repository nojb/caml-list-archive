Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] OCaml User Survey 2022

--000000000000a6319c05d9284bc2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hi everyone,

we are delighted to announce the OCaml User Survey 2022. With this survey,
the OCSF is trying to get a better picture of the OCaml community and its
needs.
It would be very helpful if you could take a few minutes (10 to 15) to fill
the survey and share it with other OCaml programmers.

https://forms.gle/oKy2Joz1cZhCPNtf6

The survey is run by the OCaml Software Foundation[1]. It builds on the
previous iteration[2] issued in 2020. The results will be published here on
discuss and on the  website of the OCSF.
We would like to particularly thank @cjr for his help as well as everyone
who commented on the previous survey. We tried our best to take all remarks
into account but surely missed something.
Don't hesitate to give us your feedback (on the discuss thread or by
sending me a message or email).

The survey will remain opened until March 11th 2022 (AOE).

Cheers,
