			CALL FOR PAPERS
			Reflection'99 
		The Second International Conference on
		Meta-Level Architectures and Reflection
			Saint-Malo, France
			July 19--21, 1999
			reflection99@emn.fr

OBJECTIVES

            Over the last 15 years, Meta-Level Architectures and
            Reflection have attracted the attention of researchers
            throughout computer science. Reflective and meta-level
            techniques have now matured to the point where they are
            being used to address real-world problems in such areas
            as: programming languages, operating systems, databases,
            distributed computing, expert systems and web-computing.

            Following Reflection'96 held in San Francisco, this
            conference will provide an opportunity for researchers
            with a broad range of interests in meta-level architectures
            and reflective techniques to discuss recent developments
            in this field.  It will also provide an opportunity for
            researchers to discuss their work with colleagues from
            other parts of computing.  The conference aims not only at
            advances within the field of reflection and meta-level
            architectures, but also seeks to bridge related
            developments in other fields of computer science using
            reflection as the binding theme.  In addition to paper
            presentations and invited talks, time will be reserved for
            intensive discussions on topics ranging from conceptual
            foundations to practical applications.

PAPER SUBMISSION
            Papers will be accepted on topics including, but not
            limited to, the following:

	Adaptative software components
	Metamodels (UML, CORBA, etc.)
	Formal methods

            An original manuscript lpr-written in English, should be submitted no
            later than February 1, 1999 to the program chair.  
            Electronic submissions of up to 20 pages (Postscript
            format following the LNCS guidelines) to
            reflection99@emn.fr are highly encouraged.  An electronic
            mail address should be included; confirmation and all further
            correspondence with the program chair can be done electronically.

            Papers will be reviewed by the program committee;
            acceptance will be based on depth, quality, relevance, and
            scope.  Accepted papers will be published in the
            conference proceedings, which  will appear in the
            series ``Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences'' (LNCS) from
            Springer-Verlag.


LOCATION
            Saint-Malo is located in Brittany, approximately 400 km
            west of Paris, on the Channel.  Known as the
            corsair city, its area is truly wonderful, including
            the famous Mont St-Michel abbey.  For more information (in
            French), see http://www.ville-saint-malo.fr/.
            The congress center, le Palais du Grand Large, is located
            on the sea front, 200 meters away from the historical
            center.
