I am about to implement a wavelet-based audio compression algorithm,
part of my Ph.D. research, in OCaml.  To this end, I must read and
write binary data streams representing the input digital audio and the
output compressed audio stream.

Is there a standard way of handling binary file I/O in OCaml, or must
I resort to handling input and output bitstream formatting in C?

Thanks,
John Whitley
