No, and unfortunately it isn't likely that I can switch to Linux. 

It appears that the Tcl C interface has changed a bit in going from 7.6 to 
8.0, and while the Unix port was not affected the Windows port was. The 
relevant sections from the Tcl 8.0.3 distribution are:

    8. Tcl_CreateFileHandler and Tcl_DeleteFileHandler now take Unix
    fd's and are only supported on the Unix platform.  Please use the
    Tcl_CreateChannelHandler interface instead.

    9. The C APIs for creating channel drivers have changed as part of
    the new notifier implementation.  The Tcl_File interfaces have been
    removed.  Tcl_GetChannelFile has been replaced with
    Tcl_GetChannelHandle.  Tcl_MakeFileChannel now takes a platform-
    specific file handle.  Tcl_DriverGetOptionProc procedures now take
    an additional interp argument.

which affect the file ocamltk41\support\cltkFile.c, which uses the
obsolete Tcl_GetFile function and Tcl_File type. My perusal of the rest
of the sources didn't turn up any other porting issues, but I haven't
tried to rewrite and compile yet.
