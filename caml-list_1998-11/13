Hi,

Unix port *was* also affected. We had to write a patch to compile the whole
stuff.

If TCL_MAJOR_VERSION is defined >= 8 then the compiled source will use the new
Tcl_GetFile.
cltkEval.c, cltkImg.c, cltkFile.c where patched to use the new API (you can
find locations by "grep-ing" TCL_MAJOR_VERSION or 8).

That's strange, because all you said seems to be patched in the last release.
Make sure that when compiling, TCL_MAJOR_VERSION is defined and >= 8.
If the problems are still present, then we should have a look with Francois
Rouaix.
