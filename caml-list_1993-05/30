The 8086 version should work fine. But it's severely limited in
memory, and rather slow.

In theory, all you need to run the 386 version is a VCPI-compliant
memory manager. Windows only provide DPMI memory management. So, if you
somehow manage to run Windows under a VCPI memory manager, Caml Light
should run fine. I've heard that the latest release of QEMM might be
able to do that, but that's a wild guess.

None that I know of. If anyone has some practical experience with
porting Unix programs to 32-bit Windows applications, I'd like to hear
about it (how hard is it, which compiler to use, etc.).
