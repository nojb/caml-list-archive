Bonjour a tous les caml-light user.

Y en a-t'il qui connaisse SUIT ...... Enfin un moyen simple pour ecrire des
interfaces portables en C (ANSI) en s'embetant un minimum (tout ou presque se
fait a la sourie, et les possibilite depasse de loin le gadget). 

Et qui dit en C dit en caml-light .....

Je crois que cela serait genial si quelqu'un pouvait interfacer SUIT et
caml-light. Avis aux amateurs ....

A toutes fins utiles, je joins les informations relatives a SUIT que j'ai
obtenues par mail.

	   Copyright 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 the University of Virginia

This is an automatically generated message from the SUIT project at the
University of Virginia.  Because of SUIT's unexpected popularity, we have
changed our support mechanisms.  As of March 13, 1993, mail to this address
will automatically respond with this general information message.  Please
read it thoroughly, as it mostly likely contains the information you're
looking for.  For technical support for answers to "how do I" questions, you
can send mail to our user community mailing list at:

	suit-users@virginia.edu

To get on this mailing list, just send your email address to:

	suit-users-request@virginia.edu	  

At the *end* of this message, there are mail addresses for bug reports and
administrative support.  Thanks for your continued interest in SUIT, which
has now been distributed to thousands of sites, and has reached all
continents but Antarctica.  (we're still hopeful about Antarctica!)

FIRST, THE BORING LEGAL STUFF:
------ --- ------ ----- -----

SUIT, including all its source code, is available without charge to
Universities and other non-profit institutions.  For-profit site licenses
are individually negotiated for a price in the neighborhood of $25,000 (Yes,
this is a big number, but if we have to deal with lawyers, we want it to be
worth our while.)  We are also considering a "shrink-wrap" per-CPU license.
Email to the administrative mail address at the bottom of this file if you
are interested in a commercial license.

No one may redistribute SUIT without our express written permission,
although executable programs built with SUIT may be redistributed.

Anyone may ftp SUIT for evaluation purposes.  If it takes you longer than
about two weeks to "evaluate" SUIT, you're probably "using" not "evaluating"
SUIT and are violating our copyrights.  

OKAY, ON TO THE FUN STUFF:
----- -- -- --- --- -----

SUIT provides a standard library of screen components (buttons, menus,
sliders, etc.), and allows interactive layout and specification of user
interfaces.  The user interface to a SUIT program is editable even while the
application runs.  Programs using SUIT are written in ANSI-C.  SUIT runs on
UNIX/X, Color Macintosh, DOS, and Windows ; a single application source file
may be recompiled to run on all platforms.

SUIT was designed to be easy to learn - we view it as "the Pascal of UI
toolkits."  Learning from a 10-page written tutorial, our undergraduates
have been able to use SUIT productively after 2 hours.  This is possible
because we rely more heavily on interactive tools than previous toolkits,
and because the entire system as been designed to be easy to learn.

SUIT's biggest advantages are:
	- it runs across a very wide variety of hardware platforms
	- it has a documented 2 hour learning curve for beginners
	- it's very lightweight; relatively small amount of code

SUIT's weaknesses are:
	- although our software is stable, we aren't a "commercial vendor"
	- like any toolkit, we may not have "that special widget" you want
	  (although we make it *very* easy to make your own widget)
	- we're in C, not C++ 

STATUS:
------

	SUIT v2.3 can run your ANSI-C application transparently across:
	 * UNIX/X platforms: SPARC, SGI, IBM RS/6000, DECSTATION, Sun3, HP
	 * Color Macintosh & Macintosh Powerbooks
	 * DOS 5.0
	 * MS-Windows 3.1

	We highly recommend that you FTP down our demo program,
	which comes with an ASCII text README file to walk you
	through SUIT's highlights.  If you like the demo, then
	look in that README file for instructions on how to
	import and install a full release of SUIT.
	
  
   WHAT DO I NEED AT MY SITE IN ORDER TO USE SUIT? 
   ===================================================
	This all depends on the platform you will use:

	X WINDOWS: 
		You will need at least X11R4 and gcc 2.1 or later.
		Or any ANSI-compatible C compiler. 
		(If all you have is gcc 1.3X, send us mail. 'gcc -v'
		is how to find out what you have).		

		On the RS6000, SUIT is known to work with 
		version 3.1.5 and 3.1.6 of the operating system 
		and version 1.1 of the xlc compiler. 
				
	MAC:
		System 6.0 or 7.0 and Think C 5.0

	DOS:
		DOS version 5.0 and Borland C++ version 3.1
	
	WINDOWS:
		Microsoft Windows 3.1 and Borland C++ version 3.1

  
   HOW TO GET A DEMO OF SUIT
   ===================================================
	The demo is made up of the following files:

	demo		-- an executable demo program
				(demo.exe on DOS/Windows platforms)
	demo.sui 	-- a support data file that demo needs
	README		-- an ASCII text file that explains SUIT and 
				tells how to get the whole SUIT distribution

	The files are in the directory
		pub/suit/demo/<arch> 

	where <arch> is one of the following supported architectures:
		sparc
		sun3
		rs6000
		sgi (note: this version uses X-windows, not "straight GL") 
		dec
		dos
		windows_3.1
		mac (these files are binhexed) 

	Download these three files and run demo program (detailed
	directions are below, if you need them). If you like the demo,
	the README file has step by step instructions for getting
	the entire SUIT distribution. 
	
	Again, thanks for your interest in SUIT.
