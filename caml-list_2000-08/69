I have taken a first crack at getting O'Caml 3.00 to compile and run under
Cygwin,

- "./configure; make world; make install" works.
- The replay debugger works intermittently
- The native code compiler doesn't seem to run.

I would be interested in comparing notes and patches with anyone who has
tried this. I am particularly interested in getting the debugger to work
reliably.

Thanks.
