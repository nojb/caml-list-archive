Hello!
The problems with 'Access forbidden' were fixed.
URL is: http://young.tepkom.ru/asdl2caml
I apologize for inconvenience.
The site is very new, and the problems may still occur.
Please do not hesistate to write me, if you encounter any.

BTW, I found several bugs during testing, so now 0.6 version is
released.

Thanks to all who reply!

By the way, Daniel Wang has wrote to me and informed me,
that asdlGen v.2.0(beta) has the support for OCaml. 
(but it still requires SML/NJ installed).
So I guess our patch for asdlGen 1.2 will never be released...

Regards,
Dmitri
