I set of patches and instructions for getting O'Caml 3.00 to compile and
run under Cygwin 1.1.x is available at,

    http://www.cs.cornell.edu/stodghil/ocaml-cygwin/

At the moment,
- "./configure ; make world" works 
- bytecode and native code compilers work 
- the debugger appears to work. 
- labltk and ocamlbrower compile and link, but not tested. 

The changes that are in these patches were written almost entirely by
Xavier Leroy and committed to the O'Caml CVS repository. All that I did
wasextract them and package them so that they could be applied directly to
the O'Caml
3.00 tarball.

If you have any comments or questions (or even better yet, more patches!),
please send them to me at stodghil@cs.cornell.edu
