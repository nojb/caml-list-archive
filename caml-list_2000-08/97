While the domain of the challenge task has not been revealed,
presuming it's one well-suited to O'caml does anyone want enter an
O'caml team? Given that ICFP'{98,99} first places were won by domain
experts (although not necessarily the other winning categories!), a
good strategy seems to be putting together a team with a large number
of members on the hope that some of them will happen to be experts in
the domain of the challege. After the challenge has been revealed, the
remaining team members can then withdraw to support roles, trying
to break the models the domain experts have created.

Will Inria be entering this year?

Cheers,
Julian.
