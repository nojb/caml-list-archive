I haven't heard of it, and that would be a major undertaking.  It's
like hand surgery: in principle, it is possible to reconnect a hand to
a wrist; in practice, there are so many tendons, nerves and vessels to
reconnect...

GC bugs are also quite a nightmare...

Damien Doligez's PhD thesis was precisely on a concurrent collector in
the style of OCaml's collector.  (Actually, this is backwards: the
concurrent collector was designed first, and the current OCaml
incremental GC was derived from it.)  The two POPL papers and the
dissertation available from http://pauillac.inria.fr/~doligez/caml-guts/
give a good idea of how difficult efficient concurrent collection is.
