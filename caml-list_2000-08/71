Hello, All.

You know, there are no english textbook on O'Caml.
Manual is not the best choice for a novice.
So I am trying to study Ocaml language using "The Functional
Approach to Programming" of Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny, 
which is actually about Caml Light. 

Some Caml Light code from this book (and form others) does not work 
for Ocaml, for example, Ocaml report a syntax
error for a definition from page 25
  
 let neg = fun  true  -> false | false -> true ;;
  
1) Could anyone point out other known basic discrepancy between Caml   
Light and Ocaml that were not mentioned in the FAQ?
  
2) I know there is a French book "Diveloppement d'applications avec   
Objective Caml". Is it suits for studying functional programming and 
OCaml for peoples without any background in the functional programming?

3) Why did the meaning of "fun" change?
  
Thank you in advance.
  
Sergei.
