The implementation model for exceptions is similar.  However, the
virtual machines of Caml Light and OCaml have significant differences;
not to mention the OCaml native-code compiler.

You can always run your tests under Moscow ML, but don't extrapolate
the results to Caml Light and especially not to OCaml; that would not
be scientific.
