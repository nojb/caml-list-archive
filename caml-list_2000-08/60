Uff, yes, indeed, my explanation of "Store_{whatever}" was actually
correct, but I forgot about the specific treatment of double arrays (or
more precisely: values with the "Double_array_tag"), which are unboxed and
therefore do not fall under the rules for structured blocks.

Sorry for the confusion! Since I had seen problems with "Store_{...}"
already three times, I didn't think further about the special case...
