Thank you for your explanation: I can now explain the issue I was
addressing using your own terminology.

I was addressing the meaning of the basic exception raiser, the very
primitive that you named here the "primitive '_raise' construction"; I
think that the meaning of this primitive should be fixed once and for
all, and the simplest way to do so is to turn out its name into a
keyword.

(Hence, if we still give to this primitive its usual name, it suggests
to turn ``raise'' into a keyword; if we use your naming convention
then ``_raise'' should be turned into a keyword.)
