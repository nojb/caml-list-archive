I would say that Store_{whatever} macros are useful for data structures
that are created in the C-world but should be managed (and destroyed) in
the OCaml-world, WITHOUT any further access on the data by the C
part. For all other cases, use the Field_{whatever} macros. With this
macro, the OCaml GC won't try to have a look at your C data structures.

By the way, Markus has already found a bug like this in my own code. See
this message for further details on how the bug is triggered :
  http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200002/msg00074.html

I hope it helps,
d.
