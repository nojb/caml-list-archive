Have you thought about employing some kind of monadic type system?
The type system would allow you to isolate those program parts which
eventually involve `read' (and thus must be control-inverted during
compilation) from those which do not (and thus may be compiled in
direct style).

I am no expert in monads, but this seems to sound rather natural.
Maybe a look at how Haskell is typed and compiled may help?
