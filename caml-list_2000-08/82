You're right, there is no really good example that uses redefinition
of raise. That's why the advantage to be able to redefine it may
overcome the inconvenience of not being always sure of its meaning.

You're right, we don't want to have zillions of keywords. On the other
hand, you also need to have some level of confidence into the words
you use in the language, otherwise you can write horrors as the famous

if else then else else then

when then and else are not reserved.
