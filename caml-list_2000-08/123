You can see our entry at http://caml.inria.fr/icfp00-contest/,
including some cool test images.  The topic (ray tracing) wasn't
exactly our cup or tea, but we had a big team (7 persons) that
self-organized rather efficiently along the "surgical team" model,
and fortunately included one excellent mathematician who zipped
through all the 3D geometric nonsense with amazing speed.  We'll see
how it goes in a few weeks...
