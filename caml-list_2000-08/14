Dear collegues,

I am writing an article about imperative programming, and would like to
use Caml for examples.  It's been a bit hard to work from the manuals on
the web (partly because the network keeps doing fishy things).  I would
really appreciate it if you could point me to a comprehensive manual that
covers things like IO, and which I can also easily print and put on my
desk (i.e., something in .ps or .dvi format, for example).

Also, I would certainly appreciate your input on the first draft when it
is ready, so let me know if you are interesting in a taking a look.

Many thanks in advance,

Walid.
