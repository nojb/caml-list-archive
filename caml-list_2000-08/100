That's one strategy.  So far, teams have been relatively small and
composed of members of the same institution -- it helps to be able to
work in the same room!  But maybe a big, distributed team can also do well.

At any rate, I encourage everyone to participate in the challenge (and
use OCaml for it, of course).  Here is the URL for this year's
contest:

        http://www.cs.cornell.edu/icfp/

Teams must register in advance, it seems.

Yes, of course!
