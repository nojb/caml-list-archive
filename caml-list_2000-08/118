There are books on caml in English. I applaud the brave Inria
researcher who wrote the following. The `caml-style' photo suggests it

Sex and the Single Camel 
 Novel by Phil Clendenen 

 If you'd like to feast on the peach-fuzz boys, kif, and the streaming
 life of Morocco tongue-stroked earlier by Burroughs, Ginsberg, and
 Bowles, Sex and the Single Camel is for you. The language is most
 original and the eroticism perpetual and, yes, bizarre! You may want
 to rush to Maroc and never return.  - Robert Peters
