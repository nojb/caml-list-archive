Hi,

 Kwangkeun>  I have a quick question. Does OCaml have the same
 Kwangkeun>  implementation for exceptions as in CamlLight 0.7?
 
This I cannot answer with authority (but according to my memory, the
answer is yes)

 Kwangkeun>  if CamlLight implementation of exceptions is the same as
 Kwangkeun>  in OCaml we can use the Moscow ML without having to
 Kwangkeun>  translate our SML benchmarks into Caml.

I don't think that this will measure what you think it will measure.
Remember that exception differs slightly in SML and Caml: In SML
exceptions are generative.  In Moscow ML 2.00[1] _all_ SML exceptions
are roughly encoded as Caml exceptions of the form:

        exception SMLexc of string ref * 'a

(In the modified CamlLight runtime system of cause.  The code above is
not valid Caml.)

Where the string ref corresponds to the name of the exception.

Hope this helps.


Cheers,

--Ken


[1] Earlier implementations of Moscow ML used a much complicated
encoding where some exceptions had one encoding and others another.
