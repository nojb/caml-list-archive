Subject: change warning to error?
Sender: weis@pauillac.inria.fr

Is it possible to instruct ocamlc that the `partial match' warning
should be treated as an error, i.e., that it stop compilation and
produce no output?  In using SML/NJ, I have found this option extremely
useful---I don't have to worry about overlooking a warning in six
pages of compiler output.
