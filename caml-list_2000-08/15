   Subject: change warning to error?
   
   Is it possible to instruct ocamlc that the `partial match' warning
   should be treated as an error, i.e., that it stop compilation and
   produce no output?  In using SML/NJ, I have found this option extremely
   useful---I don't have to worry about overlooking a warning in six
   pages of compiler output.
   
What about compiling from emacs and using C-x ` to step through
all errors and warnings?

Bye,

Hendrik
