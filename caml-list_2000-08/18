I agree this would be useful, although my problem is different:
when I compile some modules that get this warning, I _expect_
it due to changes in earlier type declarations, but I'm not up
to working on it. The problem is that a subsequent 'make' will not
recompile the module because it was previously successful.
So I don't even get to look through six pages of warnings: the whole
build looks clean. (I have to 'make clean' to see the problem,
which I may forget to do).
