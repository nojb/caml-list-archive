It's a way to "hide" functions inside of other functions.
Like in the tail-recursive case I posted, I cluttered the
namespace with the second "internal" recursive function.
In a real program it is better to hide that "internal" function
from the outside world:

let firstFunction x = blah blah
  in
     secondFunction y = blah blah (uses firstFunction);;

Thanks,
