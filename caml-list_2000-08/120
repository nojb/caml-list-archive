Hi,

I'm not an OCaml user but we're examining the option of using OCaml to
allow the users to extend our application with new classes they write
themselves (all conforming to a common interface. The catch is that we
would like to be able to execute the user's new code line-by-line.
I read a post which talked about using the OCaml evaluator
Toploop.runscript. This would appear to provide us with an acceptable
solution.
Is this the case, and if so does the executed script run in the
application's environment, or can we access data structures in the
script's environment.
We are currently planning to write the application in C++ for
performance reasons (heavy floating point calculations and memory usage)
and we would be embedding the OCaml code.

thanks,

Adam
