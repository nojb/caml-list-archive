Dear Camlers,

I am looking for papers where the Caml's current polymorphic typing and
inference algorithm of mutable data types are studied in detailed.  I am
mainly interested in the typing of references and mutable records.

I have found two papers by Xavier Leroy on the INRIA repository that
describe different approaches to the typing of references; there are:
"Polymorphic type inference and assignment", 1991, and "Polymorphism by name
for references and continuations", 1993.  But it is not clear to me if any
of these approaches is used currently in Caml.

Thanks,

Ivan Sanabria-Piretti
