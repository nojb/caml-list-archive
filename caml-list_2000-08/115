Hello,
I thought that this info might be interesting
to the subscribers of the list.

I asked O'Reilly about their plans to translate
the first OCaml book into English (the book
is currently available only in French), and the
response was that
a) they are already working on the translation
b) it will be available free of charge for
viewing on the publisher's web site

I did not ask when exactly it will be done.
I also do not know wheather there will be
a printed copy availabe.

The representative said that it is OK to disceminate
this info to OCaml users.



Regards,
Vladislav
