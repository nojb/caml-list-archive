I am a bad programmer, and I hardly know OCaml. However, I'd like to try =
the contest. I am not sure at all I will be able to do a program able to =
resolve the task, and I don't think at all I could win. But anyway, I'd =
like to try. And I rather try with someone else than alone. So if =
someone feel about the same, just send me an e-mail, and we could =
register a team.
