			  2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

		   3rd APPSEM II Workshop (APPSEM05)
	     Frauenchiemsee, Germany, 12-15 September 2005
		 http://lionel.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/APPSEM05/


The final  workshop of the APPSEM  II initiative will take  place on the
island of Frauenchiemsee,  an island in Lake Chiemsee  near Munich, from
September 12 to 15, 2005.  It will follow immediately onto the APPSEM II
Summer School at the same location.

Background and Objectives

APPSEM II (Applied Semantics II)  is a 36-month FP5 IST thematic network
project that started  in January 2003. The network  consists of 20 sites
(with a  number of subsites) and  is coordinated by  Martin Hofmann (LMU
M=FCnchen).

The APPSEM'05 workshop will be held on the island Frauenchiemsee, in the
lake of  Chiemsee, approximately 100 km  south east of  Munich.  This is
the 3rd general  annual meeting of the network.   Previous meetings took
place in Nottingham (APPSEM'03)  and in Tallinn (APPSEM'04). All members
of the network  are invited to attend, but  participation of non-members
from both  academia and industry with  interests in application-oriented
programming language semantics is  actively encouraged, too. The purpose
of the workshop  is to present new results and plan  future work in each
of the following nine themes of the network:

 - Program structuring: object-oriented programming, modules,
 - Proof assistants, functional programming, and dependent types,
 - Program analysis, generation, and configuration,
 - Specification and verification methods,
 - Types and type inference in programming,
 - Games, sequentiality, and abstract machines,
 - Semantic methods for distributed computing,
 - Resource models and web data,
 - Continuous phenomena in Computer Science.

For  each  theme  there will  be  a  session  of contributed  talks.  In
addition,  there will  be  several invited  talks,  an industrial  panel
session, a brainstorming session and a business meeting.

Following  on  from  the  workshop,  an  informal  proceedings  will  be
published on the  web. Full refereeing will be  done on revised versions
of  the papers  after  the workshop  with  a selection  of papers  being
published in a formal proceedings.


Submission

Two kinds of contributions are solicited:
 - short presentations of circa 15 minutes each
 - full presentations of circa 30 minutes each

Submission for short presentations

Authors  should  submit a  short  abstract  of  maximal 2  pages.  Short
presentations offer  the opportunity to advertise any  work relevant for
APPSEM II, either  completed or in progress.  These  submissions will be
judged by the programme committee according to interest and relevance to
APPSEM II; the PC will try  to accommodate in the workshop programme all
short presentations that meet these criteria.

Submission for full presentations

Submission of  full presentations  is in 2  phases: phase 1  focusses on
relevance  of the  topic  to the  APPSEM  remit; phase  2 involves  full
refereeing.

Phase 1: Authors should submit an extended abstract of maximal 10 pages,
excluding appendices.  The PC encourages high quality extended abstracts
that can be considered for formal publication within few months.

The  submissions will  be  ranked by  the  PC according  to quality  and
relevance to  APPSEM II  themes.  Successful submissions  will get  a 30
minute slot for presentation at the workshop, and will be considered for
phase  2.  Other  submissions will  be automatically  considered  for 15
minute   presentation  slots.   Authors  of   submissions  to   phase  1
automatically express a commitment to submit to phase 2 if accepted.

Phase  2: Authors should  submit a  full paper  (max 20  pages excluding
appendices)  that  will  be   refereed  according  to  usual  scientific
standards after the workshop.  Selected  papers will be published in the
proceedings  for the workshop.   We expect  to have  10-12 contributions
published in  the final  proceedings.  The exact  format of  these final
proceedings is yet to be decided.


Important dates

- Submission for short presentations (max 2 pages): 8 July 2005
- Submission for full presentations (max 10 pages): 8 July 2005

Venue

The  picturesque small island  Frauenchiemsee is  home of  a Benedictine
monastery, which nowadays  also hosts seminars.  Founded in  722 by Duke
Tassilo III of Bavaria, its  most famous abbess was Irmengard (died 866;
beatified 1928), great-granddaughter  of Charlemagne. Other historically
recorded  abbesses  are Sabina  Preindorfer  (died  1609) und  Magdalena
Haidenbucher  (died 1650).   Until the  11th century  the  monastery was
directly subordinated to  the Holy Empire, later on  it was subordinated
to the Archbishop of Salzburg.


Organisers

The workshop is organized by Martin Hofmann, Hans-Wolfgang Loidl, Sigrid
Roden, Konstantin Kutzkow (Institute for Informatics, Ludwig-Maximilians
Universitaet M=FCnchen).
