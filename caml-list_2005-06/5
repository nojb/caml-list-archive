Hi riders,

The 0.3.0 version of ocaml-ssl is out. This library consists in bindings 
to the open-ssl library to handle secure communications. You can find it 
here:

http://savonet.sf.net/

The main improvement of this version is that functions are provided to 
make the library thread-safe (see the Ssl_threads.init function). It is 
also more cooperative with threads (blocking sections everywhere). Bugs 
were corrected and some functions were reorganized (small API breakage, 
sorry).

It is released under the GPL license + openssl exception (though, I 
could make it LGPL if someone really needs that).

Feel free to mail me if you've got any comment, bug, etc.

Regards,

Samuel.
