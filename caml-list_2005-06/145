I have been quite successful at doing C++ template-like things in MetaOCaml.

In fact, using Functors and Modules judisciously, it is possible to hide all of the code-generation aspects and write 
quite straightforward code that can be instantiated in many different ways.

An earlier version of this work (joint with Oleg Kiselyov) is available at 
http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/metamonads/, and has been accepted at GPCE 2005.

Thanks for asking ;-)
