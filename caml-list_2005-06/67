Hi list,

I have just released WDialog-2.1, the toolkit for dialog-centric web
applications. This release adds several session managers written by
Eric Stokes, including a daemon-based session manager for almost
unlimited scalability. There are a number of language modifications, but
they are all backward-compatible. The serialization method has been
changed, instead of relying on O'Caml's Marshal module, serialization is
now done by WDialog itself, increasing security.

WDialog is hosted at Sourceforge, and you find links to all relevant
documents on the homepage: http://wdialog.sourceforge.net

Of course, you can also get the new version by GODI.

Gerd

************
Feature list
************

      * Separation of the user interface (UI) definition from the
        backend program, improving the structure of the application and
        enabling advanced software engineering processes 
          
      * The UI definition is contained in an XML file, and it describes
        the whole UI from the overall dialog structure to the style of
        the individual HTML element
          
      * The dialogs have built-in persistency for session state. The
        HTML form elements can be tied to dialog variables reflecting
        their current state
          
      * A powerful template system manages the combination of individual
        HTML fragments to whole pages
          
      * The dialogs behave like GUI widgets. They visualize the state of
        the session, and user clicks are treated like events that are
        handled by programmable callback methods 
          
      * The callbacks are written in a real programming language
        (Objective Caml, or Perl), making it possible to formulate all
        algorithms and to use all system resources
          
      * The application can run as CGI as well as application server
        (now also with FastCGI)
          
      * The WDialog toolkit itself does not require any database as
        backend store (but can do so, optionally)
          
      * WDialog preprocesses all web inputs, and ensures that certain
        security standards are fulfilled
