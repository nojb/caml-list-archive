My intent is not to start another thread about GC and threading. My
intent is to know how, in a short future, I could efficiently use a
moderately SMP machine by writing pure OCaml code.

It could be with typed channels between unix processes, by modifying
the GC, by using concurrent constructs within the language, ... I
don't know so this is why I'm asking it here.

Yours,
d.
