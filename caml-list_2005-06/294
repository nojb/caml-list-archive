I do not see that. The current algorithm is recursive descent
is it not? That can also be used with a trivial modification
to test graph equivalence, by simply keeping a list of visited
nodes and not revisiting them.=20

The problem of course is that the cost per node
is O(N) where N is the recursion depth.

Profiling indicates my code spends up to 60% of all time
doing comparisons.

That seems reasonable, since the client will usually
know if the data structure contains cycles or not.
