For anyone who is interested in commercial exploits using OCaml, we are 
releasing our first stand-alone sofware package, Presenta.

Presenta is an OpenGL-based slideshow presentation program with support for 
animated points, typeset mathematics, 2D and 3D graphics:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/presenta/

The whole program is just under 10,000 LOC, entirely OCaml. The core of the 
program is a general purpose 2D vector graphics library (Smoke) which we've 
been developing for the past six years and which was translated from C++ into 
OCaml 2 years ago, with great success.

We currently support only x86 and AMD64 Linux but we are also considering 
supporting Mac OS X as well.

Let me know what you think! :-)
