Well, one of the easiest ways is to extend the Unix library to be able
to include the shared memory and semaphores system calls (shmget, shmat,
shmctl, shmdt, semget, semctl, and a couple of others, too).  That way
heavyweight processes could simulate threads (they CAN take advantage of
multiple processors but can also share data.  That would be the easiest
way to "solve" (if only partially) the problem.
