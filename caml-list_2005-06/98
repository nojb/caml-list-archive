                 Final Call for poster submissions

    21st. INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOGIC PROGRAMMING (ICLP'05)

                          Oct 2-5, 2005
                    Sitges (Barcelona), Spain

               http://www.iiia.csic.es/iclp2005/

* Conference scope. Poster contributions
  are sought in all areas of logic programming including:

  Theory (semantic foundations, formalisms, non-monotonic reasoning,
    knowledge representation, inductive logic programming)
  Language issues (constraints, concurrency, objects, coordination,
    higher order, types, modes, programming techniques)
  Implementation (compilation, memory management, virtual machines,
    parallelism)
  Environments (program analysis, program transformation, validation
    and verification, debugging)
  Applications (deductive databases, software engineering, natural
    language, web tools, internet agents, artificial intelligence,
    molecular biology)

* The ICLP Posters provide an excellent forum for authors to present
  their work in an informal and interactive setting. Posters are ideal
  for presenting speculative, late-breaking results or for giving an
  introduction to interesting, innovative work. Posters provide authors
  with a unique opportunity to make their work highly visible during
  the conference and get feedback from the community on the ongoing
  work.

  Poster submissions focusing on the following are specifically
  encouraged:  Tools, applications, current work not yet ready for
  publication, PhD thesis summaries (submitted recently or to be
  submitted in the next 6 months), research project overviews.

  Posters must be submitted electronically through the conference
  paper submission web pages. A poster should contain an extended
  abstract of up to two pages. Each accepted poster will have up to 2
  pages in the conference proceedings, and a 10 minute slot for presentation
  during the conference. Posters will also be displayed during the
  poster session.

* Submission deadline (firm): June 20, 2005
  Notification:               July 05, 2005
