The short answer is you can't. It's a pity, but to the present day the
vanilla Ocaml distribution does not support mixing native and byte-code.
Also, it is not possibile to Dynlink native code, which is even more of
a pity.

There are libraries and patches to achieve this; however, they are
hardly maintained. I remember Asmdynlink, which was in the now defunct
CDK (Caml develpment kit). There is a also a patch to the compiler (3.07
last time I looked at it) which also allows native dynlink.
