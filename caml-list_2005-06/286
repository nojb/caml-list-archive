                             CUFP 2005
     THE SECOND COMMERCIAL USERS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP

                          Talinn, Estonia
                        September 24th 2005
                        Co-located with ICFP

Functional languages have been under academic development for over 25
years, and are still proving to be very fertile ground for programming
language research. Consequently, most of the development focus of
these languages is driven by academic and theoretical questions. More
recently, however, functional languages have been very successfully
used in commercial, industrial, and government settings, where their
advantages have been able to be leveraged dramatically.

The goal of CUFP is to act as a voice for commercial users of
functional programming languages and technology. It aims to help
functional programming become increasingly viable as a technology for
use in the commercial, industrial, and government space, by providing
a forum for FP professionals to share their experiences and ideas,
whether business, management or engineering. It also aims to enable
the formation and cementing of relationships and alliances that
further the commercial use of functional languages. Providing user
feedback to language designers and implementors is not a primary goal
of the workshop, though it will be welcome if it occurs.


Program plans
-------------

The meeting will last a full day, with a mix of invited and submitted
presentations, plus discussion sessions.

Topics will range over a wide area, including:

    * Case studies both of successful and unsuccessful uses of
      functional programming;
    * Business opportunities and risks from using functional languages;
    * Enablers for functional language use in a commercial setting;
    * Barriers to the adoption of functional languages, and
    * Mitigation strategies for overcoming limitations of FP.

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange. A full report
of last year's workshop will appear in the Functional Programming
column of SIGPLAN Notices.

See http://www.galois.com/cufp/ for more information, including last
year's schedule and a report describing last year's workshop. This
year's schedule will also be available there soon.


Submissions
-----------

Submissions by prospective speakers or suggestions for speakers are
welcome! Just send an e-mail to cufp at galois.com with an outline of
what you'd like to talk about or what you think your suggestee should
give a talk about.
