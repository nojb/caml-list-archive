In playing with the debugger, two features which would be very useful to
me came to mind, but I'm not sure if they're even possible with the OCaml
debugger!

Is there any way to see the return value of a function in the debugger? I
can step to any point in the program with relative ease, and I can inspect
the value of any variable in my program while executing it, but how can I
see what a function has returned or is just about to return? Is it
possible? It's a pain to to compute the return value in my head from the
variables and keep track of it in later recursive calls.

Also, is there a way to find which expression is about to be evaluated in
the debugger? It's simple enough to know the character ocaml is about to
progress to, but is there a way to see what specific expression (a range
of text) the debugger is about to look into?

Thanks,
