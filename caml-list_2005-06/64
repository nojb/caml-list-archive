         HLPP 2005: Third International workshop on
         High-level parallel programming and applications

         Call for participation

         Monday/Tuesday 4-5 July, 2005
         Coventry, United Kingdom

         Detailed informations: http://hlpp.free.fr

************************************************************************

Parallel and distributed systems are now readily available as their
price/performance ratio continues to improve. But parallel and
distributed programming is still dominated by low-level techniques such
as send/receive message passing.

Sequential programming has long benefited from high-level programming
techniques and tools that have made today's immense range of software
economically viable. Two decades of research into high-level parallel
and distributed programming have produced methods and tools that improve
the price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range
of target applications.

Grid systems offer a tremendous computing power. Nevertheless, this
power is far from being effectively exploited. In addition to technical
problems related to portability and access, grid computing needs new
programming paradigms. Research on high level programming for meta and
grid computing is particularly relevant.

This workshop follows HLPP 2001 and HLPP 2003, and is aimed at:
   - computer science researchers, practitioners, graduate students
   - scientific computing researchers, practitioners, graduate students
   - high-performance application developers (e.g. in DBMS, data-mining,
     parallel model checking, virtual reality)
