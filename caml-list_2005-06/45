ocamlc with the "-custon" flag makes standalone bytecode programs (it
embeds a copy of the ZAM, which it generates a slighly larger
executable).  But, like was was said earlier, any external libraries
referenced (Dbm, etc.) would have to be included.  I think they can be
linked in using a flag, but I don't know.  I do know that any external
non-caml libraries (.a & .so files) are not linked in.  I almost
exclusively use the native code compiler and may be mistaken, so check
the documentation.  Check out the O'Really [sic] OCaml book ("Developing
Applications with OCaml") on the OCaml website: it has a pretty decently
good discussion of this.
