It is not relevant. To write this, every 'a -> 'a object must be seeable as a 
'a -> 'b object, which is obviously wrong (otherwise, e.g. func 0 would have 
any type).

Again, the explanation is not relevant. Here, func is not of type 'a -> 'b, 
but '_a -> '_b instead, that means that the first usage of func will freeze 
the type (you won't be able to use func 4, then func true). It happens every 
time you use references. Otherwise, you could write e.g. l := [(1,1)]; func 
true.

'a -> 'b is included in 'a -> 'a, but not the contrary (intuitively, functions 
of the first type don't terminate properly, e.g. let f a = raise Exit).
