Heh, I didn't realize that they were handled different internally  ;)  I
thought it was a reasonable thing to do because it is more explicit and
equivalent, but if it isn't actually equivalent...

Would it be difficult to write a printer that had much direct access with
the original file? That's something that I'd quite obviously need.

In any way, I think I'm going to try to do more research into how Tuareg
does its indentation. It's unfortunately not well documented, but it has
the added benefit of being able to indent one line at a time. I'll take a
look into writing a new printer, but I suspect that that will be the
harder route... correct me if I'm wrong!
