Actually, this is very desirable. Ask Jon Skaller, who is developing the
Felix language mainly because Ocaml does not have this feature. It also
very desirable to us for the AS/Xcaml project, where server side
applications (Xlets) are dynlinked upon client request for their
execution. In order to run a native instance of an AS/Xcaml application,
the code for all the relevant xlets must be statically linked into the
xcaml daemon.

Scaml does this, but there is no correctness proof for it. It is a patch
to 3.07. Unluckily Xavier wants to have an provably perfect solution to
this problem, which is definitely a good thing, but this delays such a
great feature as native dynlink.

This is exactly what Asmdynlink did. It was a bytecode interpreter
written in Ocaml and ideally compiled with Ocamlopt. I do not believe
that is has been ported to 3.08, though.
