I use this:
 lfs.irisa.fr/~pad/hacks/quickcheck.ml

All you have to do is include this library and then put in your code
rules such as

let _ = assert
 ((Quickcheck.laws "rev" (fun xs -> reverse (reverse xs) = xs)
   (Quickcheck.lg Quickcheck.ig)) = None)

the lg and ig functions are generators (list and integer generators).


By the way it also include a unit framework, but
it is just
  let testunitframework b = assert b   :)
that you use by writing for instance

let _ = testunitframework (List.map (fun x -> x +1) [1;2;3;4] = [2;3;4;5])
