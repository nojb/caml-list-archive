Hi,

Does OCaml have any support for having modules of the same name in
different libraries? If not, it should be seriously looked at.

I guess something as simple as using the folder name as a base, and
for multiple module names conflicting with the base library,
unprefixed modules would be the standard library.

Just that I want to create modules that will collide with names from
other libraries/standard library, and I don't want to run into more
namespace collision problems. The record scoping rules are painful
enough.

Jonathan
