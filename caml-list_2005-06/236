Ok, but that still doesn't answer my question (on how to connect the
stdin channel to a <> compatible char stream).

The documentation says that the parser interface is no longer
supported by proper ocaml, so we need to preprocess with ocampp4.

The parser interface seems to be a nice thing if you want to "script"
in ocaml - that is, if you want to write quick and dirty solutions to
problems that you would ordinarily do in Perl/PYthon etc.

Of course, if you want to write a more complex parser, it's better to
do it in lex/yacc.
