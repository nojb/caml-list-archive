Thanks for the quick response, and at the same time sorry for bearing 
bad news again.
I assume you mean the 1.45 version, since the file dates changed around 
the time you posted your reply to my post (31st of May, 21:48). I have 
installed the new files but the problem still persists. If you just type 
in the code I posted,

module rec A : B =
  struct
  end
and C : D = E(A)

then position the cursor inside it somewhere (e.g. on 'end') and press 
Alt+Q for reindent, it just hangs there. Is it something in my setup, is 
anyone able to reproduce the error?

Regards
