You probably want all the ocaml tools to be built as universal binaries 
and you probably also want the ocamlopt compiler to be able to produce 
universal binaries.  I would expect that will require some effort from 
the Caml Team at INRIA.

I wouldn't get impatient just yet.  Even inside Apple, most of the 
software engineers don't have Intel development machines.  The first 
Intel CPU Macintosh products won't be on the market until sometime 
around Q2 next year, and even then, the PowerPC machines will probably 
still be the high throughput hotness machines.  There's plenny time to 
spare.
