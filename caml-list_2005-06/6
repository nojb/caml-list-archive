Thanks for answering this, but I had asked him (Harry Chomsky) on
November 8, 2003 if he would consider the "OCaml special exception for
linking" so that his library's licensing terms would be more in line
with [some] other packages and OCaml itself... to date, my email has
not been answered.

And I just checked the current "OCaml Win32" download, and it is as
you say above - LGPL (with no "OCaml linking exception").

This is unfortunate, as I would like to both use *and* contribute to
this project... but, c'est la licensing disagreement. :)
