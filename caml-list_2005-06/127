Hi all,

We are trying to modify the ocaml compiler in order to have it verify
the well foundedness of recursive module definitions, and have a
question for the long standing ocaml source hackers.

>From early experiments, it seems that the dependencies in the various
.depend files are insufficient. For example, try to modify the version
string, say "3.08.3", in stdlib/sys.cmo, and make the world. Launch
the new toplevel; nothing has changed. How do people deal with this
issue? In the cases we have, cleaning up the executables before making
the world again is enough. Is it in general? 

Thanks.
