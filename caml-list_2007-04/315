And:

  3) Documentation for the new camlp4 is almost non-existent.

I am not so concerned about the 3.09 compiler not working with the new
macro syntax, because presumably people will upgrade somewhat quickly
anyway.  Unless... they depend on old syntax extensions that have not
been rewritten yet.

Very substantial parts of our code base depend on non-trivial Camlp4
macros, and it is a lot of tedious work to rewrite those.  Even though
it's a huge PITA, we could live with the lack of backwards
compatibility as long as there were at least sufficient documentation
to support a quick transition.  I am also currently working on a new
non-trivial extension, and haven't started writing the macro part yet
in the hope that documentation will soon be available to improve my
productivity.

It seems reasonable to predict that many people won't (be able to)
upgrade to 3.10 for the reasons explained by Martin.  I can't imagine
that INRIA wants to make a release that has a hard time of being
accepted by the community.  This would be a waste of INRIA's
resources, too.

I'd therefore strongly suggest that INRIA plan more carefully how to
make the next release.  From my point of view, the best way would be
to provide sufficient documentation in advance to allow Camlp4
developers to rewrite their macros in time.  It would be a great
advantage, too, if the old Camlp4 supported any new syntax (not
extensions, just the base language; there are probably very few
changes anyway) so that people have at least a short reprieve during
which they can just use an old camlp4 installation before they are
forced to upgrade their macros for future OCaml-releases.

Indeed...

Sounds reasonable.

This would surely be helpful, but I don't think that this is
absolutely necessary.  It isn't horribly hard to have two
OCaml-installations, and refer to the old camlp4 where necessary.

Maintaining a second OCaml-installation would certainly be a bigger
problem if the macro code itself refers to a lot of external packages
(this may be rare), which may then need to be maintained in a
separation installation, too.

It would surely be most helpful for the community if both good
documentation were available, and a backwards compatible camlp4
version were provided.  If there are limited resources at INRIA that
prevent solving both problems, my preference is that they be invested
in the former rather than the latter...

Markus
