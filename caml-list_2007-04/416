CDPN Moves To Corners GPS Market In China!

China Datacom Corp.
Sym: CDPN
Close: $0.065

CDPN announced Friday that is has acquired all outstanding shares of
General Link Information Systems, Chinas only GPS vehicle monitoring and
management system. GPS systems are huge; controlling that market is even
bigger. Read the news and get on CDPN first thing Monday!

0 Java Virtual Machine The Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE
platform) is used for a  wide variety of applications from small applets
on desktops to web  services on large servers. Sun's  comprehensive
offerings enable rapid development of applications and  web services.
Components that are responsible for routing incoming requests and
enforcing navigation in web applications. Even a single application is 
often expected to do more than one thing at a time.
For more information on the use of the Front Controller design pattern,
see the J2EE Patterns catalog. Create a Java project, create or import
an applet source file (see the final section if you want to import a JAR
file containing applet source files).
For example, the Text Field  component works with the JavaServer Faces
framework to convert and  validate the input as well as to broadcast
change and validation  events.
Interact with web clients (typically a browser application such as
Netscape or Internet Explorer) using a request-response paradigm.
JSP pages must be placed within a web application in order for the JSP
pages to be executable within the IDE. 5 Last month, you read an
introduction to the NetBeans IDE. This tutorial guides you through the
process of creating the GUI for an application called ContactEditor
using the NetBeans IDE GUI Builder, also known by the code name Matisse.
2 and later, Java Web Start software is  installed as part of the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE). In the meantime, you can get started learning
some of the  technologies by following links within this article. The
runtime system searches the call stack for a method that contains a
block of code that can handle the exception. Applications launched with
Java Web Start are cached locally,  for improved performance.
You need not use any of these methods, but if you  choose to do so, you
may need to override them with code that is  specific to your class. If
you are comfortable working with Ant, you can edit your Ant  script and
the IDE project configuration file to achieve an even  tighter
integration between the NetBeans IDE and your build process. Sun
Microsystems has for some time also supported the development of  BlueJ,
a programming environment developed at the University of  Kent, UK, and
Deakin University, Australia.
This block of code is called an exception handler. Add to that the many
inconsistencies with how different browsers  display the tags, and your
productivity can slow to a halt.
Behind the scenes is functionality code, which you'll learn to
incorporate later.
regex API is most similar to that found in  Perl. Desktop shortcuts can
also launch the application, providing the user with the same experience
as a native  application. This design pattern creates an aggregate view
from component views.
Though there are no project templates that are specifically designed for
creating applets in NetBeans IDE 5. Add to that the many inconsistencies
with how different browsers  display the tags, and your productivity can
slow to a halt. Next month, you'll learn about the many Java
technologies often used in web applications and what their uses are.
The drop-down list is populated with names from a  database table.
In the world of regular  expressions, there are many different flavors
to choose from, such as grep, Perl, Tcl, Python, PHP, and awk. An
exception handler is considered appropriate if the type of the exception
object thrown matches the type that the handler can handle.
The model represents data and the rules that govern access to and
updates of this data.
Note: For the code in this issue of Fundamentals to compile, you  need
to use the JDK 5. This month, you begin web application programming by
jumping right in and creating a small sample application. This block of
code is called an exception handler.
Regular expressions are a way to describe a set of strings based on
common characteristics shared by each string in the set. The controller
translates the user's interactions with the view into actions that the
model will perform. Manipulating Events This section describes the
JavaBeans event-manipulating capabilities.
This tutorial should take approximately two hours to complete.
org Advanced Free-Form Project Configuration Free-form projects in the
NetBeans IDE provide a very powerful tool  for Java developers who build
and run their applications using an  Ant script. The controller is given
a reference to the underlying model.
The drop-down list is populated with names from a  database table. A
basic understanding of the Java programming language is required.
You need not use any of these methods, but if you  choose to do so, you
may need to override them with code that is  specific to your class.
Using the BeanContext API This section covers the Extensible Runtime
Containment and Services Protocol, also known as beancontext. Java Web
Start supports multiple, simultaneous versions of the  Java Platform,
Standard Edition.
The exception handler chosen is said to catch the exception.
It offers educational  tools such as visualization and interaction
facilities that greatly  aid the learning of object-oriented concepts.
This tutorial is designed to get you going as quickly as possible.
As you become more familiar with using the Java Editor, refer to the
IDE's Help menu for a deeper understanding of its capabilities.
You might want to skim over it quickly and then return to each section
as time allows.
