With regards to the closing comment to Bug Report #4251:

Does this mean that menhir will be moved to the O'Caml distribution at some
point? I don't think I'm the only person reading this list who doesn't use
Menhir (at the moment) solely because it is not part of the *standard*
O'Caml distribution. Unless Menhir is due to become the official,
distributed and supported replacement for ocamlyacc, then this comment is
not terribly impressive[1]

stated!
