How can I create a stand-alone top-level (REPL) executable?

My workstation is not powerful enough to run some things, so I want to 
create an interactive top-level (REPL) executable, copy it to a 
different machine (with, say, more RAM) and talk to the REPL.
Alas, this does not work, because, even though my executable code gets 
linked in, it cannot be used without the mli files:
ocamlmktop foo.cma -o mycaml
mycaml now requires foo.mli to be present somewhere for Foo.bar() to be 
usable. this means that mycaml is not really stand-alone, I have to 
carry all the mli files with it.

this all basically means that I have to compile exe files (instead of an 
interactive REPL) to do my work on a different machine (i.e., 
effectively, I am using the C development model: edit/compile/link/run 
instead of the Lisp development model: edit/run).

so, is there a way around?
how do I create a completely stand-alone ocaml repl that contains my code?

thanks.

Sam.
