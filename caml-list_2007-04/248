Hi Guys,

we are currently offering some 6 months internship(s) for OCaml 
developers at National ICT Australia, Sydney. Those internships are 
sponsored, but competitive. For current students there is the 
possibility to extend the scope to a BSc or Master thesis.

If you are interested please read the following and contact me directly.

Cheers,
Ralf



Internship at NICTA, Sydney
============================

As part of the Goanna  research project on automatic code analysis of
C/C++ programs we offer the opportunity for a six months internship in
Sydney (Australia).

The goal of the project is to develop an efficient and precise end-user
analysis tool for (embedded) system code which includes kernel, OS and
driver software. We are developing a novel approach based on formal
verification techniques which permits it to be substantially more
flexible then existing solutions. The project team offers highly
motivated students the opportunity to work in an exciting R&D environment.

We are looking for candidates with the following abilities:

  * strong programming background
  * good knowledge of C/C++
  * expert knowledge in OCaml development
  * vocational English skills
  * team player
  * background in model checking or static analysis is a plus

The project team consists of international researchers and developers
from two of NICTA's research groups: Embedded, Real-Time and Operating
Systems (ERTOS) and Formal Methods (FM).

NICTA is Australia's research center of excellence in computer science.
Working in a research center might be of particular interest to students
who are looking for a future career in research, or who like to get a
deeper understanding of research issues.

For further information you can have a look at the project's page:

  http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/research/goanna/

and the Embedded, Real-Time and Operating of System group:

  http://www.ertos.nicta.com.au/

We are looking for a student who likes to join us as soon as possible,
but we might have further opportunities later in the year and next year.
The internship typically covers the student's basic expenses for the 6
months period. If you are interested or like to receive more information
feel free to contact: ralf.huuck@nicta.com.au
