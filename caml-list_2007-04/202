               CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND PARTICIPATION

                              Workshop on
        MULTIPARADIGM PROGRAMMING WITH OO LANGUAGES (MPOOL 2007)
                                 at the
    EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (ECOOP 2007)
                     31 July 2007, Berlin, Germany
                                 
                                  and
                         CALL FOR CONTRIBUTION
                       for a chapter of a planned
                   LNCS Survey on the State of the Art 
                      in Multiparadigm Programming

While OO has become ubiquitously employed for design, implementation, and even 
conceptualization, many practitioners recognize the concomitant need for other 
programming paradigms according to problem domain.  We seek answers to the 
question of how to address the need for other programming paradigms---or even 
domain specific languages---in the general context of OO languages.

Can OO programming languages effectively support other programming paradigms or 
the embedding of other languages?  The answer seems to be affirmative, at least
for some paradigms.  For example, significant progress has been made for the
case of functional programming in C++. Additionally, several efforts have been
made to integrate support for other paradigms as a front-end for OO languages 
(the Pizza language, extending Java, is a prominent example).

This workshop seeks to bring together practitioners and researchers in this 
developing field to `compare notes' on their work---describe existing, 
developing, or proposed techniques, idioms, methodologies, language extensions, 
or software for expressing non-OO paradigms in OO languages; or theoretical 
work supporting or defining the same. High-level presentations of position are 
welcome, and reports of work in progress, are welcome.

Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

  - non-OO programming with OO languages;
  - merging functional/logic/OO/other programs (language crossbinding);
  - non-OO programming at the meta level (e.g. template metaprogramming);
  - techniques for language embeddings (e.g. multistage programming); 
  - module systems vs. object systems;
  - OO design patterns and their relation to functional patterns;
  - multiparadigm and multilingual programming in the .NET framework;
  - type system relationships across languages;
  - theoretical foundations of multiparadigm programming with OO languages.

The workshop will consist of short presentations with interspersed discussion 
sessions, and longer general discussions of themes or topics derived from some 
common element of subsets of presentations. We expect the majority of the 
participants to give presentations.

Prospective participants may submit either presentation abstracts or full 
papers. All accepted materials will be distributed at the workshop and also
made available at the MPOOL 2007 Web site. 

For authors of accepted presentations who require justification for travel 
the organizers can provide official letters of invitation. 

EXTERNAL PUBLICATION

We have received approval from Springer to solicit chapters for a report on the
state of the art in multiparadigm programming, to be published as a volume of 
the LNCS series. Authors of selected papers will have the opportunity to revise 
and expand their papers into chapters for this publication.

SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

Prospective authors are invited to submit abstracts or full papers in PDF, 
postscript, or Microsoft Word. Authors of accepted papers are responsible for 
submitting the final version using the Springer LNCS LaTeX template to ensure 
inclusion in the proceedings. Submission and email correspondence to 
mpool07@multiparadigm.net

AUTHORS' SCHEDULE

May 13th,  2007:  Abstracts due.
May 20th,  2007:  Notification of acceptance.
June 15th, 2007:  ECOOP early registration.
