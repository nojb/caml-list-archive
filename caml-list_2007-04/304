Curious, but can't you run camlp4 (old) to generate pure Ocaml text?
Then, you have no macros and can re-introduce them.

An alternative is a translator from old to new syntax, I guess that
would be HARD otherwise it would have been done?

I wonder if a pipeline would work, so you can multi-stage
pre-processors?
