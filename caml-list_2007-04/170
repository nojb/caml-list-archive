Like Michael, I am also not going to answer your question (sorry!) but can I 
just say that, as a commercial developer, there would be significant 
incentive to write a killer IDE for OCaml if the current top-level was free 
for commercial use, e.g. part of the stdlib.

Having been playing with F# recently, I'm starting to appreciate some of the 
features afforded by a decent IDE. However, both OCaml and F# lack features 
found in the other and, more importantly, lack many features that could be 
hugely beneficial, particularly to users of the interactive systems.

Marshalling top-level state is one such feature.
