Doesn't quite work for me... This is my usage pattern.

I've a toplevel <:str_item< type $list:l$ >> where l is a list of 
((_loc * string),(string * (bool * bool)) list, ctyp ,?? list)
and ?? list is a list of something that I haven't figure out yet (the
manual says <:str_item< type $list:sslt$ >>: type declaration).

to write type a = (b ($list:l$) as 'b) , I've to give a list l
of one element as
((_loc,"a"),[], <:ctyp< (b ($list:[<:ctyp< 'b >>,<:ctyp< int >>]$) as 'b) >>, [])

My problem is to write the type (('b,int) b as 'b) as a ctyp .

I want to write it in this way as both l and the list of type variables
in (('b,int) b as 'b) are not fixed. Moreover types in <:str_item<
type $list:l$ >> can be mutually recursive.

thanks :)
