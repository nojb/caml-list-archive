Sorry, my feeling is that, by now, the meta-programming core of 
metaocaml is stable enough to be merged into Objective Caml.  I guess I 
should have stated that.

To maintain Objective Caml's competitiveness with GHC, which has 
Template Haskell, this seems to be an obvious thing to do -- especially 
since I personally consider metaocaml to be superior to TH.
