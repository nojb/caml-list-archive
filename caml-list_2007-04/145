Dear All,

CamlPDF is a library for reading, writing and manipulating PDF files
and data.

This is a request-for-comment release, under a BSD-style licence:

http://www.coherentgraphics.co.uk/camlpdf.html

Those not interested in PDF may, however, be interested in the
literate program, which shows what can be done with ocamlweb:

http://www.coherentgraphics.co.uk/camlpdf.pdf

CamlPDF has already shipped as part of a popular shrink-wrapped
desktop product. However, since this large codebase aims to provide
a more complete PDF library than was required for that product,
feedback would be much appreciated. Please see the Request for
Comment on page (iii) of the literate program.
