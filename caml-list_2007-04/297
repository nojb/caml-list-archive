Yes, that is possible, assuming I can also ship any required libraries.

OUCH. That's a significant complication.

Ocaml is still experimental. Its input language is evolving all 
the time. It wouldn't evolve much if it didn't have a user base.

Sure! My thoughts would be: Menhir should really go to GLR.

[Felix has GLR parsing built in :]
