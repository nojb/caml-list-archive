Hi,
    That would be my preference in terms of prioritization of work for
Menhir, to get it to output table driven code. I tried converting a
decent sized grammar (verilog 95 with some later stuff in it) from
ocamlyacc to menhir a few months ago and it was completely painless,
but I did notice that the compile time and code size for menhir were
much greater.

    I like where it's going, and even though I'm not a huge fan of yacc,
it is quite compatible AND has addressed some deficiencies of yacc. That
is a huge bonus for me.
