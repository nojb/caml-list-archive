The source for COCANWIKI[1] contains extensive support for threading
of mail messages, based on JWZ's algorithm:

http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html

You are of course welcome to copy this.  If there are any license
issues let me know & I can fix them.

I'd also like to point you to another useful JWZ doc:
