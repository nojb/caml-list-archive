Hi,

I hope the following job post is not unwelcome. Thanks,

Jake

Skydeck is a startup developing software and services at the
intersection of mobile phones, Internet telephony, and the web. We are
looking for great programmers to join us. Our office is located in
downtown San Mateo, CA, just a short walk to Caltrain and near plenty of
parking and lunch options.

To us a great programmer is someone who:

  * Gets things done.
  * Can debug effectively.
  * Knows how to remove complexity.
  * Has tried many different ways of programming.
  * Thinks programming is about the most fun thing out there.
  * Can express himself or herself clearly in speech and writing.
  * Has enough of an ego to dive into difficult projects.
  * Can set aside ego to work with others.
  * Is always striving to improve.

Some reasons you might like working at Skydeck:

  * We are small enough that you will have a big impact on what the
    company becomes, both technically and culturally.

  * We think the best way to get software out the door is with a small
    number of the best people that we can find.

  * We use the sharpest tools available, and build our own when needed.

  * Our products are going to be used by a lot of people and will change
    the mobile phone business for the better.

We program in OCaml when we can and C++ and Java when we must, on Linux,
Symbian, and Windows Mobile, but we require no specific experience.

Write to us at ocamljobs@skydeck.com. To get our attention, tell us what
you think is broken about the mobile phone market in the US today.
