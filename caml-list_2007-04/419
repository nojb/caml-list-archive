Hi everyone,

	I'm looking for the equivalent OpenGL call to glGetInteger in lablGL, and I
can't find it. This is probably a stupid question, (and I'm not even sure
whether caml-list is the right place for this) but has anyone ever needed to
do the equivalent of glGetInteger(GL_VIEWPORT, x) in OCaml using lablGL? I can
see the get_matrix calls, but nothing else? Is this unimplemented? (and, if
so, how could I contribute the fix?)

	Thank you very much in advance,
-carlos
