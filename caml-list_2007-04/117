Thanks.

I've updated it!

Right.

It always had to be like that (even in the previous web page, strange...)

Yes, the DELETE_RULE example was br0ken.

Yes just open Camlp4.Sig to see the token type now.

-I +camlp4/Camlp4Parsers is useless since one doesn't use any
Camlp4*Parser module.

camlp4.cma no longer exists it's camlp4lib.cma but here it's also
useless since one doesn't link (-c)

ocamlc -I +camlp4 -pp camlp4orf -c dynamic_functor_example3.ml

Thanks for your porting efforts!
