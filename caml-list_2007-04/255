                    21th Int. Workshop on Unification

                A satellite workshop of RTA'07 and TLCA'07
		          Paris, France
                        Friday, June 29, 2007

                      http://www.rdp07.org/unif.html
   
	
UNIF is the main international meeting on unification. Unification is
concerned with the problem of identifying given terms, either
syntactically or modulo a given logical theory. Syntactic unification
is the basic operation of most automated reasoning systems, and
unification modulo theories can be used, for instance, to build in
special equational theories into theorem provers.

The aim of UNIF'07, as that of the previous meetings, is to to bring
together people interested in unification, present recent (even
unfinished) work, and discuss new ideas and trends in unification and
related fields. This includes scientific presentations, but also
descriptions of applications and softwares using unification as a
strong component.

In 2007, UNIF is organized as part of the 2007 Federated
Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2007).

This workshop is the twentyfirst in the series: UNIF'87 (Val D'Ajol,
France), UNIF'88 (Val D'Ajol, France), UNIF'89 (Lambrecht, Germany),
UNIF'90 (Leeds, England), UNIF'91 (Barbizon, France), UNIF'92
(Dagstuhl, Germany), UNIF'93 (Boston, USA), UNIF'94 (Val D'Ajol,
France), UNIF'95 (Sitges, Spain), UNIF'96 (Herrsching, Germany),
UNIF'97 (Orléans, France), UNIF'98 (Rome, Italy),
UNIF'99 (Frankfurt, Germany), UNIF'00 (Pittsburgh, USA), UNIF'01
(Siena, Italy), UNIF'02 (Copenhagen, Denmark), UNIF'03 (Valencia,
Spain), UNIF'04 (Cork, Ireland), UNIF'05 (Nara, Japan), UNIF'06
(Seattle, WA, USA).
