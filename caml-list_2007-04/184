Actually it's just that the angle is not only a function of time, but also
of the period T between two frames:

  angle(t+T) = angle(t) + 0.01 * t

For example, if you interrupt the program and restart it a few seconds
later, the rotation will restart where it left (plus one tiny increment)
even though time is still running.


So there's probably no big trouble with the time function or the
rotation matrix.
