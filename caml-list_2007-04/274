Hi,

I'm working on a process back-end of STM library. It's now supported by Google
SOC and expected to release after the summer (and maybe earlier). With it, you
will be able to do shared-memory (supposing that's the style your want)
parallel programming based on processes, which in turn gives you speedup. 

If interested, you can have a taste first through the (vm)thread back-end
currently available (check my homepage below), though it won't really speed up
your program because of the well-known global lock of OCaml threads.
