I'm not sure that is a good idea .. IMHO it's premature.
Installation is highly 'personal' and OS dependent,
might include docs, man page, etc etc.

Perhaps simply some way of saying what is to be installed,
and generating a manifest of files *to be installed*
without actually installing them?

Ocaml doesn't currently have a packaging model. This makes
things hard to find .. but until there is one, trying to
do it in an officially distributed tool might prejudice
a proper discussion of the requirements.
