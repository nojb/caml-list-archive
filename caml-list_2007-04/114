Ocamllex doesn't have a notion for beginning of line. Three possible
solutions:

1. You can simulate it with a bool ref parameter to your lexer that gets set
to true by each rule to indicate that you're no longer at the beginning of a
line - the "!for" rule than raises Failure if it matches when this ref is
true. Slightly tedious for code maintenance... 
2. You use two lexers - one with the "!for" rule and one without and call
one lexer from the other (not very nice, because ocamllex doesn't support
code reuse between lexers so you'll be duplicating a lot of code).
3. Pre-process the input to ocamllex to include a special character that
cannot appear in your text and place that at the beginning of the line (e.g.
one of the control characters in 0..31).

HTH,


David
