OK.
I will try my own attempts, and I think the
first ways will be paved twice: one thing in C,
the other in OCaml.

I hope that the names of the OCaml-functions will have very
similar names as the C-functions.

There is no seperated lablgl-documentation, right?!
So I have to look up for the C-API-functions and
guess the right names of the OCaml-pendants?!

...as a museum of old code? ;-)

Really? :)

OK, but you can't insert Assembler-code in OCaml-code directly ;-)
