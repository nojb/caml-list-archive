I won't use Menhir for that reason either. My product, Felix, is
designed to 'build out of the box' on all platforms with minimal
pre-requisites, which happen to be: you need

	(a) Python
	(b) Ocaml
	(c) A C/C++ compiler 
	    * with development versions of libs

People have enough trouble with just 3 pre-reqs without me
adding another code base/product to the list -- it is particularly
messy on Windows (native) platforms.
