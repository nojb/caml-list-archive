Release 1.4 of LSD mount utilities (minor enhancements)

   A new version (1.4) of the LSD mount utilities has been released
   (download here: http://software.m-e-leypold.de/lsd-mount-utilities).

   This release doesn't add new functionality. Instead parts of the
   code have been reorganized in (probably more reliable) reusable
   components.

   As a side effect

     - The installation footprint has been reduced by factor ~2.3
       (formerly separate programs have been gathered into a single
       one and switch on the name under which the program is
       installed).
    
     - The tool verbosity is greatly reduced (since we now suppress
       standard error for most of the probing with external tools). To
       get a partial trace of the things happening internally
       (e.g. which external programs are invoked) you can now set the
       environment variable lsd_lama_trace=verbose.

   A more detailed description of the utilities can be found at
   www.etc-network.de/blog/mel/projects/lsd-mount-utilities/about.html.

   Please read the complete README (and specfically the disclaimer)
   before installing or using the software).

Regards -- Markus
