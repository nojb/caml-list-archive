Ah, of course.  Rechecking my commands, your assertion is still 
consistent.  I thought I had counterintuitively gotten errors without 
the .cma, and had subconsciously filed in my brain under "weird inlining 
or something . . ."  Well nice to know axiomatically that .cmo / .cma is 
mutually exclusive with -c.

Yes if that's the case then I definitely think it should at least be a 
warning to include such a file with -c.

OTOH, I see from the list archive that I'm not making up this inlining 
across files thing . . .

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/caml-list/0117.html

So if I understand correctly then, cross-file function inlining must by 
design be delayed until link time?
