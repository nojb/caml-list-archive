Looking at the code very: spamoracle write its database to a fresh 
temporary file and then rename it. With a local file system (not NFS) 
under Unix, this is atomic. It is thus safe to "mark" and "add" in 
parallel, but if you do several "add" in parallel, you'll not get the 
expected behavior (but the database will not be corrupted).
