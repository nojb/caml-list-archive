I'm sure it is a good idea. Only a standard coming from caml's =20
development team is likely to be widely adopted. For example I =20
personally don't use ocamlfind and find very annoying any library =20
that _forces_ me to use it to install it.

I would be entirely satisfied by a very simple solution e.g. each =20
library in its own directory in `ocamlc -where`, with everything in =20
there (including documentation) according to a standard directory =20
layout.

Best,
