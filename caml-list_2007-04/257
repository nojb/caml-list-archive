Hi,

I have an application where I would like to sign bytecode and check
that the signature is valid before running it. I was thinking to
compute hashes of the various sections of a bytecode file, sign them,
and store the result in an additional section. Is there a library
somewhere for manipulating bytecode files? I see pieces in
tools/dumpobj.ml and bytecomp/bytesections.ml. Thanks,

Jake
