In general, a syntax extension that (like before) uses quotations in the 
revised syntax would be compiled using such a command:

ocamlc -c -I +camlp4 -pp camlp4orf pa_foo.ml

It replaces

ocamlc -c -I +camlp4 -pp 'camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo' pa_foo.ml


There might be some slight error in the commands I just wrote (it 
happens). You can have a look at my updated json-static package that 
you'll find on my web site. It supports both the old and the new camlp4, 
and it works for sure with 3.10.0+beta [it uses two different source files 
of course].
