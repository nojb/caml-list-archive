I agree with the need for documentation, but not with the timing you
propose.  Release 3.10.0 has been delayed quite a bit already, and
1- there is no reason to make users who do not depend on Camlp4 wait longer
   for 3.10;
2- having the new Camlp4 officially released as part of 3.10.0 can only
   facilitate the porting of Camlp4 macros and extensions.

More generally, we are painfully aware that the transition from 3.09
to 3.10 is a minor upgrade for users who do not depend on Camlp4, but
a major change for Camlp4 users.  We plan to maintain 3.09 (by making
bug-fix releases) longer than usual so that users who are stuck with
the old Camlp4 can stay with 3.09 for a while.  Nobody is forced to
upgrade to 3.10 immediately.

Releasing both old and new Camlp4 as part of 3.10 is out of the
question, however.  That would only delay the inevitable and would
waste a lot of our time to make such a release.  The priorities are
1- get 3.10.0 out of the door, and 2- of course, provide more
documentation on the new Camlp4.
