Not if it is optional, like the ocamlbuild tool for example.

There do indeed appear to be some issues with camlp4.
However what was done was the 'right thing' despite that --
IMHO of course.

First: few would have tested it, given the incompatibilities,
it it were not forced onto the market.

Second: Ocaml 3.10 is still in beta, and the author(s) of
camlp4 *needed* the feedback and participation from the community.

Third: the community wanted a better camlp4: this is the price,
and I believe most people using camlp4 are willing to help
and get it working.

Fourth: it had to be done sometime, and I would guess that
there was no technical choice but a painful change.

However with Menhir, the issues aren't so bad because it doesn't
yet need to replace Ocamlyacc, just be available as an alternative.

I'm not complaining, but stating my reasons why I think it 
should be

.. and also making it clear, I hope, why I won't be
using it in my product until it is.

Unfortunately my team also has limited resources.
I already tried Menhir and provided some feedback.
I'm supportive of it. But I cannot convert my
production code to use a third party library
unless I can include the source in my product.

Felix doesn't use any external third party libraries:
it uses the system Ocaml and C++ libraries, and it
uses Cil/Frontc, Elkhound and Tre .. which are included
in the Felix system as source code and built by the
Felix build system. 

I might consider doing that with Menhir if the licence
were FFAU like MIT/BSD/Boost/Creative Commons.
