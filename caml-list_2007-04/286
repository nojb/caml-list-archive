Isn't there a contradiction here somewhere? "We won't fix Ocamlyacc,
because Menhir will replace it and we won't put Menhir in the standard
distribution because it is not god enough yet?".

I don't want to make any demands whatsoever here -- I haven't looked
an Menhir yet, nor have I looked at the Ocamlyacc bug in
question. It's only I see a discrepancy here.
