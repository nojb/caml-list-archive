<http://pattern.ijop.org/>
. This blog belongs to the editors of IJOP, columnists, staff,
advisory, editorial and domain expert boards, external reviewers, and
to those who have been specially invited. It is an open forum which is
managed by Dr. M. E. Fayad and his associates, if you would like to
submit an article to the Software Pattern Blog, please email it to
patterns-blog@ijop.org <mailto:patterns-blog@ijop.org>
 and refer to the guidelines at http://pattern.ijop.org/?page_id=4

This blog focuses on software patterns, stable analysis and design
patterns, architectural patterns, pattern languages and how to
develop systems of patterns. In order to keep the spam at a minimum,
