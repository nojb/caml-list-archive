X-Spam: no; 0.00; bigarray:01 ocaml:01 ocaml:01 recompile:01 stub:01 c-library:01 compiler:01 bigarray:01 c-library:01 cheers:01 compile:01 preprocessor:01 caml:02 caml:02 namely:02 

Since a few days I'm using ocaml3.10 as standard ocaml environment. Until now everything worked fine. Then I tried to recompile a stub file for an ocmal-interfaced C-library and ended up with the error message "'bigarray.h' not found". After browsing the directory <ocamllibpath>/caml/ i realised, that the compiler was correct :), there was realy no bigarray.h. Instead there is a file named compatibility.h where some preprocessor commands are included which seemed to correspond to the former bigarray.h. After creating a new file bigarray.h with the sole content:

 #include <caml/compatibility.h> 

everything worked fine, until there was another error message for a different ocaml-interfaced C-library, namely: "'camlidlruntime.h' not found". Here I had to create the file camlidlruntime.h with the content:

#include <<oldocamllibpath>/caml/camlidlruntime.h>

in order to be able to compile. Now this solution does not seem very nice to me. Is there a general advice how to change settings as the one above from ocaml < 3.10 to ocaml 3.10?

cheers

christian
