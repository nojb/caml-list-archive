You could in principle pre-compile your parser on your own machine using
menhir and ship the generated files, so menhir wouldn't be a prerequisite.

There are at least two reasons why Menhir isn't (yet) shipped with ocaml.
First, it produces code which is significantly larger than ocamlyacc's
tables. This might be a problem for some people, so we should add an option to
produce tables instead of code. Second, Menhir is still considered
experimental, and its input language could still evolve. For instance, its
treatment of errors and error recovery might be modified in the future, as
well as its treatment of priorities.

Feel free to make suggestions about Menhir! They are most welcome, even
though, by lack of spare time, Menhir is not moving very fast.
