I agree that there are probably many more users who do not depend on
Camlp4 than ones that do.

Well, I wouldn't exactly say that it facilitates it, but it certainly
enforces it ;-)

Finally we'll get stack backtraces for native code, which is an
extremely important feature for production systems.  I guess every
OCaml-developer will be happy about that.
