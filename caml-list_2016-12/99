### New this year

Those familiar with previous ICFP conferences should be aware of two signif=
icant changes that are being introduced in 2017:

1. Papers selected for ICFP 2017 will be published as the ICFP 2017 issue o=
f a new journal, Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL), =
which replaces the previous ICFP conference proceedings. The move to PACMPL=
 will have two noticeable impacts on authors:

    * A new, two-phase selection and reviewing process that conforms to ACM=
=E2=80=99s journal reviewing guidelines.
=20=20=20
    * A new, single-column format for submissions.

2. Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase of =
the reviewing process will have the option to submit materials for Artifact=
 Evaluation.

Further details on each of these changes are included in the following text.

### Scope

ICFP 2017 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional progra=
mming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, f=
rom foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The scope=
 includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including bo=
th purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with o=
bjects, concurrency, or parallelism. Topics of interest include (but are no=
t limited to):

  * *Language Design*: concurrency, parallelism, and distribution; modules;=
 components and composition; metaprogramming; type systems; interoperabilit=
y; domain-specific languages; and relations to imperative, object-oriented,=
 or logic programming.

  * *Implementation*: abstract machines; virtual machines; interpretation; =
compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; garbage collection and=
 memory management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfac=
es to foreign functions, services, components, or low-level machine resourc=
es.

  * *Software-Development Techniques*: algorithms and data structures; desi=
gn patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof assistants; deb=
ugging; testing; tracing; profiling.

  * *Foundations*: formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type theor=
y; monads; continuations; control; state; effects; program verification; de=
pendent types.

  * *Analysis and Transformation*: control-flow; data-flow; abstract interp=
retation; partial evaluation; program calculation.

  * *Applications*: symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial in=
telligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web programming; h=
ardware design; databases; XML processing; scientific and numerical computi=
ng; graphical user interfaces; multimedia and 3D graphics programming; scri=
pting; system administration; security.

  * *Education*: teaching introductory programming; parallel programming; m=
athematical proof; algebra.

Submissions will be evaluated according to their relevance, correctness, si=
gnificance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its co=
ntributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what h=
as been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it wi=
th previous work. The technical content should be accessible to a broad aud=
ience.

ICFP 2017 also welcomes submissions in two separate categories &mdash; Func=
tional Pearls and Experience Reports &mdash; that must be marked as such at=
 the time of submission and that need not report original research results.=
  Detailed guidelines on both categories are given at the end of this call.

Please contact the program chair if you have questions or are concerned abo=
ut the appropriateness of a topic.

### Preparation of submissions

**Deadline**: The deadline for submissions is Monday, February 27, 2017, An=
ywhere on Earth (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth>).  This =
deadline will be strictly enforced.

**Formatting**: (NOTE: NEW FORMAT REQUIREMENTS FOR ICFP 2017)  Submissions =
must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on US Letter sized pape=
r, and interpretable by common PDF tools. All submissions must adhere to th=
e "ACM Large" template that is available (in both LaTeX and Word formats) f=
rom <http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template>.  For authors us=
ing LaTeX, a lighter-weight package, including only the essential files, is=
 available from <http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format>.

There is a limit of 24 pages for a full paper or 12 pages for an Experience=
 Report; in either case, the bibliography will not be counted against these=
 limits. These page limits have been chosen to allow essentially the same a=
mount of content with the new single-column format as was possible with the=
 two-column format used in past ICFP conferences. Submissions that exceed t=
he page limits or, for other reasons, do not meet the requirements for form=
atting, will be summarily rejected.

**Submission**: Submissions will be accepted at <https://icfp17.hotcrp.com/=
> (in preparation at the time of writing).

Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submi=
ssion deadline using the same web interface.

**Author Response Period**: Authors will have a 72-hour period, starting at=
 15:00 UTC on Monday, April 17, 2017, to read reviews and respond to them.

**Supplementary Materials**: Authors have the option to attach supplementar=
y material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose =
not to look at it. The material should be uploaded at submission time, as a=
 single pdf or a tarball, not via a URL. This supplementary material may or=
 may not be anonymized; if not anonymized, it will only be revealed to revi=
ewers after they have submitted their review of the paper and learned the i=
dentity of the author(s).

**Authorship Policies**: All submissions are expected to comply with the AC=
M Policies for Authorship that are detailed at <https://www.acm.org/publica=
tions/authors/information-for-authors>.

**Republication Policies**: Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republ=
ication policy, as explained on the web at <http://www.sigplan.org/Resource=
s/Policies/Republication>.

**Resubmitted Papers**: Authors who submit a revised version of a paper tha=
t has previously been rejected by another conference have the option to att=
ach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), expla=
ining how they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submiss=
ion. If a reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous su=
bmission and wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the pr=
ogram chair will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her=
 previous review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of =
the previous reviews.

### Review Process

This section outlines the two-stage process with lightweight double-blind r=
eviewing that will be used to select papers for presentation at ICFP 2017. =
 We anticipate that there will be a need to clarify and expand on this proc=
ess, and we will maintain a list of frequently asked questions and answers =
on the conference website to address common concerns.
=20
**ICFP 2017 will employ a two-stage review process.**  The first stage in t=
he review process will assess submitted papers using the criteria stated ab=
ove and will allow for feedback and input on initial reviews through the au=
thor response period mentioned previously. At the PC meeting, a set of pape=
rs will be conditionally accepted and all other papers will be rejected.  A=
uthors will be notified of these decisions on May 1, 2017.

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with committee re=
views (just as in previous conferences) along with a set of mandatory revis=
ions. After five weeks (June 5, 2017), the authors will provide a second su=
bmission. The second and final reviewing phase assesses whether the mandato=
ry revisions have been adequately addressed by the authors and thereby dete=
rmines the final accept/reject status of the paper. The intent and expectat=
ion is that the mandatory revisions can be addressed within five weeks and =
hence that conditionally accepted papers will in general be accepted in the=
 second phase.

The second submission should clearly identify how the mandatory revisions w=
ere addressed. To that end, the second submission must be accompanied by a =
cover letter mapping each mandatory revision request to specific parts of t=
he paper. The cover letter will facilitate a quick second review, allowing =
for confirmation of final acceptance within two weeks. Conversely, the abse=
nce of a cover letter will be grounds for the paper=E2=80=99s rejection.

This process is intended as a refinement of the review process that has bee=
n used in previous ICFP conferences. By incorporating a second stage, the p=
rocess will conform to ACM=E2=80=99s journal reviewing guidelines for PACMP=
L.

**ICFP 2017 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.** To =
facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

  1. **author names and institutions must be omitted**, and
  2. **references to authors' own related work should be in the third perso=
n** (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on =
the work of ...").

The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come t=
o an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossi=
ble for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be=
 done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job=
 of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background referenc=
es should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel f=
ree to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they nor=
mally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the w=
eb or give talks on their research ideas.

### Information for Authors of Accepted Papers

* As a condition of acceptance, final versions of all papers must adhere to=
 the new ACM Large format. The page limits for final versions of papers wil=
l be increased to ensure that authors have space to respond to reviewer com=
ments and mandatory revisions.

* Authors of accepted submissions will be required to agree to one of the t=
hree ACM licensing options: copyright transfer to ACM; retaining copyright =
but granting ACM exclusive publication rights; or open access on payment of=
 a fee.  Further information about ACM author rights is available from <htt=
p://authors.acm.org>.

* At least one author of each accepted submissions will be expected to atte=
nd and present their paper at the conference.  The schedule for presentatio=
ns will be determined and shared with authors after the full program has be=
en selected.  Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the p=
resenter consents.

* We intend that the proceedings will be freely available for download from=
 the ACM Digital Library in perpetuity via the OpenTOC mechanism.

* ACM Author-Izer is a unique service that enables ACM authors to generate =
and post links on either their home page or institutional repository for vi=
sitors to download the definitive version of their articles from the ACM Di=
gital Library at no charge. Downloads through Author-Izer links are capture=
d in official ACM statistics, improving the accuracy of usage and impact me=
asurements. Consistently linking to the definitive version of an ACM articl=
e should reduce user confusion over article versioning. After an article ha=
s been published and assigned to the appropriate ACM Author Profile pages, =
authors should visit <http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-servi=
ce> to learn how to create links for free downloads from the ACM DL.

* The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made availa=
ble in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to *two weeks prior* to=
 the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the=
 deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase of the=
 review process will be encouraged (but not required) to submit supporting =
materials for Artifact Evaluation. These items will then be reviewed by a c=
ommittee, separate from the program committee, whose task is to assess how =
the artifacts support the work described in the associated paper. Papers th=
at go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a s=
eal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted paper=
s will be encouraged to make the supporting materials publicly available up=
on publication of the proceedings, for example, by including them as "sourc=
e materials" in the ACM Digital Library.  An additional seal will mark pape=
rs whose artifacts are made available, as outlined in the ACM guidelines fo=
r artifact badging.

Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and will not influence th=
e final decision regarding paper acceptance.

Further information about the motivations and expectations for Artifact Eva=
luation can be found at <http://icfp17.sigplan.org/track/icfp-2017-Artifact=
s>.

### Special categories of papers

In addition to research papers, ICFP solicits two kinds of papers that do n=
ot require original research contributions: Functional Pearls, which are fu=
ll papers, and Experience Reports, which are limited to half the length of =
a full paper. Authors submitting such papers should consider the following =
guidelines.

#### Functional Pearls

A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to functiona=
l programming. Examples include, but are not limited to:

  * a new and thought-provoking way of looking at an old idea

  * an instructive example of program calculation or proof

  * a nifty presentation of an old or new data structure

  * an interesting application of functional programming techniques

  * a novel use or exposition of functional programming in the classroom

While pearls often demonstrate an idea through the development of a short p=
rogram, there is no requirement or expectation that they do so. Thus, they =
encompass the notions of theoretical and educational pearls.

Functional Pearls are valued as highly and judged as rigorously as ordinary=
 papers, but using somewhat different criteria. In particular, a pearl is n=
ot required to report original research, but, it should be concise, instruc=
tive, and entertaining. A pearl is likely to be rejected if its readers get=
 bored, if the material gets too complicated, if too much specialized knowl=
edge is needed, or if the writing is inelegant. The key to writing a good p=
earl is polishing.

A submission that is intended to be treated as a pearl must be marked as su=
ch on the submission web page, and should contain the words "Functional Pea=
rl" somewhere in its title or subtitle. These steps will alert reviewers to=
 use the appropriate evaluation criteria. Pearls will be combined with ordi=
nary papers, however, for the purpose of computing the conference's accepta=
nce rate.

#### Experience Reports

The purpose of an Experience Report is to help create a body of published, =
refereed, citable evidence that functional programming really works &mdash;=
 or to describe what obstacles prevent it from working.

Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:

  * insights gained from real-world projects using functional programming

An Experience Report is distinguished from a normal ICFP paper by its title=
, by its length, and by the criteria used to evaluate it.

  * Both in the proceedings and in any citations, the title of each accepte=
d Experience Report must begin with the words "Experience Report" followed =
by a colon. The acceptance rate for Experience Reports will be computed and=
 reported separately from the rate for ordinary papers.
=20=20
  * Experience Report submissions can be at most 12 pages long, excluding b=
ibliography.

  * Each accepted Experience Report will be presented at the conference, bu=
t depending on the number of Experience Reports and regular papers accepted=
, authors of Experience reports may be asked to give shorter talks.

  * Because the purpose of Experience Reports is to enable our community to=
 accumulate a body of evidence about the efficacy of functional programming=
, an acceptable Experience Report need not add to the body of knowledge of =
the functional-programming community by presenting novel results or conclus=
ions. It is sufficient if the Report states a clear thesis and provides sup=
porting evidence. The thesis must be relevant to ICFP, but it need not be n=
ovel.

The program committee will accept or reject Experience Reports based on whe=
ther they judge the evidence to be convincing. Anecdotal evidence will be a=
cceptable provided it is well argued and the author explains what efforts w=
ere made to gather as much evidence as possible. Typically, more convincing=
 evidence is obtained from papers which show how functional programming was=
 used than from papers which only say that functional programming was used.=
 The most convincing evidence often includes comparisons of situations befo=
re and after the introduction or discontinuation of functional programming.=
 Evidence drawn from a single person's experience may be sufficient, but mo=
re weight will be given to evidence drawn from the experience of groups of =
people.

An Experience Report should be short and to the point: it should make a cla=
im about how well functional programming worked on a particular project and=
 why, and produce evidence to substantiate this claim. If functional progra=
mming worked in this case in the same ways it has worked for others, the pa=
per need only summarize the results &mdash; the main part of the paper shou=
ld discuss how well it worked and in what context. Most readers will not wa=
nt to know all the details of the project and its implementation, but the p=
aper should characterize the project and its context well enough so that re=
aders can judge to what degree this experience is relevant to their own pro=
jects. The paper should take care to highlight any unusual aspects of the p=
roject. Specifics about the project are more valuable than generalities abo=
ut functional programming; for example, it is more valuable to say that the=
 team delivered its software a month ahead of schedule than it is to say th=
at functional programming made the team more productive.

If the paper not only describes experience but also presents new technical =
results, or if the experience refutes cherished beliefs of the functional-p=
rogramming community, it may be better off submitted it as a full paper, wh=
ich will be judged by the usual criteria of novelty, originality, and relev=
ance. The program chair will be happy to advise on any concerns about which=
 category to submit to.
