Subject: [Caml-list] the latest obuild (v0.1.8) supports ppx

Dear list,

Obuild is a very simple build system for users and developers
of OCaml libraries and programs.
Obuild acts as a building black box: users only declare what they want 
to build and with which sources; the build system will consistently
build it.

The maintainer of obuild (Jerome Maloberti) just added ppx support.
This will be available soon in opam, starting from obuild version 0.1.8.

Francois.
