This is absolutely true, and I'm extremely grateful to all who commented --
the results are wonderful. The barriers to entry in this case, however, are
knowledge, quality and effort. By contrast, Jacques Garrigue (sorry for
picking on you Jacques) recording a session off the cuff on his laptop as
he casually steps through the code in his editor (he wouldn't even need a
webcam) and then uploading it to youtube would be a tremendous resource in
and of itself.

Another idea is that we develop a protocol for doing precisely this kind of
evolutionary crowdsourced commenting, but take the initial barrier out of
it.  Suppose that we allowed opening PRs on random files in the codebase. I
(or others) would ask questions about functions I didn't understand, and
other people would step up and explain them. Eventually, there might be
some documentation and clarification to add to the code. This would require
tolerance of 'unhelpful' and question-based documentation PRs. There might
be some very basic questions in there. We could add a specific tag, so
these PRs aren't closed prematurely (they could take a while). Would that
be ok?
