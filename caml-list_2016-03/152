Subject: [Caml-list] Call For Workshop Proposals: 32nd International
 Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2016)


           *** CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ***

                      ICLP 2016

     32nd International Conference on Logic Programming

                    Oct 17 - 21, 2016
                    New York City, USA

       http://software.imdea.org/Conferences/ICLP2016/

ICLP 2016, the 32nd International Conference on Logic Programming,
will be held in New York City, USA, from October 17 to October 21, 
2016.

Workshops collocated with an international conference are one of the
best venues for the presentation and discussion of preliminary work,
novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide and interested audience.
Collocated workshops also provide an opportunity for presenting
specialized topics and opportunities for intensive discussions and
project collaboration. The topics of the workshops collocated with
ICLP 2016 can cover any areas related to logic programming, (e.g.,
theory, implementation, environments, language issues, alternative
paradigms, applications), including cross-disciplinary areas. However,
any relevant workshop proposal will be considered.

The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizers,
but ample time should be allowed for general discussion. Workshops can
vary in length, but the optimal duration will be half a day or a full
day.

Workshop Proposal:
==================
Those interested in organizing a workshop at ICLP 2016 are invited to
submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and about
two pages in length. They should contain:

 * The title of the workshop.
 * A brief technical description of the topics covered by the workshop.
 * A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.
 * A list of some related workshops held in the last years
 * The requested number of half-days allotted to the workshop
   and an estimate of the number of expected attendees.
 * The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page,
   phone) of the workshop organizers together with a designated
   contact person.
 * Previous experience of the workshop organizers in
   workshop/conference organization.

Proposals are expected in text or PDF format. All proposals should be
submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by March 29, 2016.


Reviewing Process:
==================
Each submitted proposal will be reviewed by the Workshop, Program and
General Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and that fit the
goals and scope of ICLP will be selected.  The decision will be
notified by email to the responsible organizer by April 8, 2016.

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the
number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every
accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting
room. The proceedings should be produced and distributed (usually via
web pages) by each workshop organizer.


Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
===========================

 * Producing a "Call for Papers" for the workshop and posting it
   on the Internet and other means.  A web page URL should be provided 
   by April 24, 2016, and will published on the ICLP 2016 home page.
 * Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
   program.
 * Reviewing/accepting submitted papers.
 * Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
   organizers and the Workshop Chair.
 * Sending workshop program in PDF format to the Workshop Chair for
   distribution and posting at the conference by September 18, 2016.
 * The use of the Computing Research Repository (CoRR) for the
   workshop proceedings is strongly recommended. For guidelines, see:
     http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/projects/ALP/electronic_publishing.html
   We encourage reading these instructions in advance so that you can
   ask paper authors to prepare the final versions of their papers
   accordingly.
