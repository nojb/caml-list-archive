The main problem a technical writer faces in documenting someone 
else's software is to understand it.  Without that, he might produce 
elegant documentation that looks good but is utterly useless.

Would such a recording bw useful to a documentatino writer?  Possibly 
even one who writes comments to include in the code?

As ever, may I suggest people look at the Trestle documentation at 
http://www.std.org/~msm/common/SRC-RR-068.pdf as an 
example of how good machine-generated documentation can be?

Of course this takes care and attention whe writing the comments in 
the code.  nd, presumably, a competent program to covert thsoe 
comments into a well-orgnnised volume.

PR? I donn't know the acronym.
