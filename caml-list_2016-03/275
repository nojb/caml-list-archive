Subject: [Caml-list] Is it possible to get back some OCaml code after ppx
 processing ?

Dear list,

I am completely new to the -ppx option of the compiler, so please
forgive in advance my (probably stupid) two questions.

Here is some example code:
---
type t = {
   i: int;
   f: float
} [@@deriving sexp]
---

1) I'd like to see all the functions automatically created
by the magical spell "[@@deriving sexp]".
At least their names and type signatures would be nice.
How to do that?

2) If that's not possible, I'd like to get back some
OCaml code corresponding to the AST after ppx processing.
If that's possible, how to do that?

Thanks a lot,
Francois.
