Subject: Re: [Caml-list] <DKIM> Re: Status of Flambda in OCaml 4.03

It is realistic when using the -Oclassic option that Mark mentioned.
By default the flambda inlining heuristic is decided at call site. Hence
all the information about a function needs to be available to correctly
decide. That means that the size of the cmx file is approximatively
linearly related to the .o file size. It is not easy to decide that some
function will never be inlined, so the information is always kept,
even on function annotated with [@inline never]. But I wouldn't
expect that to benefit that much. But for the -Oclassic mode where
the decision is made at the definition, it is possible to decide not
to include some information in the cmx. This is what happens in
non-flambda mode, and in flambda mode it also reduce a bit the
cmx size, but not as much as it could. This will probably improve
in 4.04 if there is sufficient interest in this -Oclassic mode.
