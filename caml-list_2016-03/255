Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Papers: Workshop on User Interfaces for
 Theorem Provers (UITP 2016 @ IJCAR), Coimbra, Portugal, Deadline May 9th

			First Call for Papers

			      UITP 2016
  12th International Workshop on User Interfaces for Theorem Provers
		    in connection with IJCAR 2016
		  July 2nd, 2016, Coimbra, Portugal
	  http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/uitp/current/
	  
		* Submission deadline: May 9th, 2016 *

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The  User  Interfaces  for  Theorem  Provers  workshop  series  brings
together   researchers  interested   in   designing,  developing   and
evaluating interfaces  for interactive proof systems,  such as theorem
provers,  formal  method  tools,  and  other  tools  manipulating  and
presenting mathematical formulas.

While  the reasoning  capabilities of  interactive proof  systems have
increased dramatically over the last years, the system interfaces have
often  not   enjoyed  the   same  attention   as  the   proof  engines
themselves.  In many  cases,  interfaces remain  relatively basic  and
under-designed.

The User  Interfaces for  Theorem Provers  workshop series  provides a
forum for  researchers interested in improving  human interaction with
proof  systems. We  welcome participation  and contributions  from the
theorem proving, formal  methods and tools, and  HCI communities, both
to  report on  experience with  existing systems,  and to  discuss new
directions. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:

- Application-specific  interaction mechanisms  or designs  for prover
  interfaces Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces
- Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting proof
- Implementation  techniques (e.g.  web  services, custom  middleware,
  DSLs)
- Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct proof
- Representation and manipulation of mathematical knowledge or objects
- Visualisation of mathematical objects and proof
- System descriptions

UITP 2016 is a one-day workshop to be held on Saturday, July 2nd, 2016
in Coimbra, Portugal, as a IJCAR 2016 workshop.

** Submissions **

Submitted   papers  should   describe   previously  unpublished   work
(completed or  in progress), and  be at least 4  pages and at  most 12
pages. We encourage concise and relevant papers. Submissions should be
in PDF format, and typeset with  the EPTCS LaTeX document class (which
can be downloaded from  http://style.eptcs.org/). Submission should be
done via EasyChair at 

        https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=uitp16

All papers will be peer reviewed by members of the programme committee
and selected by the organizers in accordance with the referee
reports.

At  least one  author/presenter  of accepted  papers  must attend  the
workshop and present their work.

** Proceedings **

Authors will have the opportunity to incorporate feedback and insights
gathered during the  workshop to improve their  accepted papers before
publication  in the  Electronic  Proceedings  in Theoretical  Computer
Science (EPTCS - http://www.eptcs.org/).

** Important dates **

 Submission deadline: May 9th, 2016
 Acceptance notification: June 6th, 2016
 Camera-ready copy: June 20th, 2016
 Workshop: July 2nd, 2016
