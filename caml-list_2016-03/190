Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Flambda/compiler walkthrough + modularity

Adding a new optimisation to Flambda can be straightforward, in
particular if it's a stand-alone global pass.  However, this doesn't
relieve you from problems associated with phase ordering, which can be
problematic to deal with.

If, however, the optimisation relies on something (just to pick an
example) such as the approximations computed during simplification
then it may be harder.  Things like this probably need to hook
directly into the simplifier, which is rather more involved.  We've
had some initial thoughts about returning the approximations as the
"types" of Flambda terms, which might make things more easily modular
in this area.

The idea of a talk is an interesting one, although I think for the
moment it would be a better use of our time to improve the
documentation within the code (which we are planning to do before the
release).  Also, given this is the first version, it's quite likely
there will be significant changes in the next couple of releases which
might make such a talk get out of date quite quickly.  It's perhaps
something we should consider doing after that.
