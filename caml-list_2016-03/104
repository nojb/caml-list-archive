Subject: [Caml-list] CFP - 5th Workshop on Practical Aspects of Automated
 Reasoning

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

PAAR-2016 - 5th Workshop on Practical Aspects of Automated Reasoning
July 2nd, 2016.  Coimbra, Portugal

Deadline: May 2nd, 2016
http://cs.ru.nl/paar16/

General Information

  The 5th Workshop on Practical Aspects of Automated Reasoning will
  be held on July 2nd, 2016 in Coimbra, Portugal.  PAAR is associated
  with the 8th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning
  (IJCAR-2016).

Scope

  PAAR provides a forum for developers of automated reasoning
  tools to discuss and compare different implementation
  techniques, and for users to discuss and communicate their
  applications and requirements. The workshop will bring
  together different groups to concentrate on practical aspects
  of the implementation and application of automated reasoning
  tools. It will allow researchers to present their work in
  progress, and to discuss new implementation techniques and
  applications.

Topics include but are not limited to:
    o automated reasoning in propositional, first-order,
      higher-order and non-classical logics;
    o implementation of provers (SAT, SMT, resolution, tableau,
      instantiation-based, rewriting, logical frameworks, etc);
    o automated reasoning tools for all kinds of practical
      problems and applications;
    o pragmatics of automated reasoning within proof assistants;
    o practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility
      studies;
    o evaluation of implementation techniques and automated
      reasoning tools;
    o performance aspects, benchmarking approaches;
    o non-standard approaches to automated reasoning,
      non-standard forms of automated reasoning, new
      applications;
    o implementation techniques, optimisation techniques,
      strategies and heuristics, fairness;
    o support tools for prover development;
    o system descriptions and demos.
  We are particularly interested in contributions that help the
  community to understand how to build useful reasoning systems
  in practice, and how to apply existing systems to real
  problems.

Paper Submissions

  Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either
  an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15
  pages) via EasyChair at
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=paar2016. Submissions will
  be refereed by the program committee, which will select a balanced
  program of high-quality contributions. Short submissions that could
  stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop are particularly
  welcome.

  Submissions should be prepared in LaTeX using the EasyChair proceedings
  style. The package containing the class file and its user guide and
  some helper tools can be downloaded from
  http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip. PAAR proceedings
  will be published electronically in the EasyChair Proceedings in
  Computing (EPiC) series.

  If quality and quantity of the submissions warrants this, we plan to
  produce a special issue of a recognized journal on the topic of the
  workshop.

Important Dates

  Paper submission deadline: May 2nd, 2016 (Anywhere on the planet)
  Notification: May 23rd, 2016
  Camera ready versions due: June 6th, 2016
  Workshop: July 2nd, 2016
