*****************************************************************

FTfJP 2016 - Call for papers

18th Workshop on
Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs

Co-located with ECOOP 2016 - 19 July 2016, Rome, Italy

http://2016.ecoop.org/track/FTfJP-2016

*****************************************************************


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline: April 15, 2016 (AoE)
Notification of acceptance: May 13
Workshop: July 19


OVERVIEW

Formal techniques can help analyze programs, precisely describe program
behavior, and verify program properties.  Languages such as Java, C#,
and Scala are interesting targets for formal techniques due to their
ubiquity and large installed base, stable and well-defined interfaces
and platforms, powerful (but also complex) libraries. The rising
deployment in smart cards and mobile computing raises concerns about
security and demands new methods to counter new possibilities for abuse.

Work on formal techniques and tools and work on the formal underpinnings
of programming languages themselves naturally complement each other.
This workshop aims to bring together people working in both fields, on
topics such as:

* Language semantics
* Specification techniques and languages
* Verification of program properties
* Verification logics
* Dynamic program analysis
* Static program analysis
* Type systems
* Security

The workshop welcomes a wide range of submissions (see below), such as
technical contributions, case studies, challenge proposals, and position
papers. Just as the number and the feature set of Java-like languages is
expanding, the term "Java-like" is also to be understood broadly.


SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Contributions are sought on open questions, new developments, or
interesting new applications of formal techniques in the context of Java
or similar languages. Contributions are possible in two formats:

* full  papers (up to 6 pages in the ACM 2-column style)
* short papers (up to 2 pages in the ACM 2-column style)

Submissions should strive not merely to present completely finished
work, but also raise challenging open problems or propose speculative
new approaches. Case studies, reports from competitions, and other
experience reports  should identify lessons learned, reflect on the
state of the art, or clearly motivate further research.

We particularly welcome (clearly marked) position and discussion papers
that may simply present suitable topics for discussion at the workshop,
or raise issues that you feel deserve the attention of the research
community. Examples include future work identified from existing
research, potential PhD proposals, and specific well-motivated
challenges within the workshop scope.

Contributions will be formally reviewed for originality, relevance, and
the potential to generate interesting discussions. Accepted papers will
have the option of being published in the ACM Digital Library. In
addition, depending on the nature of the contributions, we may be
organizing a special journal issue as a follow-up to the workshop, as
has been done for some of the previous FTfJP workshops. Contributions
must be in English, in PDF format, and follow the format outlined above.
Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of
them will be present at the workshop.=20
