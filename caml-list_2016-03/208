This is true, but note that this problem also happens when people
contribute code changes to the project. They start by constructing a local
understanding of what is happening, then use this knowledge to write a
patch. The patch may be a documentation patch, or a fix or a new feature,
and there is a risk in all cases. Currently people rather send code changes
only, so it's good to remind that they can also document their assumption
in passing (or just send documentation patches); a review will be needed
anyway.

I'm not assuming a separation of role between "development" and
"documentation" in my remark above. I never had the luck of working with
technical authors dedicated mostly to writing documentation, so I cannot
comment on how people with such a profile would best contribute -- but they
should definitely get in touch to sort it out.

(Sorry about the acronym-speak. PR is actually a loaded acronym for the
OCaml project right now, as it may denote either a "Pull Request" on the
github interface for code contributions, or a "Problem Report" on the
Mantis bugtracker. One can be explicit and say GPR and MPR. It is also
possible to send patches on the bugtracker, so here I should just have said
"patches".)

Some regions of the codebase have a well-defined maintainer (typing ->
Jacques Garrigue, pattern-matching -> Luc Maranget, backend -> Xavier
Leroy, garbage collector -> Damien Doligez), and some people are experts on
more local or cross-cutting aspects. As far as I know, there is no formal
ownership structure, but people triaging bugs or change proposals will
usually know who to ask before making decisions. You don't need to know in
advance who would be the best reviewer to send a patch.

Yes, and this is encouraged. More generally, people should feel free to
look at the bugreports and try to propose a fix (whether they "know well"
the affected part of the codebase or not), and to look at the proposed
patches and review them -- which means commenting on everything that feel
strange or that you do not understand in the patch.
