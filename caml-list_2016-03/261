Subject: [Caml-list] [TFPIE 2016] 2nd call for papers

       Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE 2016)
                        2nd Call for papers
              https://wiki.science.ru.nl/tfpie/TFPIE2016

The 5th International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in
Education, TFPIE 2016, will be held on June 7, 2016 at the University
of Maryland College Park in the USA. It is co-located with the
Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP 2016) which takes
place from June 8 - 10.

*** Goal ***

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals
that use, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in
education. TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas,
classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on the use of functional
programming in education are discussed. The one-day workshop will
foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for
publication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2016 will
screen submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope
and are of interest to participants. Potential presenters are invited
to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or a draft paper (up to 16
pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted presentations will have
their preprints and their slides made available on the workshop's
website/wiki. Visitors to the TFPIE 2016 website/wiki will be able to
add comments. This includes presenters who may respond to comments and
questions as well as provide pointers to improvements and follow-up
work. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit (a
revised version of) their article for review. The PC will select the
best articles for publication in the journal Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). Articles rejected for
presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally reviewed by
the PC. TFPIE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews,
Scotland (2012), Provo Utah, USA (2013), Soesterberg, The Netherlands
(2014), and Sophia-Antipolis, France (2015).

*** Submission Guidelines ***

TFPIE 2016 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the
classroom, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any
creative use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or
outside Computer Science.  Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

- FP and beginning CS students
- FP and Computational Thinking
- FP and Artificial Intelligence
- FP in Robotics
- FP and Music
- Advanced FP for undergraduates
- Tools supporting learning FP
- FP in graduate education
- Engaging students in research using FP
- FP in Programming Languages
- FP in the high school curriculum
- FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
- FP and Philosophy

*** Best Lectures ***

In addition to papers, we request "best lecture" presentations. What
is your best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun
way to present FP concepts to novices or perhaps an especially
interesting presentation of a difficult topic? In either case, please
consider sharing it. Best lecture topics will be selected for
presentation based on a short abstract describing the lecture and its
interest to TFPIE attendees.

*** Submission ***

Papers and abstracts can be submitted via EasyChair at the following
link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2016

It is expected at at least one author for each submitted paper will
attend the workshop.
