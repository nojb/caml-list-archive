Recently, I was looking for some Kohonen Self Organizing Map (SOM)
library in OCaml and I didn't find one.

In opam, it looks like there is nothing related to neural networks
or I missed it.
This smells like a bad news (as in "nothing mature out there").

It looks like I will have to use R the day I really need to use SOM maps.

Here is what I found however:

http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/neurocaml/src/?root=neurocaml

Article 71 in the OCaml Journal (not free, unfortunately):

http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_journal/index.html

An interesting e-mail but with dead links:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/1997\/10/e3746cfab892fc757d0d8abcbcc13420.fr.html

If we had at least some bindings in opam to a high quality neural 
networks library, that would be useful to several people ...
