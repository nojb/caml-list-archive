Subject: Re: [Caml-list] <DKIM> Re: Status of Flambda in OCaml 4.03

One problem I see with the current approach is with libraries: their
.cmx files either contain sufficient information for Flambda /
cross-module inlining, in which case compiling and linking with many
such libraries may be slow.  Or they don't, in which case the
generated executable will be slow.  I don't think people will want to
maintain multiple library installations with different compilation
flags.

Users who just want to build an application generally don't care much
about (linear) compile times, because they only rarely install or
recompile a package.  But they will typically want good performance.
Developers usually don't care much about compile times either the
first time they compile a project.  But recompilations better be
lightening fast.

That's why I think multiple compilation files may be the better
long-term solution.  It may be slightly slower to build a project the
first time round, because you have to create more files.  But being
able to reuse compiled information in a more fine-grained way will
both satisfy developers who need fast recompilations, and users who
want good performance.  Note that sometimes developers also have to be
able to quickly switch between "slow" and "fast" compilation if they
are in the process of tuning their code.
