--------------------------------------------

=C2=A0

The 3th International Conference on Algorithms for Computational Biology (A=
lCoB 2016) invites researchers to submit poster presentations. AlCoB 2016 w=
ill be held in Trujillo (Spain) on June 21-22, 2016. See

=C2=A0

Poster presentations are intended to enhance informal interactions with the=
 conference participants, at the same time allowing for in-depth discussion.

=C2=A0

TOPICS

=C2=A0

Presentations displaying novel work in progress on algorithms in computatio=
nal biology are encouraged on the following topics:

=C2=A0

- assembling sequence reads into a complete genome,

- identifying gene structures in the genome,

- recognizing regulatory motifs,

- aligning nucleotides and comparing genomes,

- reconstructing regulatory networks of genes, and

- inferring the evolutionary phylogeny of species.

=C2=A0

Posters do not need to show final research results. Work that might lead to=
 new interesting developments is welcome.

=C2=A0

KEY DATES

=C2=A0

Submission deadline: May 14, 2016

Notification of poster acceptance or rejection: May 21, 2016

=C2=A0

Please submit a .pdf abstract to:

=C2=A0

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dalcob2016

=C2=A0

It should contain the title, author(s) and affiliation, and should not exce=
ed 500 words.

=C2=A0

PUBLICATION

=C2=A0

Posters will not appear in the LNCS/LNBI proceedings volume of AlCoB 2016. =
However, they will be eligible for submission to the post-conference journa=
l special issue in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioin=
formatics (TCBB, 2014 JCR impact factor: 1.438, quartile Q1).

=C2=A0

REGISTRATION

=C2=A0

At least one author of each accepted poster must register to the conference=
. The registration fare is reduced: 240 Euro. However, it gives the same ri=
ghts as all other conference participants (attendance, copy of the proceedi=
ngs volume, lunches...). Contributors of regular papers who in addition get=
 a poster accepted must register for the latter independently.
