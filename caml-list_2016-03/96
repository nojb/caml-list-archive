Just for information: with the ZeroMQ bindings that are in opam
(package zmq), it is possible to do synchronous and/or asynchronous 
distributed programming in OCaml.
That's not exactly RPC, but with some translation layer you can do some 
kind of RPC.
However, unlike async, zmq is not a pure OCaml library so
that's not as portable. You need the right version of the ZeroMQ
C++ library to be installed.

But, the good news, some asynchronous programming can be done
in OCaml without pulling in neither async nor lwt. :)
