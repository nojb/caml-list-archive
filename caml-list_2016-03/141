Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Status of Flambda in OCaml 4.03

By "enabled at configure time" I mean that you need to pass the
"-flambda" option to the configure script when building the compiler.

The main reason Flambda isn't enabled by default is because we need to
do further work to improve compile-time performance.  There are also
concerns about .cmx file size.  Flambda produces larger .cmx files: it
stores the entire intermediate representation of the compilation unit
so that no subsequent cross-module inlining decision is compromised.

There is a mode, -Oclassic, which uses Flambda but mimics the
behaviour of the existing compiler; unfortunately this isn't really
fast enough yet either and .cmx sizes aren't small enough.

When we manage to address some of these issues further, hopefully for
4.04, we will revisit whether Flambda should be enabled by default.

One of the main reasons there is a configure option rather than a
runtime switch is to avoid having to re-engineer the compiler's build
system to permit multiple builds of the various libraries (the stdlib,
for example) with differing options that affect what appears in the
.cmx files (e.g. with and without Flambda).  Even if code were used to
allow Flambda to read non-Flambda .cmx files, performance degradation
would result.
