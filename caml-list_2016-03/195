A nice quality of in-code comments that a video session does not have is
locality: the explanations are closed to the explainees, so hopefully they
can evolve in synch. Another nice quality (shared with blog posts) is that
it can be proposed by third-parties and crowd-sourced with moderate
efficiency: you can help document the OCaml implementation by sending a
pull-request with comments on the parts you fought to understand.

This has notably been done by Alain Frisch for the parsetree representation
during the 4.01 development phase, and recently (4.03 development cycle,
GPR#310) in types.mli and typedtree.mli by Fr=C3=A9d=C3=A9ric Bour, Gabriel=
 Radanne
and Thomas Refis, with helpful feedback from Alain Frisch and Jacques
Garrigue.

Anyone can help by submitting their own contribution to
documentation-as-comments.
