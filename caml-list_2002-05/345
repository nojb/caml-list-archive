When I worked with Arity/Prolog many years ago I extremely enjoyed its
_inline C_ feature, which allowed exactly what you would think of it,
and it was very useful. It had also a "traditional" (swiggable we would
say nowadays) interface to C.

Is it possible to implement such an inline C via camlp4?
