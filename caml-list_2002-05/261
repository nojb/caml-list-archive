You are right. Raise was a keyword in Caml for 10 years, just for the
syntactic reasons you mentioned.

With Caml Light, simplicity was the rule (remember that we managed to
run on a 640 ko PC!). So that raise was turn into a primitive function
for sake of simplicity. Afterwards, Objective Caml inherits (:-) that
property of raise.

In 2002, it may be the time to turn raise into a keyword again to
give our beginners and users a more confortable and natural system.

I also agree completely with you on the unvaluable importance of
program testing (and also program proving, but this much more
difficult). We plan to write a test generator for Caml
programs. Maxence Guesdon who has industrial experience on testing
volonteers on that project.
