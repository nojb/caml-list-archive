Hi,

This possibility exists since 1 or 2 years with the Graphps module
which is distributed in the Caml bazar.

Furthermore this library has a (tiny) website of its own!
(Have a look to http://pauillac.inria.fr/graphps/)

It is fully documented and can be used as a replacement of the
Graphics module; then your program will generate a postscript (or
encapsulated postscript file) instead of drawing on the screen.

Get the library at the used place, file graphps-1.0.tgz:

ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/bazar-ocaml/

(Caml Light users may find it in .../bazar-cl/graphps/graphps-1.0.tgz)

Hence, with Graphps, a program using the Graphics library not only can
work without any window manager, but it can even work on a computer
without screen! (Not a crazy idea by the way: I've done it once to
generate images from home, telneting on an INRIA destop that was
running a program using graphps :)

The library is mature, but any new idea, remark, enhancement, or, even
better, any code contribution is warmly welcomed.

Enjoy!

PS: Sorry for the late answer, I don't have time to read the Caml-list
these days!
