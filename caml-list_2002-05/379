Ok: that's perfectly reasonable, it just needs to be documented.

[The replace semantics you describe are unfortunate for me: my unification
algorithm keeps a hashtable of variable -> term bindings into which
I have to incrementally subtitute while iterating through the table.
At present, I'm building a fresh table, but then I have to clear
the original one and copy the whole contents up. I was hoping
to just modify the table in place .. ~2.5 times faster ..]
