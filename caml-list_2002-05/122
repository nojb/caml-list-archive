Hi, everyone.

I recently read Matthias Blume's paper about the NLFFI foreign interface for
SML/NJ (http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/blume/papers/nlffi.pdf).  NLFFI encodes
the C type system in ML using phantom types.  Then, with some compiler
extensions for dealing with C values, an ML program has direct access to
native C functions and data.

I like the design of NLFFI, and I was wondering if anyone has considered
implementing something similar for ocaml.

Thanks,
--Steve
