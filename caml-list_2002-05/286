Gerd,

What about the possibility of having multiple owners for the same library?
I can see the case (in fact I'm going to build a module that does this)
that segments a single shared library into multiple modules.  Then I'd
want multiple owners for the same library.

Are there any other tricks I need to be careful of to make sure that
this works?

On an unrelated point, can you modify the Makefile to define a new
variable, say DEBUG, that is set to either -g or nothing and replace
all the -g's with $(DEBUG)?  This would trim down the size of the
generated files.  This could also be added to configure as a -debug
command line option.  I can send in a patch if requested.

Best,
Blair
