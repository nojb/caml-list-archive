I haven't. And since I don't fully understand PV typing,
I prefer not to bother the developers (I fear the
"this is a feature not a bug" reply :))
But I understand that there may be error when source
is compiled when there aren't in the interpreter, ex:
  let x = ref []
When compiled, this gives :
  The type of this expression, '_a list ref,
  contains type variables that cannot be generalized
And this is perfectly fair (think of 2 different modules
accessing x, there may be a type clash).
I think the same thing happenned
in my previous mail but I haven't managed to isolate the problem yet.
