This is another reason that this is external to programs.  The typical
solution is either to use a shell with a more extended syntax (zsh,
for example) which lets you write "**/foo" to mean "foo in all
subdirectories", or to use the program find possibly with the support
of xargs.  A typical example is:

find . -type f -name \*.deleteme -print0 | xargs -0 rm

If your program needs to do this work itself, it should implement its
own system of globbing, much like find does.
