In Scheme, there is a conventtion that the names of destructive =
functions end with "!" and predicates end with "?". E.g., "append!" vs. =
"append", and "null?", "pair?", etc.

Are there any similar conventions that people use in O'Caml?

I ask because I am implementing a class and I want to provide both =
destructive and non-destructive versions of some of the methods. I would =
like the method names to clearly indicate which is which.

Thanks.
