  There are some cases where you may know the format string

  through something like gettext.

Rather, the format strings are known at compile-time,
but you don't know which string will be used.
So you can precompile all strings, and
select the right formatter at run-time.

Even if you want to do things at runtime, you can compile the default
string at compile-time, and then you know the type to expect.
Switching strings can then be done in a type-safe way: throw an exception
if the type of the replacement string's compiled printer doesn't match.
You'll need this type of mechanism, anyway.
