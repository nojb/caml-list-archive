General rpm feature. Use PreReq: instead of Requires: to get package
always installed after the package it depends.

For PLD Linux I have choosen to have only /usr/lib/ocaml in ld.conf and
have symlinks to dll*so there, just beacuse I thought it is simplest
approach. You can check http://www.pld-linux.org/ocaml.html for details.
(BTW: nice document about Debian OCaml packaging policy can be found in
Debian ocaml package).

Of course if there are local libraries, say in /usr/local/lib/ocaml user
is free to add anything to ld.conf, this scheme depends only on
/usr/lib/ocaml presence there.

There might be problem with check sums of interfaces. OCaml is far more 
restrictive when it comes to ABI compatibility then C. This probably
isn't so problematic with dll*.so files (as they do not tend to change), 
but it will be, when native code libraries could be placed in shared
files.
