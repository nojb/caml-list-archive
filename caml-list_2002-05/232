I say it. Camlp4 and the attempts to improve the syntax have been
considered *officially* by the OCaml team as a "not serious" work and a
"loss of time". As I worried about that, and asked for more information,
it has been confirmed by the team, moreover with several personnal attacks.

Sorry for this "human" problem, but I cannot create and have
imagination in my work when I am considered like that.

Camlp4 continues and I made many changes, but in the previous CVS
distribution, directory "camlp4", no more "ocaml/camlp4". It will
be distributed normally just after OCaml releases and perhaps with
intermediate releases.
