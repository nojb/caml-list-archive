Isn't camlp4 the obvious solution to this problem?
Format strings could "just" be processed at compile-time
by a camlp4 extension that produces a Danvy-style encoding
out of the format string.
Runtime processing of format string is more problematic,
but who needs that, anyway? Instead of concatenating format strings,
you'd directly use Danvy-style combinators.

Just my 2.e-7 kg of gold worth.
