Indeed: with debian we choose a solution to the problem because no one
proposed a standard policy. Now seems that a policy is just to be
issued, well for us, we are only asking to take _one_, _definitely_
decision.

Already done in debian packages, for each package that ships a library
that contain shared objects we have two packages: one named libfoo-ocaml
and one named libfoo-ocaml-devel where 'foo' is the name of the library.
The former contains the shared objects, the latter contains all the
other developmente stuff.

Yes, but not /usr/lib itself, something like /usr/lib/ocaml (what a
coincidence! :-) is better, anyway we have a polluted /usr/lib/ocaml
directory so that is better to choose something different like
/usr/lib/ocaml/shlibs or similar. See FHS for more details.

Cheers.
