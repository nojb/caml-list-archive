Sure, there are plenty of announcement sites and Webzines where
regular mention of OCaml might help.  But there are so many of them
that we (the Caml *development* team) can't deal with this and have to
rely on volunteers.  For instance, Alan Schmitt writes a column for
Linux Weekly News.  Anyone is most welcome to write columns,
announcements, etc, for their favorite sites; that's an excellent way
to contribute to the OCaml project.
