Mmm, I thought (misleaded by a teacher, of course) that the following
would exhibit exponential behavior of type-inference:

let f y z = (z y) y
let f y = f (f y)
let f y = f (f y)
let f y = f (f y)
let f y = f (f y)
let f y = f (f y)
(* ad libitum *)

It seems that what takes time is occurence checking (disabled
with -rectypes) and pretty-printing of types (because internally, there
are many sharings), not type inference itself. For this (unatural)
example, bad behaviour of occurence checking is visible
(less than 0.04 seconds with -rectypes, and more than 10 minutes
[I'm not patient enough to wait more] without -rectypes).
