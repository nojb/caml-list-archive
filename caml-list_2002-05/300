You could have a special package L that only contains the library, and a minimum
cma/cmxa archive that loads the library, but that does not access it. The rest
can be placed in other packages that list L as predecessor. Ensure that
you call at least one O'Caml function from L (it can be empty), otherwise
the linker will remove the libraries from L from any executable you try
to build.

I can remove it from the command that builds "ocamlfind", but I do not think
that the debugging symbols should be missing in any cma library. They are
removed anyway if you build an executable without -g, so it is only a matter
of disk space (on the developer's system), and disks become larger all
the time.
