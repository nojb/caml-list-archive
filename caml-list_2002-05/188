Hmm.. when perparing rpms with OCaml packages for PLD Linux I first
created /usr/lib/ocaml/dlls and put dll*.so from all packages (including
main OCaml package) there directly. However it caused problems with
ocamlmktop (IIRC, ocamlc worked fine), so I ended up with dllfoo*.so 
in /usr/lib/ocaml/foo and symlinks in /usr/lib/ocaml (and just 
/usr/lib/ocaml in ld.conf).

AFAIK /var/lib/ocaml isn't good place for installation on any binary
stuff. /usr/lib/ocaml should be used, as it can be read only. /var is
for data that programs change. There is nothing to change in dynamic
library after it is installed. Please reffer to FHS for details.
