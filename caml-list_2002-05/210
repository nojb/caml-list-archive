So, you prefer to clutter the /usr/lib/ocaml/ld.conf file rather than
have a convenient tool for removing a line there when you remove the
package they belong to ? Remember, clutter is an open way to insecure
behavior ...

Mmm, there is a long discution on some of the debian lists (well a
flamewar would be a more correct name) with one side claiming that rpath
are evil, and can lead to problems if the files are moved around later
one (example cited was the moving of the /usr/X11R6 directory, probably
because you want to install a new X server while keeping the old one).

unless you have a package manager handling things :)))
