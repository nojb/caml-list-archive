Hmmm. That is bug #491 in the bug tracker,
and its categorized "not a bug" which it clearly is.
The note says "need full source code to investigate".
Great. Someone could have contacted me by email:
the source is all online at sourceforge and has been
for two years.

In any case, it seems the bug wasn't fixed, and now I may
be bitten by it again..but it is hard to be sure.
