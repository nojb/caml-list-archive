Before proposing such a solution is better to reach an agreement among
the community of OCaml libraries developer.

I've built a lot of debian packages containing ocaml library shared and
not. Almost of them assume that all the library files will be installed
to a _single_ directory, including in "library files": ml and mli files,
cm? files and shared objects. Installing all this stuff in a single
directory will cause rapidly name clashes.

The right(TM) solution seems to be: install shared object files in a
single directory listed in OCaml's ld.conf _but_ install all other stuff
in a per-package directory that needs not to be listed in ld.conf.

Right now I know no package that supports two different destination
directory as install flags. This is a tiny problem, but requires changes
in a lot of packages.

Please, don't require that all the library stuff will reside in a single
directory.

Cheers.
