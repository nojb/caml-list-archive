BTW, OcamlIDL can be easily patched to support COM under Cygwin, are you
interested in that?

I think most of them use dual (custom/dispatch) interfaces, so
*theoretically* one can extract their IDL interface definition by OleView
tool and then create the necessary stubs by CamlIDL. But *practically* it
is not an easy task: many MIDL features are still not supported by CamlIDL,
so I gave up when I tried this recently...

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
