Unfortunately, the ocaml compiler is itself dependant on type
information.  Compilation of pattern-matching in particular is tightly
integrated with the type checker. So you cannot turn off type
checking, lest you get invalid code.

One thing you might want to try is to write your own interpreter for
your subset of ocaml. According to the code snippets you posted, it is
restricted enough, so that should be easy. Then you can experiment
without compiling, and compile later if you really need to. Note that
with some tricks your interpreter can share data representation with
ocaml, so that your functions could be called directly from ocaml
(with a bit of magic, of course).

As long as your type are not really huge (like in Alain's example),
and you are not using subtyping, I don't think that there is much room
for improvement in the compiler.  This said, we find a complexity bug
once in a while. One of them was quite serious: type checking was done
twice for arguments in applications. Usually you won't notice it, but
if you have an application inside an argument inside an
argument... this was exponential! Unfortunately I don't remember
whether this was corrected before or after 3.04.

Cheers,
