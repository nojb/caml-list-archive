Note that it's not type-checking that's painful so much as type
reconstruction.  If it were possible to provide O'Caml with an
explicitly typed representation, simply checking the types should be
quite easy.  (Is it well typed?  Is it not well typed?)  Type
reconstruction, on the other hand, requires term unification and the
like, and takes a bit more effort.

How hard would it be (probably difficult) to expose an explicitly
typed layer from the system for automatic code generators?
