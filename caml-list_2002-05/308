Read the OCaml manual:

val iter : ('a -> 'b -> unit) -> ('a, 'b) Hashtbl.t -> unit

Hashtbl.iter f tbl applies f to all bindings in table tbl. F RECEIVES
THE KEY AS FIRST ARGUMENT, AND THE ASSOCIATED VALUE AS SECOND
ARGUMENT. The order in which the bindings are passed to f is
unspecied. Each binding is presented exactly once to f.
