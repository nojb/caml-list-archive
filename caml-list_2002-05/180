A few weeks ago I played around with the FFTW and also wrote a small
interface. Due to lack of time I had to discontinue the project, but
maybe you can find one or the other idea in my code that you might want
to adopt. I have put the sources here:

  http://www.oefai.at/~markus/tmp

Writing an interface that supports all FFTW-features in a convenient way
is quite non-trivial. Maybe you want to place your project at SourceForge
so that others can also contribute some code.

Regards,
Markus
