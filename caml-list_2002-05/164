Well, type-checking ML involves more than term unification -- the=20
worst case complexity is something truly horrible (EXP-time).
Having said this, for most programs, the worst-case complexity
rarely, if ever arises in "natural" code.  (I've not run into
it...)

So, I'd actually be surprised if there was any significant speedup
obtained by eliminating the type-inference from the compilation
path. =20
