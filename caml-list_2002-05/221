Probably yes, if you are going to use/create COM components with vtbl-style
interfaces. Support for IDispatch interfaces is very limited (see camlidl
manual).

In fact Cygwin gcc has all necessary COM libraries and camlidl can be
easily patched to support COM interfaces for Cygwin-build OCaml (I have
done that if you are interested).

[ocaml\README.win32]

The native Win32 port has threads and COM support

[camlidl\readme]

In addition, Camlidl provides basic support for COM interfaces and
components under MS Windows.  It supports both using COM components
(usually written in C++ or C) from Caml programs, and packaging Caml
objects as COM components that can then be used from C++ or C.

[end of quote]

So yes, MSVC-compiled OCaml supports Camlidl and COM out-of-the-box.

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
