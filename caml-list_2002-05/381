I meant no harm. But, you know, sometimes the pre-release
builds of open source projects are known from the very start
to be buggy or unstable, and it is advised to restrict use
only to testing. You know, like Windows 98 for example: use
is advised only for sake of testing the
"blue-screen-of-death-at-startup" feature ;->

This is as much as I wanted to hear: no known, obvious,
major flaw. Not like Windows 98, so to speak...

OK, now let me read some documentation on CVS so I can
figure out how to download the source :-)
