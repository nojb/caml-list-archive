Thanks for your prompt reply. So, the associativity also the same as the
first character.

Then, I have problems with the following code. In SML, I defined a few
infix as follows:

infixr 4 << >>
infixr 3 &&
infix 2 -- ##
infix 2 wth suchthat return guard
infixr 1 ||
				
I want to convert these code into ocaml. How can find so many different
'first characters'? Because the available characters in ocaml are:

**...            right
*... /... %...   left
+... -...        left
@... ^...        right

Do you have any sugestion?

Thanks a lot!
