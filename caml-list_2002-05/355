Hi, all, I have a question about the precedence of infix in ocaml.
I define a few infixes as follow:

let (^^) x y = ...
let (^+) x y = ...
let (^<) x y = ...

Now how can I define the precedence of them?  At first, I want to use
brackets to solve it, but later I find out it is almost impossible because
there are a lot of recursive functions and combination of these infixes. 

Can you give me any idea?
Thanks a lot!
