The same issue arises for List.rev_map. By experiment, I find it applies
its function argument from the head of the list argument, in order,
which is suggested by  the statement that it is tail recursive.
But it isn't *guarranteed* by the manual, and it probably should be.

To be pedantic .. the 'tail recursive' bit is non-information.
Only source code has that property. List.rev_map is a standard library
routine. It should be characterized by saying it has
linear performance, with constant storage overhead.
