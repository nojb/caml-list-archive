I don't know how the compiler treat unit values wrt optimization or
such, but using an unit in each node to emulate Set seems to me
inefficient for a module of the standard library.

I think, but I haven't thought a lot about it, that the problem can be
solved using an implementation polymorphic in the leaf type hidden to
the use that access Set and Map through functors as usual.

Anyway the idea seems really good.

I also suggest to add different kind of visit (i.e. not only iter) like
{pre,post,in}visit via different functions or specifing the desired
behaviour when using the functor or both.

Cheers.
