My Stew library (Available at http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/ocaml.html)
includes some random number stuff. There are a few modules for random number
distributions (Functorized so you can use your choice of actual (P)RNG
generators with them; I like the Mersenne Twister, also part of the
library.), and I just added exponential and poisson distributions after
seeing your email. :)
