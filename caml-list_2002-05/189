Unix gets it right. That's what package managers are for. You do
rpm -e foobar (or equivalent) and that's all.

Looking in multiple directories takes time. Think how much would it
take to check hundred of directories, which is no more then avarage
linux installation have C libraries. Similar can be told about /usr/bin
and <tab> in shell.
