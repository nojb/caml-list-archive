this only shows that " %2$s %1$d" is not a valid translation of " %s %d",
since they do not have the same type, and would fail at runtime (using this in
C would give you a segfault).

" %2$d %1$s" with type "string -> int" is a valid translation of " %s %d"

this means that not checking the translations could lead to a hole in the type
system, and so printf must be prepared to detect type errors (which it
currently does :)
