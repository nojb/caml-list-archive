That was me and I'm still working on it.  I just started working on 
automatic structure wrapping.  This project (ocaml-swig) is the first time 
I started working on the core of swig which unfortunately is constantly 
changing because Dave and the others trying to improve the C++ support.  So 
I really can't tell you when a working release of the ocaml-swig module 
will be done.
