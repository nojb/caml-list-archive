FAIW, let me say I'm shedding blood to make my code compile 
when I raise exceptions that have non banal type lists: I 
always misplace my parentheses. I never realized there was 
an alternative syntax provided by CamlP4, but I'm pretty 
sure this must be the solution to my crux. Should this be 
the case, I would find it considerably inconveniencing if 
camlp4 should be removed from the distribution.
