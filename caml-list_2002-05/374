I considered it, but there are several issues.  One of them is that
readline is GPL, thus linking it with the Caml toplevel could cause
license incompatibility issues.  Another issue is portability to
platfroms that do not have readline: the line reading and prompt
handling logic is quite different between readline and just reading
from standard input.

All in all, I believe using an external line editor such as Ledit,
CLE, FEP, ILE, etc, is a lot simpler and more flexible.
