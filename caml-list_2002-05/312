Subject: [Caml-list] Curious about Unix.readdir and ls

Hello,

I was wondering.... when doing Unix.readdir on an Emacs backup file (like #myfile#), I only get the name #myfile (without ending #). First I thought that was a problem related to the readdir function but obviously it is a little deeper than that:

When doing 'ls .' on the directory containing the above example file ls seems to have the same problem (at least on my system). The file is printed in flashing red and without the ending #. Or is this as it should? How do I know that? 

BUT, if I let the shell expand a wildcard, it does so correctly: 'ls *' returns a line containing #myfile# and my ocaml program doing readdir gets a correct filename (of course).

So, what is happening? Anyone who wants to enlighten me? :)

Jens Olsson
