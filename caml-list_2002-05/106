Fine then, like said, i did not look at it.

Sure, but it has to build for slower arches, which could use it for dvi
viewing, if not for actual presentation with fancy images. Anyway, for
me, it has to build for all 11 arches that are going to be released with
debian woody, so i did hand fix the makefiles (do you like a patch, i
don't think it will be nice, but it works, basically i have a instalopt
and instalbyte target, with a install target which call installopt, i
think.
