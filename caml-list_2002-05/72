Yes, we're in contact with the DrScheme folks, and they (with some
help/kibitzing from us at Penn) are definitely working on a DrML
environment -- probably for just a "teaching subset" of OCaml.

Actually, the motivation for my question on this list a couple of days
ago was to check what the fallback alternatives would be in case DrML is
not ready for teaching in the fall...

Unfortunately, this very wonderful aspect of the DrScheme environment
seems to have involved quite a lot of work and special hand-crafting.
It's not clear that it can be replicated for other languages with a
reasonable amount of work.
