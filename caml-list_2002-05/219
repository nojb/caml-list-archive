Subject: [Caml-list] ANN: Dynamic Caml v0.2 is released

I am pleased to announce the availability of Dynamic Caml v.0.2
from:

http://oops.tercom.ru/dml/

Dynamic Caml is a high-level, type-safe (statically typed)
and efficient dynamic code generation library and a set of 
CamlP4 syntax extensions for Objective Caml. 

Though still supporting only bytecode,
release 0.2 is much more mature than the previous 0.1 release.

This is the list of changes:

- Most of Objective Caml expressions are supported either
  natively (as constructors of code type) or via functional
  wrappers that are automatically generated by syntax extensions.
  Not supported expressions are:
    * labelled applications
    * OO features (method calls and such)
  Those can be used via manually written functional wrappers.

- Functional wrappers for expressions that are not natively supported
  are inlined in the generated bytecode, thus removing application
  overhead.

- Several bugfixes

- More examples added (see directory tests/ in the distribution)

Your comments and suggestions are welcome!

Dmitry
