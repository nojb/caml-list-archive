That is not correct: The Graphics-Library is independent
of X11. It's especially designed to be independent and
therefore provides a platform-independent graphic.
And that's the reason, why the set of available functions
is limited to a small subset.
This then can be used on Unix-, Windows-, Mac-Systems.
No X11 (or X11-emulators) is (are) required.

But on unix-systems it maybe is only available
on X11 right now.

Interesting in the Graphics-Lib is, that the names of the
graphics-functions are the same as in PostScript.
It would be nice to have the possibility to directly
write PostScript-Files with that Library too. :)
