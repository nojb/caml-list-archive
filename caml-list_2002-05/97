Just in case someone has not yet found this extremely useful site:
You can always find literature related to some topic if you look at
citeseer. Say, you start with one item from Dave's list like
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/remy91type.html
and then surf around along the links to related, cited or similar
documents. But don't waste you whole day there :-).

Yours, Florian.
