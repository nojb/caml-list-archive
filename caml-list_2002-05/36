Hello,

I guess that you want to use drawing functions (lines, circles...) 
available inside Graphics, without opening the graphic window, and
obtain results as some graphic file format.

If my guess is correct, unfortunatelly, the drawing function of the
Graphics library highly depends on those of the window system (X on
Unix, for example). Using these functions without windowing systems is
impossible at this moment.
