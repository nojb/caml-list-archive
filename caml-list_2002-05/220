I've a question about the link betwen Dynamic Caml and MetaOCaml 
(you can found MetaOcaml at
http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/taha/MetaOCaml/) 

As I see it, the main difference is that MetaOcaml is a modification
of the ocaml compiler, and dml is an external library, but is there
any more in depth difference between the two ? (By the way, MetaOCaml
lack a good documentation).

But it seem also (I may be wrong) that MetaOCaml enable more easily
multi stage generation (that is program that generate program that
generate program) Is this feasible with dml ?
