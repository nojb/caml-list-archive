Same as ocaml, camlimages installs (by make install) its native code
library only when the native code library is already
compiled. Therefore it is not a problem, I think.

On the otherhand, the problem of advi... Yes, it tries to install a 
native code version. At some point of the developement, we changed
its Makefile in order to install the native code version. 
It is since the byte-code advi is too slow for the real use
(i.e. presentations with many fancy images). 
Well, we will look for what we can do for the portability.
