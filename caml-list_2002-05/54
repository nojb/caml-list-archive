  I'm sorry, what do call "formatter"? Is it the format string or the
  formating function?

  This is true with the current implementation of printf in the Printf
  module. But this would be wrong if you consider parameter reordering
  in the C printf (the printf manual page gives enough good explainations=
).

  I've been giving the following example for quite long now: languages
  do not always order words the same way. So, sometimes, you need to
  reorder parameters in translated strings in order to get a correct
  syntax in the targeted language. With printf, you can do it this way:

  fr: " %s %d"
 =20
  string -> int

  de: " %2$s %1$d"

  int -> string

  This example shows that if you want a full featured internationalisatio=
n,
  you cannot state that "you know the type you expect" since you will onl=
y
  determine it at run-time.

  Cheers,
