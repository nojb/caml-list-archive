AFAICT from a quick look at the source, it's more like this:

delete: the binding may or may not be presented subsequently
add: the binding may or may not be presented
replace: the binding may be presented with the old or the new data
value; if it was already presented, it will not be represented
otherwise: the binding will be presented with its initial data value.
