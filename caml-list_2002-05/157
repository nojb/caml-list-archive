There are three cases to consider:

A. word-aligned
B. odd
C. equal to 2 modulo 4

Yes, compaction is the reason why non-aligned pointers are not allowed
by the documentation.  The compaction code will crash on case C.

So you can have it word-aligned, or odd, but not all arbitrary
pointers are allowed.  Be careful.  And compaction is now activated by
default (not in 3.04, but in the working version).

Don't ask me what happens on 64-bit machines, I'd have to look at the
source :-)
