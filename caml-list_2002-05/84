Hi Jocelyn,

I give some references below, but I have to add several caveats to my
remarks.  I don't have all these papers, so I can't check exactly what they
cover.  I believe they include similar operations on labelled records, and
these can be mapped to tuples by the SML technique of defining tuples as
records with numeric labels.  Whether that's the best approach is another
question; possibly it would be simpler to represent them as nested pairs,
as Alain Frisch suggested.  Finally, I'm not sure whether all these papers
gave type systems that were extensions of ML.

Anyway, here are the papers I had in mind.  Didier's work went on to become
Objective ML (which is why I wondered whether this operation was already
available in the system underlying OCaml).  Some of the other authors are
active on this list, and might be able to tell you more accurately whether
their work is relevant.
