Dear all,

I'd like to stop this thread for several reasons:

  1. the *really* bad idea here is to implicate (use?) OCaml users in
     this debate where personal issues overcome technical ones;

  2. There is no such decision, official or not. Daniel's message reflects
     only his personal point of view (and current mood).

  3. Daniel, I am sorry, but you are not the one who decides what is
     official and what is not.

Daniel, if you want to reply to this message, please do it to me
personally.

OCaml users and friends, if and when this problem that we (INRIA
folks) are facing will get solved, you'll be notified if the solution
changes something in the OCaml tree and/or the development model. If
you hear nothing about that, consider it as being good news.

Sincere apologies for this noise.

Sincerely,

-- Michel Mauny, (as head of the INRIA Cristal group)
