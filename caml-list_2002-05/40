When starting Cameleon i was told that emacs (or xemacs) would remain
THE editor. So i did not try to create another one and i chose to
inteface with them. But if you need a simple editor, interfacing
with toplevel, then one idea could be to take efuns (the simple
emacs clone developed by Fabrice Le Fessant) and add some
functionnalities to it. By making it a part of Cameleon, i think
the result could be what you're looking for. BTW, Cameleon includes a
doc browser which lets you access source code from the doc.
