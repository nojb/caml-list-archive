Hi, thanks for all you guys. 

After carefully checking my code, I tried to remove Obj.magic from my
code. Anyway, at last I have to keep one which is not the case you guys
mentioned. My code is very simple:

-----------
type ty = ty1 -> ty2   

(* where ty1, ty2 are some types I defined before, ty1 is some type like
g * h, while ty2 likes c * d * e * f. *)


let x = (f (g)) a

-----------
Here, f and g are functions, and the return type of (f (g)) is ty, which
is a function type ty1 -> ty2. While, the type of a is ty1. So, the
return type of (f (g)) a should be ty2. Anyway, every time I get an
error here. The error message is: You applied too many parameters... 

I was very surprised. After I removed a, then it is all right and the
return type is ty. So, I was thinking that the compiler treated ty as an
atomic type, not a function type. Then I have to use 'Obj.magic' here.
Anyway, the result with 'Obj.magic' is correct.

Probablely I was wrong here, but I'd like to get the help from you.

Regards,
Dengping
