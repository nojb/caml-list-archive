I gave a try at it today, with the latest binary snapshot (TclTk-8.4a4-2=
),
and the MacOSX port looks very much alpha quality.
After a lot of tweaking, I could succeed in building an executable
of ocamlbrowser without X11, and run it.
However it looks stranges (menus are not menus but selectors), and
doesn't work: I get lots of "SetFrontProcess failed" errors, and
cannot do anything with the application.

So, this doesn't look like it is going to be usable very soon.

On the other hand, installing Xdarwin is easy, and then you can just
use the standard Tcl/Tk, which works fine. I suppose this will be the
supported way in ocaml for some time.
