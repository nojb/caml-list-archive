I'm not quite sure what you mean. Do you mean that improving the
syntax is perceived to be waste of time by many people, or do you
mean that improving the syntax would waste the time of many people
(or both)?

I would estimate that it would take less than 30 minutes from a
capable Ocaml developer to change and test this issue by
modifying the Ocaml parser. After changing the syntax, it should
be possible to simplify the handling of variant types in the
compiler.
