I'll check the database. I can report that the specific bug  I had
in Ocaml 3.02 did NOT occur in 3.04. I know this because
I actually checked the code with both versions.

I must apologise for the delay responding, I had a serious ISP
problem (got cut off from the Internet entirely).

The complete source of my program is available from

    http://felix.sourceforge.net/felix_src.tgz

See the web site:

  http://felix.sourceforge.net/download.html

for information on building.

To use the included build scripts, you must have Python installed.
After unpacking the tarball, type

     python script/maker noiscr test

and it should build the compiler and then crash running
some of the tests. If you try the whole process again,
using Ocaml 3.01 it should work.

I have commented out the lines that cause Ocaml 3.01 to
give a diagnostic message. If you wish to generate the
Ocaml 3.01 errors that Ocaml 3.04 does not report,
you will need to uncomment those lines.
Grep for

 `DCL_val_typeof

in the files

  src/symtab.ml
  src/bbind.ml

Would you please email me privately when you have the tarball,
as I may wish to upload a new version in  which the code has
been substantially changed.

I am running Ocaml 3.04 on Linux RH 7.2
built with gc 2.96 after applying the patch to correct
a gcc 2.96 bug.

I will do everything I can to help resolve this problem,
I'd like to use new ocaml features .. and of I am already
depending on

    #variant_type

syntax in matches, which will not be supported in Ocaml 3.05.
I can't backtrack for that easily, and I'd hate to upgrade the syntax
only to find I can't compile my code under 3.05.

Thanks for your time, and of course, the excellent Ocaml system.
