Well, strings already _have_ a hard limit on their size...

But on second thought, yes, it seems that networking applications do
need features that are beyond what can reasonably be expected from a
Pervasives function. For example, in addition to limiting memory usage,
I also need to implement timeouts. Since there is no way to
asynchronously interrupt threads[1], the only way to make sure a
thread never blocks indefinitely is to use nonblocking IO, which
complicates things a bit.

So I ended up writing my own IO interface on top of the Unix module.
What bothers me about this is that now I cannot use any library
functions that operate on (in|out)_channels. Moreover, I had to
implement basic buffering, although the channel implementations do that
already.

Why, therefore, is it not possible to create standard channels that are
backed by user-defined functions? This is pretty much a standard feature
in many languages, and it would make life easier in many ways.

[1] Or so I gather. The Haskell folks have studied asynchronous
exceptions in PLDI '01 and implemented them in GHC. Perhaps their work
could be adapted for ocaml as well?
