There is no current owner of the ocaml project on freshmeat.net.  It
was last updated for version 3.0.1.

Because there is currently an ocaml project there, changing the owner
requires going through an editor approval process.

I volunteer to update freshmeat.net with announcements of new ocaml
versions.  Any objections?
