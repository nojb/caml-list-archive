Hello.

The docs weren't very clear on this, so I just wanted to check: is
(value)NULL a legal caml value? Checking from the sources, it seems that the
GC does leave alone all pointers that don't point to within the caml-managed
heap. However, the docs state that only "memory allocated by malloc" can be
turned directly into an abstract caml value. So may I rely on NULL working?
It would ease dealing with many C interfaces.
