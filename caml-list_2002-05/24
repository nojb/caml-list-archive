MLton does a bit more than that, really. It specializes *all* polymorphic
code, so that, after the transformation, the program can be typed in a
monomorphic type discipline. My suggestion, on the other hand, was to
duplicate polymorphic code only on a ``per-kind'' basis; for instance, if
all product types are of kind POINTER and (unboxed) integers are of kind
INT, then a polymorphic function (say, the identity) that is used at types
(say) int * int, float * float and int would only be compiled twice. I
believe this would severely limit the ``code size explosion'' problem
that is sometimes feared when doing monomorphization.
