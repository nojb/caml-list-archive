Hi,

Reading a recent thread on the list, I noticed that ocaml could be
used with COM components on windows. As I currently intensively use
the Python COM bindings with MS' text processor whose name I won't
say, I wonder if I could use ocaml to the same end.
However, the release notes in the ocaml-win distribution states that
the cygwin version lacks COM support, and the native win32 version
partially implements the libraries, among which I find no COM nor IDL
link. Does anyone on the list have more information ?

Thanks,

sL
