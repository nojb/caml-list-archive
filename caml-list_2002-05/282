Hi, folks.

I have a question about Stream.from.  If I create a stream by
Stream.from f by some function f, in what order f is called?  I mean,
is it guaranteed that f is always called as f 1, f 2, f 3, ....? or is
the order like f 1, f 3, f 5, f 7, f 2, f 4, .... possible?

The manual states nothing, so maybe I have to assume there is no
guarantee.  But then using a function with side effects
is nearly impossible, which is unfortunate.

I tried to understand the source, but it is full of magic and anyways,
the source does not make any guarantee for the future.
