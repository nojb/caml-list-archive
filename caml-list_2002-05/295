I think you're confusing tail calls with closure
conversion.  Closure conversion determines which
closures can stack allocated, done away with, or must
be heap allocated.  There are simple ways and complex
way to do this. Some references:

Orbit, Kranz et al

'Control Flow Analysis: A compilation paradigm for
functional langauge' Manuel Serrano

'Flow-directed Lighweight Closure Conversion' by the
guy who does the Stalin scheme compiler

'Lightweight Closure Conversion' Paul Steckler and
Mitchell Wand.

Google or CiteSeer with find the above and a zillion
more.

HTH,
Noel
