In networking-applications, or when using pipes you
can't use C's standard-lib and have to use the
Unix-API directly (open/read/write/close).

Ocaml's libraries seem to be wrapping C's standard-lib
for it's normal I/O and the Unix-API for it's Unix-module.

So, if you want to use pipes/sockets, you have to use the
Unix-module's I/O-functions!

But I think in Ocaml it is not a problem to write wrapper-code.
In C this would be much effort, but I think in Ocaml it's
easy to write a network-lib....
