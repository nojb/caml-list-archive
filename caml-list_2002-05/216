Would you elaborate more on said problems ?
It is a bit different though, altough i see why you say it is similar.

Ok, if we go that way, it is okay by me, just a decision should be
taken, after a reasoned discussion, and after that we should stick to
it.

That said, i _don't like_ the symlink idea, symlink are a nice thing,
but mainly in this kind of cases are used when you don't have an
integrated distribution, and no packaging system, and many people also
claim that symlink can cause lot of problems. It is more a workaround
for case where you cannot do things properly.

Then if we go that way (all stub libraries in one or two dirs), what
will happen, as far as debian and maybe other integrated distribution
are concerned, is that we will put the stub libraries in the directory
(/usr/lib/ocaml/shlibs or something such), and the rest of the stuff in
the subdirectory. There will be no symlink, and this needs a redesign of
the build process of all those libraries, an adaptation to things like
findlib and ocamlmakefile, and is quite big work, so best to do it for
after there is a final decision on the subject.
