Hello Gurus ;-)

wouldn't it be a good idea to announce new Ocaml-releases
via freshmeat?

A lot of people then suddenly had informations on this
interesting programming language they never heard of
before.

I grepped the freshmeat-mails on Ocaml but did not found
any entry. So I think that it never was announced there.

Ciao,
   Oliver
