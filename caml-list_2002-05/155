Hello,

people have always kept telling me that I have perverse needs, but that's
the way it is: I (ab)use OCaml for interpreting models learnt by a machine
learning system. The problem is that such models may require hundreds
of thousand lines of OCaml-code including absolutely mad amounts of
pattern-matches on and constructions of values of sum- and product type.

Needless to say that I get into trouble when I actually want to interpret
or compile these models to evaluate them on new data. Type checking just
takes an awful amount of time, in fact much longer than the learning
algorithm needs for model generation...

It would be really nice if there were some command-line flag for the
OCaml-compilers which turns off every check that is not required under the
assumption that the given OCaml-code is (type) correct as is guaranteed in
my case. Would this be easily possible? What else could I do to reduce the
amount of work the OCaml-compiler has to do? Insert Obj.magic everywhere?

Best regards,
Markus
