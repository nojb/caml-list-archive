I suppose it will never be possible, because the drawing functions simply
call the drawing primitives of the windowing system. 

One way out would be a virtual X11 server that is not connected to any
hardware device but has a "screen" that only exists in memory (e.g.
http://www.xfree.org/4.2.0/Xvfb.1.html). A quick test shows that it really
works:

$ Xvfb :1 -screen 0 32x32x8 -nolisten tcp -ac &
$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.04

# #load "graphics.cma";;
# open Graphics;;
# open_graph ":1 50x50";;
- : unit = ()
# fill_circle 25 25 25;;
- : unit = ()
# let img = get_image 0 0 50 50;;
val img : Graphics.image = <abstr>
# dump_image img;;
- : Graphics.color array array =
[|[|16777215; 16777215; ... |]|]

Note that the window is even bigger (50x50 pixels) than the server screen
(32x32 pixels).

The memory requirements of the virtual server seem to be moderate, but I don't
know what happens in the long turn.

Maybe this is an option for you.
