I was always wondering about the need for removing any directory from
ld.conf: it the directory is not there, there will be no problem
anyway...

It's not because Unix does something wrong that you have to follow it.
In the past I was installing libraries somewhere else (using --prefix
in most packages) and using -rpath. The trouble is that -rpath is
broken on some Unices, so I've reverted to making symbolic links to
/usr/local/lib for the soname. Otherwise it's a pain to manage.

Now I don't think that the current scheme in caml is perfect, but to
me it works ok. When I delete a library I just delete its directory,
and I'm sure it's clean.

I'm the culprit. And well, I have no definite opinion about libraries in
the standard distribution, just that they set an example.
Note that moving dlls around _is_ dangerous, because you may
end-up with dlls with the same name in different place when
overwriting an existing installation.

By the way, if you're so fond of the C way, using versioning on dlls
would be very useful about this kind of problems (with the version in
the .cma, rather than using symbolic links!)

Cheers,
