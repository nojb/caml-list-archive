Sure, but it is also possible you found a problem and we all could benefit
from its removal.

That's right.

I played a bit with your example, and while I haven't isolated the
problem, I found that there is no problem with the reported expression.
The problem only happened when the f_ngt5 (or whatever you called it)
was included and disappeared when it was removed. So it seems like a
genuine bug.
