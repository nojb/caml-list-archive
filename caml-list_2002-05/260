Although OCaml is probably my favourite language, I get to program in
Java a fair bit (and Scheme a little, but there the syntax is nice and
regular!).

The only syntax error I commonly make in OCaml is that I usually
forget to put parens around the exception and its arguments to a raise
function.  And the problem is exactly that... the raise FUNCTION.
try...with is syntactic, so why shouldn't raise be a statement instead
of a function?  And it wouldn't break many programs (except for a few
unit tests written with FORT).

Then I'd never make any errors in OCaml.  :-)

(In truth, these errors are maybe 10-15% of the type errors I get from
OCaml compilations.  And 90% of the `syntax' errors.)

And if we were looking for things to include in the standard OCaml
distribution, I would nominate FORT.  Unit testing is very important,
and perhaps we could create a culture that regularly shipped unit-test
with their code (as Java is making progress toward).
