I've updated the software slightly and included the results and a
short explanation (in postscript and PDF) on that page of some
benchmarking I did that shows that the Cpsio functions are faster than
the equivalent OCaml printf functions in byte-code, and often faster
in native-code, despite doing more garbage collecting.  Results are
also compared to the equivalent C printf functions.

The web page again is:
