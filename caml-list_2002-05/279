Thanks for mentioning them. All the documentation I have on 
Ocaml now is the "official" html manual, but the syntax part 
is not human-readable. I was never actually taught Ocaml, 
but rather I learned it (if I ever did) by writing code and 
trying to get it to compile. I never had problems figuring 
out the meaning and usage of type lists in constructors, 
with the sole exception of exceptions. Somehow, they have 
always escaped my inductive learning ability. I'll try 
reading the guidelines.

I have absolutely no authority to criticize the syntax; I 
just claim that some aspects of it are not user-friendly. 
Math transcends user-friendliness. It simply is not meant to 
be used in any definite way. It just sits there, exists. (I 
once heard an algebraist wonder if category theory had any 
*real* use.) Software systems, on the other hand, must be 
used by humans in order to be worth creating, and, for this 
reason, they ought to be as intuitive as possible. I still 
have not had time to mess with CamlP4 and cannot say much 
about it, but if its syntax is more intuitive than the 
native one, then welcome CamlP4.
