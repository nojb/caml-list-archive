Hi, all, 

When should I use 'Obj.magic'? It is really confusing. Now I am converting
a bunch of code from sml to ocaml. During the process, I want to make
sure that the type of every function keep consistent with the original
one. But I still encountered a lot of problems about the types in ocaml. 
For examples, all my base functions are fine in ocaml. But, sometimes when
I tried to combine a few base functions together in the same way as my
original code, I got a type error. After endless trial, I have to use
'Obj.magic'. In some sense, it is good because I can compile my code
now. On the other hand, things will be worse because it is very difficult
to debug if I use a few 'Obj.magic' in my code. I couldn't find out the
origins of all the runtime errors. 

So, we should be very careful to use 'Obj.magic'. Can somebody tell me
the appropriate situation to use this function?

Thanks a lot!

Dengping
