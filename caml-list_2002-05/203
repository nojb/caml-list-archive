  Hi,

    In order to avoid spending some time on writing C stubs
    myself, I'd like them to be generated automaticaly.
    There are currently 3 stub generators: camouflage, ffi
    and another one I don't recall (IIRC, someone claimed
    that he was working on a SWIG interface).

    I'm a bit confused since I don't really know what generator
    to choose among all those. Moreover, they all seem to have
    been last update in august 2001 and the C interface may
    have changed since.

    Has anyone experiences and advices about this?

    Thanks in advance.=20

    Regards,
