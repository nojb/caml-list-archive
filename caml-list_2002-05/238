Sigh. I also don't want to mess with social issues at INRIA, but find
it strange indeed that this is the official line. The only reason
so far why I didn't use camlp4 too often in the past was _because_ it
obviously didn't get enough official support. Its addition to the standard
distribution seemed like a good idea to me. I consider it a very useful
tool for a language that is still a somewhat moving target and which may
require syntax changes in the future. Those could be done with much less
hassle given a powerful tool. Not to mention extensions needed by users.

The syntax question has already been raised here several times so I
don't want to do it again. Suffice it to say that OCaml _has_ syntactic
problems about which beginners stumble frequently as I still remember
from my beginner time and as I can observe with people whom I have just
recently converted. One can get accustomed to and work around those
issues, but this doesn't really make them go away.

Markus Mottl
