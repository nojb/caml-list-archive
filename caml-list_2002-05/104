BTW, about advi, i have gotten a bug report claiming that kpathsea
handles the virtual font stuff, but i am not able to confirm it. I asked
the reporter to check on this and inform me back if this is the case.

If this is the case, s font handling would be quite easy if i understood
correctly, only the calls to gsftopk would be needed. 

If you are interrested, i got quite a number of bugreports from
different people for advi, some of them easy to solve (mostly packaging
dependencies issues), but i say this here to show that there seemed to
be quite some interrest in advi, since lot of people checked on it.

Friendly,

Sven LUther
