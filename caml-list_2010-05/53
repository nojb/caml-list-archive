Hello,

are there mbox-Libraries around?

If not: a while ago I wrote something that
was meant as a library for reading mbox-files.
But I have not worked on that code for a long time.

I did just some matching with ocamllex to split the mails,
and then worked on strings.
The stuff needs to be rewritten, because I used Str-Lib,
and would prefer Pcre, but maybe that also is not a good idea....

So... do I need UTF-8 parsing? Is there something in ocamlnet,
what I should use?

Are there encodings which I might also have to handle?
And if so: which? And what library to use for it?
I think even Pcre might not match my needs here?


Ciao,
   Oliver

P.S.: And: what kind of License would make sense? LGPL3?
