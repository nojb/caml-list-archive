> I'm pleased to announce Camomile 0.7.3, a new version of Camomile, a =
comprehensive Unicode library for OCaml.

now works on Windows.
>     - Aliases of character encodings containing ":" are removed,
>     to support Windows platform.
>     - Buffering bugs in CharEncoding and OOChannel modules.
>     - Tree-merging bugs of ISet and IMap.
>     - Locale data are properly loaded by binary channels. (Windows =
related)
>     - "make depend" properly generates .depend file.
>     - cpp is no longer required to build from the distribution.
>     The license documentation for locales/*.txt files is added. =
(locales/license.html)

>   The package is tested on Windows (MinGW-port of OCaml 3.11.0  + =
Cygwin on Vista SP1) and Linux (Ubuntu 8.04 + godi version of OCaml =
3.11.2).

I'd like to know whether you can successfully operate Camomile in your =
platform.  I have complaints on Mac and MinGW environments, and although =
I believe that the problems are fixed, I'm too lazy to find spare Mac =
around and test the package :-)  Also, I would like to hear about a =
success ( /failure ) story of Camomile.  Do you use Camomile?  What for? =
 This is important since I have to convince my boss to allow me to =
invest some spare time to Camomile project.

Camomile is used in Barista [1] to encode / decode / modify UTF8 strings =
of Java classes.

My opinion of Camomile is absolutely positive:
 - installation is a breeze;
 - API is complete yet straightforward;
 - it meets a need of the OCaml ecosystem.

Not yet updated to 0.7.3 but 0.7.2 used to work like a charm on both =
MacOS X and Fedora.
