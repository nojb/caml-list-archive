The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial 
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of 
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning, 
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to 
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to 
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 17th LPAR
will be held in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

Conference Chair: Steffen Hoelldobler
Programme Chairs: Chris Fermueller, Andrei Voronkov

Submissions of two kinds are welcome:
* Regular papers that describe solid new research results. 
* Experimental and tool papers that describe implementations of systems, 
  report experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems.

See the web site http://www.computational-logic.org/lpar-17/Home.html for all
the details.
