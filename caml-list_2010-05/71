Yes.

Yes. They are wrong.

I'm afraid the situation is far worse. Even if you relax your conditions
from "ML-like" to any functional language and even allow broken TCO, there
are not only no language implementations satisfying those weaker conditions
but nobody is even trying to create such a language implementation.

HLVM is not yet ready for serious use and it may well never compile OCaml
but at least it is now compiling code like this:

I think LLVM is a much better choice than libjit. Once you've got that kind
of solid foundation to build upon and a decent language like OCaml to write
in, you can write a decent FPL implementation in a few man-months. The
problem is finding the time...

Cheers,
Jon.
