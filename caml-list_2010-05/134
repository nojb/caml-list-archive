Dear Inria,

I have visited your site and I think that the free 3d objects content 
could be of interest to our web site visitors.

I have already placed a link to your site along with a description at 
"http://www.pelican3d.com/website/links3.html". If you want the 
description of your site modified or if you have any other 
cross-promotion ideas, let me know.

I would appreciate if you placed a link back to my site:
