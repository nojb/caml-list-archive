I have long used the emacs tuareg mode (simply because when I asked
advice someone told me that it was better than the standard caml
mode), and have recently wondered if that choice was motivated by
rational reasons. When I looked at it, I discovered that the original
caml mode has overall the same set of features (with some of them
coming earlier due to it being maintained by the OCaml team), was
reasonably well documented and was split in multiple source files
instead of one monolithic .el for tuareg-mode. I switched to the
standard caml-mode. The indentation, coloring and shorctuts are a bit
different, but otherwise I don't see what motivated the better tuareg
reputation.

Are you planning to add new features that would make tuareg decisively
better ? Have I missed some existing killer feature ? Why did you
choose to maintain the tuareg mode instead of collaborating with the
caml-mode upstream ?
