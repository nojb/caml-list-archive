First off, public insult seems quite superfluous.
We should be able to handle a heated debate without resorting to that.

And I still wait for a clear statement of your level for "high performance",
and references to benchmarks that back up your claims in this thread.
As you seem to come from an academic background, I expect facts
and references, and not ad hominem attacks and fuzzy unbacked claims.
Unless you show that neither Bigloo nor Scala meet your (to be defined)
criteria for "high performance", my counterexamples still stand.

It may just end up that we have different perceptions of "high performance",
and of the trade-offs we are going to make in our language / platform choice=
s.
