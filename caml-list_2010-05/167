I was not trying to insult you. Your examples are silly because they are
incomplete and untested. Do you even have either of them working right =
now?
AFAICT, Scala.NET is known not to work and Bigloo.NET is still have =
dozens
of core bugs fixed.

I don't think this is heated at all. We were talking about "high
performance" languages and you cited a bunch of languages that get =
whipped
by Python on this benchmark:

Within 2x of ANSI C compiled with gcc on all practically-relevant =
benchmarks
without dropping to low-level code, e.g. GHC's FFI in Haskell.

An ad-hominem attack is an attack against a person. I attacked your
examples, not you.

Are you talking about Bigloo.NET and Scala.NET or have you gone back to =
the
original discussion about JVM-based languages?

Scala on the JVM is 7x slower than C++ on this benchmark:

=20
http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=3Dall&lang=3Dsc=
ala&lan
g2=3Dgpp

The JVM's hash table is 17x slower than .NET's on this benchmark:

  http://fsharpnews.blogspot.com/2010/05/java-vs-f.html

I think that is not "high performance" by any reasonable definition and =
this
reflects fundamental deficiencies in the VM itself, so there is no hope =
of
working around it in general.

I have not been able to get Bigloo to run: it was deleted from Debian =
and
Ubuntu (and the shootout) and the source distribution barfs during
configuration with " ./install-gc-7.1: 39: patch: not found".

Probably. What languages do not you not consider to be high performance?

Cheers,
Jon.
