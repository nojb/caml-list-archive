Thanks again.

In the meantime, I gone on another way: I really needed to have a 
working development environment on this notebook before leaving!

I just used brute force : copy of c:\cygwin from the working computer to 
the "new" one. My compiled version of ocaml came with this brute force copy.

This allowed me to try again my compilation script:
- ActiveTcl installation was not modified
- and this time, it passed ocamlbrowser compilation.

Now, can anybody confirm the behaviour I observed with a fresh cygwin 
install?

I will (later) investigate the problem (taking your suggestion into 
account) on the virtual machine on which I reproduced the problem.

Salutations

I had some weird issues when upgrading to Cygwin because if the location of Cygwin1.dll is wrong then cygpath returns garbage paths - which confuses the hell out of flexlink! However, I don't think this is what's affecting you because errors owing to that surfaced while linking ocamlc for me.
