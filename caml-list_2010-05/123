They haven't been written yet. :-)

LLVM provides the compilation to native code, both static and JIT.

LLVM's intermediate representation is a low-level assembly language with no
memory safety and no automatic memory management. HLVM is a layer on top of
LLVM that provides a higher-level intermediate language that is memory safe
and garbage collected.

HLVM's IR is evolving much too quickly to be worth specifying yet.

Today, HLVM is an OCaml library. In the future, HLVM will be a free standing
VM.

Ultimately, HLVM should be just as easy to understand. The only reason it
appears complicated today is that HLVM is a set of evolving fragments that
are gradually stabilizing and being pulled together to form a progressively
more capable core VM.

> What if hlvm would really take off, could they set it free and move the

HLVM is free. I would always keep the core (VM and standard library) open
source. I might write an "HLVM for Scientists" book, sell libraries or
implement features for a fee but nothing evil. :-)

In fact, one dream I have is to create a commerce-friendly platform for
tools and libraries. I think Linux has really suffered from being
anti-commerce rather than truly free.

Cheers,
Jon.
