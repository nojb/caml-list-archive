I wrote ocamldefun during my master project where I done both the theory an=
d
the implementation of this tool: I was a beginner both in ocaml and in
functional programming since I only wrote a mini-compiler in ocaml during m=
y
studies without any lecture on functional programming. But ok: there were
ocaml experts in my research team which provide me some wonderful helps :-)=

Ocaml is not Coq: there is no such "contrib/" directory ;-). As far as I
know, the Ocaml development team does not accept so much external
contributions (for many good reasons).

That is what ocamldefun actually does.
