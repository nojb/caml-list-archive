Has anyone gotten an OCaml multithreaded program to build for Win32 native =
threads using the
MinGW ocaml cross-compiler?

At least with the Fedora distribution of that compiler, there's a libthread=
snat.a, but it's
missing some symbols.  The source for that library assumes the availability=
 of pthreads
and Unix-style signals on the target.  There is a pthreads library for Ming=
GW, but there
isn't a complete emulation of signals on Windows.  So I think another appro=
ach is needed.

Maybe the cross-compiler can instead generate calls to the procedures in th=
e native threads
library that's distributed with the Windows version of OCaml.  That library=
 would have
to be converted, somehow, from the .lib format to the .a format.
