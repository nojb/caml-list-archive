keith, a few thoughts, ... before I've worked with linux I was a
windows guy. I remember the day (forgot the context though) when I
installed the ocaml package on my dell/windows-xp/laptop (yuk) . Since
the workflow on windows is very gui centric, you can't help to get
very sensible how a particular app looks and feels. I can tell you
those "weird" guis (tcl/tk?) scared the hell out of me and I hoped I
could get rid of the stuff without breaking the registry :-).

Anyway, I think in order to provide something that the next windows
user would like to work with, all the ocaml gui apps should be feel
very much more native.

Maybe the time would be better invested by an effort to port
Ocaml-Batteries to F#. I mean why not?
