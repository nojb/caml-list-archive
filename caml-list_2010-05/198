Oh no, not at all, I really love make and the central role it plays in 
my use of a UNIX workstation. Since I have to work on Mac OS-X, Linux 
and Solaris, while I have FreeBSD at home, I had to pay special 
attention to the portability of the macros and reimplemented many 
mechanisms presented in the `standard' BSD Makefiles.  I use them all 
the time, and they usually work like a charm!

The most polished sets are for the production of TeX/LaTeX documents 
(with METAPOST and BIBTeX support) and the production of a web page 
(with sgmlnorm and tidy). The OCaml macros work but some parts really 
need to be rewritten.

You are quite right that bmake and gmake are not that different. When I 
switched from GNU Make to BMake, I found it easy and straightforward to 
program and appreciate the lot of meaningful examples I could study to 
learn the proper use of the program. It does not need to mean that such 
examples do not exist for gmake, just that I did not found them in times 
of need.

Best Regards,
Michael
