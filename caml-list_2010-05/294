Hello,

This is a follow-up on PR#5049 [1], but the bug has been closed and it
seems no longer possible to comment on it now (and reopening doesn't
seem relevant).

Is there a practical test to be sure whether natdynlink works or not?
What kind of "feedback" do you expect?

That seems overly restrictive. As far as Debian is concerned, Coq
dynamically loading ssreflect and compiling stuff works on all native
architectures [2] (as of OCaml 3.11.2), that means:

 - powerpc (powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu)
 - sparc (sparc-unknown-linux-gnu)
 - kfreebsd-i386 (i686-unknown-kfreebsd*-gnu)
 - kfreebsd-amd64 (x86_64-unknown-kfreebsd*-gnu)
 - hurd-i386 (i386-unknown-gnu0.3)
 - amd64, i386 (linux kernel)

If I understand correctly Xavier's explanation in [1], it should work on
any x86-GNU-based system where shared libraries are supported (and not
only Linux!). Natdynlink working on sparc and powerpc seems to be a
surprise, but not the other ones AFAIU. Maybe people on this list can
also report working natdynlink on other systems.

Maybe adding a ./configure option would be more flexible?
