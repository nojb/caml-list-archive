Ok, the topic here is personal and office computing. I mean cubical
drones who are not allowed to used right mouse button? Consultants and
their 20 MB powerpoints? Middle management assholes with the portable
devices, always busy with syncing stuff from some weird Exchange
source to another place. Grandpa who is trying to install his new
scanner which also a tv receiver, because the isp told him he also
watch tv over internet?

It's one ugly amorphous quickly fluctuating mess that happens if you
endow the average end user with a PC and throw them into a hit-and-run
market environment.

So far linux was spared by the end user and 'personal computing'.
Would linux be really capable to enhance the personal computing
experience not only for the enduser but also for the developer? I see
two stumbling blocks:

- X/X11/X org:  I support a few members in my family and friends with
linux installations and problems. X is a source for a lot of grieve.
The complexity of X punches the end user to often. I dont see
alternatives though.

- Applications: I mean the way enduser application are developed
deployed and installed. The best way would be mono, unfortunately a
forbidden fruit because microsoft was too stupid to really set it
free.
