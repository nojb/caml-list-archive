This has been fixed in caml-mode long ago too.
I think the main difference is that ocaml-mode is based on very old
code, developped originally for caml-light, and was it emacs 18 at
that time. It contained various hacks to make it faster, with some bad
side effects at times. Overall the bugs have been corrected, but this
is probably the case that at one point tuareg mode was more stable.

I'm not going to suggest that tuareg mode switch to the ocaml-mode
code base, because I think that actually the tuareg code is cleaner.
However, for various historical reasons the two code bases are
developped in parallel, with some reasonable amount of sharing, so
I see no real problem with the current situation.
