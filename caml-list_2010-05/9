The current release of CamlPDF does this, and it's about 15000 lines of 
Ocaml / F#.

http://www.coherentpdf.com/ocaml-libraries.html

You just have the occasional thing like this:

let digest =
   (*IF-OCAML*)
   Digest.string
   (*ENDIF-OCAML*)
   (*i*)(*F#
   function s ->
     let hasher = System.Security.Cryptography.MD5.Create () in
       string_of_int_array (intarray_of_bytearray (hasher.ComputeHash 
(bytearray_of_string s)))
   F#*)(*i*)

to account for the difference in standard libraries. And a little bit of 
messing around with the different syntax, for example writing

(!x).y

instead of !x.y

And you can't use labeled arguments or polymorphic variants.

But it's perfectly feasible. I converted said 15000 lines of code in a 
few days.

Cheers,
