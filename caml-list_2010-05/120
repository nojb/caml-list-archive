sylvain, between the lines I think you're say I'm overreacting. I
would put it the other way around and say it's sad when people aren't
aware of such "details".

Once I've tried my luck with the D language, just to give another
tragic example. I think if its inventor walter bright settled all
those subtle licensing issues earlier, the language had a much bigger
following today. Now it's too late.

In case of mono I think they should have rigorously abandon *all* the
non-ecma parts (ado.net, windows.forms, asp.net,...) from the start.
And the special agreement "non-lawsuit" whatever agreement between
novell and microsoft was the nail in the coffin for mono as the
standard vm on linux. The ship has sailed.

It's really sad if see when great achievements can't unfold its
potential because of such minor issues. Programming environments on
linux are particulary delicate in this regard especially because there
are so many community-focused languages today such as Python. I don't
think something closed like the JVM had the slightest chance today to
take off. The alternatives aren't bad enough anymore.

Maybe I care for hlvm too much :-)
