I would say it hasn't been a big problem on Windows because people
are still using windows. Furthermore, how many of the programs that
Microsoft distrubutes with Windows 7 are written in C#/.NET and 
how many are written in C++? 

Furthermore, many of the problems suffered by Windows are not a
problem on Unix systems.

They were always a mistake. COM never made it to Unix.

This is a Microsoft specific problem. Unix systems have used versioned
shared libraries since at least the mid 1980s.

The STL should only be problem and compile time.

Another mistake. Never common on Unix.

I've only ever come across one problem as a result of this, a problem
with passing file descriptor across the application/DLL boundary when
the application and the DLL were compiled with different versions of
the compiler. Again, this is a problem with Microsoft's OS that I have
never come across on any of the Unix systems I have used.

You have to be kidding me. I personally think the Microsoft development
tools are completely horrible.

How does that have anything to do with using a VM or not.

Microsoft was your saviour because Microsoft caused all your problems
in the first place.

Microsoft keeps calling Unix a legacy platform, but Unix has evolved 
over time and to people running modern versions of Unix, its Windows
that looks like a legacy platform.
