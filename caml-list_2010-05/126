hi erik,
I highly appreciate your blog, so it hurts me a little but - I disagree:

English is not my first language, maybe I misunderstand, but what
you're are saying here sound like a complete contradiction to me:
Like you say C and C++ are considered as 'unsafe' languages. But thats
because they offer features, that are not available when programming
for a vm. This has nothing to do with languages, it's a conscious
platform decision.

I'd call that a questionable decision. As far as I know, using native
binaries means to open a whole range of potentially uncorrectionable
problems with abi incomptabilities between libraries or with changes
of the underlying os.

As far as I know when you go native you always have to take abi
incompatibility and therefore recompilation into account. For business
apps, that's a showstopper.

Would you mind to share some infos about your experiences, maybe on your blog?
