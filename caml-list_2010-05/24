                    Deadline: 1st June

              Some Student Grants Available!

CONTENT MATH TRAINING CAMP (6th-9th July):

This is a training school comprising tutorial sessions and practical labs with
an integrated Doctoral Programme (see below).  Its aim is to disseminate the
latest developments and emerging trends in intelligent computational
mathematics as well as to familiarise, in particular young researchers, with
the leading state of the art technologies for authoring, presenting,
conserving and accessing mathematical knowledge and their applications.

Preliminary list of topics: http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/cmtc

Please let us know what you are particularly interested in by June 1 (mail to
Christoph Lange <ch.lange@jacobs-university.de>).

Deadline for your own presentation proposals: 1st June
Acceptance notification:                      8th June

DOCTORAL PROGRAMME (7th-9th July):

PhD students at any level, working on a research topic related to the CICM'10
conferences may apply for participation in the Doctoral Programme. Application
documents shall be sent to Volker Sorge <v.sorge@cs.bham.ac.uk> and they
should consist of:

   * A brief (max. 1 page) summary of the PhD topic
   * A short letter of recommendation from the supervisor
   * A statement whether the student applies for a grant or not
     (Some financial support for travel and attendance is available)

Application deadline:    1st June
Acceptance notification: 8th June

The Doctoral Programme will enable graduate students to discuss and present
their research and ideas, and gain feedback from respected researchers within
the areas of Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.  It is
integrated with the Content Math Training Camp (see above).  The Doctoral
Programme will also promote contacts between participating students and
provide information on careers opportunities in academia, research and
industry. Moreover, tutorials from experienced researchers are planned as well
as a social programme including some sports event.
