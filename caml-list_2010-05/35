I think it's not really that bad. Ocaml developers support Windows as
a first class platform. Many Ocaml libraries can be build under
Windows without a problem. And now GODI supports Windows too.

Ironically it's also not entirely true. F# works well under Mono/Unix.
Maybe it will even be faster than Ocaml for some applications due to
threads running in parallel on multiple cores. But F# is very
different from Ocaml.
