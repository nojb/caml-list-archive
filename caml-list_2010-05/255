I would be most interested to hear answers to this e-mail.

I too have wondered about the differences between tuareg mode and caml =
mode.

I noticed that key bindings are different and formatting is handled a =
little differently. I have never seen a good comparison between the two =
though. Or why tuareg-mode exists at all (instead of improving caml =
mode).

Another thing is that in the tuareg mode documentation, there is no =
mention that you need to install files from caml mode. It seems like C-c =
C-t (type throwback) only works after installing caml-types.el from caml =
mode. What other files from caml mode need to be installed?

I'm glad to see ocamlspot.el is included now.

Thanks

Tom
