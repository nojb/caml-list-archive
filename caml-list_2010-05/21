hi
I'm waiting for the day that microsoft release f# under a "official"
open source license. It has been promised several times, but its still
only available under the "Microsoft Research Shared Source license
agreement" and
meanwhile I'm not sure if it ever really happens.

So I've stumbled over OcamlL (*) who claims to target the clr vm. The
project seems a littled stalled and the build environment is
configured for cygwin. Besides the website there is very little info
to find on the internet.

Before I waste too much time on this, does somebody has experience
with OcamIL? Is it something that could be refined or are there some
fundamental problems? Do you think it is interesting, or completely
obsolete now with f#?

thanks in advance
ben
