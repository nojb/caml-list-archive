I have just compared libcamomile-ocaml-data and locales-all packages.
The two packages contain almost the same thing:
http://packages.debian.org/sid/libcamomile-ocaml-data
http://packages.debian.org/sid/locales-all

The size is almost the same (3MB vs 5MB) but the uncompressed size is
not at all the same:
- camomile: 24MB
- locales-all (2 steps uncompression): 99MB

At least it means that camomile data is a reasonable size for this kind
of data on Linux system. On Windows system, I think these figures are
almost the same but data are part of the base windows installation.

Now, a question/suggestion/feature: is it possible to store .mar file
as .mar.gz? This would help to reduce occupation by a factor of 5...
