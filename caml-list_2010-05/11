The variants are represented using a block. If you introduce a single
variant, it will create a block that points to kinematic. E.g. "Force of
kinematic" will create a pointer to the kinematic structure. 

Your construction of force and momentum will add a level of indirection
for every use of the kinematic structure.

Phantom type doesn't add a level of indirection and left no trace in the
generated assembler. 

This is not about optimized compiler in this case but about data
representation. Even if you use an optimized compiler (which is not
really the case with ocamlopt), you won't change datastructure
representation to optimize.
