For a research project I'm working on, I'm looking for examples of C code that 
uses the OCaml native interface. I'm particularly interested in code that 
performs some not-completely-trivial interpretation of constructed values by 
inspecting blocks and their tags. 

Have you written any code like this? Have you run across any in some open source 
project? Any pointers to such code would be much appreciated. Open source code 
would be best, but if you are willing to share proprietary code samples with me, 
I will give you any reasonable assurances you may require.

You can contact me off-list at: cconway@cs.nyu.edu

Regards,
Chris
