I have worked in many environments, most have been homogeneous, none have had more then four platforms. Supporting four platforms is not difficult if your tools support all four platforms (unfortunately Ocaml's support for Windows is a bit spotty). Running a VM, no matter how good, is always going to carry a performance hit. If your code is UI intensive, that may be acceptable (although I find the startup time for the JVM to be a problem), but if your code is memory or CPU intensive a VM may be unaceptable.
