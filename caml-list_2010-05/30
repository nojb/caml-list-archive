I guess you shouldn't take some stup** trollism as representing the =20

I am not a Windows user but this kind of "Windows sucks" remark pisses =20=

me off.

Still, it's a fact that it's hard to use ocaml on Windows but there =20
are frequently some posts on this list showing that many ocamlers do =20
care about Windows.
The Ocaml Team explicitly requests some help of windows users to test =20=

the releases because they know it's a downside of ocaml.
I think this shows that they really seem to care about it and try to =20
improve.
