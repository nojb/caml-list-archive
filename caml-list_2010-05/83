I have an OCaml 3.11 program that prints out the arguments on the command l=
ine:

  let main =3DArray.iter (Printf.printf "arg =3D %s\n") Sys.argv

On Linux, if I provide a command line argument containing 8-bit characters,
like =E9 (an e with an acute accent), the program above, compiled with ocam=
lopt
or ocamlc, prints them faithfully.

For Windows, I can compile the program above with ocamlc on Windows, or cro=
ss-compile
it with MinGW-ocaml on Linux.  In both cases, any 8-bit characters in the c=
ommand
line are printed as garbage.  I've tried running the program from rxvt (a s=
hell for
Cygwin) and Windows cmd.exe.

Why does the behavior differ?

Although it's not a particular concern to me, the OCaml interpreter handles=
 8-bit characters
on Linux and Windows differently.  From the earlier part of my message, you=
'd think that
Linux ocaml handles such characters well, and Windows ocaml, not well -- bu=
t just the
opposite holds!  In Windows, if I enter a string containing an 8-bit charac=
ter, the interpreter spits
it back faithfully:

  # "=E9";;
  - : string =3D "=E9"

But in Linux:

  # "=E9";;
  - : string =3D "\195\169"

Why this inconsistency?
