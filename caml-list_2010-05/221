========================================================================
WS-FM 2010
7th International Workshop on Web Services and Formal Methods:
Formal aspects of service oriented and cloud computing

September 16-17, 2010
New Jersey, USA

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Final CALL FOR PAPERS*
Abstract Submission: May 28, 2010
Paper Submission: June 4, 2010
========================================================================


WS-FM 2010 will be held at the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken,
New Jersey, USA, on September 16-17, 2010 (Hoboken is located across the
Hudson river from Manhattan and easily accessible by subway, ferry, or
bus from New York) and will be co-located with:
8th Int. Conference on Business Process Management (BPM 2010)
http://www.bpm2010.org/

Service Oriented Computing (SOC) provides standard mechanisms and
protocols for describing, locating and invoking services over the
Internet. Although there are existing SOC infrastructures that support
specification of service interfaces, access policies, behaviors and
compositions, there are still many active research areas in SOC such as
the support and management of interactions with stateful and
long-running services, large farms of services and quality of service
delivery. Moreover, emerging paradigm of cloud computing provides a new
platform for service delivery, enabling the development of services that
are configurable based on client requirements, service level guarantee
mechanisms, and extended services based on virtualization (Software as a
Service, Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service). The
convergence of SOC and cloud computing is accelerating the adoption of
both of these technologies, making the service dependability and
trustworthiness a crucial and urgent problem.

Formal methods can play a fundamental role in this research area. They
can help us define unambiguous semantics for the languages and protocols
that underpin existing web service infrastructures, and provide a basis
for checking the conformance and compliance of bundled services. They
can also empower dynamic discovery and binding with compatibility checks
against behavioral properties and quality of service requirements.
Formal analysis of security properties and performance is also essential
in cloud computing and in application areas including e-science,
e-commerce, workflow, business process management, etc. Moreover, the
challenges raised by this new area can offer opportunities for extending
the state of the art in formal techniques.

The aim of the WS-FM workshop series is to bring together researchers
working on SOC, cloud computing and formal methods in order to catalyze
fruitful collaboration. The scope of the workshop is not only limited to
technological aspects. In fact, the WS-FM series has a strong tradition
of attracting submissions on formal approaches to enterprise systems
modeling in general, and business process modeling in particular.
Potentially, this could have a significant impact on the on-going
standardization efforts for SOC and cloud computing technologies.
