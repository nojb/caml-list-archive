Yes. One can't really program in those languages without using
pointers and manually allocating/deallocating memory.

Yes, many languages (native compiled Ocaml and Haskell are just
two) have garbage collection and are fundamentally safe.

I call requiring a VM one more potential point of failure.

My experience says otherwise. My experience consists of having lots of
small self contained programs, written in Ocaml and distributed using
the Debian packaging system.

Binary incompatibilities always get found during development and
developer testing and QA.

I find Ocaml native binaries far more reliable that those of C and
C++ and that reliability is due to garbage collection, and the fact
that Ocaml's type system helps prevent bugs.

You have no idea just how much you are overstating the case.

There's really not much to share. Its programs written in Ocaml and
distributed to the client machines via the Debian packaging system.
