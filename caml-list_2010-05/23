I cannot answer you question about OCamIL, but if you are interested in 
combining OCaml and .Net programming, you might be interested in our 
CSML tool which allows you to define bindings between the two worlds in 
a high-level way. We use it to develop large OCaml applications with a 
Winforms GUI and other .Net components.
