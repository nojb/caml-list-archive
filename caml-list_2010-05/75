I use camomile as the default implementation for ocaml-gettext:
http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocaml-gettext

Basically I do encoding conversion with it. Projects of mine built with
ocaml-gettext use camomile as well.

Sylvain 

ps: as asked on the BTS, a way to be able to relocate the .mar file
would be something great -- this actually prevents me to distribute my
projects built with camomile. (relocate -> remove the hardcoded path)
