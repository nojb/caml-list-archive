Putting aside an answer I posted this morning on a parallel thread,
I will just present some counter examples to this claim.

Limiting myself to the JVM, and not even trying to be exhaustive, I =20
can find...

... in the LISP family :
   - Clojure - http://clojure.org/ - Eclipse Public License

... in the Scheme family :
   - Bigloo - http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/fp/Bigloo/ - GPL / LGPL
   - Kawa - http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/ - X11 / MIT license
   - SISC - http://sisc-scheme.org/ - GPL

... in the ML family:
   - Yeti - http://mth.github.com/yeti/

... in the Haskell family:
   - CAL - http://openquark.org/Open_Quark/Welcome.html - BSD-like license

... in its own family:
   - Scala - http://www.scala-lang.org


Moreover, at least Scala and Bigloo deliver excellent performances.
