Well, the Objective Caml sources come from a Unix background, where
wildcards (*.ml) are expanded by the command shell and the commands
receive an already-expanded argument list. One day I may add
command-line expansion in the Objective Caml start-up code, but don't
hold your breath.

I thought Win32 finally raised the length limit on the command line to
some reasonable value like 4k. At any rate, you can always split the
call to ocamldep thus:

        ocamldep [some files] > .depend
        ocamldep [more files] >> .depend
        ...

Also, a "for" loop may work, for instance

        for %i in (*.ml) do ocamldep %i >> .depend

(that's probably the wrong syntax, but you get the idea).
