I strongly recommend to the original poster to get djgpp, or at least
the 32 bit perl binary made with djgpp.  The syntax Xavier suggests for
a loop won't work with COMMAND.COM, and you'll have a VERY VERY hard
time finding one that does.  COMMAND.COM is a shell from hell (rhyme
unintentional) or rather from the early 60's...
