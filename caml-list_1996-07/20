Subject: constructors for objects in ocaml
Sender: weis
Status: O


Hi everybody,

it is possible to define something like a constructor in ocaml,
ie to add an expression to a class which is evaluated every time
an object is created?

I tried something like

class top arg as self =
  method create x = let _ = print_x
                    in x
  val x = self#create arg
end;;

but got an error saying, that self is unbound.

Bye,

Hendrik Tews
