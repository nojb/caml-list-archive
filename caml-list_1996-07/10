Hi!

EP>And by the way, I suppose someone already made the following suggestion 
EP>but it would be very useful to have a "compile" option and a "make" 
EP>option on the menus of ocamlwin.

Actually my DOS-port does have a #compile command for the OCAML interactive
environment. It's easy since you need much of the modules aready to build
OCAML. I didn't include a make facility, because then I would have to
integrate the functionality of ocamldep. Hmm. I should think of that, it
would help much ;-)

bye, Georg
