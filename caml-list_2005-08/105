It is not possible to compile such "open"s into the toplevels. This has
to to with the initialisation order.

Nevertheless, a partial solution is implemented in findlib:

ocamlfind ocamlmktop -o top -custom -package findlib,... -linkpkg

Note that I mention "findlib" explicitly. Now you can at least #require
the packages in scripts which generates the necessary #directory
directives, so your script becomes independent of where the packages are
actually installed. (#require does not load code that is already part of
the toplevel.)

My advice is to have a project-wide initialisation file one can #use
from the scripts, e.g.

#!./top
#use "./init.ml"

And in init.ml there are all the #require and open directives.

For me this works.

Maybe the OS does not resolve the relative path. You can also try

#! /usr/bin/env ./adwords

but note that #! only allows one argument.

The directories are not in the search path. This is solved by the
#require trick shown above.
