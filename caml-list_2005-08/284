Yes, I've only studied it through ocamlbrowser. So I'd recommend simply 
commenting the labltk .mli file rather than writing a quick reference.

I meant that the topic "GUI programming using lablTK" is too specific for a 
book.

I'm using the Text widget in a very simple way. I may have to start using the 
canvas widget because I can't figure out how to do various things (e.g. a 
spreadsheet).

Yes and there are a few books on OCaml. But you're talking about the 
intersection of those two sets of users, which is much smaller.

Yes, that is true.

Yes. As OCaml gains popularity it will be commercially viable to publish 
cheaper books. In the mean time, if you're interested in making money, 
perhaps educational software would be better?

I have two projects with GUIs now. One is that database app, that has a very 
simple GUI. The other is Presenta, that draws its own GUI via OpenGL.

I tried to get the latter to work with lablgtk but was told to take my 
question to the gtk forum, where they told me not to use out of date OpenGL 
bindings.

Incidentally, OpenGL is extremely important for us. So a GUI toolkit must be 
able to handle OpenGL widgets. Indeed, this begs the question: why not do the 
whole thing in OpenGL?
