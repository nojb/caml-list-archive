Well I tried to get Ocaml in the door where I work. I was tasked
with writing what was basically a compiler; programming language 
like syntax on the input, construct internal representation, 
manipulate internal representation, write out binary data which 
is basically a state transition table for a program running in an 
embedded device.

When this started I had already been programming in Ocaml for
about 9 months and felt really comfortable with it. Ocaml is
also ideal for compilers.

I suggested it but management said no and I didn't push it.
Ocaml is in their eyes a rather obsure language. I then suggested
Java (with ANTLR) but no, then C++, no. In the end it was written
in standard C with flex/bison. Every time I had to traverses a
damned linked list in C I though of how easy and foolproof this 
would have been in Ocaml.

So yes, the Ocaml code I write at home I do so without a manager
(not even my wife is allowed to tell me what programming language 
to use :-)).

Good advice for everyone : stay away from churches, mosques and
synagouges.
