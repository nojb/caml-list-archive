Hmm. I thought that making postscript or pdf output of an OpenGL
document is difficult, but apparently I'm wrong.

Well, "better" is rather subjective. And not having the native
interface means that people will say "oh, look, this is a non-standard
OCaml program" instead on looking at the application itself.

That's said, if we can have a nice (to be defined ;-) OCaml GUI
toolkit, cross-platform and well documented, we a minimal set of tools
to help design interfaces, I would seriously consider its use.

I'm usually a proponent of GPL but for such a toolkit, I wouldn't mind
a LGPL or BSD-like license.

I have created a Google group to discuss this:
Homepage:  =09   =09http://groups.google.com/group/ocaml-gui  =09=20
Group email: =09  =09ocaml-gui@googlegroups.com =09=20
Description: =09  =09Mailing list to discuss design and development of a
cross-platform Graphic User Interface for the OCaml language


Yours,
d.
