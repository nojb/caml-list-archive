It appears (with the help of a friend good with a debugger) that
there's something going wrong with my code, and how it's interacting
with the GC.

I have a debug compiled version of my kernel, the disassembly, sources
to the C threading code, and some notes from the guy about the
debugging @ http://moonbeam.purevoid.org/~jonathan/ocaml/

If someone can point out what I'm doing wrong, it'd be the biggest
life-saver I could ever imagine!
