Hello,

I've just released ocamlscript 1.0. ocamlscript is the very very small
implementation of a simple idea: write shell-like scripts on a Unix
system but in OCaml and optimized for speed.

For example, you can have a file with following content:

--start execute-n-times--
#!./ocamlscript unix.cmxa

let times = int_of_string (Sys.argv.(1))
let program = Sys.argv.(2)

let _ =
  for i = 1 to times do
    ignore(Unix.system program)
  done;

  exit 0
--end execute-n-times--

And execute this script as:
 ./execute-n-times 10 'echo Hello world!'

When this script is executed ("./execute-n-times"), the first time it is
compiled into native code ("./execute-n-times.opt") and then
executed. At second execution, the native code is executed
immediately. Of course, if the original script is modified, the native
code version is automatically recompiled.


A nice project (and from where the original idea of ocamlscript comes
from) would be to do a Linux distribution where all usual shell scripts
are replaced by ocamlscript scripts. I probably won't do it. ;)
