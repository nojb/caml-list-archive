Easier???  You'd need to build a complete event/messaging subsystem, a
renderer, ..., a set of widgets and get people to ship it.  Plus it'd
likely only run on Linux and BSD.  What about OSX Mac/Windows?  It's
not easier at all especially if it was to be anything like a modern
day gui - think Quartz Extreme/Aqua or AeroGlass. IIRC the plan for
Gtk+ is to go this route too using Cairo.  Despite hating Gtk, it'd be
better to rely on them for the gui and wrap it with something like
your description of a "functional GUI" or bind to WxWidgets (or both).

There's also enlightenment as an alternative for Linux users.
