OCaml runs fine on a Sharp Zaurus (400 MHz ARM with 64 MB of memory);
the ocaml interpreter runs on the device as well as cross-compiled native
code. But of course it's running Linux, not PalmOS.

Porting the runtime would be the main obstacle, I guess, depending on
how much POSIX-compatibility you can get from PalmOS.  I've also heard
rumors that Palm will move to an embedded Linux platform, so maybe the
answer is just to be patient.
