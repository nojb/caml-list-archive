Nonsense. For special cases it may appear that writing a GUI toolkit is 
easy. What everbody seems to forget whenever this discussion comes up is 
that writing a GUI toolkit that's useful for *general* use is hard. Very 
hard. You need to worry about such things as BiDi, accessibility, 
feel-compatibility with the "host" platform (ie. things like identical 
focus handling, interaction with other programs through DnD, etc. etc.), 
  proper widget design, etc. etc.

In short: The solution seems easy to you because you're only seeing a 
subset of the problem.

Just a small real life example of why not to do this: The Mozilla people 
wrote their own GUI toolkit and after all these years they *still* 
haven't been able to fix all the focus problems. (Note: They actually 
had valid reasons for doing so, among other things the fact that none of 
the GUI toolkits at the time could do some of the things required for 
full standards compliance.)
