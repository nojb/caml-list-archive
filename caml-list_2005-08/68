No one is going to pay =A3800 to buy a report containing evidence Ocaml
works in industry.  You may make a damn good case, but it ain't gonna
happen.

If you don't have a few million to spend on advertising, some free
t-shirts and big signs with words like "disruptive", "lower tco", and
all that jazz you're coming through the back door with word of mouth.=20
That means you write applications in it, applications which are used!

This is one thing people fail to understand.  Ordinary users won't
care if your software is written in OCaml, Brainf**k or Java.  The
application is primary to them.  Developers otoh will care about the
underlying language.  To get their attention though you need to do
more than write some code.  You need to write code that gets used.=20
That's the hard bit though.  What will people use?

Yep. :)
