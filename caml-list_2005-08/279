I would prefer a GUI programming language (similar to TeX for word 
processing). This might be easier to develop, can either be static (the 
widget build at compile time) or dynamic, and most of all, it is easier 
to modify an existing GUI.

Why a modern look, you should have the look of the OS you are running on,
using the OS X look on OS X,
the windows look on windows,
the KDE (with the user skin) look on KDE etc ...

This is were things are difficult and where a programming language to 
design the GUI is needed, because the GUI elements do not have the same 
dimension on all platform.

Let's start with simple thing for a basic toolkit,

Then, if the librairy is powerfull enough, it should be possible to 
design new widget entierely in OCaml with the library ?
