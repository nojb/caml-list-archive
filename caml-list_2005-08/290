Why do you think that?

Yes but we gain the ability to have a better interface on all platforms.

I'd rather go entirely OCaml except for the lowest level stuff. Writing 
bindings is just too tedious and error prone and I'm not convinced that 
there's anything sophisticated enough out there that it would be worth the 
hassle. We can certainly improve upon Cairo and I have only had bad 
experiences with other widget sets (e.g. Qt, wxWindows).

It might be nice to allow native GUI dialog boxes (e.g. load and save) but, 
beyond that, I'd be happy to have non-native provided it was more aesthetica 
than the native GUIs.

Also, we'd need the library to be free for commercial use.
