Hi,

I hope someone with experience in the guts of the ocaml systhreads
package can help me out.

I've tried adapting the win32_threads.c source in systhreads to work
with DST. I've implemented a C co-op threading module, which appears
to function correctly according to the tests I've done.

However, I can't seem to be able to get ocaml threads to play along
nicely. I'm out of ideas, and really need some help >_<

All code is available online (http://glek.net/subversion/os/kernel/)
and can be checked out with an svn client (using URL above). For
building, you need to first do make boot (takes a while on lesser
machines like my PIII 600). Also, I copied hooks.h and signals.h from
the byterun folder to ocaml/libs/ocaml/caml (needed private values for
signals.h). And removed the bytecode variants of whatever was present.

The file with the ocaml threading code is
http://glek.net/subversion/os/kernel/ocamlthreads.c, and the C co-op
threading code is http://glek.net/subversion/os/kernel/threads.c

I would very much appreciate anyone who can take the time to look at
this, and discover what I'm undoubtedly doing wrong. This is a major
area of DST to be implemented, and without threading in OCaml, we're
pretty much stuck in the middle of no-man's land.

For once this is a legitimate cry for help ;-) I know I've sent some
stupid, stupid emails in the past....

Thanks to all willing to help,

Jonathan
