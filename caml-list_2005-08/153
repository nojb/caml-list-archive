Or is there? I downloaded libgc_1_1.zip from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgc/, but I wonder if that's the right 
  package. Your docs say libgc should be installed, but according to the 
README file in the package I downloaded, it is intended to be added into 
your source tree--there is no documented installation procedure. Also, 
it's C++, and appears to be primarily geared toward MSVC projects. Have 
I got the wrong one?
