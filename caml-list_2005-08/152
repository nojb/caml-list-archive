This looks like a really cool thing. Haven't tried it yet, but I'm 
working on it. Meanwhile:

  * Your installation docs should include links to OCaml and libgc--
    especially the latter, since it takes a bit of effort to search for
    it--and there seems to be another LibGC for .Net.

  * Your cat logo is nice, but at first glance it looked like a wolf. But
    I suppose that will only bother people who know Japanese ;-)
