Unless you have a substring type I think that'll have to be: "prefix"^_

Anyway, we've had this discussion before. :-)

Are you sure? I was under the impression that macros didn't know about the 
type system.

Has anyone done any ad-hoc polymorphism (if that's the right jargon, I mean 
the equivalent of "+" for both int and float in SML) for containers? I 
haven't finished it yet but I've recently been playing with a term-level 
mini-Caml interpreter that I was going to add this functionality to. So 
"fold", "map" and so on are built into the language and can be applied to the 
built-in data structures set, list and array. Also, the pattern "1::2::3::_" 
can be applied to any container type.

The main problem that I can think of is the unpredictable memory use of 
substring/subarray types when they keep their "parent" around for longer than 
expected. This makes me think that it might be a bad idea...
