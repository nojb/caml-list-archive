That's bad news that nobody answered to this interesting topic within one
week.
As for buying a report, it might be nice to freely provide some results and
trends and then sell the "full report" if it's what you want to do.

My company is using OCaml is a lot of our projects, mainly for development
tools (compilers, level generators, resources builders... ). It's perfectly
suitable in the case where you need to manipulate a lot of data structures
and apply algorithms to them.
