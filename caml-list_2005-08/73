Well your thinking is correct as long as you're the only programmer
involved. If you work with teams, unless you're the project manager you
can't really force other people learning a new language even if it's better
suitable. There's important human factors.

BTW when I think that writing applications is a good way to get people
involved. I got some of interest about OCaml when I presented MTASC at OSCON
last week, and PUGS (Perl 6 compiler in Haskell) is also bringing people to
learn the language.
