Its not really necessary to automate evrything. All we need is a 
central database, which simply contains all we really need to know.
Of course we need *one* database per target system, which is 
really careefully maintained and the used by as many projects as
possible. 

The current situation of every project hacking its own whether 
forecast, is really unreliable and unsatisfying.

Oh, no ... no more such bad jokes .... please, please lets stay serious! 
You dont really ask me to set up an complete (hardware) emulation 
for every target, just that braindead stuff like autoconf can guess 
how many bits an int takes ?! 
No, thats not serious software development.
