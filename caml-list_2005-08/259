Shouldn't be such a problem. We just have to found a separate 
group (outside of the caml project), which thinks carefully and
makes some definitions ...

Well, just a job for namespaces ... (build.*, host.*, ...)

Okay, s/ansi/iso/g;

In this case you explicitly change the host platform, so it also
requires proper adaption of the config-db.

BTW: is the output of the ocaml-compiler platform dependent ?

Well, I'm crosscompiling quite evrything. It normally works.
