Hello,

2005/8/30, Jon Harrop <jon@ffconsultancy.com>:

The client of my application is also written in Lablgtk2 and, despite
helpful answers by Jacques Garrigue and Olivier Andrieux as well as
SooHyoung Oh's tutorials, I find programming with Labgtk2 not very
easy (to say the least). I find Lablgtk2 is largely under-documented.
Of course, this is a large task that cannot be achieved by two
individuals.

I'd also loved too. Having a cross-platform GUI (with native look and
behaviour on Windows and MacOS X),   programmed using a functional
style, well documented (with reference manual and tutorial) and with
necessary tools (GUI design application) would be very very helpful.

However this is a huge task. To add on your initial question:
  1. do you think a minimal part of the OCaml community could
aggregate to ensure the long term maintainability of the toolkit?

  2. how to have a modern look (with whatever definition you might
find for it) which *is* a discriminant point when choosing a GUI?

  3. how to respond to toolkit's users that need to have more "exotic"
widgets/systems?

Yours,
david
