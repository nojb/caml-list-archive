Yep.  Every time I've used a binding to Gtk in any language it's been
pretty ugly.  Unfortunately it's seems to be the only one any wants to
bind to on Linux. :'(

Ch 10 or 11 of CTM (Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer
Programming by Haridi and Van Roy) describes a good model and the
trade offs of various models.  The ref documentation for QTk, the
toolkit they describe, is available at
http://www.mozart-oz.org/documentation/mozart-stdlib/wp/qtk/html/index.html=
.

It's incredibly simple, yet very powerful.
