Whilst considering future projects, it occurred to me that a management report 
along the lines of "OCaml for Industry" might be a viable product. Such a 
book could explain the utility of OCaml in overall terms (for managers and 
investors) as well as detailing the benefits, costs and various ways of 
adopting OCaml in industrial projects.

I'd like to hear from anyone who thinks their company might buy such a 
management report (for around 800UKP) and anyone who can provide information 
about case studies of OCaml having been used in industry.
