Wanted: One OCaml Expert to do a technical review on an upcoming book. Pay  
is decent for the amount of time involved. You'll also receive a full page  
acknowledgement in the book (with picture if you like) and a copy of the  
book to use as a business card.

If you are interested, please contact me off list with your qualifications  
and resume.
