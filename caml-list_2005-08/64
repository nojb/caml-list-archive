My theory was that programmers who appreciate better languages might want some 
evidence that they can present to their managers in order to help justify the 
use of non-mainstream languages. I was curious to see if anyone here was in 
such a position.

I get the impression that most people here (like me) write OCaml code without 
benefit of a manager. ;-)
