The examples that bother me most are record constructors, where I want to
read structured data from a file into a record. And of course :: (which is
just sugar) too.

If it were just functions, it would be less annoying, but left to right is
less surprising.

It's a fun topic to chat about, but if you were allowed one change in the
language, surely this wouldn't be it? :-)
