Well, there is certainly more in the debian packages than just a documentation
hook change and a rebuild, but sure, we all know who makes the main work.

there are mirrors around, ftp2.de.debian.org carries it for example, not sure
if ftp2.fr.debian.org does. As for under development, sorry, but that is pure
FUD, the only reason it is not in the archive, is because of mirror space and
bandwidth consideration in the archive. The security team supports it, and it
was released at the same time as debian/sarge, so as far as quality control is
going, it is there.
