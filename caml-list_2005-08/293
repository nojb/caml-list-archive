Thanks for the link. I'll check it out.

This is exactly the kind of thing that I'd like to avoid. Firstly, Qt is a 
very expensive commercial product so we wouldn't use it. Secondly, Qt goes to 
great lengths to circumvent flaws in the C++ language. It would be a great 
shame to "port" these to OCaml. Finally, I found that TrollTech's own Qt 
demos segfault reliably, so I'd question Qt's stability.

I'd much rather see only low-level bindings with all of the widget code 
written in OCaml.
