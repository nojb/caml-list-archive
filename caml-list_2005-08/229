I've had reason to consider such things before in the context of Fresh
O'Caml, but thankfully have so far managed to avoid having to do this:
it is probably quite a serious undertaking, although I imagine it mainly
reduces to adjusting mlvalues.h.

What information do you wish to store?  Rather than adjusting the block
headers, it might be possible to simply tack it onto the end as extra
fields, provided those fields obey the GC structure constraints.  I've
wondered about such schemes to enable me to determine at runtime which
fields of a record were marked mutable in the source code, something
which is not possible at the moment.
