Hi dude,

There is no support for berkeley DB (only for gnu dbm (gdbm), and ndbm if I remember).

I am aware of two packages, one by yaron minsky and one by lex stein.
I personnaly find the one by lex stein slightly better. I use it for a project of mine.
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~stein/ocamlbdb-4.3.21.tar.gz
There is some strange stuff when you use transaction, but it works pretty well.

The one by lex stein is more recent (well he updated his old version to make it work with berkeley DB 4.3)
