I quite like the notion of a DSL for GUIs, presuming
that it (1) makes simple things simple, with
reasonable defaults for each platform and few if any
unpleasant surprises; (2) keeps complicated things
possible - we shouldn't be sacrificing flexibility;
and (3) is reasonably orthogonal - if the code looks
similar, the layout produced should look similar, with
only those changes in the gui actually reflected by
changes in the code.

One additional advantage this has is that it allows
GUI work to be done by the people who are good at
designing GUI's, rather than those that know the
particular system being worked with, without producing
a lot of icky code.

That's a good point.  I've spent way too long looking
at OO examples of GUIs.  What does a functional GUI
framework look like?
