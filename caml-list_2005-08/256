Tree pattern matching isn't all that specific is it?

I mean one could argue regular patterns are a 'specific domain' ..
but one would be missing the fact the finite state automata are
in the basis of computing.

Ocaml can't even do regular matching, how on earth you could
call it a 'pattern matching language' I don't know. Yet CDuce
is already extending patterns well beyond mere regular matches
by providing fairly strong capturing ability.

Agree. However, whenever you have two tools you have to join them
together somehow. One way of doing that is with Unix scripting,
shell scripts and the like. This is very ugly and non-portable,
but can usually be got to work.=20

For example, using ocamllex/yacc is just horrible in practice,
in Felix compiler there are so many files just to glue them
together ..=20

.. in Felix language itself both lexer and parser
tools are built in to the language and the compiler does the gluing.

Camlp4 provides some interesting ways to glue things in a much
more structured way than Unix script.
