Those features would require a substantial amount of work for either (1) or 
(2), AFAIK.

Then your requirements are quite different from my own and, I believe, many 
other people's. To start with, I am just interested in a minimal working 
library that would let me knock up simple applications. Cross-platform drag 
and drop is way down the line...

If you're talking about supporting all languages and all features on all 
platforms then of course it is an enormous undertaking. From my point of 
view, that is such a difficult task that it simply isn't worth discussing. I 
believe we can only do a decent job if we attack a small problem.

If you're talking about my option (2) then it is more like GLUI and not like 
Qt and wxWindows.
