Using XUL with ocaml would be great... they are working on building
everything (firefox, thunderbird and friends) on the top of xmlrunner,
that is a multi platform library to display xul widgets. The big problem
is that at the moment you can write 'actions' (DCOM objects ??) only in
javascript and c++, and there is a project to implement a python
backend. javascript and c++ are a pain to use. the python backend is
still in a preliminary stage of development (I think). It would be
fantastic to have ocaml bindings (don't look at me :) )... 

Hand writing gui, in my opinion, is something of the past. Using, for
example glade + code generator or XUL is the way to go.
