I knew it was frozen but wondered if an exception was asked for.  e.g.
The Haskell maintainers are waiting for GHC 6.4.1 before they'll
compile the haskell apps (which includes Darcs :'( ).

Btw, how well does Hoary run on your AMD64 bit machine?  I was hanging
off installing the 64bit version because I heard it had problems.

Yep, the abi changes still seem to be an ongoing concern in some
packages.  That said, Ubuntu is in a lot better shape than Debian Sid
was a few weeks ago (not suprising since Ubuntu have been at it since
April).  G++ is now more standards compliant (this caused me some
grief with L4 Pistachio, I'd bet some software has similar issues) and
has resolved some C++ linking issues, so it's a good thing all round.


Cheers,
Chris
