The question is .. why did you ask management?
This should be your decision not theirs. They're paying you because
YOU are the expert in software development.

I used Ocaml to develop a translator for a telco:
I didn't ask .. I *told* them how I was doing it.
I myself raised the issue of maintainability, and even
suggested a teacher be paid to train other programmers.

I made it quite clear that in the available time-frame
with the available resources .. there was no possible
alternative. Haskell could have done it .. but I
don't know Haskell. C++? Java? NO WAY!
