Currently I'd just like to store the address of the allocation site. 
I've tried adding an extra field, hoping that the run-time system would 
never access it. But either I did not get it right, or my assumptions 
about the run-time system were too simple. In any case, the programs 
crashed. I believe this had to do with the representation of arrays but 
no longer remember exactly.

As an alternative, one could maintain a table on the side that maps the 
address of the block to whatever information is associated with it. But 
since the garbage collector moves blocks, this isn't simple to 
maintain, either.
