My only ellipses-related gripe is that ML patterns are designed to be linea=

but it would be nice if they could perform all linear pattern matches.=20
Currently, you cannot match [|1; ...|] in OCaml.

I believe the less-elegant solution "a when Array.length a > 1 && a.(0) =3D=
 1"=20
will incur a significant performance penalty when used in the middle of a=20
large set of unguarded patterns.

=46rom my limited experience of SML, it is more of a pain than a benefit.
