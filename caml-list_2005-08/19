FASE'06 CALL FOR PAPERS

Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
Vienna (Austria), March 27-29, 2006

http://www.elet.polimi.it/conferences/fase06/

The information society is increasingly reliant on software at all=20
levels. Hence, the ability to produce software of high quality at low=20
cost is crucial to technological and social progresses. An intrinsic=20
characteristic of software addressing real-world applications is the=20
need to evolve in order to adjust to new or changing requirements.=20
Maintaining quality while embracing change is one of the main challenges=20
of software engineering.

Software engineers have at their disposal theories, languages, methods,=20
and tools that derive from both systematic research of the academic=20
community and the experience of practitioners. It is one of the roles of=20
software engineering as a scientific discipline to create a feedback=20
cycle between academia and industry by proposing new solutions and=20
identifying those that "work" in practical contexts.

Submissions may address either academic research or industrial=20
experiences, but they must clearly identify the problem and the=20
envisaged solution. Particularly, contributions are encouraged that aim=20
at a combination of conceptual and methodological aspects with their=20
formal foundation and tool support.

A non-exclusive list of topics of interest is:

* Requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management=20
of requirements towards software
* Software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture=20
of individual systems or classes of applications
* Implementation concepts and technologies: distributed, mobile, and=20
embedded applications, service-oriented architectures and Web Services
* Software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source=20
development
* Model-driven development: design and semantics of semi-formal visual=20
languages, consistency and transformation of models
* Software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering,=20
configuration management and architectural change, or aspect-orientation
* Software quality: validation and verification of software using=20
theorem proving, testing, analysis, metrics or visualization techniques
* Application of formal methods to software development

Important dates

* Friday 7 October 2005: Submission deadline for abstracts
* Friday 14 October 2005: Submission deadline for full papers (strict)
* Friday 9 December 2005: Notification of acceptance/rejection
* Friday 6 January 2006: Camera-ready version due
* Saturday 25 March to Sunday 2 April 2006: ETAPS 2006

Submission information

ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers and=20
tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the proceedings and=20
have presentations during the conference. A condition of submission is=20
that, if the submission is accepted, one of the authors attends the=20
conference to give the presentation. Submitted papers must be in English=20
presenting original research. All submitted papers must be unpublished=20
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous=20
submission of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is=20
forbidden.

Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF (preferably) or PS=20
(using Type 1 fonts). The proceedings will be published in the=20
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Final papers=20
will be in the format specified by Springer-Verlag at the URL:=20
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

It is recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and=20
length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately=
.

Research papers

Final papers will be no more than 15 pages long, and should present=20
original research. Additional material intended for the referee but not=20
for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs -=20
may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the=20
page limit.

Tool demonstration papers

Submissions should consist of two parts:
* The first part, at most four pages, should describe the tool=20
presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and provide=20
information which illustrates the maturity and robustness of the tool.=20
(This part will be included in the proceedings.)
* The second part, at most six pages, should explain how the=20
demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including=20
screen dumps and examples. (This part will not be included in the=20
proceedings, but will be evaluated.)
