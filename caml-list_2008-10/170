                     CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
                             ICFP 2009
 14th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                 31st August - 2nd September, 2009
                        Edinburgh, Scotland
               http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2009

The 14th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 31st August to
2nd September 2009.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and
developers to hear about the latest work on the design,
implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops to be affiliated with ICFP 2009
and sponsored by SIGPLAN.  These workshops should be more informal and
focused than ICFP itself, include sessions that enable interaction
among the workshop attendees, and be fairly low cost.  The preference
is for one-day workshops, but other schedules can also be considered.
The workshops themselves will be held between August 30th and
September 5th, as capacity allows.
