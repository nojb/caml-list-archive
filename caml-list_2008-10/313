This is perhaps a bug in the code. I don't have time nor incentive
to fix the 1.2 code line, which uses Qt3 (and Qt3 portability classes in Qt4),
but it's there in the SVN repository and the world is free to send me patches
;).

I am aware of most of these problems and my primary goal is to eliminate
silliness and follow the principle of least astonishment.

Cheers, Kuba
