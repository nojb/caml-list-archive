Welcome in the windows world. For your information, there is a lot of
thing in windows that is bigger than cygwin.

Just taking a fresh example (install it last sunday): PSDK for AMD64
(platform SDK). This is the recommanded C compiler to compile OCaml for
Win64. It takes 935MB (ok this is not 1GB). It is just what is replacing
mingw !!!!

Other examples:
- games
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Team, takes ~6GB (official number from
  microsoft website)

If hard disk space were a problem, nobody would install Microsoft
products...

Another information, I have various benchmark on cygwin. My conclusion
was not what i have expected. Most of the time cygwin runtime has a good
speed. This is not so slow in fact. I think most of the slowness you can
see is because you are working in a MSDOS/emulated X terminal which
seems slow (but is not, this is just a question of refresh rate).
Seriously, cygwin is not that bad. I would still not recommend using it
for various other reasons.
