I'm glad to report that I just tried with XCode 3.1.1 and the linker  
did not complain (as it did with XCode 3.0). I wrote a little test and  
the native Dynlink worked with that version of XCode  (using 10.5.5,  
Intel -- I had to drop an -I flag in the linker call from the OCaml  
compiler when I was trying it).
