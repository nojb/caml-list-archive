Installing DDK is kind of a long shot. I certainly don't have it installed,
even though I use Visual Studio daily.

For ia32, OCaml should use nasm where it previously used masm, that's about 
all I wish for.

For ia64, I don't care much, and if DDK provides masm-x64 then that's probably
good enough.
