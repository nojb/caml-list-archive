             9th International Conference on
        Application of Concurrency to System Design

             University of Augsburg, Germany
        acsd[at]informatik[dot]uni-augsburg[dot]de

         *** Paper deadline: 4 January 2009 ***
        Notification of acceptance: 10 March 2009
            Final version due: 10 April 2009

The International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System Design=
 (ACSD) serves as a forum for disseminating theoretical results with applic=
ation potential and advanced methods and tools for the design of complex co=
ncurrent systems. While there are already quite a few success stories in th=
e field, there is still a strong need to bring theory and practice closer t=
ogether. The conference aims at cross-fertilizing both theoretical and appl=
ied research on topics including, but not limited to, the following:

* Design methods, tools and techniques based on models of computation and c=
oncurrency (data-flow models, communicating automata, Petri nets, process a=
lgebras, state charts, MSCs, etc.), (performance) analysis, verification, t=
esting and synthesis.

* Hardware / software co-design, platform-based design, component-based des=
ign, refinement techniques, hardware / software abstractions, co-simulation=
 and verification.

* Synchronous and asynchronous design, asynchronous circuits, globally asyn=
chronous locally synchronous systems, interface design, multi-clock systems=
, functional and timing verification.

* Concurrency issues in Systems on Chips, massively parallel architectures,=
 networks on chip, task and communication scheduling, resource, memory and =
power management, fault-tolerance and Quality of Service issues.

* (Industrial) case studies of general interest, gaming applications, consu=
mer electronics and multimedia, automotive systems, (bio-)medical applicati=
ons, internet and grid computing, etc.

* Concurrency issues in ad-hoc, mobile and wireless networking, sensor netw=
orks, communication protocols, cross-layer optimization, resource and power=
 management, fault-tolerance, concurrency-related security issues.

* Business process modelling, simulation and verification, (distributed) wo=
rkflow execution, business process (de-)composition, interorganisational an=
d heterogeneous workflow systems, computer-supported collaborative work sys=
tems, web services.

* Synthesis and control of concurrent systems, (compositional) modelling an=
d design, (modular) synthesis and analysis, distributed simulation and impl=
ementation, (distributed) controller synthesis, adaptive systems, superviso=
ry control.

Regular Papers

Regular papers should be in IEEE Computer Society Press 2-column format (ft=
p://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/instruct8.5x11.pdf, see =
also the Formatting section from Information for Authors of the webpage htt=
p://www.computer.org/cps/), and should be submitted via Easychair. Both lon=
g papers (7 to 10 pages) and short papers (5 to 6 pages) can be submitted. =
Authors submitting long papers should indicate in their submission whether =
they would be prepared to reduce the length of their submissions to 6 pages=
 on the recommendation of the programme committee.The cover page should inc=
lude the corresponding author, physical and e-mail addresses, phone and FAX=
 numbers, and an abstract of at most 60 words. The deadline for submission =
of regular papers is 4 January 2008. Papers will also be accepted up to 10 =
January 2008, so long as the cover page (including title and abstract) is s=
ubmitted by 4 January 2008. Submitted papers should describe original work =
that has not been previously published and is not under review for publicat=
ion elsewhere. More information can be obtained through the conference web-=
pages.

Tool Papers

Tool papers should be in IEEE Computer Society Press 2-column format (ftp:/=
/pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/instruct8.5x11.pdf, see als=
o the Formatting section from Information for Authors of the webpage http:/=
/www.computer.org/cps/), with no more than 5 pages, and should be submitted=
 via Easychair.The cover page should include the corresponding author, phys=
ical and e-mail addresses, phone and FAX numbers, and an abstract of at mos=
t 60 words. The references should include a link to the tool-homepage, wher=
e it can be downloaded. The deadline for submission of tool papers is 4 Jan=
uary 2008. Papers will also be accepted up to 10 January 2008, so long as t=
he cover page (including title and abstract) is submitted by 4 January 2008=
=2E Acceptance of a tool paper implies that a tool demonstration should be =
given at the conference. For facility arrangements and questions, please co=
ntact acsd@informatik.uni-augsburg.de.

Proceedings

Proceedings containing accepted regular papers, tool papers and invited pap=
ers are planned to be published by IEEE Computer Society Press.
