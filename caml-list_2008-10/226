Camlp4 extensions can open and write files normally.  However it
doesn't have access to crucial details of the 'OCaml environment' such
as the current search path for libraries, which means that it usually
cannot do anything sensible.

For example, I wanted to load another module/library from a camlp4
extension - but that sort of thing isn't possible as far as I can
tell.

I wrote a bit more about this issue here:
