This is likely to erupt into a flamewar ;) I will leave it to the user to 
choose. I have no preference personally, and this is a matter of taste
and people get religious about it: so no point arguing either way.

I will support space-only mode, mixed space-tab mode, and also different
indent styles between expressions/statements and within them. Basically
whatever emacs/vi does, I will do as well, leaving it to the user to choose.

Depending on time constraints, the full gamut of choices may be relegated
to 2.1, but I have it all on my mind.

Cheers, Kuba
