A number of you are already aware of the following feature request:

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4608

whose text reads
===================
I really wish that the basic features of metaocaml, namely .< >., .~ and .!
were included in OCaml proper.  The many other experimental features of
metaocaml could stay 'experimental', those are the 3 which are sorely
needed.

Note that OCaml could be really ahead of Haskell here (with its untyped
Template Haskell, which is closer to camlp4 than to metaocaml) by being
the first production language to have _typed_ metaprogramming facilities.
===================

This feature request is currently the entry in Mantis which has (by far!) the largest number of comments from separate people, as well as now being the entry with the most comments overall.  

Please add your voice to the chorus!

Jacques
