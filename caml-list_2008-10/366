A Generative Theory of Shape

Michael Leyton

Springer-Verlag

=20

The purpose of the book is to develop a generative theory that has two =
properties regarded as fundamental to intelligence -=20

maximizing reusability of structure and maximizing recoverability of the =
generative operations. These two properties are=20

particularly important in the representation of complex organization - =
which is the main concern of the book.=20

The primary goal of the theory is the conversion of complexity into =
understandability. For this purpose, a mathematical theory=20

is presented of how understandability is created in a structure. This is =
achieved by developing a group-theoretic approach to=20

formalizing reusability and recoverability. To handle highly complex =
structure, a new class of groups is invented, called unfolding groups.=20

These unfold structure from a maximally collapsed version of that =
structure. A principal aspect of the theory is that it develops a=20

new algebraic formalization of major object-oriented concepts such as =
inheritance. The consequence that the book establishes=20

a representational language for complex organizational structure, that =
is interoperable by virtue of the principles on which the theory=20

is based: reusability and recoverability.=20

=20

The book gives extensive applications of the theory to CAD/CAM, human =
and machine vision, robotics,  software engineering, and physics.=20

For example, the theory is used to give new and detailed insights into =
the main stages of mechanical CAD/CAM: part-design, assembly a

nd machining. And within part-design, an extensive analysis is given of =
sketching, alignment, dimensioning, resolution, editing, sweeping,=20

feature-addition, and intent-management. In robotics, several levels of =
analysis are developed for manipulator structure and kinematics. =20

In software, a new theory is given of the principal factors such as text =
and class structure, object creation cloning and modification, as=20

well as inheritance and hierarchy prediction. In physics, a new theory =
is given of the conservation laws, and motion decomposition=20

theorems in classical and quantum mechanics. In perception, extensive =
theories are developed for Gestalt grouping criteria, orientation=20

and form, the prototype phenomena, and the main Gestalt motion phenomena =
(induced motion, separation of systems, the Johannson=20

relative/absolute motion effects. =20

=20

=20

Springer-Verlag allows the book to be viewed on-line at institutions =
that have a Springer subscription:=20
