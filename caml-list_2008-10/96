Good point. Even a moderately long argument will corrupt the environment:

# Proctitle.setproctitle "Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white 
as snow.";;
- : unit = ()
# Unix.environment ();;
- : string array =
[|"little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.";
   ", whose fleece was white as snow."; " was white as snow."; "w.";
   ...

That is why you not only need bounds checking but relocation of the 
environment to do this safely.

Thanks,
Dave
