Sure, many of OCaml's standard libraries contains a reimplementation.

Indeed, OCaml has many such issues that the community could easily fix and 
that would help adoption.

I submitted the following trivial fix over a year ago:

  http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4338

It was completely reimplemented by Xavier (thus avoiding copyright issues) and 
will be available in 3.11 well over a year after I fixed the problem.

In fact, I'm not sure there would have been any point in creating a patch 
rather than posting code given that the code gets reimplemented anyway.

I believe we can improve upon having Xavier reimplement trivial fixes himself 
and users having to wait for a year before they can benefit from such fixes.

That will not help merge parts of MetaOCaml (which is already a fork of OCaml) 
into upstream OCaml.
