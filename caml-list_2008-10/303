       Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming
                                  RDP'09
                  28/6/2009 - 3/7/2009, Brasilia, Brazil
                    Second Call For Workshop Proposals		 


RDP'09 is a federated event comprising two major conferences: 
 - The 20th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
   Applications (RTA'09) 
 - The 9th International Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and
   Applications (TLCA'09) 
In addition, the 4th International School on Rewriting (ISR'09) will
take place the week before RDP.

Previous RDPs were held in 2003 in Valencia (Spain), 2004 in Aachen
(Germany), 2005 in Nara (Japan), and 2007 in Paris (France). RDP has a
tradition of federating every two years RTA and TLCA, and of hosting
related workshops.

We solicit proposals for satellite workshops of RDP'09 that are
related in topics to one or both of the RDP conferences. 

Workshops should have a length of 1 or 2 days (possibilities for
longer workshops should be discussed with the organizers). It is
tradition at RDP that attendance to workshops is open to participants of
parallel events, similar to the way FLoC workshops are run. There will
be one day (Sunday, June 28) reserved for workshops, however, it will
also be possible to run workshops on the other days in parallel to one
of the main conferences.

RDP will provide the possibility to print workshop proceedings,
details of the procedure will be posted later by the local organizing
committee. RDP will not be able to reimburse invited workshop speakers
for travel or living expenses, though it may be possible to waive part
of the registration fees for invited speakers. The priority of RDP will
be to keep registration fees for the conferences and workshops low.

Please submit your workshop proposal by email to

      rdp09workshop-proposal@sympa.pps.jussieu.fr

Proposals should be written in plain text. The proposal should cover the
following topics: 
   
 1. Name of workshop 
 2. A statement of the topics and goals of the workshop 
 3. Names and addresses of the organizers 
 4. Pointers to descriptions of previous editions of the workshop, if any 
 5. A description of the submission selection process  
 6. Plans for the publication of proceedings (informal proceedings
    distributed to participants, electronic journal,  proceedings with
    separate selection process, ...) 
 7. Plans for invited speakers or special sessions (round-table
    discussion, tutorials, ...) 
 8. Expected length of the workshop 
 9. Expected number of attendees 
10. Any special needs (for system demonstrations ...) 
  
The Workshop Selection Committee consists of  Mauricio Ayala
Rincon (RDP'09 general chair), Pierre-Louis Curien (TLCA'09
program chair), and Ralf Treinen (RTA'09 program chair).
