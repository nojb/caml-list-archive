-nodynlink only makes a difference for the AMD64 backend. It is accepted 
by ocamlopt for all ports in order to simplify Makefiles.

There were reasonable arguments for turning the "ready for dynlink" 
behavior on by default, namely that nobody would do it otherwise in the 
Makefiles of their distributed libraries since it is required only on 
one port. Also, according to a few benchmarks, the impact on performance 
is very limited.
