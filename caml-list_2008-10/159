Not quite clear what you mean by this - are you referring to the Cygwin
*port* of OCaml or the MinGW port *built* in Cygwin? (though I'm aware that
you don't have to use Cygwin to build this any more)

While it's not a major issue (especially once OCaml 3.11 comes along and
just about everything that can be done in bytecode is possible in native
code...), the bytecode interpreter in the MSVC port is considerably slower
than in the MinGW port (as documented in the readme) which is the reason I
chose it years ago over MSVC...

That said, I'd quite like to take advantage of my shiny new x64 quad-core
Dell so perhaps it is time to switch 8-)
