This makes the mistake of supplying a lump of code instead of a patch.
It's a very common mistake, so don't feel bad about it.  In fact it
happens so much with libvirt that I cowrote the following section to
cover it:

Rich.

ObComment: People at Red Hat deal with patches almost as a form of
currency.  Typically I'll send and receive a dozen patches a day, and
the kernel developers probably deal with ten times as many.  The
interesting thing is that the actual diff / patch format is very
crude.  It's crying out for someone to invent a tool which actually
understands the syntax of the code in the files (not just as plain
text) and creates a more robust and easier to read format.
