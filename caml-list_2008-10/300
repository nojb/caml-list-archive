I agree.

Even without changing your editor, you can change the tab length.

Moreover, if the editor uses tabs and counts them as more than one 
character (default behavior of emacs) it won't be able to locate errors 
correctly.

Finally, when you use backspace to delete one space and suddenly it 
deletes eight of them because it was actually a tab, it's annoying 
because it's unpredictable.

Altogether, this means that if you edit a file and put tabs in it, it 
may work for you, but it may annoy the people you give your file to :p
