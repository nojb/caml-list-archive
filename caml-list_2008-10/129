You should consider enhancing what is already existing: ocamlbuild is
here to bootstrap already some piece of the OCaml build process.

I think that it will be quicker to extend ocamlbuild to be able to
compile everything well than to recreate a "make". 

Take a look at the build script in build/*.sh to see what is needed.
These are fairly simple script, that can be easily transform
automatically into .bat file.
