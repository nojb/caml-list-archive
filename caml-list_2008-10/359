Thanks for these explanations. I suspected something like that, since I
already encountered some problems with missing location info in the
typedtree.

Do you think about submitting a patch to caml developers in a near future so
that ocamlwizard could find all needed information with any compatible
version of ocaml without any patch ? And then it would be great to be able
to use ocamlwizard features from an ocaml library (this is more convenient
and faster than launch commands and read files).
