Hi,

I think Batteries Included is a great idea and have been looking forward to 
seeing how it turns out.  I've just installed it and have been playing around 
with it.  A quick question, how do you get batteries to work in the toplevel?  
I tried the usual:

  # #use "topfind";;
  # #require "batteries";;
  No such package: bin_prot.syntax - Required by `batteries.bin_prot.syntax'

But I get an error.  Attempts to "#require" batteries.bin_prot.syntax yield 
similar errors.

This is quite important to me.  I don't know what the general sentiment of the 
community is, but the toplevel is one of the major reasons I use OCaml.  In 
fact, for every Makefile I write, I write an equivalent toplevel init file.  
This ensures that any code I write in the toplevel, will compile with no 
changes and vice versa.  Even when making simple edits to compiled code, I 
will open up a toplevel, load the library/file and open the correct name 
space of where the edit will take place (automated with some elisp of 
course).  This allows me to test, in the toplevel, each little change I make.

Thanks in advance,

Peng
