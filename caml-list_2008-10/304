Ocamlwizard is available here from Osp Meeting: http://ocamlwizard.lri.fr/
The OSP result is here : http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/38

Me and Mohammed were very busy this last month (from the osp meeting), but
Mohamed have updated the website and the Newer will be online in few days, I
think...

Me, I try to finish the "developper documentation" this next week to help
some best implementation of this tools in emacs and other IDE... and to
explain our implementation, I prepare too a short video to show "how
install" and "use" ocamlwizard.

We try to finish some part of ocamlwizard, but we can't promise when... for
this time.

We didn't answer at all question on ocamlwizard, but I have read it (and I
am sure, Mohamed too) and I wil continue every weeks to read caml list...
and I hope this developper documentation answer for me.

...Sorry for my english...
