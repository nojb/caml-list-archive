The Changes list do mention a number of important changes in the  
runtime system.

For most of my programs the bottleneck functions are implemented in C.  
For one of the few cases where OCaml is taking care of the core loop,  
ocaml 3.11.0beta1 produce a consistently slower native executable than  
3.10.2 by a very small factor (around 0.5%). I have not timed in  
Windows, and I run Windows inside a virtual machine, so I'm not sure  
if the differences I will observe there are just an artifact of that  
setup.
