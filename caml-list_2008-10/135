           Sixth International Workshop on
aPpplications of declArative and object-oriented Parallel Programming

                      ICCS 2009

AIMS AND SCOPE

Computational Science applications are more and more complex to  develop 
and require more and more computing power. Bill McColl's post 
"Sequential Computing Considered Harmful" is an excellent summary of 
today's situation. Sequential computing cannot go further. Major 
companies in the computing industry now recognizes the urgency of 
reorienting an entire industry towards massively parallel computing 
(Think Parallel or Perish).

Parallel and grid computing are solutions to the increasing need for 
computing power. The trend is towards the increase of cores in 
processors, the number of processors and the need for scalable 
computing everywhere. But parallel and distributed programming is  still 
dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message  passing. 
Thus high-level approaches should play a key role in the  shift to 
scalable computing in every computer.

Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages  such 
as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming,  parallel 
execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries,  genericity and 
meta-programming in object-oriented languages, etc.  have produced 
methods and tools that improve the price/performance  ratio of parallel 
software, and broaden the range of target  applications. Alos, high 
level languages offer a high degree of  abstraction which ease the 
development of complex systems. Moreover,  being based on formal 
semantics, it is possible to certify the  correctness of critical parts 
of the applications.

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel 
programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level 
programming languages, semantics of parallel languages, formal 
verification, design or certification of libraries, middlewares and 
tools (performance predictors working on high-level parallel/grid 
source code, visualisations of abstract behaviour, automatic hotspot 
detectors, high-level GRID resource managers, compilers, automatic 
generators, etc.), application of proof assistants to parallel 
applications, applications in all fields of computational science, 
benchmarks and experiments. Research on high-level grid programming is 
particularly relevant as well as domain specific parallel software.

The aim of all these languages and tools is to improve and ease the 
development of applications (safety, expressivity, efficienty, etc.). 
Thus the Sixth PAPP workshop focuses on applications.

The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the 
development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing 
and computational science researchers who are potential users of these 
languages and tools.

TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

* applications in all fields of high-performance computing and
  visualisation (using high-level tools)

* high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for parallel
  and grid computing

* Program verification and Formal verification of parallel applications/
  libraries/languages or new technics for parallel computing in
  computer-assisted reasoning

* high-level parallel language design, implementation and
  optimisation

* modular, object-oriented, functional, logic, constraint programming
  for parallel, distributed and grid computing systems

* algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries

* generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic
  skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries

* benchmarks and experiments using such languages and tools

* industrial uses of a high-level parallel language



PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as
part of the ICCS proceedings.

Submission must be done through the ICCS website:
http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/papers/upload.php
We invite you to submit a full paper of 8 pages formatted according to
the rules of LNCS, describing new and original results, no later than
December 6, 2008. Submission implies the willingness of at least one
of the authors to register and present the paper. An early email to
papp at free.fr with your intention to submit a paper would
be greatly appreciated (especially if you have doubts about the
relevance of your paper).

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop and extended and
revised versions will be published in a special issue of Scalable 
Computing:
Practice and Experience, provided revisions suggested by the
referees are made.
