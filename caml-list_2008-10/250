I'm not sure that parsing ocamlbuild file is the right thing to do. For
a simple OCaml project (which would probably mean most Camelia
projects), there are no OCamlBuild files at all.

Mmmhhh.... there's .itarget (i.e. a list of files you wish generated
after compilation), but that's about it. And, again, most projects don't
have any.

Cheers,
 David
