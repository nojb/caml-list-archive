Thanks for the info. I remember I once saw a smaller lib with similar
name for this purpose, maybe it was the same one but you upgraded it?

That's the exact reason I'd leave camlish as small as possible and only
concentrate on the glue layer. Your lib just gave this another vote.
I'll add a reference to FileUtil in the README. Camlish users can just
customize their working environments by importing various
modules/functions in scope via their .camlishrc file.
