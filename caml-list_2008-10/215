Did you manage to do it with *.dll or *.lib? I don't have those dll's  
and have been unable to compile the MinGW port with a setup that  
succeeded since 3.09.3. I keep getting:

Cannot export tcl84_NULL_THUNK_DATA: symbol not found

Could it be a path issue? Could you please show me an example of the a  
path that you are using successfully?
