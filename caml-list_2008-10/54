Indeed the question is not trivial.  Because MetaOCaml (like OCaml) has
higher-order functions (which may operate on code values or on functions
on code values), it is not trivial at all to `simulate' MetaOCaml in
OCaml.  Our PEPM paper this year (Kameyama, Kiselyov, and Shan) needed
the full power of System F just to express a subset of MetaOCaml without
polymorphism (even let-bound) or nested quotation (such as .<.<42>.>.).

    http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/metafx/pepm66-kameyama.pdf

Section 2 of this paper gives a series of examples to illustrate the
non-triviality of the simulation.  You can try to skip to Section 2.5
to see the most challenging example there.

To the contrary, that is not the only difference; the timing of
side effects (including non-termination and exceptions) can also be
different.  We give an example at the beginning of our Section 2.
