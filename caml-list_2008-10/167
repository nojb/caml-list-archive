I think that you always have "ml" (and "ml64" for x64) in MS Visual
Studior 2008 even in Standard Edition (the one I have).

However, you don't have it with Visual Express (free edition). In this
case you should fetch it...

In fact for MSVE 2008, you cannot install masm, so you have to extract
it by hand and forcibly install it in "cl" directory.

I think all (cl, ml and link) is also shipped in MS PSDK, especially for
x64...
