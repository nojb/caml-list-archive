Hi Jun,

If it's a bug, it should go to mantis... but it's not one.

Actually, it doesn't compile in 3.10.2.
(At least, not in release310)
But it did compile until 3.10.0, and this was a bug.
Indeed, in the above 'a is a constrained variable, so its variance is
not inferred. The explicit variance is +'a, which doesn't cancel
unification.
(One might argue that we need a special variance to indicate types
that do not appear in the body...)

This is not strange. Here 'a t expand to u, where 'a is forgotten.
So the type annotation really removes the connection between input and
output types.
This is the right way to obtain what you wish.
