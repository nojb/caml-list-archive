I just had a visit to your project, and yes, I agree they are mostly
orthogonal. Camlish only concentrates on the interaction, redirection,
composition and coordination of _external_ commands, pushing/pulling the
input/output as OCaml values. It doesn't, and probably won't, define
functions as common shell commands by itself, which, I believe, are
better left to other libraries.

As a compensation, camlish allows one to execute shell commands directly
from toplevel, if (s)he doesn't care about the interaction with OCaml
world. So instead of writing

   # !! cmd "ls -l";;

which is plain OCaml function calling outside command "ls", one can
simply write

   # ls -l ;;

which is a shell command, not a function named "ls". I myself am
interested in using OCaml toplevel as a shell environment.

Still, it's very nice to see others confronting similar problems and
trying to solve them in different approaches.
