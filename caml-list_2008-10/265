I already thought that Camelia and similar apps should provide essentially
two UI modes: the standard, all-exposed "clutterface" typical of most
applications, and a "nakedface" where just as you say there's just the main
window (or two), even without decorations, and nothing more.

Camelia provides panes for debugger and toplevel, so those of course could be
held in a virtual space in the "nakedface" model.

Heck, as far as I can imagine it, it souldn't be that big of a deal to have
the virtual desktops implemented in Camelia itself: depending on which 
direction and how fast the mouse crosses/touches the window edge from
inside, it changes the viewport to a different window.

I had similar mode in mind for a PCB editing application I'm working on, so
I do actually find your ideas appealing and worthwhile. Especially that
it's relatively trivial to implement little goodies like that. I vehemently
hate window decorations on CAD programs: that's why I liked the old
school applications like Protel for DOS, AutoCad, most of the stand-alone CAD
workstations: they displayed things full-screen since screen real estate
was really expensive, and often had single-key shortcuts to swap the screen
with a textmode interface for options, command input etc.

Will check on omake, for sure.

Thanks for the suggestions, keep them coming. I guess I have to think of
"classic" and "naked" interface modes for Camelia, then.
