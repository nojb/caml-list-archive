Yes, I referred to it indirectly in my previous message. Indeed, ASN.1
supports disjoint unions ("tagged types") that would allow to extend a type.
It is obviously possible to build extensible protocols with ASN.1, but if I
understand it correctly, not all protocols expressed in ASN.1's abstract
syntax are automatically extensible --- it requires some care when designing
them (i.e., tagging).

My main problem with ASN.1 is that even the distinguished encoding rules are
fairly complex; also, explicit tagging results in relatively heavy
serialization too. My protocol family is both substantially simpler and better
adapted for extensibility. For example, the generic pretty-printer (able to
decode any message) takes ~40 lines of code.
