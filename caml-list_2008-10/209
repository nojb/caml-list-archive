Indeed. However, some people might want to recompile them (e.g. to keep 
debug symbols, or to use a specific version of their C compiler).

As far as I can tell, the install target does not copy these files.

No.

You're right about the circular dependency, but the answer is much 
simpler than for the chicken-and-egg question: OCaml came first.
I don't see a compelling reason to include a binary version of flexdll 
in the OCaml distribution. Just consider flexdll as an external 
dependency that comes in binary form (like the MS C compiler). It just 
happens to be produced by the OCaml compiler.

Note that flexlink.exe can be compiler with an old OCaml compiler. Also, 
if you insist to bootstrap everything, it shouldn't be too difficult to 
get a minimal (=no dynamic linking of external C code) ocamlrun.exe for 
3.11 that does not require flexlink.
