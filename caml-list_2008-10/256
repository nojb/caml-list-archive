Err... I'm not sure .itarget is what you want. It's close of what you 
want, sure, but you may have several .itarget for the same project, 
things like that.

A typical project may have:
   * some source files (.ml .mli .mly .mll);
   * several main targets (.byte .native .mllib .mlpack), that may or 
may not be put together in one or several .itarget;
   * a documentation (.odocl);
   * some special rules (_tags myocamlbuild.ml), like some libraries to use;
   * a configure script.
This is not, IMO, easily relatable to the project itself, which is 
simply a list of files...

Given a list of files, an IDE can guess interesting targets such as:
   * .docdir/index.html for each .odocl;
   * .cma .cmxa for each .mllib;
   * .cmo for each .mlpack.
But potentially every file can generate several interesting targets. For 
instance, from the file x.mlpack, one can generate x.cmo, x.cmx, x.cma, 
x.cmxa, x.mli, or even x.docdir/index.html.

IMO, simply allowing to view the whole contents of a directory is 
enough, especially thanks to the fact that ocamlbuild does not pollute 
your source directory.
