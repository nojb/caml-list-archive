Thanks, this was an interesting idea, though apparently setproctitle is 
not available on Linux, only BSD. There have been some attempts to 
expose it to Linux, including this one for Perl:

http://search.cpan.org/~opi/Sys-Proctitle-0.03/

You can see the gory details here:

http://search.cpan.org/src/OPI/Sys-Proctitle-0.03/libsetproctitle/setproctitle.c

It appears that it is possible to do this with OCaml, but it involves 
building and linking in a shared library that defines the obsolete _init 
method, fiddles around with memory relocating the environment and a 
bunch of other nasty stuff I don't even want to understand. If it was 
something simple like wrapping a libc function, I'd go for it, but this 
is all too complicated for such a simple, stupid hack. =)

Thanks,
Dave
