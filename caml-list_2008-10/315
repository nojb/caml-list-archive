Exactly, and that's why indentation in-between statements/expressions
can use tabs with arbitrary length, but indentation within statements/
expressions (split between lines) has to copy previous line's indentation
up to the starting column, and then use solely spaces. Same goes for 
indentation of comments that follow a non-blank line (can only use spaces).
There are several orthogonal issues here, all are well known, so please let's
not prolong this thread ;)
