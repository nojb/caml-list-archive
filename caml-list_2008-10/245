Ah, I didn't realise that. Perhaps ocamlopt -help could include a note to
that effect?

Indeed - that's the benefit I was referring to! However...

Then why might my program be running ~25% slower when compiled with ocamlopt
3.11.0 vs 3.10.2? I'm assuming that there's little to no difference between
ocamlopt using masm and ocamlopt using gas in terms of resulting
performance?
