Unfortunately, Its's not possible (for now) to have ocamlwizard compatible =
with both ocaml-3.10 and ocaml-3.11 for several reasons :=20
=C2=A0
Ocamlwizard uses a patched ocaml-3.10 parser to be used on incomplete sourc=
e files. But I think it is easy to patch=C2=A0an=C2=A0ocaml-3.11 parser to =
do so.
=C2=A0
During the first month (during June), we used cvs version of ocaml (3.11). =
We have patched an ocaml-3.11 parser, we parsed the annot file to get expre=
ssion's type and read cmi files to get more information and to extract prop=
osals ...=20
=C2=A0
But, We've released by the beginning of July that types in .annot (3.10.2) =
are not always qualified enough. And to give the right qualification we hav=
e to perfom a scope analysis. We also need to scope analysis for nagivation=
 in soure code and refactoring.
=C2=A0
We know its better to use ocaml compiler as a blackbox to increase portabil=
ity. and we considered this approach as much as possible, but (unfortunatel=
y) important information are missing. Performing our own scope analysis it =
not realistic. The solution we have choose is to embed and ocaml type check=
er (3.10) and to patch it to have localizations in cmi files (.cmi + locali=
zations =3D .owz files). I=C2=A0suppose typecheckers in ocaml-3.10 and in o=
caml-3.11 are differents.
=C2=A0
So, we have embed ocaml source files in ocamlwizard (parser + typechecker )=
 because we have to patch some files to get the information we need. Thus, =
to be used with ocaml-3.11, one have to patch ocaml-3.11 parser and typeche=
cker.
