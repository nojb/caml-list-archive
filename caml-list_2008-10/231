X-Spam: no; 0.00; ocaml:01 mingw:01 cygwin:01 ocaml:01 debugger:01 bug:01 cheers:01 2.0:98 sourceforge:01 msvc:01 supported:02 supported:02 codebase:96 slightly:03 slightly:03 

Here's the update from the trenches: I'm about 75% done
porting Camelia code to Qt4, the editor-related parts took
longer than anticipated since a lot of code had to change due
to the arguably better way that Qt4 handles text editing. The
code shrinks quite a bit in the process (20% or so, per the line
counts), so that's hopefully good ;) The debugging will surely
take quite some time.

I'm in the process of getting admin rights to the sourceforge
project and setting up an SVN repository for the code.

The upcoming version will be 2.0, and I hope to add some features
to it before it's final. I'm sure of Ocamlbuild support.
Any other features that people would like?

I'll keep you guys posted, this is obviously a "slightly"*
larger project than initially anticipated, but the codebase
is OK to work with, and it'll have way more features than
anything done from scratch in a weekend would ;)

My plan is to have the final 2.0 release support all OCaml builds
out of the box on Windows (MSVC, MinGW and Cygwin), although
I will put 3.11.0 as the minimum supported version of OCaml
due to debugger and other woes. Linux and OSX will also be
supported; Linux-wise I can only test on FC9, but bug reports
will be welcome of course.

Cheers, Kuba

* - "slightly" in the log scale, so just one order of magnitude
is "not much" ;)
