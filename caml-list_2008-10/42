Are there any tools or examples that would allow me to take a .cmo or .cmx
file and produce a list of the external modules that are referenced from
that file?

I'm trying to sort a list of .cmo or .cmx files so that they may link
successfully.

  ocamlc -o binary a.cmo b.cmo c.cmo

I know of the "ocamldsort" tool but I'd rather have a tool that took in
the binaries and sorted those (it fits much better in my Makefile that
way). The ocamldsort tool only works on source files.

If I could just read a list of external module references out of a .cmo
file I could topologically sort them on my own (or error out if there is a
cycle).

Any ideas?
