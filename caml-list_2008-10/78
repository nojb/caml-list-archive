I've been reading through this thread and it all seems like a 300-liner
in Qt/C++ (yes, it's that powerful) (excluding syntax definition for Qt's
editor widget, if one doesn't exist somewhere for grabs).
Is there a non-Cygwin (mingw?) version of Ocaml for Windows that's "good
enough" for you? If so, I will tackle it over the weekend. My numerical
methods prof was looking for something like that too. Just give me
a pointer to a non-Cygwin version of Ocaml that works for you; I refuse
to deal with anything that has "Cygwin" in it :)

Cheers, Kuba
