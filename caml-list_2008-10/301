I would prefer to not have an editor which modify completely the file I am
working on (ie. automatically replace tab by spaces). When working on big
project, you cannot assume that everybody use spaces-based editor, and you
still want to minimize the diff size of your patches.

That&#39;s actually nearly what Camelia has right now. Right now Camelia<br>
insists on not dealing with tabs at all -- it converts them all to<br>
spaces. This &quot;feature&quot; has to go obviously, and it&#39;s a few-liner to<br>
convert between characters (which include tabs) and columns.<br>

<br>
What do you mean with this? Reason I ask is that in OcalIDE an option to<br>
save files with spaces only, was added because it allows one to simultaneously edit files in various editors, each with its own tab<br>
&quot;length&quot;. If not, indenting is not maintained. I myself think that<br>
avoiding tabs altogether is a good solution.<br>

I agree.<br>
<br>
Even without changing your editor, you can change the tab length.<br>
<br>
Moreover, if the editor uses tabs and counts them as more than one character (default behavior of emacs) it won&#39;t be able to locate errors correctly.<br>
<br>
Finally, when you use backspace to delete one space and suddenly it deletes eight of them because it was actually a tab, it&#39;s annoying because it&#39;s unpredictable.<br>
<br>
Altogether, this means that if you edit a file and put tabs in it, it may work for you, but it may annoy the people you give your file to :p<br>
