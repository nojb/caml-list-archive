Talking about ocamlwizard, why does it embed a part of ocaml sources
rather than use a configure option to find the compiled sources of ocaml ?
This would allow to compile ocamlwizard with any (compatible) version of
ocaml (even a cvs version). For example, how to use it with ocaml 3.11 beta1
without modifying the copied parts of ocaml present in ocamlwizard ?

That's how topcameleon is compiled, asking the user where the compiled
sources of ocaml are located.

Having the compiled sources of ocaml is not a problem for an ocaml
developer, and the ocamlwizard users are ocaml developers, aren't they ?

For users of pre-compiled packages (debian, etc.), this is not a problem
for the packagers to have ocamlwizard compiled using the sources of ocaml
used for the ocaml package.
