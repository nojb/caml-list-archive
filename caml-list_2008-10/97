I'm starting to wonder if this all isn't one big joke that went over my 
head. =)

Yeah, it would be really nice to get a safe version of this feature 
packaged up somewhere that could be installed easily. If you search the 
web for "libproctitle" you'll find a library by Dmitry V. Levin which it 
looks like he was trying to get into Debian earlier this year. I couldn't 
find it in unstable, though. There are RPMs available here:

http://sisyphus.ru/srpm/Sisyphus/setproctitle/get

That Perl module also has the low-level stuff broken out into a C library, 
though it doesn't appear like any attempt was made to release it 
independently:

http://search.cpan.org/src/OPI/Sys-Proctitle-0.03/libsetproctitle/

Hmm. Maybe it's time to replace "ps" with something more modern... this is 
all so dirty, yet it seems like monitoring process status is still a 
useful thing to be able to do, especially with the proliferation of 
multi-process servers.
