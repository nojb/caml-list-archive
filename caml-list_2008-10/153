Not at all. Once compiled, ocaml doesn't use cygwin anymore. With maybe
the big exception of some little thing in ocambuild, that should be
fixed in ocaml 3.11 (something like needing "tput"). 

For example, if you download and install OCaml MSVC from
http://caml.inria.fr and you open a MS Visual Studio 2005 MSDOS shell,
you can perfectly compile a native application (well I have not done it,
but I will try tomorrow ;-)

All you need is "cl", "ml" and "link" I think (all are MSVC tools).
