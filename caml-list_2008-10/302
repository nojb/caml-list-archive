That is the whole issue. If you work in a big project wherein everyone
can you use their own "tab length", maintaining consistent indentation
is difficult (if not impossible). As Romain Bardou pointed out, you
can even use the same editors with differing "tab length". Real messy.
And the bigger the project and the longer it needs maintenance the worse
it gets.

BTW, I believe all editors are "space based" :-)
