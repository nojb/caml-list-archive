What do you mean with this? Reason I ask is that in OcalIDE an option to
save files with spaces only, was added because it allows one to 
simultaneously edit files in various editors, each with its own tab
"length". If not, indenting is not maintained. I myself think that
avoiding tabs altogether is a good solution.
