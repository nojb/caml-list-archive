My motivation (if I tried this) would be that CygWin might be a
security risk: AFAIK processes of different users interact via the
cygwin.dll. Security implications are not clear (there is a paper from
ten years ago which says it might open up a security hole) - but it's
difficult these days to get any answer from the cygwin developer
community wether this has changed.
