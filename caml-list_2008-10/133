Unreal Tournament 2004 takes 5.3GB, I have it installed on an XFS
partition though. ;)
It's just games, not games on a microsoft platform (PS3 and Blu-Ray anyone =
?).
But I dont think you will get many students install a 2GB environment.
If they have too, they will of course but they are likely to prefer
the 200MB one. And the point is not students, cross-compilation  will
simply give better results with less troubles.

Indeed, runtime has no reason to be affected as long as it's not using
external libraries, typically -lws2_32, winsock2). The point is really
startup.
As for terminal slowness, my computer boots in 16 seconds under linux.
I recompiled my kernel yesterday and activated PRINTK_TIME/Show timing
information on printks, it gives you the time a kernel message was
emitted, related to startup. At the end of the boot, the kernel was
giving times 3 seconds better than an independent chronometer. There
had been enough things to write on the console for message to take 3
seconds to be displayed. Displaying on a terminal is slooow
everywhere, not just windows.

Also, I don't think cygwin is bad. I just think it is not the
appropriate answer for most of us. IMHO msys/mingw is a better
*approach*, however their shell implementation is bastard. They
decided to support both forward and backward slashes for instance,
this has the awful consequence of giving you "not found" errors when
using /c/gnu/msys/home/Adrien/icu\\source (personal experience). That
is however something at the msys level, not the mingw one.
