Yes, still blushing that I'd failed to check the Changes file first...

OK, so I've tried using the -nodynlink option with all calls to ocamlopt and
spotted *no* timing difference. A quick binary comparison of the EXE
produced reveals that ocamlopt -nodynlink is making ABSOLUTELY NO difference
in the resulting code.

While I can see a benefit to having native code compile for use with dynlink
by default, given the performance hit I'm seeing, wouldn't it be better in
terms of backwards compatibility if you had to specify, say, -fordynlink in
order to compile a .cmx (and, presumably more importantly, .o file) for use
with ocamlopt -shared?
