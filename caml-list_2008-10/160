Sorry - by "needed" I mean you don't need to run Cygwin's bash to use OCaml.
The final stage of my OCaml installation procedure involves copying the
required Cygwin binaries (ar.exe, as.exe, cygiconv-2.dll, cygintl-3.dll,
cygintl-8.dll, cygwin1.dll, dlltool.exe, gcc.exe and ranlib.exe) to OCaml's
bin directory at which point OCaml "uses" Cygwin but I don't have to. I
wasn't meaning that you could uninstall it after compilation...
