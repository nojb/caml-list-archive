That's actually nearly what Camelia has right now. Right now Camelia
insists on not dealing with tabs at all -- it converts them all to
spaces. This "feature" has to go obviously, and it's a few-liner to
convert between characters (which include tabs) and columns.
The editor widget in Qt has a good text document model, and
iteration/selections are implemented via a text cursor class.
It's very easy to have multiple, even overlapping selections -- they
are all handled by the editor code, pretty much transparently.

OK, I'm adding this to my feature list. I didn't even know ocamlbrowser
existed (never quite made it through the manual, I'm afraid).

It's there.

I presume you're talking about missing closing elements (parentheses etc.).
Yes, they can be automatically highlighted.

I will first release 1.90, which will be an alpha, then a few releases later
we'll have a beta, and then 2.0 ;)

I know for sure now that 1.90 release will be a single executable that can
be run from anywhere, which will make it more convenient to test.

Cheers, Kuba
