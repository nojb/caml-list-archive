In fact, I cannot really prove what I say, but MSDOS shell windows seems
to refresh less frequently, giving you a strange feeling that something
is blocked. It is not a question of being slow but SEEMING to be slow.
I mean you spend the same amount of time but you get results sooner in
linux console than in MSDOS. At the end of the process, the chronometer
is at the same time, but with MSDOS you have the feeling to have spend
more time.

I think that the refresh rate of MSDOS is over 125 ms (ergonomic limit
time to feel that something is not stalled).

+10 points, "/" and "\\" (and " " for all OS) in pathname is a big pain.
Spend many hours debugging scripts.

Another big problem: "\n" in cygwin. For example if you use 
ocamlfind ocamlc -pp "camlp4 `ocamlfind query -a-format sexplib`" 
You are in trouble, because "\r" will pops up in the resulting command
line not being interpreted by the shell as space....
