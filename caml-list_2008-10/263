PyQt may be a good thing to look at, but I don't know how easy it would be
to port PyQt to OCaml. The only language I found it easy to bind to almost
any binary API is Lisp, since it can actually execute nontrivial programs
at compilation time.

I guess the starting point would be to look at Qt's C++ API and design
an API for Qt in OCaml, and only then try to bridge the gap.

Cheers, Kuba
