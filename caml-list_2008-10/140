Dear Colleagues,

Below is a link to a call for abstracts for HFL 2009, a workshop to
be held in conjunction with ETAPS 2009 (York, UK) on the topic of
hardware design and functional languages.  A major aim of this
workshop is to open communication channels between researchers
working in these two areas and between academia and industry.  A
successful workshop, held at Intel in 2005, started the process.  HFL
2007, held before ETAPS in Braga, Portugal, was very well attended
and proved to be a great venue for the exchange of ideas and
practical experience on this topic. We are looking forward to another
exciting workshop in 2009.

We hope you will consider submitting an abstract and attending the
workshop.

Best wishes,

Andy Martin  (IBM, andy@martin-robson.com)
John O'Leary (Intel, john.w.oleary@intel.com)
