      Dear list,

 We're happy to inform you that the first alpha version of OCaml
Batteries Included has just been released. You may find the source on
the Forge [1], as well as the release notes [2],  and you can browse the
documentation online, including a detailed presentation of what OCaml
Batteries Included is all about [3].  A GODI package has also been
uploaded for OCaml 3.10 .

The list of features is a tad too long for detailing it here. Let's just
say that there are new or improved data structures, i/o, unicode ropes,
syntax extensions, primitives for invoking some of the tools of the
toolchain, etc.

It's alpha-level code, so use with caution, and not all the features we
have in mind have been implemented yet. On the other hand, any form of
feedback is greatly appreciated.

Have fun coding,
 David
