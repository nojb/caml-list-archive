IMPORTANT DATES

Submission:     8 Oct 2008, 5PM EDT (Wed)
Notification:   8 Nov 2008 (Sat)
Camera ready:   19 Nov 2008 (Wed)
TLDI'09:        24 January 2009 (Sat)



SCOPE

The role of types and proofs in all aspects of language design,
compiler construction, and software development has expanded greatly
in recent years. Type systems, type analyses, and formal deduction
have led to new concepts in compilation techniques for modern
programming languages, verification of safety and security properties
of programs, program transformation and optimization, and many other
areas. In light of this expanding role of types, the ACM SIGPLAN
Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation (TLDI'09)
follows six previous International Workshops on types in compilation
and language design (TIC'97, TIC'98, TIC'00, TLDI'03, TLDI'05, and
TLDI'07), with the hope of bringing together researchers to share new
ideas and results in this area.

Submissions for this event are invited on all interactions of types
with language design, implementation, and programming methodology.
This includes both practical applications and theoretical aspects.
TLDI'09 specifically encourages papers from a broad field of
programming language and compiler researchers, including those working
in object-oriented, dynamically-typed, late-binding, systems
programming, and mobile-code paradigms, as well as traditional
fully-static type systems. Topics of interest include:

- Typed intermediate languages and type-directed compilation 
- Type-based language support for safety and security 
- Types for interoperability 
- Type systems for system programming languages 
- Type-based program analysis, transformation, and optimization 
- Dependent types and type-based proof assistants 
- Types for security protocols, concurrency, and distributed computing 
- Type inference and type reconstruction 
- Type-based specifications of data structures and program invariants 
- Type-based memory management
- Proof-carrying code and certifying compilation

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list; papers on novel
utilizations of type information are welcome. Authors concerned about
the suitability of a topic are encouraged to inquire via electronic
mail to the program chair prior to submission.



SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Authors should submit a full paper of no more than 12 pages (including
bibliography and appendices) by Wednesday, October 8, 2008 5PM Eastern
Daylight Savings Time. The submission deadline and length limitations
are firm. Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will not be
considered.

All submissions should be in standard ACM SIGPLAN conference format:
two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline. Detailed
formatting guidelines are available on the SIGPLAN Author Information
page, along with a LaTeX class file and template:

    http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm

Papers must be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and
must be formatted for US Letter size (8.5"x11") paper. Authors for
whom this is a hardship should contact the program chair before the
deadline.

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy: 

    http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm

Submissions should contain original research not published or 
submitted for publication elsewhere.

The URL for submission will be announced closer to the deadline.
