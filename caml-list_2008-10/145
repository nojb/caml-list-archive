I have to say I am really surprised. All the cygwin installations I've
seen were terribly big, with tens of thousands of files, if not
hundreds of thousands. Would you (and/or David) mind sharing you
configuration file ? (the one created at the root of the package
cache, don't remember the name). The point is not that I don't believe
you, I just want to *know*. I guess the difference is that I also
installed other development tools and libraries

I won't prove that as I've not said *that*. You're talking about
something very specific whereas I said something much more general.
I'd like to say cygwin slowness is universally known but I'd be told
I'm not proving anything. The point is that every operation that
requires the cygwin translation layer is slow.
Of course, if you don't use anything ocaml doesn't already provide, it
won't be slow (but that wouldn't prove cygwin is not slow). Now, if
you don't need to deliver/provide/release/... an application that
specifically targets windows, I don't really get why you're running
ocaml on windows, use a real linux installation, get a virtual machine
(virtualbox is great), use ocamljava (which is great !). But anyway.

Again, ocaml is not the only application in the world, nor the *one* I
was referring to. Even though this is the ocaml mailing-list and the
topic is definitely about ocaml, there exist other things with which
ocaml has to interact.
And just for the report, you can run the ./configure scripts (they
don't give you correct results but are mostly working) and, yes, they
are slower.
