:,(

I'm searching for some tool that would help me to convert open source caml
(.ml) files to C/C++, C#, VBScript, ASP, and/or PHP.

The main reason for searching a tool that could help me to convert these .ml
files is the following:

1- I don't have the time to learn another new language.

2- I'm already doing programming in some many languages, that it gets
annoying. Just think about it. I'm doing programming in C/C++, C#, and
Visual Basic for college. Soon I will have to learn Java. I'm doing ASP,
PHP, Actionscript and Javascript for Web Design.

3- I don't have problem to learn Caml if in the future I find a company that
required me. Mind while, I would like to spend my time learning how to do
better algorithms that learning thousand of new languages.

Please let me know where I can find a program or opensource program that
could do this task. =)
