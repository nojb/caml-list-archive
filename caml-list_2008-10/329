I don't agree, people should take care of the license of the file they
use from OCaml source. You cannot link with everything inside the
source, except if you acknowledge in some way the license of this
source. 

A lot of code from the compiler is Q Public license. People should be
aware of this point.

To be short, people using GPL for their code should include the
following term: 

 As a special exception, you have permission to link this program
 with the FOO library and distribute executables, as long as you
 follow the requirements of the GNU GPL in regard to all of the
 software in the executable aside from FOO.

(when using module FOO). 

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QPL

However, I agree that embeding source of ocaml inside another project is
the worse thing you can do.
