7GB for a 900MB profile sounds about right unfortunately. The format of
spacetime profiles makes it difficult for the viewer to do much better than
that. I hope to get around to changing the format to fix this, but probably
won't until some time next year.

I would recommend trying to get a smaller profile. Taking snapshots less
often will help, as will running the program for a shorter time (even with
the same number of snapshots). Failing that try getting access to a machine
with more memory.
