Subject: Re: [Caml-list] oasis and C wrapper


Hi Kenneth,

I don't know if you have solved this problem yet, but I have a small
example of building a static C lib and statically linking with OCaml
using Oasis and OCamlbuild.

The repository is here:

https://github.com/aziem/ctypes-static-lib-ocamlbuild

and I think the most relevant example for you is under the oasis-lib
branch. This example uses ocamlbuild to do most of the work rather than
trying to get options set correctly in the _oasis file. So I use
ocamlbuild tags and a small myocamlbuild plugin and get everything built
correctly.

This example uses information from various sources, including those you
linked to in your first email, as well as information from the
OCaml-Ctypes issue tracker. The repository is mainly for my own
documentation purposes but may be of use to you.
 
Hope this helps,
Aziem
