But how does the toplevel determines types? My exception type was
perfectly declared and available in the .cmi file. Yet, before 3.12 I
got the <abstr> or similar displayed in the toplevel, and in 3.12 it
started segfaulting.

I'm simply wondering whether or not the heuristic gets triggered more
easily in 3.12 than it was before. It's just a gut feeling. Nothing I
can prove.

My segfault wasn't about comparing two exceptions using generic
comparison, but merely not being able to display it in 3.12's toplevel.

Thanks for the background info.
