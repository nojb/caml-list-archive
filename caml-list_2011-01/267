MIDLANDS GRADUATE SCHOOL
in the Foundations of Computing Science

University of Nottingham, 11-15 April 2011
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~vxc/mgs/mgs.html

The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing
Science is a collaboration between researchers at the Universities of
Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. It was established in
1999. The MGS has two main goals: to provide PhD students with a sound
basis for research in the mathematical and practical foundations of
computing and to give PhD students the opportunity to make contact with
established researchers in the field and their peers who are at a
similar stage in their research careers.
This year, the MGS is at the University of Nottingham. It will start on
11 April and finish on 15 April.

This year the school offers the following courses.

Core courses:
"Functional Programming" by Henrik Nilsson
"Category Theory" by Thorsten Altenkirch
"Typed Lambda Calculi" by Andrzej Murawski

Advanced courses:
"Coalgebra" by Paul Blain Levy
"Game Semantics and Applications" by Dan Razvan Ghica
"Game Theory, Topology and Proof Theory for Functional Programming"
  by Martín Escardó
"Process Calculi for Protocol Verification" by Eike Ritter
"Mechanized Theorem Proving" by Georg Struth

In addition there will be an invited course given by Professor Andrew M
Pitts.

We invite graduate students in computer science and related fields to
participate. Applicants from industry who want to strengthen their
theoretical background are also welcome. The deadline for registration
is 18 March 2011. More details and information on how to register are on
the school web page.
