Hello,

I will try to investigate further my example to make sure it is not
another problem. If I get
a simple repro case, I will post it.

What I was considering recently (after my second post) is the following
scenario:

t and u are two inaccessible mutually recursive values, but one is still
in the minor heap (t) while the other (u) has been promoted (if a minor
cycle just ended between the allocation of both values, this seems
possible even if unlikely). In this case, the finalisation of t and its
removal from a weak array might occur long before the finalisation of u ?

Cheers,
Christophe
