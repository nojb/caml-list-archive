Subject: [Caml-list] Lwt Patch For Tuareg 2.0.2

Hey everyone, I patched Tuareg-mode 2.0.2 to support Lwt.  Sorry it's  
2.0.2, when I did this, I didn't realize I was using an older version  
of Tuareg-mode, hopefully updating for the latest is easy enough.  I  
think I have done most of the boring work of patching, so hopefully  
someone more knowledgeable than I can fix any obvious errors I made.   
I'll continue to try to keep the mode updated though.

The patch can be found at:

https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=845&group_id=43&atid=257

The *lwt-1.patch file is the latest version.

Disclaimer:
- This is my first foray into the world of emacs-lisp, I was mostly  
semi-blindly merging changes from the 1.46 patch into this, that means  
I may have done nonsensical things.  There are undoubtedly bugs.

- I do not guarantee this works completely.  I have fixed the bugs as  
I come across them, but so far I have only used the 'lwt' syntax  
extension so I cannot guarantee it works for the rest.
