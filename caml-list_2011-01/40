Thanks, we're pretty happy it worked out so well.

On September 9, 2010, Apple dropped their restrictions on languages
used to develop iOS apps.  The press release is available here:

    http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09statement.html

The only restriction now is that your app can't download code (i.e.,
it can't be a platform).  It was a good day for us, for sure.
