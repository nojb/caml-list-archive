      <br>
      can anybody share experience with OCaml on an Blue Gene ?<br>
      <br>
      I may have the opportunity to use one here at EPFL, and I was
      wondering if somebody has already managed to compile OCaml on that
      IBM thingy.<br>
      I've been told everything is cross-compiled, so I don't expect too
      much trouble...<br>
      On the parallelization side, everything runs with MPI, so there
      too things should in principle go allright.<br>
      It should however require quite a bit of manual Makefile editing
      (they have highly customized C compilers), so I'd be glad to
      receive feedback on that.<br>
      <br>
      thanks!<br>
      <br>
      Guillaume.<br>
