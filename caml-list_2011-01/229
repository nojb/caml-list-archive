Subject: [Caml-list] Forcing gcc/ocamlopt to link against specific versions of libc.so
 and libm.so

[I think this question is more about gcc options than anything else so please don't be put off by the fact it's about FreeBSD!] 

I'm working with OCaml 3.12.0 on FreeBSD 8.1 and need to produce native binaries which are compatible with FreeBSD 6.4. I have therefore installed the compat6x package. FreeBSD 8.1 has /lib/libm.so.5 and /lib/libc.so.7 and the compat6x package gives me /usr/local/lib/compat/libm.so.4 and /usr/local/lib/compat/libc.so.6 as they're what shipped in FreeBSD 6.x

My question therefore is twofold:

1. What do I have to pass to gcc to tell it to use the older libm.so.4 and libc.so.6?
2. What's the best way to pass those instructions to OCaml's configure script?

At the moment, after running configure I've simply edited config/Makefile and put -static before -lm in NATIVECCLIBS but that's obviously producing executables which are a bit larger than I'd like (and I expect that kills native dynlink as well?)

Any help much appreciated!


David
