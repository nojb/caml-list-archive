Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Purity and lazyness

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I wouldn't classify Erlang as "pure": sending and receiving messages -- which are two of the most important primitives in Erlang -- are definitely side-effects.
Also, asynchronous error-checking, Mnesia, etc. look quite impure to me.

I also vaguely remember Simon Peyton-Jones declaring something along the lines of "The next Haskell will be strict".

Cheers,
 David
