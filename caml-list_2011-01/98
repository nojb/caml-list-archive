<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.prime/3083>

It uses seq instead of pattern matches for clarity.  But laziness
means that you could hide the side effect in any pattern match
whatsoever.

A small part of the standard library pretends that some externally
visible effects are not impure.  Other programmers follow that style.
In their code bases, you will occasionally see commits which add
additional laziness to avoid blocking on network input (when the
client will never send data because the protocol is half-duplex) or to
avoid reading too much data from disk.
