Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Webdav client library

Hi,

the search engine team at Mylife is very proud to announce the release
of a WebDAV client library for Ocaml:

http://oss.wink.com/webdav/

WebDAV allows one to access a remote filesystem via the HTTP protocol.
It is often used as easy replacement for FTP, and is e.g. built-in to
many desktop file browsers.

The library is an add-on to Ocamlnet's Http_client, and basically allows
one to submit WebDAV-specific request methods (like PROPFIND or COPY) in
addition to the core HTTP methods (like GET and PUT). There is also
support for the Netfs.stream_fs class type that was recently added to
Ocamlnet, and which models a simple filesystem. So, for example, to get
the file listing at a WebDAV server, one could write

let fs = Webdav_netfs.webdav_netfs "http://my-webdav.server.com/root"
let files = fs # readdir [] "/the/path/to/the/directory"

There are more such functions for retrieving files, uploading files, and
managing directories. Note that Ocamlnet already contains a compatible
implementation for the local filesystem, and one can also e.g. upload an
entire directory tree with something like

let local_fs = Netfs.local_fs()
Netfs.copy_into local_fs "/source/dir" fs "/remote/root"

The WebDAV implementation is complete with the omission of the locking
methods. The library also includes the XML parsers and printers that
would be needed for a WebDAV server (but does not include a server yet).

The library uses PXP for parsing and printing XML. See this file for all
requirements:

http://oss.wink.com/webdav/webdav-1.0/INSTALL

The library is included in GODI for ocaml-3.12 as package godi-webdav.

Lots of fun,

Gerd

P.S. Mylife is using this library for copying large files between
machines of their search clusters, and for accessing HDFS volumes.
