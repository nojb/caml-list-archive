Subject: [Caml-list] Native OCaml iPhone app now in iTunes Store

I'm happy to say that our iPhone app written in OCaml is now available
in the iTunes store.  It plays the classic card game Cassino, which is
actually quite fun.  But it also shows that you can use OCaml to build
native iOS apps.

You can check out the app here:

    http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cassino/id411381417?mt=8&uo=4

I posted about our OCaml-to-iOS cross compiler a while back on this
list.  It's based on OCaml 3.10.2 and uses patches from Toshiyuki Maeda
and us (Psellos).  Since I last posted about it, I've fixed at least one
bug, so if you're interested you might want to try the newest version.
I created a web page that describes how to build it, here:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/compile-to-iphone.html

It's really enjoyable to work with the power and flexibility of OCaml on
the iPhone.  OCaml offers excellent leverage for building iPhone apps,
once the lower layers are in place.

I'd be very happy to answer questions about our experiences and methods,
either on- or off-list.
