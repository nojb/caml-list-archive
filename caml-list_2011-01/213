Subject: [Caml-list] Status of OCaml in Fedora and RHEL

OCaml 3.12 has been accepted as a feature for Fedora 15.  That work
has now been finished and you can use the same packages in Fedora 14
if you like:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/OCaml3.12

Also OCaml 3.11.2 and a small selection of libraries shipped with
RHEL 6.0 last November as an unsupported component.  If you're a RHEL
subscriber you can get it from the 'Optional' channel in RHN.

Rich.
