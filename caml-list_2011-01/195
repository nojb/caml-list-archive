Subject: [Caml-list] writing some code using a function for which only the signature is
 known

Hello,

If I am writing some code, and I don't want to dive
into implementing some sub function I will need but don't
have yet, what is the standard way to do this in ocaml?

In python, there is the pass keyword, Haskell has some
keyword which I don't remember for this also.

Sorry for the dumb question maybe, I am returning to ocaml
after a too long absence. :)

Regards,
Francois.
