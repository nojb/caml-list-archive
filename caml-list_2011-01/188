You cannot define a recursive type abbreviation in Caml Light.  But you
can define a recursive concrete type:

type form = Form of textbox list * (form -> customer list -> customer list);;

This will make your code a bit more cumbersome (you'll have to add the
Form constructor in many places), but it should work.
