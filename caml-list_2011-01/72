Subject: [Caml-list] Purity and lazyness

Hi,

I have a question which though not strictly Ocaml-centric, I reckon is
not completely off-topic for this list.

In presentations by Haskellers, lazyness and purity are often portrayed as
going hand in hand.  Now, I can see why a language which is lazy by default
would also need to be pure, since side-effects would be indeed very messy 
if evaluation order is not predictable.  However, I cannot see the converse,
that is, I don't see why purity would require lazyness. 

So, my question is whether there is something I'm missing and in fact "purity 
<=> lazyness", or I am reading too much from those Haskeller presentations,
because they never meant to say anything beyond "lazyness => purity", and
freely mixing the two was just a casual oversight.

Your thoughts?
Best regards,
Dario Teixeira
