I would like to use SWIG.  That said, for the range of functions it
works for, camlidl seems to provide much cleaner bindings to C
libraries than SWIG.  If SWIG could be used to create similarly clean
bindings without requiring a syntax extension or very verbose OCaml
code then it would be much more attractive.
