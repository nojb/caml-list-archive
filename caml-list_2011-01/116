========================================================================
JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC
Special Issue on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/tkutsia/jal-wwv.html
========================================================================

SCOPE
-----
This special issue of the Journal of Applied Logic is related
to the topics of the workshop WWV'10: Automated Specification
and Verification of Web Systems, which took place in Vienna on
July 30-31, 2010. Both participants of the workshop and other
authors are invited to submit contributions.

The increased complexity of Web sites and the explosive growth
of Web-based applications has turned their design and
construction into a challenging problem. Nowadays, many
companies have diverted their Web sites into interactive,
completely-automated, Web-based applications (such as Amazon,
on-line banking, or travel agencies) with a high complexity
that requires appropriate specification and verification
techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to the
analysis and verification can address the problems of this
particular domain with automated and reliable tools that also
incorporate semantic aspects.

We solicit original papers on logic-based methods and
techniques applied to Web sites, Web services or Web-based
applications, such as:

  * Rule-based approaches to Web systems analysis, certification,
    specification, verification, and optimization
  * Algebraic methods for verification and certification of Web
    systems
  * Formal models for describing and reasoning about Web systems
  * Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems
  * Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to
    the semantic Web
  * Intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web
    specifications authoring
  * Web quality and Web metrics
  * Web usability and accessibility
  * Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications

SUBMISSION
----------
We expect original articles (typically 15-25 pages; submission
of larger papers will be evaluated depending on editorial
constraints) that present high-quality contributions that have
not been previously published and that must not be
simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submissions must comply with JAL's author guidelines. They must
be written in English and should be prepared using the Elsevier
LaTeX package.

Submissions are encouraged via the EasyChair submission system:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jalwwv2010.

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
  * Submission of papers: March 7, 2011.
  * Notification: June 6, 2011.

GUEST EDITORS
--------------
  * Laura Kovács (Vienna University of Technology)
  * Temur Kutsia (RISC, Johannes Kepler University Linz)
