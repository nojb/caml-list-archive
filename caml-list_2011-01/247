I think there are other situations (I can't remember how you can force them) where the toploop displays the "wrong" things. As I understand it, the compiler/interpreter really has to jump through hoops sometimes to display the correct version of a value because the value representation throws away so much (virtually) of the typing information.

However, this is weird since () and the constructor None are not equal in OCaml-land (they happen to have equivalent representation, but that's not the same thing):

# f () = f None;;
- : bool = true
