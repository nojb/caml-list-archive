Unless there is some other driver to keep things pure even while being 
strict.  And I would argue there is- concurrency.  Concurrency has a lot 
of similarities with laziness, in that the ordering of computations can be 
(and often is) undefined, with all the fun that entails.  Haskell is 
really good at multithreaded because it has already "paid the price" of 
dealing with asynchronous computations.
