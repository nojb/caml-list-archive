I'd say that while purity certainly does not require laziness, they are 
a natural match: purity can benefit from laziness as an alternative to 
mutability in some situations.

For instance, you cannot do memoization of unary functions like you 
would do in OCaml, using a mutable datastructure as a cache. You can 
pass this cache around or use a monad to maintain it, but using laziness 
gives a natural alternative: extend the object data structure itself 
with an extra slot to hold the result of the function to be memoized and 
you want this extra slot to be computed lazily.
