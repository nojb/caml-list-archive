The double semicolon is mostly used in the top-level. Although there is
sometimes good use of them in source files, it is bad style to include them

There are some customizations possible to make it more to your liking. See
the included custom-tuarag.el file for examples. However, I suspect you have
other issues since you should not be getting any of the errors you mention
above. Maybe try a fresh emacs install and/or a different system.
