Maybe it's too late, or it was too much wine ;)
but I don't understand waht you are talking about.


Can you be more verbose/elaborate or give an example (maybe
in Python or Haskell) on what you want to achieve?


Your subject also seems not to match the text of your mailbody...


...if you want just to write a function that fit's into
a certain signature, it can be a lot or nothing.

The signature defines the interface.
The functionality that you want to implement
can be even more complex, but what gets in and what gets out
is in the interface.

So: what do you want  to know?

(Maybe other readers understand you?)


Ciao,
   Oliver

P.S.: OK, I just looked up the "pass" command from Python.
      It seems just to be something that does nothing,
      but is sytactically needed, so the compiler does not complain.

      I OCaml, where type checking is a crucial topic,
      you can insert dummies like giving back unit ( () )
      or empty strings( "" ) or so, if you need to do that
      just to match the type.

      Or in some cases, option type can help you here.

      But, as mentioned, a question that is more concrete explaining your problem
      would be nice.

      Maybe you just can post some code you tried and did not get running?
