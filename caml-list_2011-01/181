Subject: re[Caml-list] cursive type definition camllight


I'm implementing a graphical interface in camllight on which there are forms.
I've defined a form as

type form == textbox list * (form,customer list -> customer list);;

This form displays some textboxes (using graphics library) on which the user
types the necessary data, after that, it is parsed and tailed to the
returned customer list. It is necessary that the function that does this
takes the form as a parameter. Â¿Is this possible?

Otherwise, i could do:

type form == textbox list * (field_values list,customer list -> customer
list);;

but I would like to avoid it in order to keep a clean code.

Thanks in advance for your replies.
