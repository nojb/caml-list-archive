Note that in your code the function oapply only adds constant overhead to some
function calls (and these are probably non-trivial functions).  So in any case
the result cannot be "horribly inefficient", since it's within a small constant
factor of the fully-inlined version.

The question is, will you butcher your code just because you are scared of
a _potential_ performance problem, or will you write the short, readable,
bug-free code first and then see if it really becomes a bottleneck?

Even if the inlining is definitely needed, I would start by writing and
debugging the generic version, and only then optimize it (by inlining
or otherwise).
