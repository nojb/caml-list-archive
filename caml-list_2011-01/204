Subject: Re: [Caml-list] writing some code using a function for which only the signature is known 

For anything more than toy examples, it's better to use Dmitry's solution of
a specially defined exception, because you certainly don't want the
exception to get caught before it reaches the top level, but Assert_failure
or Failure are liable to get caught if you write code with exception
handling.

This is assuming, of course, that you're not using nasty catch-all exception
handling in your code.

Mark.
