some things i've seen, maybe something about my local emacs setup sometimes?

1) if i try to indent-region i get things like Symbol's function
definition is void: tuareg-before-change-function.

2) sometimes just using tab to indent i get an error (that i can't
figure out how to reproduce right now so this is just my recollection
of the emacs error message) about how a regexp isn't matching, and the
regexp looks to me like it is looking for ocaml style comments, and no
indentation happens.

3) sometimes i don't get an error, but the indentation is just not
right to my eye, and sometimes i can fix it by e.g. selecting the
whole buffer and doing indent-region, but sometimes not. or by putting
in ";;" everywhere, like after "type x=int" lines as well as after
"let myfn x = x" definitions.

of course today vs. yesterday it is behaving better -- all in all it
feels very random to me when tuareg does/not work. maybe once a person
gets used to it all it works fine? but i think it feels kinda scary
weird slightly broken to a newbie.

sincerely,
A Newbie.
