Subject: [Caml-list] boostbind/pythonbind/luabind for ocaml?

Hi!

  Is there anything like luabind or pythonbind for Ocaml? Basically, it's
http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind/docs.html#hello-world
  a really convenient way to bind class member / functions to another language.

Thanks!

Note: Lua is written in C, not C++, and it still works fine -- as long
as there's a way / API to construct Ocaml objects in C-land. Template
magic does the rest.
