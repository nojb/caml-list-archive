Subject: Re: [Caml-list] replacing swig

Hi,

You need annotations in the code. There's just no way to guess this.
And you'd have to guess for out-parameters too, and maybe also
"ownership" (who will have to free the object), and length of arrays
(end delimiters)...


For an overview of which kind of info you want, see:
  http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection/Annotations


As you'll see, there is a project named gobject-introspection: the
annotations in comments around functions are parsed and an XML file is
created.
I started a project named "ocaml-gir" to take advantage of that and,
really didn't enjoy working with it. I've actually stopped developping
it completely: I've even emptied git HEAD so people are less likely to
use it.
Working with a bad tool outputting bad data wasn't a lot of fun.

I then started "cowboy"[1] which uses yacfe to parse source files,
simplifies its output a bit and then parses the gobject annotations to
create bindings. It's possible to do do that for non-gobject projects
too.
There should be more info in the announcement from a few months
ago[2]. I've had no time to spend on the documentation unfortunately
but if you need help/details, I'll help (although, not before
saturday).


You might also want to look at qtcaml[3]. It interfaces with gccxml
and it should also be possible to use this interface and only write an
"adapter" like you'd do with cowboy.


Whatever you do, unless you have a magic wand, you will need
annotations and a "regular" interface: it should follow a set of
standards/rules. If you have troubles remembering the interface, how
could you make a computer understand it?
Changing the interface of the project won't be possible usually but
adding annotations upstream shouldn't be a problem. It might take time
but you'll probably get help from the project members.
