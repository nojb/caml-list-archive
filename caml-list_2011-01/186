Subject: [Caml-list] menhir + ocamlbuild trouble under Windows 7

I am trying to compile a program under Windows 7 with menhir (version
20090505) and ocamlbuild (3.11.2). Menhir complains about "unknown
option `-modules parser.mly`". I am no expert for Windows and cygwin
but the same version of ocaml and menhir on MacOS and Linux does not
complain. Where should I be looking for the source of the trouble?

Actually, the program I am trying to compile under windows is here:
http://hg.andrej.com/alg (just run "make").

Also, GODI is dying on me in bootstrap stage 2. Something about
godi_console not being there. Isn't it supposed to work under Windows
7?

Thanks,

Andrej
