Ocaml is based on caml light, there are some syntactic changes, and some
additional stuff (like the object system and the modules).

If you can make abstraction of this synctactic changes, most of the C&M book
should apply as well to ocaml. Since it shows many functional programming
tricks, i gues syou could as well use it with other functional languages as
sml or even lisp based ones :)))

There surelly are many things you can help on, myself, i am planning a small
work in a landscape building sysytem, a bit like terraform, but in ocaml.

I don't really have that many time for it though, write to me if you are
interrested.
