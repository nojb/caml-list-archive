Update on the gcc 2.96 issue:

A patch is now available, along with an updated source RPM and an
updated RedHat 7.2 binary RPM, all at the usual place:
        http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html

For those who are worried about it, the purity of the OCaml source
code isn't affected: the patch simply selects gcc compilation options
(-fomit-frame-pointer) that seem to work around the bug.

As to which versions of gcc are affected: gcc 2.96 from RH 7.2 and
Mandrake 8.1 are, I'm certain that 2.95.2 is not, and believe that 3.0
isn't either, but this has to be checked carefully.

A bug report was filed with RedHat.  (The bug was already in their
database, but I added a report for good measure.)  If someone knows
how to file a bug report for Mandrake 8.1 (which seems to be affected
as well), I can provide details.

This is actually the second time that RedHat's modified gcc breaks
OCaml.  I won't engage in RedHat bashing here, since that's rather
pointless.  We'll probably deal with this issue like we did the first
time: test the gcc version in configure and issue a strongly worded
warning, telling the users to continue at their own risks.  Just
refusing to compile for gcc 2.96 would be excessive, since apparently
not all versions of 2.96 have the bug...
