List,
   I have a problem with the mutability analysis for hash-tables.
For example:
     let h = Hashtbl.create 10 ;;
creates:
     h : ('_a, '_b) Hashtbl.t
instead of:
     h ('a, 'b) Hashtbl.t

My specific hashtable contains immutable objects that can be added
and removed to the table.  The default analysis is too strict, forcing me
to use Obj.magic for coercion ('_b -> 'b). This is safe in this case,
because I know
the objects are immutable. However, in the general case, I don't see
why it is neccessary.

 Anyone cares to explain?

     Ohad.
