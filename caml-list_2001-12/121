We've been quite conservative with dynamic loading, enabling it only
on platforms where we know for sure that it works.  We'll see if the
dynamic loader in MacOS 10.1 is standard enough to be used.

It's a known issue with the PowerPC code generator in ocamlopt.
We'll work around it at some point.  Right now, just don't do "make opt.opt",
it's optional anyway.

Thanks for your feedback,
