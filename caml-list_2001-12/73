I'm not much of an OCaml expert, but I suspect that what you are trying to do 
is not possible.

Imagine that you had defined such a function, and want to call it like this:

> 	 myFunctionCall f l

What would be the type of f?  It depends on l:

If l is [],  f has type 'a

If l is [1], f has type int -> 'a

If l is [1; 2], f has type int -> int -> 'a

etc.

I don't think OCaml can properly type a function like you are describing.

Jim
