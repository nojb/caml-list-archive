I find it quite funny that *adding* an optimisation makes things work. Since
2.96 (also true for 3.0), gcc has been much better at tail-call'ing,
tail-recursion. Most of the bugs appearing in 2.96 were caused by using "-O3"
together with "-fomit-frame-pointer". The solution was to *remove*
"-fomit-frame-pointer"

For information, i've had problems with ocaml 3.02 built with -O3
-fomit-frame-pointer. -O3 works nicely.

I've not been able to reproduce under 8.1 
(taking your srpm and removing the patch)

Mandrake and Redhat have been using gcc 2.96 for quite a long time now.
Mandrake 8.0 and redhat 7.1 have it. But beware that these gcc's are heavily
patched and evolved a lot.

3.0 is not very stable. Redhat's rawhide has switched to pre-3.1 cvs version.
