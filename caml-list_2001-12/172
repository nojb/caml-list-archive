You need to look at the assembly code generated for the MD5Transform
function.  More explanations on the gcc bug, and a smaller test suite,
can be found in my bug report on RedHat's bugzilla (bug #57760).

Right.  This bug isn't in RH 7.1, and popped in RH 7.2.

> But beware that these gcc's are heavily patched and evolved a lot.

>From my point of view, they evolve from bad to worse :-)  
I miss the robust gcc 2.95.2 from RH 6.2 and Mandrake 7.2, which never
failed me.
