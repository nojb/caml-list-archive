I also need to expose caml code in a DLL.  Could you post your working thread code/event loop so that I can avoid hacking around?

Do you have any idea what will happen with windows dynamic linking behavior if two such DLLs get loaded into the same process
space?  It'd be cool if they could share runtimes, but I doubt that would be an easy or free behavior.  I'm not even sure you would
get correct separation of two runtimes for free.  I'd have to test the linker scoping behavior.
