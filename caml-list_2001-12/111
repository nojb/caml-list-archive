I am thinking that rather than building a bunch of custom GUI behavior for my application, it might be nice to have a tool which
could parse a ocaml datatype of nested variants/records, and generate a custom graphical tree/graph editor widget for it.  Then I
could get my app-specific behavior for cheap, with a UI contract that would make my style self-consistent whether I liked it or
not.  Has anyone done anything similar?
