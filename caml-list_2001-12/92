There is definitely one system wide limit of 64 thread words in NT,
and I think this is it.  In Windows 2000 this was increased to 1088
(i.e. 64 + 1024).  And yes, if your threads store local values, this
does limit the number of threads you can use.  One of our customers
ran into this, and it was very difficult to track down.  MS don't
exactly hide this limit, but it's far from obvious.
