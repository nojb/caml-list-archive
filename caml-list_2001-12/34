I have the usual kind of type error:

Values do not match:
  val send : ('a, int, 'b) t -> 'a -> int
is not included in
  val send : ('a, 'b, 'c) t -> 'a -> int

Now, this is just the tip of an iceberg that goes very deep.  Does anyone have
a tool somewhere that will print out a more complete type proof?  I could check
such a proof over to find the true mistake.

Failing such a tool, can anyone suggest some power techniques that will speed
up my type debugging?

Thanks!
