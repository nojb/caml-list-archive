Hello

I am starting now to think about building an IDE for OCaml under Win32. =
The Linux port will be done after.

Goals are :
- easy typing ( multiple-undo, syntax highlight, [auto indent], modes, =
search/replace tools, etc... )
- highly customizable ( custom keys and menus, configurations scripts =
written in ocaml )
- extensible ( modes in ocaml )
- written in ocaml ( with some C/C++ dll for Win32 User Interface - no =
GTK )
Targeted audience are windows developers.

This is a round-table, i would like to collect as much ideas / opinions =
before starting the project.

I have already seen EFuncs and Cameleon in the Hump, Efuncs is a little =
too much "emacs-like" and Cameleon seems to be far more than an editor. =
Does anyone have heard about other projects ?
