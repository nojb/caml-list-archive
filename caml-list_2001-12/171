I want to write a function which I can use to determine the
maximum length of a field in a database query so I want to build
a list of fieldnames and their lengths.  

I found it a lot more difficult to build such a list
than would be the case in python which I know better.

I am trying to figure out how ocaml would handle this but got
stuck with the following code. The compiler complains about a
syntax error in the line after the last line of code.
I apologize if it a stupid question, but I can not figure out
why.

-------------------------------------------------------------
let lys1 = ["a";"b";"c"]

type rek = { naam : string; lengte : int }

let rec bourekordlys lys nuwelys = 
  match lys with 
      [] -> nuwelys
    | h::t -> let rekord = {naam = h; lengte = 0}  in
              let l = List.append nuwelys [rekord] in 
              bourekordlys t l;;
   
let l = [];;

let ll = bourekordlys lys1 l in
  let lm = [] in
  let rec veranderde_lys ll lm =  
    match ll with   
      [] -> lm
     | h::t ->  let n = h.naam in 
                let lg = h.lengte + 5 in 
                let lz = List.append lm [{naam=n;lengte=lg}];
                  veranderde_lys t lz
---------------------------------------------------------

What is wrong here?
