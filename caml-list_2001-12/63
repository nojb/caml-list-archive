The best thing in software/hardware, it is free & "technology-independent" just like my
body/soul/brain.

actually, if i don't need your help, it's the very pleasure/happiness to me.
but i dont need your help. i am stand alone.
now(19??~2001),i don't think computer seriously. 
computer is not more serious than liveness/eating/breathing/sleeping. 

if we help together for Right-thing. it also good, but the fear(try for un-free-things) is BAD.

after 4~5 days, we download vault, just like win95/win98/win2000.
anyway, humanity is devil.  
http://research.microsoft.com/vault/

computer is $ ware. computer do people think computer-way.
naked..
but i am not naked, i wear cloth that other ppl MADE.
i want my own hardware/software, i do not want /com-pu-ter/(their $, their ego, their destroy,
their silly fame, their stupidity ).......
