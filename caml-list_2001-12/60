It is just an exception to the GPL.

Here it is (from gcc-3.0.1/gcc/libgcc2.c):
GNU CC is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)
any later version.

In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
Free Software Foundation gives you unlimited permission to link the
compiled version of this file into combinations with other programs,
and to distribute those combinations without any restriction coming
from the use of this file.  (The General Public License restrictions
do apply in other respects; for example, they cover modification of
the file, and distribution when not linked into a combine
executable.)

This clause is often known as "modified GPL", and allows in fact more
than the LGPL.
But it looks like we made a different choice for ocaml, applying a
similar clause to the LGPL rather than the GPL. It avoids to have to
prove to everybody that the "modified GPL" is liberal enough...
Also, I wonder whether you can relicense under LGPL code released under
"modified GPL"? The wording does not say so, but the constraints are
similar.
