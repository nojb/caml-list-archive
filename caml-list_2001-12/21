A final release of Ensemble is now ready. This release includes several
interesting libraries for Caml:
1. Cryptographic library interfacing with OpenSSL.
2. A socket library using winsock2 and scatter-gather on Linux, with support for raw
    C iovectors.
3. A merge tool allowing packaging of Caml libraries.

All proprietry dependecy generation and build tools have been discarded. This
has two benefits: (1) The license can be BSD-type  (2) it is easy to cut-and-paste
complete files and libraries.

I now have to start working on some "serious" projects, and I no longer have the
time to develop the system. I'll keep maintaining it though.

As usual the system is available from: www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble.

  All the best,
     Ohad.

   considerably reduced.
2. Cleanup up and updated INSTALL.htm.
