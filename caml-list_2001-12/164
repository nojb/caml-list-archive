But i remember something similar about gcc 2.7.x or at least one of them that
didn't work well with ocaml back then (96-97 time frame i think). There was
just a small test in the configure script and if it detected a not working
gcc, there was a notice of problems with it and it just stopped.

You may very well be able to say the same thing in a more milder way, and it
would not cause any kind of problem, i think.
