Hello
I got some problems passing a callback function value to a DLL, which will
call the caml function when some event occurs.
In fact, to use the callback_exn C API function, I have to link with the
libcamlrun library, but that's not why I want to do because an interpreter
 ocamlrun ) is already running.

Here's a proposal to resolve such a problem :
a DLL should have an EntryPoint ( called CamlEntryPoint for exemple ) and
when it's first load by the run-time system, it call the DLL EntryPoint
function, passing both cprims and names_of_cprims arrays as parameters. Then
we only have to add a "caml" callback func (useless in caml !) to enable DLL
callback.

I don't know how LabTk works... I'll have a look at it.
