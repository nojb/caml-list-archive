It doesn't "take" 90 M properly speaking.  The 90 M figure is what
"ps" reports.

... and probably of any program that uses Open GL on your machine.

Exactly.  The X server, as well as programs that access the hardware
3D acceleration of your video card (and that is presumably the case
with Open GL programs) map the video RAM in their own memory space,
often two or three times (don't ask me why).  With a modern video
card, that means a lot of memory space.  But it's not memory that your
program "takes", properly speaking, just accesses to shared resources.

(The same goes, to some extent, for the shared libraries used by your
program.)

To understand how much memory your program really occupies, it
helps to have a close look at /proc/<pid>/maps.
