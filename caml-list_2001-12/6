Ah, well... you have found the Achilles' heel of the situation... In all
likelihood, after all is said and done, that maintenance programmer will
probably continue to be me. So at the very least I will have translated all
that C/C++ gobledygook into something a bit more comprehensible for the next
time I have to look at it. I can simplify the coding by 6x, but the overall
architecture and data structure concepts are still well beyond what most
"maintenance" programmers would be able to comprehend.

Of course, I have the never ending uphill battle against the sea off (K&R) C
programmers around me. They haven't yet embraced C++ (just to mention how
far behind they are, not that they ought to), and Perl is the brave new
world for many. You can bet there will be a hew and cry when I mention
either of OCaml or Lisp...

Cheers,
