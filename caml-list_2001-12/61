hi,

i'm learning OCaml (coming from a professional C/C++, Java background,
with a little bit of elisp and scheme (read SICP)), and own a copy of
Cousineau & Mauny's book (O'Reilly's Objective Caml is on the way). i
would really appreciate your advice on the following topics:

- C&M uses Caml (light?): is it worth reading while learning OCaml? do
  you know of any comparison of the two languages i should read if
  using C&M?

- my ultimate goal is using OCaml for real, useful projects: any idea
  about specially needed/useful applications in OCaml i could help on?

- any suggestion/recommendation/roadmap for my journey learning OCaml?

as i said before, your comments would be highly appreciated. 

thanks,

--
