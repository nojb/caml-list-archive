> Has anyone tried running OCaml on an iPAQ, either with PocketPC or Linux?

When I was at INRIA earlier this year, I tried on a local iPAQ
(with a cross-compiler ocaml[c|opt]) and on the skiffcluster iPAQs'
cluster (by compiling ocaml natively). All those machines where under
linux.

Natively (i.e. on the skiffcluster), if you have a gcc, there is
apparently no problem. I was able to compile and run my ocaml program
(until a bug appeared :).

Regarding cross-compilation, I failed to build an ocaml cross-compiler
(Xavier is aware of it ;-). However, I don't know if the issue is in
ocaml itself or more probably in a buggy cross-gcc I tried to
produce. If you need more info on steps to generate a cross-ocaml, look
at posts in this mailing list from Xavier (Leroy) and myself (I was
david.mentre@inria.fr). 

Hope it helps,
Best regards,
d.
