Subject: [Caml-list] partial function application perfomance
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk

Hi all camlers,

I've being doing some benchmarks, and one of my tests
measures partial function application perfomance. I was
surprised by results: 20+ times slower than a full
function application. I expected a greater time but 20 
times is a lot more ... I've checked my program and
seems ok, indeed the results were correct. Is this
overhead normal to partial function applications?

Best regards.
Arturo
