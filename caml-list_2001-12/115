everyone--

So I upgraded my development environment from 3.0.2 to 3.0.4 last 
night.  (Congratulations to the Caml team!)

I noticed a few things that might be of interest to people using Mac OS 
X 10.1:

+ You still have to ignore the build failures around labltk-- no 
surprise there.  I suppose there is a workaround for this if you're 
willing to install XFree86, but I don't need one so I haven't looked for 
it.  All the other tools build and install fine.

+ I tried to build ocamldoc-pre3 without success.  Apparently the 
ocamldoc build tree relies on successful completion of 'make world' and, 
since you don't get past the labltk build on a stock OS X box, that 
won't work.  (I'm not sure what to do about this problem...)

+ The interactive runtime reports that dynamic loading isn't supported 
on this platform.  Given the way the Darwin team was mucking with the 
mechanism for loading dynamic libraries in OS X while 3.0.4 was in 
development, I'm not surprised.  (My understanding is that it should be 
pretty stable with 10.1 and beyond.)

+ The opt.opt make target in ocaml-3.0.4 encounters a mysterious failure 
with camlp4.  If no one on the Caml team has seen it, I'll happily help 
track it down.

Again, my congratulations to the Caml team for kicking some serious tail.
