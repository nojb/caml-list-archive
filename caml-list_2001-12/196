It works fine for me with the normal caml-mode.  (I should know,
because I wrote it :)  Admittedly, this is still 3.01.

I guess what you see is a "minor incompatibility" with Tuareg.  I
don't think the ocaml maintainers can be bothered documenting how a
contributed piece of Emacs code that isn't part of the distribution
works.  I think you have to take this up with Tuareg's author.
