I am trying to make an ocaml toplevel to include both the
lablgtk and postgres libraries, but get the following error:
---------------------------------------------------
$ocamlfind ocamlmktop -labels -o postgres_top -I
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/lablgtk -linkpkg -package postgres
lablgtk.cma
/tmp/ccm3CpWy.o(.data+0x7b4): undefined reference to
`ml_gtk_adjustment_set_bc'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Error while building custom runtime system
-----------------------------------------------------

I got the same error when I tried to combine the two libraries
in a program.  What is causing this problem?  I know my lack of
knowledge is probably the main cause, but maybe someone can give
me a clue on how to solve the problem and explain my mistake to
me.

Regards.

Johann.
