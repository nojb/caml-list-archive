Stupid students :) They don't know what's good :)

I'll too enjoy to discuss on this subject, because i've work a little on it.
My technology is called XObjects and is a way to create and init C++ Classes
Instances from an XML Document. I'm done with the Core and it works great.
Now you got an API so that you can write your own XObjects and dynamicly
link them.
... but i don't know if it's the better place to talk about that !
