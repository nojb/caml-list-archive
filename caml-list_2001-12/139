Ensemble is a flexible message transport system written in Caml and
developed
by Cornell University, Hebrew University, and IBM research.

Ensemble version 1.34 is ready. It includes the following improvements:
  1. Added zero-copy to WIN32, and complete scatter-gather support.
  2. Ported the native C-interface to WIN32.
  3. Port to ocaml-3.04.

Ensemble is a system that although written in ML, is faster than previous
system written in C. To allow writing C applications, it is wrapped up
inside
an object-library that is linkable with any C application. Through
management
of IO vectors in C memory space, performance of C and ML applications is
identical.

The system is available from:
     www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble.
