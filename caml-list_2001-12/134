Take a look at the following OCaml class type definition:

class type foo =
  object
    method bar: [ `A | `B ] 
  end

I want to be able to relax the type of bar so that it can return any variant 
tag, rather than being limited to `A or `B.

Is this possible?  I tried

class type foo =
  object
    method bar: [> ] 
  end

but this is rejected on the grounds that

The method bar has type [> ] where .. is unbound

Any suggestions?

Regards,
Jim
