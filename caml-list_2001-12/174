Hello
I got some problems compiling under Windows and VC6 :
- for win32unix, the include path declared in config/Makefile.nt as =
SYSTEM_INCLUDES should be a copy of INCLUDE environment variable, =
defined by VCVARS32.bat. I needed to set it to the good path.
- problems building camlp4 : it seems that the $(MAKE) is switching to =
standard GCC "make", which is in the "program files\gcc\bin" directory =
on my system ( I know that spaces in paths are not a good idea, but..... =
). So we got that :

    cd ../camlp4; c:/program files/gcc/bin/make.exe OTOP=3D../../.. =
CAMLP4=3D../meta/camlp4r.exe .....
c:/program : not found

so I have to replace $(MAKE) by only 'make' because I didn't find where =
does that MAKE come from ( under Win32, filespath should be put between =
quotation marks ( "c:/program files/gcc/bin/make.exe" ).

---

Using the generated ml files ( opcodes, parser, config, etc... ), I =
managed to build the byterun system under VC6 using CamlMake.
