Hi,

Has anyone tried running OCaml on an iPAQ, either with PocketPC or Linux?
To some degree, I guess there should not be a problem, since the processor
is a StrongARM, which is supported by OCaml, and 64MB should be enough.
However, I'll be ahppy to hear if someone had experience with it.

Thanks

Roy
