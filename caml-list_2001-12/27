I am not a member of the ocaml team also, nor the participants of
discussion you saw, but since I am planning to distribute something
under LGPL, how LGPL is interpreted is my concern.  So I would like to
add a point to Sven's summary.  (Sorry, I guess you are very busy, but
you may be concerned with interpretation of LGPL too.)

Many of the discussion you saw, is, it seems for me, related to
alleged ambiguity of the statement "provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications" in the beginning of the
section 6. of LGPL.  People are afraid that, in the end, this clause
forces developer to provide the source of their "work that uses the
Library", or something making reverse engineering easy (like unstriped
executable.)

How IBM lawyers think about this problem, is reported in

May I ask you to clarify this problem?  Is it FAQ?
