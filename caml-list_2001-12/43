If David McClain encapsulated his Caml code in a Win32 DLL the way I
expect he did, each such DLL comes with its own copy of the Caml
runtime system, allocates its own Caml heap, and doesn't share
anything with any other Caml-encapsulated DLL.  On the surface, this
might look a bit wasteful in resources, but it sure makes things
easier and more robust.
