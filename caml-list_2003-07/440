I suppose this is the 1 character difference :-)
Programmers are lazy.
I've been advocating using "let () =" for a while now, and I am of
course using it myself.

By the way, there is a reason "let _ =" produces no warning: this is
the only way to do a partial application without warning.
"expr; ..." and even "ignore (expr); ..." will produce a warning.

By the way, I'm always disabling the s warning ("should be unit"), to
avoid being tempted by using "let _ = expr in " when I want to ignore
the result of a fully applied expression which does not return unit.
I know ignore does it, but I'm lazy too.
