Among library writers, findlib's pretty ubiquitous. Almost everything I've
looked at either requires it or at lesat supports it via providing a META
file.

A findlib-based setup that downloads packages from a mirror, unpacks,
installs dependencies if needed, builds, and installs the package wouldn't
be too difficult to write. It'll just take someone to sit down and /do/ it.

Given a choice between having quick-and-dirty working code and code that
works the 'right' way, the latter's better, of course. But when the choice
is between working code and seeing 20 people never ever get past arguing
what the right way it should be done is (Which seems to be what happens
every time someone mentions an ocaml version of CPAN), I'll take something
that works.
