Hello,

Are you interested in gettext ? I have write a bind to gettext function
+ a patch to xgettext for extracting string. The package is not mature
enough to be submited, but i will give it in one or two month. But i
need beta tester...

If you or any other people on the list are intersted....

Sylvain LE GALL

ps : if you have any hint about having a solution without Obj.magic for
the format4, i take it. 
pps : in fact i am trying to build something with camlp4 and  <" ">
string, but i do it without any reference... If someone, has any idea.
