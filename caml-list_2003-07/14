The native-code OCaml compiler has only one code generator for the
whole IA32 family.  This code generator is called "i386" for
historical reasons, but it is not particulary optimized for the Intel
386 processor.  Actually, the generated code is targeted for efficient
execution on the PPro-PII-PIII family, and appears to fit the Athlon
quite well too.  The next release will include a few P4-specific
tricks that do not decrease performance on other processors.

> can anyone help me in optimizing source for athlon ??

No :-)  Quite frankly, given the subset of the IA32 instruction set
that OCaml generates, I can't see any Athlon-specific optimizations
that would be worth doing.
