I thought I'd just stick in my own props for the Ocaml MPI bindings.  I
had an ~11k line ocaml program which I ported to MPI.  It only required
500 or so more lines of code to MPI-ify it (with minor restructuring so
these parts could be separated out).

It now runs on our supercomputer (56th faster computer in the world,
according to top500.org) on anywhere from 10 to 170 nodes (IBM
Netfinity Cluster P4 Xeon 2 GHz - Myrinet/ 512), and performs incredibly
well.

I am *very* happing with these bindings and would like to formally thank
Xavier for writing them :).

Best of luck.
