Hi Xavier,

Thanks for the help. "dllgraphics.dll" was in lib/ as well as lib/stublibs. 
The problem was that the version in lib/ was an old one. Copying all the 
dll*.dll files from lib/stublibs into lib/ solves the problem as far as I 
can tell.

Should I formally report this as a problem with the native Win32 
distribution or is reporting the problem on this list sufficient.

Cheers

David
