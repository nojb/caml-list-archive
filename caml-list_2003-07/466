I agree completely here. I think it would be great to have some automatic=20

like this it would be easier to make people like me (i.e. newbies) look for=

Personally, in my experience with CPAN IMHO what is needed most for shippin=
g=20
code is some code that generates a tarball of all the prerequisites needed=
=20
for a given package of code, together with an idiot-proof makefile. Most=20
people I work with do not like the -MCPAN (it can make problems if you're n=
ot=20
root, you have to answer many questions, there are firewalls), so I cannot=
=20
send them simple scripts that use the CPAN module for downloading the usefu=
l=20
stuff, I have to do the actual tarballs myself.

Oh, for this I am too newbyish

=2E..sounds great to a newbie like me...
