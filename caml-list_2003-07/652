Hi list,

In the past days I have worked on GODI, an experimental source-based
O'Caml distribution, and I think it is now worth a try.

You can get the current bootstrap tarball here:

http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/godi-bootstrap-20030730.tar.gz

Currently, GODI is based on 3.06, but I will switch to 3.07beta the next
days (and drop a message, if so).

It has been tested on Linux and Solaris.

Read the README file, it contains further instructions (and is currently
the only source of documentation).

Gerd

------------------------------------------------------------
README
------------------------------------------------------------

GODI is an experimental distribution of the Objective Caml language
as packages that can be automatically built from their sources. GODI
does not include pre-compiled binaries, but it is possible to create
them, even in packaged form.

GODI is derived from the NetBSD pkgsrc system (which is derived from
the FreeBSD port system), and has a similar way of dealing with
sources, although not everything is identical.

Basically, GODI is a framework to download, compile, install, and
package O'Caml software. This software is not included in GODI, but
GODI knows from which Internet sites it can be downloaded. To do so,
GODI provides small archives with build instructions, the build.tgz
archives. These instructions (basically Makefiles) are dynamically
added to the GODI framework, and extend it with the information needed
to deal with a certain piece of software.

After the software has been installed, it is always archived as
so-called binary packages. The binary packages can be easily
transferred to other computers with the same operating system, where
they can be added to the local GODI installations without having to
rebuild them again.

GODI knows about software dependencies, and automatically builds
prerequisites first. Furthermore, GODI can upgrade hierarchies of
dependent libraries by rebuilding the libraries in the right order.
