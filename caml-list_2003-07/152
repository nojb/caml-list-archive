I was looking into this too. There is no wxWindows binding for OCaml that I 
know of, but a while ago someone suggested using Swig to auto-generate it. I 
do not know how good such an interface would be, but Swig works with OCaml, 
and it was already used to make wxWindows interfaces in a bunch of other 
languages.

P.S. Isn't it possible for the mailing list software to hash recent messages 
and disallow identical ones?
