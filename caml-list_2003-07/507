I use Debian and I am happy, thank you very much, but that's good enough
for me. I guess RedHat/Suse/Mandrake users think similarly, and windows
users... get what they pay for, sorry.

Packaging is off-topic. The on-topic problem is module naming. If I want
to use two packages in my program, but both have a module called Stuff,
I have a problem. Current workarounds:

1) Use -pack to wrap all package1 modules under Package1, and all package2
   modules under Package2. Problem: -pack uses a cmo instead of a cma. So,
   many unnecessary modules might be linked into my program. This affects
   compilation time and size, but it should not affect run time.

2) Manually rename some modules. Problem: Each time I upgrade, I have to
   do the renaming again. Time-consuming.

The on-topic question is: Is there something better that the OCaml developers
could provide without taking them too much effort? User-only solutions are
not going to make it.
