Hi all,
I want to write a quotation to produce and assignment.
So far I was only able to produce a variable assigment,
but, of course, that's not what I want...

my attempt looks like:

<:str_item<$lid:"foo" := $str:"bar"$ >>

and the expected result should be
let _ = foo := "bar"

but I get

let _ = foo <- "bar"
and "Unbound instance variable foo"

what's the right syntax ?

tnx,
p
