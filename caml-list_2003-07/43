Why? Its a design error. Fix your design.

There's never any need for a singleton object,

because there is no resource for which there
cannot be more than one. I have seen (C++) designs
using singletons and they create an utter mess
because someone wrongly assumed something was
unique.

If you want one object, define the class in your
mainline, create it, and then coerce it to
a shared class type which does not provide a constructor.
