I got the file synchronizer Unison to work with lablgtk on OS X, but
only with X11 gtk.  There's a port of gtk to the native graphics
system (http://gtk-osx.sf.net/), but it had some problems: lablgtk has
a method for extracting the X11 window id from the gtk window struct,
which I had to stub out so lablgtk would build, but even then I just
got a lot of gtk error messages and a crashed program for trying to
use Unison with it.  (At that point I gave up and used the X11 gtk
rather than investigating further.)

Well, it compiles, but I haven't tried using it yet...
