I agree, but I still think packaging is off-topic for the Ocaml list. It has
nothing specific to the Ocaml language or the ocaml compilers/interpreters.
The real problem is managing module namespace, independently of how files are
organized.

We should be looking for solutions under our control. Developers might
refuse (and rightly so) to rename their modules, and then we are stuck.

I have two suggestions for the Ocaml developers:

1) Make -pack use cma instead of cmo
2) Add an -alias option to the compiler (and an #alias to the interpreter)
   so that modules in the cmi/cmo files use the alias name instead of the
   file name.
