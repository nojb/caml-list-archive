Hi Gerd,

Haskell people have been working on hierarchical libraries for some time and I 
think they've come up with a really meaningful organization. It makes much 
more sense than an alphabetical list of 100 libraries.

You don't need some kind of authority to manage the hierarchy either. It's a 
self-organizing system :)

Cheers,
