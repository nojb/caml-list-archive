Dear Caml-list,

I'm pleased to announce the first public release of CDuce, a new
strongly typed higher-order functional programming language for XML
documents with an efficient type-based runtime implementation.  The
distribution can be downloaded at:

   http://www.cduce.org/download.html

More information can be found at:

   http://www.cduce.org/

And you can directly try CDuce with a web browser using the online
prototype at:

   http://www.cduce.org/cgi-bin/cduce

CDuce is fast, functional, type-safe, and conforms to basic standards:
Unicode, XML, DTD, Namespaces are handled, partial support of XML
Schema validation is in alpha testing (and undocumented) while queries
are being implemented.

The OCaml community could be interested in CDuce because:

- CDuce syntax is reminiscient of ML languages (but CDuce has a
  completely different type system, with subtyping and intersection,
  union, negation types, and also a different type-based
  semantics with overloaded functions and pattern matching on types);

- CDuce is written in OCaml;

- Our research plans include the development of a CDuce <-> OCaml
  interface, to allow extending CDuce with OCaml and
  using CDuce for the XML part of OCaml applications.



This is the first beta version. All your comments, suggestions, and
bug reports are welcome. Please send all of them to info@cduce.org

Thanks in advance,

  Alain Frisch, on behalf of the CDuce team.
