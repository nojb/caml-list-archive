€.02 here: there's a couple of stuff that a CPAN-like website could do
  1) hosting libs
  2) cross-referencing & automatic dependency generation
  3) registry (the business of ensuring non-collision)

It seems to me that the sites you mention only provide hosting among these
three points. Which is still interesting.

I would think that coding 2) is just a matter of motivation. ocamldep and
camlp4 should help.

As for the last point... well, one possible drawback of current O'CaML is
its module namespace. My fear is that module names are soon enough going to
look like JoesXMLParser to distinguish it from MikesXMLParser (betting on
the success of the initiative here). Well, actually there can be modules
within modules, so that's not exactly a flat module namespace. But if
someone makes a module called Joe.XMLParser, it has got to be defined in
joe.ml[i], which is in my opinion a pretty bad name to give to a file
containing an XML parser. Maybe java-like module namespace partition is
something worth considering for efficient community management?

Why not use savana.gnu.org or ftp.gnu.org or sourceforge.net ?  Then
you'd have the
added benefit that people who don't know about OCaml would be more
likely to find
out about your project.  It would tend to help OCaml's popularity.
