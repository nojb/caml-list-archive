Did anyone read my proposal to allow submodules to be compiled in
separate files?  I didn't see any feedback. Perhaps it was so confusing
that nobody understood it.

There are several other languages/compilers that use a technique like
this.  It probably can be done with very minor changes to the language
(probably no syntax change, just adding the semantics of modules in
separate files).  GHC implements it one way, whereas GNAT implements it
a different way.  I think discussing it could point to a clean
implementation.

The advantage is that there is nothing new added to the language.  I can
place my library as sub-modules of another module, and yet have them as
separate files.

I also disagree that the namespace problem is a minor issue.  I think it
will be a hindrance to use of Ocaml for moderate to large projects.
