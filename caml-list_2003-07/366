Well, it's the usual scenario: someone somewhere who is subscribed to
the list misconfigured their mail filtering and end up re-sending
everything to the list.  It's easy to spot who does that by looking at
the "Received" headers of the duplicate messages.  (This time, the
problem is at ENS Lyon.)  As usual, the offerenders were unsubscribed
from the list.  I also added a procmail recipe to (I hope) avoid
this.  We'll see if it works.
