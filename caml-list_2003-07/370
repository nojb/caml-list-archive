Development seems pretty active. Most of the good stuff happens on
caml-list and ocaml-lib-devel mailing lists. Extension libraries are
documented here: http://caml.inria.fr/humps/ . Another good place to
look is LWN.net which publishes Alan Schmitt's useful "Caml Weekly
News". The latest one available to non-subscribers is:

I've actually been playing with Gtk + OCaml + Windows and it works
quite well, and the look and feel is closer to native than I expected.
Other alternatives are labltk (based on Tk) or the native Win32 API
(version 0.02 however, so perhaps not very stable or reliable? - can
anyone comment?). There is no WxWindows port AFAIK, which is a shame.

I should add a section on available GUIs, since I'm researching this
at the moment.
