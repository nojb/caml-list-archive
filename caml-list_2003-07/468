Another important point would be:

4) A standard packaging and build process.

For example, you can download any Perl package and type:

	perl Makefile.PL && make && sudo make install

You can use Perl's CPAN module to download, compile and install the
dependent packages with one command. It all works automatically
because all Perl packages follow a few fairly simple rules.

I agree this is a problem, but a Java-like module namespace is about
the worst possible solution. Perl has many thousands of packages but
does not require it. Mostly this is because of an informal honour
system: no one names their package "CGI" unless it is absolutely the
best system for writing CGI scripts. Little-used or still-born
packages can also be kicked out of the archive.
