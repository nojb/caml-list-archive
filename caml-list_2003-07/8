There may  be another solution  to your problem  if you are  fine with
running bytecode only:  you can build your program on  top of an ocaml
toplevel (with ocamlmktop) and  then use Topdirs.dir_use (the function
which realizes #use in the toplevel) to interpret your ocaml scripts.

Hope this helps,
