Oh? Then what would you call this (contents of COPYING, from the MLgraph
source distribution)?



                       MLgraph version 2.1
    
                       License for free use
                       September 1st, 1997.
    
    MLgraph version 2.1 is free software. It is not public domain -- We
    retain copyright to all source code -- but it is free, and you have
    license to use it as you desire. This includes utilizing it as a
    complete system, adapting it to your purposes, building new
    applications using and incorporating it, etc. These things and more
    you can do free of charge.
    
    Also, note that MLgraph version 2.1 comes with ABSOLUTELY NO
    WARRANTY. Because it is free, and made available for your use with
    no compensation due, we cannot warrant it to be suitable to any
    purpose, to be free of defects, or to comply with any standard, etc.
    
    Given that, we hope you can enjoy and utilize it.

This is obviously not very rigorous in a legal sense, but it looks like
an open source license to me. If you have reason to believe otherwise,
could you please explain?
