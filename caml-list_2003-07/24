To make this a bit more consistent, wouldn't it be better to restrict the 
occurrence of private to signatures? It is currently allowed in structs too. 
Is there a case where it is useful outside of a signature?

There was a similar idea that was proposed a while ago about providing 
an immutable view of mutable objects, which is also appealing. Any progress 
with that one?
