Yes! OCaml works really well out of the box on my Debian GNU/Linux
machines, but it's a world of pain on Windows.

A binary mingw distribution including common packages (lablgtk!)
would help here.

It's possible to create compound widgets, although it's not simple and
obvious how to do it. There's a bit in my tutorial about doing
this. For creating an actual new widget I would be tempted to use a
drawing area as the basis. Not perhaps the most pure approach, but
fairly easy as the drawing area exposes all the events you need.

Camlimages wraps freetype, but obviously this is not cross-platform.
