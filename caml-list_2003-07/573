Applying this patch works for me.

I ran into only two problems making my current project compile and work 
against the new beta1 version of ocaml-3.07:

+ The word 'parser' is a keyword again.  So I had to change the names 
of a class and some values to not conflict.

+ The ocamlmklib now makes dynamic libraries on Mac OS X, and that 
means I had to fix my build-and-install recipe to handle that fact.  
Figuring it out was a little tricky.  The error message "Error on 
dynamically loaded library: cannot access this bundle" is a little 
cryptic.  I had to change the source code to tell me which library 
before I could understand why its image wasn't being mapped.  I wasn't 
copying dllfoo.so into its location next to libfoo.a, and fixing that 
made everything better.

By the way, HUGE PHAT PROPS to the Caml Team for some of the new 
language features, not to mention the dynamic linking love for Mac OS 
X.  I'm excited.  I'm specifically excited about the polymorphic 
generalization of covariant parts of expansive expressions.  Believe it 
or not.  I think it might simplify some of my code dramatically.
