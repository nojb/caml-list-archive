And it does fit, mine works fine, extremely fine. But... why not put
some cflags possibilities in it, so that one can enhance the performance
of his compiler on certain kinds of architecture..

yes, any processor specific optimization would be worth doing in my
opinion. I am not an ocaml expert, far from this...!! All I wanted was a
working compiler, I now have it, but every time I install a new soft on
my machine, i want it to run fast as a shark. 

Even Linux kernel is achitecture optimized, so why not ocaml ?

note: this is just a suggestion, don't take it badly.
