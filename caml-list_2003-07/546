                       ESSLLI 2003

            15th European Summer School in Logic,
                  Language and Information

                    August 18-29, Vienna

                http://www.logic.at/esslli03/


Each year the European Association for Logic, Language and Information,
(FoLLi) organizes a European Summer School (ESSLLI) the main focus of
which is the interface between linguistics, logic and computation.
Courses at foundational, introductory and advanced level are given,
the aim of which is to provide for researchers and postgraduate as well
as advanced master students the possibility to familiarize themselves
with other areas of research, and to enable students and researchers to
acquire more specialized knowledge about topics they are already familiar
with. The school also features several workshops, and a student session
in which Master and PhD students can present their work.

This year the 15th ESSLLI Summer School will take place at the Technical
University of Vienna, the beautiful and cultural capital of Austria.

During two weeks 43 courses will be given. They cover a wide variety of
topics within the combined areas of interest: Language and Logic, Language
and Computation, and Logic and Computation. There will be a series of
invited lectures, and several workshops with open calls for papers.
