It is pointless to consider this UNTIL there Ocaml team
themselves decide on a packaging model.

This means some way of, for example, having
a heirarchical naming model without the top
level having to be a file containing all
the others.

It means some way of finding package and components,
and some way of installing them which doesn't require
either clobbering the main distribution or adding
a path component for every installed package.

I'm sure the team is aware of these issues, there has
been a lot of pressure to solve the problem. However thankfully
they seem not inclined to give a premature solution:
once there is a standard solution we'll all be stuck
with it for a long time.
