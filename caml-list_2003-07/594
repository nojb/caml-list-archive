Hello,

Being used to a forum, I find that a mailing-list is a poor and =
unattractive way, if not a frustrating way, to communicate. One can post =
only text, no graphics. Yet sometimes graphics can be very useful (for =
screenshots or concepts, for example).

Moreover, the Ocaml community is split de facto by the mailing-list =
system and the different sources that spread in different places. Many =
beginners won't bother posting in this mailing-list because it is mainly =
used by advanced users. So one has had to create another place for =
beginners, Yahoo Ocaml_beginners. This obliges me, for instance, to set =
up an account on this list AND on Yahoo, not mentioning =
fr.comp.lang.caml and comp.lang.ml newsgroups.=20

Not only this is unconvenient, it multiplies the chances of being =
spammed.

Why not create a real forum dedicated to Ocaml development with a =
framework like phpBB (under GPL), for example ? It would gather all the =
Caml users in a single place, which would make the Caml community =
stronger, more active and therefore more attractive.=20

A forum like phpBB allows many more ways of communicating than a simple =
mailing-list :

 - one can create an unlimited number of parallel forums (one for the =
advanced users of this mailing-list , one for the beginners, several for =
projects, for example).=20
Access can be controlled.=20
Forums can be moderated or not.=20
Posts can be categorized in predefined topics

- one can create groups of users, with or without access control.

- one can do all sorts of searches, full-text, or any combination of =
author, date, forum, topic, etc.

- customized look and feel.

phpBB includes chat rooms, for discussing technical matters in real =
time.

Good examples of what can be done with the phpBB forum is here :

 - phpBB website : http://www.phpbb.com/features.php
 - phpBB forum, with nearly 75,000 registered members (!): =
http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/

 - a large french home-cinema and hi-fi forum with over 15,000 members =
and 790,000 messages, which makes this place the single most important =
source of information on this topic in France. Because it is =
comprehensive and active, it attracts professionnals as well as the =
large public, and it is read on a regular basis by consumer electronics =
journalists  : http://www.homecinema-fr.com/forum/
