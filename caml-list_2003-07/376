Thank you for your interest in CDuce !

The point is that CDuce programs are statically type-checked. At "compile
time", there is no way to be sure that the result of load_xml will have
type ABC (load_xml operates at runtime), hence the type error. A possible
way to do what you want is:

let abc =
  match load_xml "abc.xml" with
    | x & ABC -> x
    | _ -> raise "Invalid input file !"

The pattern (x & ABC) succeeds when the argument of the pattern matching
(the loaded XML document) has type ABC, and it binds it to x.

No particular reason. A "cp cduce /usr/local/bin" should do the stuff.


I suggest to keep strictly CDuce related discussions out of the Caml-list.
Interested people can send me an email to join the CDuce users mailing
list.
