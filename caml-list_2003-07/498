Such a standard ensure no safety.

A naming schema should be used for all modules whose interfaces are used
in the final objects against which link to.

Camlimages itself is a good example of this property _not_ enforced
because it is named "camlimages", exports a lot of modules prefixed by
"ci_" but internally uses an "Image" module which MD5 sum is present in
all "ci_" modules.

An "image" module is shipped also by labltk which obviously, being a
different piece of software, has a different MD5 sum and can't be linked
along with camlimages.

A naming schema should be enforced not only for the toplevel library
modules, but for all modules being part of it.

Cheers.
