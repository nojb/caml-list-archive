SPARC/Solaris and MIPS/IRIX are well supported, SPARC perhaps a bit better.
The POWER/AIX port of OCaml isn't really supported because I don't
have such a machine at hand.  (And also because AIX is a pain.)

You do not need to cross-compile: just build the OCaml distribution on
the target machine, and compile your program on the target machine as well.

OCaml threads do not exploit shared-memory multiprocessing --
basically, all threads interleave their execution, hence multiple
processors are not exploited.  Your best bet is MPI or PVM.  Both have
bindings for OCaml.

Hope this helps,
