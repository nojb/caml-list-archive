If you know in advance what you want to load, you can also load it by
passing it as an argument to the toplevel, e.g.:

  $ ocaml qux.cmo

I prefer this approach because it cuts down on the characters I have to
retype when I make errors (Note to OCaml team: can we *please* get some
kind of history-editing functionality in the toplevel? I know there are
licensing and portability issues with GNU readline, but what about the
getline library used by OCaml2?)

This approach is also handy if you want to quickly check your syntax:

  $ ocaml my_new_module.ml

This doesn't give you an interactive shell, so it's different from
  
  $ ocaml
  # #use "my_new_module.ml";;

But it will tell you if there are errors in your code.
