ICFP, the International Conference on Functional Programming, is coming up
soon -- August 25-29, in Uppsala, Sweden. The following "Call for
Participation" has the important bits, but here is the key thing you
need to know if you are thinking of attending this year:

	       ** Early registration ends tomorrow, July 30. **

Most hotels will close out their guaranteed reservations by tomorrow, as
well.

I also append the complete program of talks. 

See you in Sweden...

Call for Participation
ICFP 2003: ACM International Conference on Functional Programming
August 25-29, 2003
Uppsala, Sweden

* About ICFP
------------
The goal of ICFP is to
  - stimulate and promote international research on functional programming, and
  - act as focal point to bring together the functional-programming
    community for intellectual cross-pollination and collaboration.

The scope of the conference includes all languages that encourage programming
with functions, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as
well as languages that support objects and concurrency. The topics covered
range from principles to practice, from foundations to features, and from
abstractions to applications.

The conference is affiliated with PLI, a confederation of international
meetings sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, which this year will also include
  - PPDP (International Conference on Principles and Practice of 
    Declarative Programming)
  - LOPSTR (International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis 
    and Transformation)
  - Haskell Workshop
  - Erlang Workshop
  - MERLIN (Mechanised Reasoning About Languages with Variable Binding)
  - DPCOOL (Declarative Programming in the Context of Object-oriented 
    Languages) 

* Useful URLs

  - Main web page for the entire PLI meeting; contains information on accepted
    papers, registration, accomodation, and social events:

* Registration now open
-----------------------
Registration is now open and the early registration deadline is July 30th.
NOTE: The cut-off date for guaranteed hotel reservations varies
with the hotel and is typically *before* July 30th. It is advisable to
make your hotel reservations soon.
