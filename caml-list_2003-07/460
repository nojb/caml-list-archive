Definitely relevant idea. Cf.
http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200303/msg00422.html ("Our shrinking humps").
I've just actually discovered this article on the list, where my library for
I/O of PNM files is cited. This library disappeared from the Internet the
day I graduated. An archive would be all the more relevant as I don't think
I'm the only
student-turned-professional-maker-of-animated-PowerPoint-slideshows who
unfortunately doesn't have too much time to spend on programming and
supporting open source packages anymore.

As of now, I don't have the resource to host a page with this library which
is very small, very easy to write but also very, very boring to make.
Typically the thing you wish someone had done before you. Sure enough, I
ould probably set up a page on some free provider in one afternoon. But
since I can't commit to any resource beyond one week for dealing with
problems, I think it would be stupid to start putting it back online when I
don't have a plan for maintenance.

By the way, if anyone wants to maintain this PNM io library, I can probably
fish it out from my old back-ups. Also, if anyone wants to maintain a funny
camlp4 "french" binding where the keywords and syntax are changed to match
French keywords and syntax instead of English... it used to be on my
webpage.

Best regards,
Benoit.

Objet : [Caml-list] CTAN/CPAN for Caml (COCAN ...?)


I wonder if anyone is interested (or opposed) to creating a true
parallel with CPAN for OCaml code?

Going beyond the Caml Humps this would provide a central place for
storing and downloading Caml libraries, and a place to register
library names, provide search and so on.

Comments?

Rich.
