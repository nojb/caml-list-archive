The current version is only fixing some little bugs but will need further
modifications in order to get the same "look" under Win32 API and GTK,
that's why it has not been released yet and will only be release at the same
time as Osiris-GTK . As for components support, only the basics ones
(already included in Osiris) will be included.

I have no plans for adding such a component.
Actually the GDI (for drawing operations) is not yet interfaced under the
Win32 API , and this would require quite a big work.
