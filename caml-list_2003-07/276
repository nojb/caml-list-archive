Hi all,
I've a problem that I feel can be solved with two lines of makefile...

my program uses dynlink to load on the fly byte-code. This .cmo are
small programs that use a library and have depencies betwwen them.

I'm also using ocamlmakefile and I've the feeling that this problem has
already been solved by Markus Mottl in it.

to cut it short: give a list of files, say:
SMALLSOURCE= a.ml b.ml c.ml d.ml

I want to have a generic entry in my makefile that builds all cmo and
cmi files (following the dependency list).

I'd like to write something like:
$(SMALLSOURCE): $(OCAMLDEP) $(CAMLP$OPT) $@  # build the dep list
	$(OCAMLC) $(CAMLP$OPT) -c $@   # compile the module using camlp4

in the end I'd like to compile the main program and library once (make
all) and having a call for ever module (make a b c ...) that builds the
module and all its dependency.

... this is not a really ocaml related problem, but I hope somebody can
still help me...
