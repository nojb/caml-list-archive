Are you sure you have clean up your browser cache since then ? :-)
More seriously : no, ocaml development is not stopped, and a 3.07 will be
released... soon (?).

If you look at the Caml Hump you'll see the last libraries that have been
released.

Actually under Windows there is the OCaml Win32 API which is pretty much
low-level for programming GUIs , so I wrote Osiris which is a simple
framework for using GUIs with OCaml. Right know Osiris is only working using
native Win32 components, but a port of Osiris under LablGTK is on the way.
As soon it's done, the community will have a cross-platform gui simple
toolkit available.

An old version of Osiris is available at http://tech.motion-twin.com
