I would be interested to follow the discussion. DLL/Dynamic linking is
currently one of the main problem we have in Galax.

Our (surprisingly ambitious) goal was to to wrap Caml code transparently
behind a C/C++/Java API. The Java part requires dynamic linking. Here
were our results so far:

 (1) Things worked ok on Linux and on most other Unix-gcc based systems
we tried, although finding the right compiler flags was sometime tricky
(why on earth is the '-mimpure-text' needed under Solaris?).

 (2) It took us more than two weeks to get some dynamic linking going
with the MinGW port of Caml, and it only worked so far with the bytecode
runtime. I'm still trying to figure out what goes wrong for the
nativecode. I was starting to think we should try with the VC++ port,
but the current discussion seems to indicate its another big mess.

 (3) Dynamic linking does not work under MacOS X.

Any chance of things improving in the near future? My dream would be
some kind of compilation magic to wrap Caml inside a C dynamic library,
but improvements on (2) and (3) above would already be a big help.

Thanks,
- Jerome Simeon
