&gt; This is not totally academic. I have come across the exact bug I<br>
&gt; describe. It was painful.<br>
[...]<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me guess where the problem might be came from:<br>
<br>
When i think of code that uses a value<br>
 =A01_000_000<br>
 =A0and you want to change it to a value ten times higher,<br>
 =A0it should be =A0changed to<br>
 =A010_000_000<br>
<br>
<br>
Coming from notation that does NOT allow &quot;_&quot; in tzhe numbers,<br>
it could be done by just adding one &quot;0&quot; at the end of the value:<=
br>
<br>
 =A01000000<br>
becomes<br>
 =A010000000<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 ^<br>
<br>
with the &quot;0&quot; added at the end.<br>
<br>
But also correct (&quot;more correct&quot; would be:<br>
<br>
 =A01000000<br>
becomes<br>
 =A010000000<br>
 =A0 ^<br>
<br>
&quot;0&quot; added at the millions.<br>
<br>
 =A0&quot;Just add one &quot;0&quot; at the end&quot;<br>
<br>
Is the edit-habit, which works fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
But when allowing &quot;_&quot; inside numbers,<br>
but people don&#39;t change the &quot;wrong&quot; editing behaviour,<br>
then allowing the &quot;_&quot; at all means introducing a new kind<br>
of possible errors.<br>
<br>
This could be an argument to throw &quot;_&quot; at all,<br>
because adding a &quot;0&quot; after the &quot;1&quot; instead of just<br>
adding a &quot;0&quot; at the end is rarely used behaviour of editing,<br>
and some people might call it &quot;weird&quot;. ;-)<br>
<br>
So this argument also could be used to disallow &quot;_&quot; at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
But no, thats not what I want to argue for ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, let&#39;s stop that discussion now.<br>
<br>
If someone thinks the three-digit-distance-&quot;_&quot; is a feature that =
makes sense,<br>
a feature wish could be added for OCaml. ;-)<br>
