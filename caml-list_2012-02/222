Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] OCamlnet-3.5.1

There is a patch release available, 3.5.1, fixing a few errors, mostly
build-related:

- Missing symbols on FreeBSD-9
- Missing symbols on Debian Wheezy (probably because of stricter 
  linking)
- posix_spawn is disabled on Mac (for the time being until the problem
  can be further tracked down)
- Mac OS does not like fchmod on shared memory
