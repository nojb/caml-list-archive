Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Latest OCaml + Libraries on CentOS

If you use centos 6.2 you will find many source packages from the latest fedora
are compatible using 'rpmbuild --rebuild package.src.rpm', followed by yum
install of the resulting binary. If you get the version of fedora package with
a matching libc version it is sometimes possible to install the binary from
fedora directly. Other distributions which are rpm based can be used as sources
as well, however sometimes the package options and selections are quite
different and dependencies are problematic.

The benefit of rpmbuild over building the sources directly is that flags etc
are built-in, you know it worked for some previous user, and the prerequisites
for building are identified for you, instead of getting a mysterious build
failure later on.
