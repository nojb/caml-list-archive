====================================================================

                       First Call for Papers

                             FACS 2012

                    9th International Symposium
                Formal Aspects of Component Software

             http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/facs12/

             Mountain View, USA, September 12-14, 2012

====================================================================

* Scope *

The component-based software development approach has emerged as a
promising paradigm to cope with the complexity of present-day software
systems by bringing sound engineering principles into software
engineering. However, many challenging conceptual and technological
issues still remain in component-based software development theory and
practice. Moreover, the advent of service-oriented computing has
brought to the fore new dimensions, such as quality of service and
robustness to withstand inevitable faults, that require revisiting
established component-based concepts in order to meet the new
requirements of the service-oriented paradigm.

FACS 2012 is concerned with how formal methods can be used to make
component-based and service-oriented software development
succeed. Formal methods have provided a foundation for component-based
software by successfully addressing challenging issues such as
mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, or
rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and
certification.


* Topics of interest *

The symposium seeks to address the applications of formal methods in
all aspects of software components and services. Specific topics
include, but are not limited to:

    * formal models for software components and their interaction

    * formal aspects of services, service oriented architectures,
      business processes, and cloud computing

    * design and verification methods for software components and
      services

    * composition and deployment: models, calculi, languages

    * formal methods and modeling languages for components and
      services

    * model based and GUI based testing of components and services

    * models for QoS and other extra-functional properties (e.g.,
      trust, compliance, security) of components and services

    * components for real-time, safety-critical, secure, and/or
      embedded systems

    * industrial or experience reports, and case studies

    * update and reconfiguration of component and service
      architectures

    * component systems evolution and maintenance

    * autonomic components and self-managed applications

    * formal and rigorous approaches to software adaptation and
      self-adaptive systems


* Submissions *

We solicit high-quality submissions reporting on (as related to topics
mentioned above):

    * A - original research contributions (18 pages max, LNCS format);

    * B - applications and experiences (18 pages max, LNCS format);

    * C - surveys, comparisons, and state-of-the-art reports (18 pages
      max, LNCS format);

    * D - tool papers (6 pages max, LNCS format);

In addition, we also solicit submissions to the Doctoral Track of FACS
2012, in the form of abstracts (2 pages, LNCS format) concisely
capturing PhD-work-in-progress, related theme, context, research
questions, envisaged contributions, and partial results.

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted
concurrently for publication elsewhere. Papers should be formatted
according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers (more information
for LNCS authors).

Paper submission will be done electronically via Easychair:
https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=facs12

All accepted papers will appear in the pre-proceedings of FACS
2012. Revised versions of accepted papers in the categories A-D above
will appear in the post-proceedings of the symposium that will be
published as a volume in the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series.

The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to
submit extended versions of their papers to appear in a special issue
of the Science of Computer Programming journal.


* Important Dates *

Paper submission: 	June 15, 2012
Notification: 		July 27, 2012
Final version due: 	August 13, 2012
