Subject: [Caml-list] FMCAD'12: Preliminary Call For Papers

FMCAD 2012 - FORMAL METHODS IN COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS
International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design
http://www.fmcad.org
Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK, October 22 - 25, 2012

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract Submission: May 9

Paper Submission: May 20

Author Notification: July 13

Final Version: August 10

Conference: October 22 - 25


CONFERENCE SCOPE

FMCAD 2012 is the twelfth in a series of conferences on the theory and application of formal methods in hardware and system design and verification. FMCAD provides a leading international forum to researchers and practitioners in academia and industry for presenting and discussing novel methods, technologies, theoretical results, and tools for formal reasoning about computing systems, as well as open challenges therein.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Advances in model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and reduction techniques, compositional methods, automatic decision procedures at the bit- and word-level, probabilistic methods, and combinations of deductive methods and decision procedures.
Topics related to the application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software. This includes timing and power modeling, and verification of computing systems on all levels of abstraction.
System-level design and verification, especially for embedded systems, HW/SW co-design and verification, and transaction-level verification.
Modeling and specification languages, formal semantics of known languages or their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and transformation, and correct-by-construction methods.
Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to industrial-scale designs. Tools that represent formal verification enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation of formal methods.
Application of formal methods in new areas.


SUBMISSIONS

Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair. More details will be provided soon on the FMCAD web site.
The proceedings will be freely available from the FMCAD Web site. We expect to have ACM In-Cooperation Status and IEEE Technical Co-Sponsorship, as has been the case with previous FMCAD conferences. FMCAD and authors will share the copyright for accepted papers and we plan on publishing the proceedings in the ACM Digital Library and in IEEE Xplore.
Two categories of papers can be submitted: regular papers (8 pages), containing original research; and short papers (4 pages), containing emerging results, practical experiences or original ideas that can be described succinctly.
Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size, see http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html. We recommend that self-citations be written in the third person. Submissions must contain original research that has not been previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial overlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their data so that results can be independently verified.
A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a distinguished paper award.


ASSOCIATED EVENTS

The Hardware Model Checking Competition 2012 (HWMCC2012) will take place during FMCAD 2012.
