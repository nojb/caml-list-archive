Subject: Re: [Caml-list] state of native dynlink on os x

Hi Alan,
> Following a suggestion by Daniel Bünzli, I used the minimum example from http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5093 then I can see that native dynlink does work.
> 
> However two questions remain. I get `ld: warning: -read_only_relocs cannot be used with x86_64` each time I link natively. Does this mean I should reopen http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4863 (the patch there is applied to my version of caml)?

Which version of Mac OS X, which version of OCaml, and what is the output of configure?

> Also, when running why3, I get some undefined symbols (_camlRandom, _camlParsing, _camlString). Where are these symbols defined?

Looks like modules of the standard library, right ?
