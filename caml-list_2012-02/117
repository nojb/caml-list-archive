We delegate documentation production to the standard ocamldoc tool,
which doesn't have this feature, so that is not really in the game
zone of batteries developers. That said, it *could* be possible to
make that feature available without changing ocamldoc upstream, by
implementing it as a custom documentation formatter -- ocamldoc has a
flexible architecture in this regard.
   http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual029.html#toc120

Xavier Clerc has some experience tuning ocamldoc (
http://argot.x9c.fr/ ), maybe he could comment on the feasibility of
this. You could ask on the caml-list, maybe cc-ing him. If you wished
to have a try at it directly, looking at how Argot is implemented
would be a good source of inspiration.

(There used to be a custom documentation generator for Batteries, but
afaik. we mostly ditched it because, while it was nice, it made
documentation generation time impossibly slow...)
