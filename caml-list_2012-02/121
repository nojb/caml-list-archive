Subject: [Caml-list] state of native dynlink on os x

Hello,

As I'm using more and more programs that use native dynlink, I'm trying 
to understand what is the state of things on os x. According to this 
message http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/2008.10.21.html natdynlink does 
not work on 10.5 and above. However, if I read correctly this patch 
http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4863 it is enabled for 64 bits 
architectures. As the patch is in godi, I built a version of ocaml with 
it, and I'm having mixed results.

For some very simple files, things seem to work fine. But if I compile 
why3 with it (current git version), I get some errors when running 
why3config:

== Found /usr/local/lib/why3/plugins/genequlin.cmxs ==
The plugin /usr/local/lib/why3/plugins/genequlin.cmxs dynlink failed :

Note that there was a warning when compiling why3:
ld: warning: -read_only_relocs cannot be used with x86_64

So I'm a bit confused as to the current state of things. My questions 
are:

- is native dynlink on os x 64 bits architecture supported in ocaml 
3.13dev?
- if so, why do I get the ld warning and why does linking fails 
sometimes?
- if not, is there hope it will be supported in the future?

Thanks a lot,

Alan
