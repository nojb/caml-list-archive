Before you start writing a total new custom formatter (which probably
breaks with every major OCaml version because of new syntactic elements),
consider to extend/override the standard formatter. I did that quite
successfully for the PXP documentation. The derived formatter is here:

https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-pxp/trunk/tools/src/odoc/chtml.ml

(Note that for current OCaml you need to remove the "{" from the matched
strings in html_of_custom_text.)

When I developed this, I found the documentation in the OCaml manual as
insufficient. You really need to dive into the sources of ocamldoc,
especially odoc_html.ml (which is lengthy but easy to get). I guess for
the effect you want you have to override
create_fully_qualified_{module_}idents_links. The location of a definition
in the source code seems to be in deed available, in the m_loc.loc_impl
values that are stored with the records for the various syntactic
elements. Don't know whether it is easy to do, though.
