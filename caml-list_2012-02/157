It allows to execute code at syntactic analysis phase and, therefore,
to do syntactic extensions without having to previously compile a file,
containing these extensions.

I am not very satisfied of it, because the evaluation supposes to type
expressions, or to try to type them, what, normally, Camlp* are not
supposed to do. It is complicated, incomplete and perhaps dangerous.
To be correct, it should embark the OCaml toplevel and, therefore, the
whole OCaml compiler, what is not a good idea.

I tried to limit it to evaluation of syntax extensions but it remains
complicated. Probably we should define a precise sub-language for it.

I am afraid it is.
