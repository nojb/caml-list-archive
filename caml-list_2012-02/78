Subject: [Caml-list] Package installation assumptions made by odb

odb is a simple ocaml program to install ocaml packages with 
dependencies.  I've written a document on the assumptions it makes of 
the packages it's to install.  By sharing this, I hope to influence 
library and application developers to use a standard interface for 
compiling their program.

The details are here: 
https://github.com/thelema/odb/blob/master/guidelines.md

Thank you for any feedback.  Please bear in mind that odb is meant to be 
simple, so the complexity of configuring, building and installing any 
packages is expected to be in that package's build system, and not odb 
itself.

E.
