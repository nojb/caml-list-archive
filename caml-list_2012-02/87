Hello,

I agree with Arnaud: although this behavior is simple to implement and 
understand (which is good) I see several cases where it would be a 
problem. For instance, I'm currently working on a suite of tools named 
like foo-feature1, foo-feature2, foo-feature3 and so on. The package 
would obviously be named foo, but it does not make sense to have a 
single "foo" executable. It does not make sense to have once package per 
executable either. So I guess you need some way to override this 
behavior when needed. Can odb extract this kind of information from an 
_oasis file, or from a META file? I'm not very familiar with those.

Regarding Melt, I'm a bit confused: you say in this mail that "its odb
package name could be melt or melt-build, depending on which part of
melt should be used to detect its installation". But in your guidelines 
it is written: "Programs that are both should do both". By the way, Melt 
actually installs two libraries: Melt and Latex.

Regarding the version number, if you need to define a standard I think 
it would be good if this standard was to call the executable with the 
"-version" option. It is, after all, the behavior of "ocamlc". This does 
not work for libraries though; here there are several possibilities:
- compute a hash of the .cma / .cmxa, but you need a database of 
hashtables -> version;
- dynamically link with the .cma / .cmxa, assuming a module "Version" 
with a variable containing the version (but this is not very practical 
for many reasons).

My 2 cents,
