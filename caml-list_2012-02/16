Subject: [Caml-list] Compiling Cryptokit on Windows

Hi list,


There has been some discussion during the last few months were some 
argued that there was not enough Windows users to test libraries. Well 
it happens that I need to compile Cryptokit for Windows. Here are my 
first results, which failed miserably. I'm using OCaml 3.12.


1) With Cryptokit 1.5.

INSTALL.txt states that I need findlib. I installed OCaml from:
	http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/
And it seems that ocamlfind is not installed by this tool. After more 
search I read here:
	http://www.camlcity.org/archive/programming/findlib.html
that "Volunteers are still wanted who port findlib to Windows and 
Macintosh."

So I guess that every OASIS project needs findlib, but findlib does not 
work on Windows, so all OASIS projects will not be usable on Windows? I 
thought on the contrary that OASIS was a step towards unification?

I tried anyway without findlib, running:
	ocaml setup.ml -configure
I get this error: "'c:\Program' n'est pas reconnu en tant que commande 
interne" (i.e. "unrecognized internal command"). The command which is 
supposed to be run is:
	c:\Program Files\OCaml\bin\ocamlc.opt.EXE -config > somefile.txt
It just misses quotes, which seems kind of silly.


2) With Cryptokit 1.3.

So I gave up and tried an older version whose INSTALL file explains how 
to install on Windows.

I checked variables in Makefile.win and ran:
	make -f Makefile.win
Now the error I get is that gcc cannot find "C:\Program 
Files\OCaml\lib/ocamlrun.a", which actually does not exist, so this is 
not a surprise. This file "ocamlrun.a" does not exist either on my 
Debian computer, so I'm a little surprised here.


I think I'll try cross-compiling now, or maybe editing "setup.ml" to put 
quotes around the command.

Cheers,
