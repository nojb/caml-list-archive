Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Some utilities about camlp4

I had trouble being sure what "meta filter" you were talking about.
Here's what I found out, in case other people on the list wondered the
same: the "meta" part of Camlp4 is about turning a value into a piece
of OCaml AST representing the syntax of this value. The "meta" filter
is a kind of type-conv plugin -- anterior to type-conv -- that reads
the declarations of algebraic datatypes and adds declarations for
functions doing that "meta" work on this datatype, taking values at
this type and returning pieces of Camlp4 AST.

If I understand correctly, here is the change you did -- maybe you
should put this information in a README somewhere:
instead of reading the type declarations in the whole file being
filtered, you only read those contained in a so-called "trash module",
whose name is configurable by the user (default Camlp4Trash). You then
produce declarations for metafunctions on demand, as in the old code,
but you *do not* reproduce the content of the "trash module" -- the
type declarations.

Are there other notable differences between the two implementations?
You said that the upstream one is "buggy", what kind of bugs did you
encounter? It could be interesting to fix them upstream.

It looks like you are doing this new implementation to be able to have
the meta-functions defined in a different module than the original
type declaration. What are the advantages of doing this? Could you
tell us a bit more about your initial motivations?
