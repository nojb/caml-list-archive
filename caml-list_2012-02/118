Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Fwd: Re: [Batteries-devel] browsing the code while
 reading the doc

Hello,

If you provide the .ml files to ocamldoc and use the -keep-code option,
generated html pages will give a link on each value to display the
corresponding code.

Another solution would be to adapt the odoc_literate custom generator you
can find here:
  https://gitorious.org/ocamldoc-generators
This generator provide an expand/collpase button for each value, useful when
writing doc in a literate programming way.

At last, since Dynlink now allows loading native code, ocamldoc now
supports loading custom generators compiled to native code, which may be
fast enough to use the batteries legacy generator.

Hope this helps,

Maxence
