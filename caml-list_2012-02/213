It would be, but i don't have normal office-type graphics, what i have
is aforementioned 10+ years old radeon in a powerpc macmini and NV94 in
the rarely used x86_64 box, the ???? (aka ???) is an Intel card (as
stated bellow) from a friends laptop. Building is very easy actually if
you just do 'sh buildall.sh', you will need OCaml,GCC,sh,wget and unzip.
