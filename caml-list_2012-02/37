This is not totally academic. I have come across the exact bug I

Allowing underscores is definitely better than not allowing them, since 
it makes code clearer. I'd rather put up with the possibility of these 
bugs than remove the feature altogether. But seeing as we can remove the 
option for these bugs with a pretty easy-going syntax restriction, why 
not? (There is no such analogous restriction that would make comments 
more accurate.)

That being said, I do agree with the general sentiment that too many 
bytes have been wasted on this thread. I'll try to extricate myself from 
the debate and get on with something useful :)
