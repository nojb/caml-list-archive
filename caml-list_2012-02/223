Subject: [Caml-list] rgba/bgra in LablGL

Hi

My app uses LablGL (with ocamlSDL), in linux.

when I ported it to mac OS, I noticed that when loading images and 
displaying them as textures, the Red and Blue bytes were swapped.

The OpenGL doc says that one can specify RGBA or BGRA when loading textures.
However LablGL only has `rgba.

Hence I patched lablGL to add the `bgra <--> GL_BGRA tag, and it works 
as expected.

Can this be included in the official lablGL ? Or is there a reason not to ?

San
