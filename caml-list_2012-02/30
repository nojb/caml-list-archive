I would actually prefer a slightly more constrained format. It is very 
easy to typo large numbers like:

   let ten_million = 10_000_0000 in

When eyeballing this, it is extremely easy to mistake this as 10^7, when 
it actual fact it is 10^8.

I would prefer a syntax rule that only allows underscore every three 
characters (starting at the RHS of the number, i.e. complying to the 
usual convention). Well, certainly that for decimal literals. For hex 
literals you probably want to enforce the same, but every four characters.
