Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Ocamlnet-3.5

Hi,

it is time for another version of Ocamlnet. The new release 3.5 focuses on
the system interface, and includes a long list of smaller improvements.

The system interface, Netsys_posix, is extended by:
 - Support for POSIX clocks and POSIX timers (with nanosecond resolution)
 - Netsys_posix.spawn usses now the posix_spawn call if present on the OS
 - Adding support for pollable events (as e.g. provided by Linux via
   eventfd). For other OS an emulation is available.
 - Support for epoll on Linux

Note that Netsys_posix covers now large parts of POSIX realtime.

Other improvements:

 - The code generator for XDR has been improved. A new switch -direct for
   ocamlrpcgen can be used to generate direct mappings between OCaml values
   and binary representation (in many cases). Speedups up to 50% are
   possible for large XDR values.
 - The new module Uq_mt allows it to access an event-driven resource from
   several kernel threads (e.g. use an RPC client commonly from several
   threads).
 - The thread-safety of Netplex container functions has been improved.
 - Netmulticore condition variables can now be polled, for better
   integration into event-based programs.
 - Option greedy_accepts for Netplex to support servers that accept
   many connections per second. With this improvement, Netplex can
   now accept more than 5000 connections/s, and assign them to worker
   processes.

Last but not least there is now a new tutorial for Equeue (event systems
and engines). In particular, the section about combining Ocamlnet with Lwt
might be interesting.

For the full list of changes (especially bug fixes), see:
