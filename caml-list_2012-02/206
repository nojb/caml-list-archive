Hi list,

An update on this: I successfully compiled LablGTK with OCaml 3.12 / 
MinGW and my application runs (almost) fine.

There was one thing which confused me: in LablGTK's README.Win32 file, 
it says to go at http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net; but these do not 
work, at least with LablGTK 2.14.2. I tried to tweak some environment 
variables so that the headers were found, but then it failed to link due 
to some symbol missing. I guess it's due to the version of GTK there 
being 2.12?

I had to use the "Bundle" from 
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.14/, which works fine.

Cheers,
