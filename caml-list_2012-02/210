Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Release - A multi-process daemon framework

Hello

I've just created the Release repository on Github:

  https://github.com/andrenth/release

From the README:

  Release is a multi-process Lwt-enabled daemon framework for
  OCaml, providing facilities for type-safe inter-process
  communication and privilege-dropping.

  Its goal is to make it easy to write servers that are
  released from the calling terminal and to release root
  privileges when those are not necessary.

This is not yet a stable release and I'm still working on some features,
but any feedback would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Andre
