Subject: Re: [Caml-list] state of native dynlink on os x

Hello,

Following a suggestion by Daniel BÃ¼nzli, I used the minimum example 
from http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5093 then I can see that 
native dynlink does work.

However two questions remain. I get `ld: warning: -read_only_relocs 
cannot be used with x86_64` each time I link natively. Does this mean I 
should reopen http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4863 (the patch 
there is applied to my version of caml)?

Also, when running why3, I get some undefined symbols (_camlRandom, 
_camlParsing, _camlString). Where are these symbols defined?

Thanks,

Alan
