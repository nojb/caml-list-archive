Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] TypeRex release 1.0.0 candidate 1

Hi everyone,

We are pleased to announce the first release candidate of TypeRex, a new
OCaml development environment, developed by OCamlPro and Inria Saclay.
This version of TypeRex only integrates with Emacs and brings a
collection of new features that programmers expect from a modern IDE.
Next versions will target more editors.

Downloads, screenshots, documentation, support and feedback
instructions are available on TypeRex website at:

http://www.typerex.org/

Summary of TypeRex features:

    * Improved syntax coloring
    * Auto-completion of identifiers (experimental)
    * Browsing of identifiers: show type and comment, go to definition,
      cycle between alternate definitions, and semantic grep;
    * Strictly semantic-preserving, local and whole-program refactoring:
          o renaming identifiers and compilation units
          o open elimination and reference simplification
    * Robust /w.r.t./ not-recompiled, possibly unsaved buffers
    * Scalable (used regularly on a few hundreds of source files)

Auto-completion is disabled by default, since more testing is still
needed for this feature.

TypeRex is written in OCaml, communicating through a socket with the
OCaml mode of the editor (currently Tuareg for Emacs, OCAIDE for Eclipse
soon).

All the features of the Tuareg mode are also included, even when we
provide an equivalent for them.

Beta testers, enjoy!
