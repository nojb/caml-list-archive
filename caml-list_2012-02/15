CALL FOR PAPERS/PRESENTATIONS TFPIE 2012
International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Education 2012
June 11 2012
University of St Andrews, Scotland
http://www.cs.ru.nl/P.Achten/TFPIE_2012/TFPIE_2012_home.html


The first International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Education, TFPIE 2012, will be co-located with TFP 2012 at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, professors, teachers, and all professionals that use or are interested in the use of functional programming in education. TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas, and work in progress on the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for publication after the workshop.

The program chairs of TFPIE 2012 will screen submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of interest to participants. Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or an article (up to 16 pages). The authors of all accepted presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the workshop's website/wiki. Any visitors to the TFPIE 2012 website/wiki will be able to add comments. This includes presenters who may respond to comments and questions as well as provide pointers to improvements and follow-up work. After the workshop, the program committee will review, using prevailing academic standards, the articles accepted for presentation to select the best for publication in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and all extended abstracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

TFPIE 2012 welcomes submissions describing practical techniques used in the classroom, tools used and/or developed, and any creative use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

FP and beginning CS students
FP in Artificial Intelligence
FP in Robotics
FP and Music
Advanced FP for undergraduates
FP in graduate education
Engaging students in research using FP

Venue

The University of St Andrews is Scotland's first university and the third oldest in the English-speaking world, founded in 1413. Over six centuries it has established a reputation as one of Europe's leading and most distinctive centers for teaching and research. St Andrews is situated on the east coast of Fife, Scotland, UK. The town is approximately 50 miles north-east of Edinburgh, 14 miles south-east of Dundee, 78 miles south of Aberdeen, and 82 miles east of Glasgow making it easily accessible by any means of transportation.
