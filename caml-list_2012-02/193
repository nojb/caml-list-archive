Subject: [Caml-list] "Modules Matter Most"

Hello,


this article I like.
I also have experienced, that thinking in types
(or: thinking in signatures) give a big advantage
on planning a program, and later implementing it.

Types make things very clear: you know what is input
and what output and how things need to fit tigether,
and what kind of signature is needed to maybe fill
a gap between an input and an output module... just look
at the missing link as a signature.

Thie article also mentiones modules as a key point
of OCaml, and I fully agree here:

  Modules Matter Most
