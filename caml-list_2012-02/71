 Java-like Programs

CALL FOR PAPERS

14th ECOOP Workshop on Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs (FTfJP 2012)
    (co-located with ECOOP and PLDI)
    Beijing China
    June 12, 2012

http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ftfjp

OVERVIEW

Formal techniques can help analyze programs, precisely describe
program behavior, and verify program properties. Newer languages such
as Java and C# provide good platforms to bridge the gap between formal
techniques and practical program development, because of their
reasonably clear semantics and standardized libraries. Moreover, these
languages are interesting targets for formal techniques, because the
novel paradigm for program deployment introduced with Java, with its
improved portability and mobility, opens up new possibilities for
abuse and causes concern about security.

Work on formal techniques and tools for programs and work on the
formal underpinnings of programming languages themselves naturally
complement each other. This workshop aims to bring together people
working in both these fields, on topics such as:

 - formal techniques for Java, C#, Scala or similar languages
 - specification techniques and interface specification languages
 - specification of software components and library packages
 - automated checking and verification of program properties
 - verification logics
 - language semantics
 - type systems
 - dynamic linking and loading
 - security

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions (of up to 6 pages in the ACM 2-column style) are sought
on open questions, new developments, or interesting new applications
of formal techniques in the context of Java or similar
languages. Contributions need not merely present completely finished
work, but also raise challenging open problems or propose speculative
new approaches. We particularly welcome contributions that simply
suggest good topics for discussion at the workshop, or raise issues
that you feel deserve the attention of the research community.

Contributions will be formally reviewed, for originality, relevance,
and the potential to generate interesting discussions.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. In
addition, depending on the nature of the contributions, we may
organize a special journal issue as a follow-up to the workshop, as
has been done for some of the previous FTfJP workshops.

Contributions must be in English, in pdf format, and are limited to
6-pages in ACM 2-column style.

Papers must be submitted electronically via Easy Chair at:
   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2012

Any PC member, other than the chair, may be an author or co-author on
any paper submitted for consideration but will be excluded from any
evaluation or discussion of the paper.
