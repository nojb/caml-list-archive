Call for Papers

         International Journal of Bio-Inspired Computation
              http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalCODE=ijbic

         Special Issue on "Knowledge and Intelligence in Distributed Systems"

Guest Editors:

   David Camacho (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain)

   Costin Badica (University of Craiova, Romania)

   Doina Bein (ARL, Pennsylvania State University, USA)

   Martijn Warnier (Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands)



A. The topic

Distributed Systems are currently facing new challenges of adapting and reusing
research results in the area of Intelligent Systems. Intelligent Systems are
using methods and technology derived from Knowledge-Based and Computational
Intelligence. Distributed Computing develops methods and technology to build
systems that are composed of collaborating components. This special issue
welcomes submissions of original papers introducing research results on all
the aspects covering the roles of Knowledge and Intelligence in Distributed
Systems, ranging from concepts and theoretical developments to advanced
technologies and innovative applications.

Paper acceptance and publication will be judged on the basis of their quality
and relevance to the symposium themes, clarity of presentation, originality and
accuracy of results and proposed solutions.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

- Hybrid systems involving software agents and human actors
- Intelligent integration of data and processes
- Intelligent cloud infrastructures
- Autonomic and adaptive distributed computing
- Intelligent service-oriented distributed systems
- Self-organising and adaptive distributed systems
- Emerging behaviours in complex distributed systems
- Knowledge integration and fusion from distributed sources
- Data mining and knowledge discovery in distributed settings
- Semantic and knowledge grids
- Ontologies and meta-data for description of heterogeneous resources
and services
- Intelligence in mobile and ubiquitous computing
- Intelligence in Peer-to-Peer systems
- Intelligence in Distributed Multimedia Systems
- Intelligent distributed problem solving and decision making
- Intelligent distributed applications in e-business/e-commerce, e-learning,
e-health, e-science, e-government, crisis management


B. Submission and review

All submissions will be reviewed according to the journal peer-review policy.
Please submit your contribution to
http://www.inderscience.com/mapper.php?id=35&jid=329 inserting the acronym for
the special issue – KIDS2012.

For preparing your manuscripts please use the instructions and templates
available at:
http://www.inderscience.com/browse/index.php?journalID=329#submission.
Submitted papers will be subject to maximum 2 rounds of refereeing process and
the authors will be informed about the final decision by August 31st, 2012.

The planned calendar is:
- Submission: 31 May 2012
- First notification: 02 July 2012
- Submission of revisions: 31 July 2012
- Final decision: 31 August 2012
- Submission of camera ready papers: 07 September 2012
- Journal issue: November-December 2012

C. Potential contributors

Submitted papers must be unpublished or not submitted anywhere else for
publication. If a shorter version of the paper has been accepted or published
in a conference, then the submission must contain at least 30% as compared to
the conference publication, this must be mentioned when submitting the paper,
as well as the name of the conference and the title of publication.
The KIDS 2012 special issue will be based on submissions attracted by:

A) Open call, which commits with previous conditions
B) Invitation of selected papers that were accepted and presented at the
IDC 2011 symposium: http://idc-2011.d-cis.nl/. These submissions must differ
at least 50% from the initial versions published in the IDC-2011 proceedings.
More specifically, we expect:
- The update of the title and the abstract
- The expansion and elaboration of the key ideas
- The expansion of the related work section and list of references
- More extensive and/or larger examples, if applicable
- Improved descriptions of algorithms or applications, if applicable
- Improved discussion and/or conclusion sections
