**********************************************************************
CALL FOR INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:

                   TURING CENTENARY CONFERENCE
                      http://www.cie2012.eu

        Computability in Europe 2012: How the World Computes
                     University of Cambridge
                    Cambridge, 18-23 June 2012


CiE 2012 is one of a series of special events, running throughout the Alan
Turing Year, celebrating Turing's unique impact on mathematics, computing,
computer science, informatics, morphogenesis, artificial intelligence,
philosophy and computational aspects of physics, biology, linguistics,
economics and the wider scientific world.

CiE 2012 is planned to be an event worthy of the remarkable scientific
career it commemorates, and will be the largest ever conference centred on
the Computability Theoretic legacy of Turing and his contemporaries.

PLENARY SPEAKERS include:

Andrew Hodges (Oxford, Special Invited Lecture), Ian Stewart (Warwick,
Special Public Lecture), Dorit Aharonov (Jerusalem), Veronica Becher
(Buenos Aires), Lenore Blum (Carnegie Mellon, The 2012 APAL Lecture),
Rodney Downey (Wellington), Yuri Gurevich (Microsoft, The EACSL Lecture),
Juris Hartmanis (Cornell), Richard Jozsa (Cambridge, jointly organised
lecture with King's College), Stuart Kauffman (Vermont/ Santa Fe), James
Murray (Oxford/Princeton, Microsoft Research Lecture), Stuart Shieber
(Harvard), Paul Smolensky (Johns Hopkins) and Leslie Valiant (Harvard,
jointly organised lecture with King's College).

SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS OF INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS are now invited for this
historic event.

For submission details, see:
http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/WScie12/give-page.php?12

SUBMISSION DEADLINE for Informal Presentations:  MAY 11, 2012

Authors will be notified of acceptance, usually within two weeks of
submission.

All accepted papers become eligible for consideration for post-conference
journals: COMPUTABILITY will consider journal versions of papers presented
at CiE conferences as a general rule; and there will be special issues of


Logical Methods in Computer Science (LMCS) and Annals of Pure and Applied
Logic (APAL).

with computability.

CiE 2012 will have a special relationship to the scientific legacy of Alan
Turing, reflected in the broad theme: How the World Computes, with all its
different layers of meaning. Contributions which are directly related to
the visionary and seminal work of Turing will be particularly welcome.
