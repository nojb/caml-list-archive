It seems then that the best option for everyone would be to have a good standard formatter in the distribution per se. These days css is on the verge of becoming Turing complete (if not already) and if the right data's here a little bit of javascript may cater most needs.  

However currently, the html generated by the standard formatter is invalid and the content littered with presentational elements (e.g. br) or inconsistent markup which makes it a nightmare to process and style with css.

Best,

Daniel

P.S.  
With respect to the original request, I once asked to turn ocamldoc into a full html code browser. But the wish was not granted :
