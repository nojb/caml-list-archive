Subject: [Caml-list] Hybrid Machine Translation Workshop (TSD 2012) - First Call for Papers

    *********************************************************
       Hybrid Machine Translation - FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
    *********************************************************

Hybrid Machine Translation Workshop, satellite workshop of TSD 2012
	     Brno, Czech Republic, 3 September 2012
     http://www.tsdconference.org/tsd2012/conf_workshop.html

The MT Workshop is organized by the Faculty of Informatics,
Masaryk University, Brno, in cooperation with the PRESEMT EU
project Consortium. The MT Workshop is a satellite workshop of
the Text, Speech and Dialog Conference.

Venue: Brno, Czech Republic

THE SUBMISSION DEADLINES:

    March 15 2012 ............ Submission of abstracts
    March 22 2012 ............ Submission of full papers

Submission of abstract serves for better organization of the review
process only - for the actual review a full paper submission is
necessary.

HYBRID MACHINE TRANSLATION

Interest in flexible and adaptable MT systems, based on the
language-independent hybrid methods, whose principles ensure easy
portability to new language pairs has led us to organizing
an MT Workshop in the framework of the TSD Conference 2012. These
methods attempt to overcome well-known problems of some
MT approaches, e.g. bilingual corpora compilation or the
laborious creation of the new rules per language pair. We also
want to address the issue of effectively managing multilingual
content and would welcome interesting suggestions in the
direction of a language-independent machine-learning-based
methodology.

The key aspects that should be touched at the MT Workshop involve
among others syntactic phrase-based modelling, pattern
recognition approaches (such as extended clustering) or
techniques towards the development of a language-independent
analysis. These aspects are intended to be of a hybrid nature,
combining linguistic processing with the positive aspects of the
corpus-based approaches, such as SMT and EBMT.

The need for easy amenability to new language pairs and
relatively inexpensive, readily available language resources as
well as bilingual lexica should be touched too. Modelling of the
translation context on phrases can improve the translation
quality so it should be considered too. Producing phrases via
a semi-automatic and language-independent process of
morphological and syntactic analysis may remove the need for
compatible NLP tools per language pair.

Another relevant aspect to which the attention has to be paid is
a parallelisation of the main translation processes since their
investigation may help to reach a fast, high-quality translation
system. Furthermore, the optimisation and personalisation of the
system parameters via automated processes (such as GAs or swarm
intelligence) is an issue which deserves to be investigated in
any case.

One of the points relevant for MT systems is a user adaptability
and user feedback with appropriate integrated interactive
interfaces. Such systems can be easily customised to both new
language pairs and specific sublanguages.


TOPICS

Topics of the MT Workshop include all themes of machine
translation (with stress on hybrid aspects of MT).

The workshop is organized in cooperation with the PRESEMT EU project
Consortium, submissions from other EU machine translation and other
projects are more than welcomed.

Papers on processing of languages other than English are strongly
encouraged.


PROGRAM COMMITTEE

    George Tambouratzis, Greece (chair)
    Bjorn Gamback, Sweden
    Adam Kilgarriff, GB
    Karel Pala, Czech Republic
    Paul Schmidt, Germany


KEYNOTE SPEAKERS

    George Tambouratzis
        Institute for Lnaguage and Speech Processing, Greece
        PRESEMT Machine Translation System


FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP

The MT Workshop program will include presentation of invited papers,
oral presentations, and poster session.

As a part of the main TSD 2012 Conference, social events including
a trip in the vicinity of Brno will allow for additional informal
interactions.


TSD SERIES

TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in
both spoken and written language processing from all over the world.
Proceedings of TSD form a book published by Springer-Verlag in their
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.  TSD Proceedings
are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation
Index.  Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major citation databases
such as DBLP, SCOPUS, EI, INSPEC or COMPENDEX.


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

The MT Workshop submissions will undergo two separate review processes
- the best papers which will succeed in both review processes (by the
TSD 2012 Conference PC and MT Workshop 2012 PC) will be published in
the TSD 2012 Springer Proceedings, all other accepted MT Workshop
papers will be published in a separate MT Workshop proceedings
with ISBN.

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages
formatted in the LNCS style (see below). Those accepted will be
presented either orally or as posters. The decision about the
presentation format will be based on the recommendation of the
reviewers. The authors are asked to submit their papers using the
on-line form accessible from the conference website, MT Workshop
submissions have to tick "MT Workshop review" check box in the form.

Papers submitted to the MT Workshop must not be under review by any
other conference or publication during the workshop review cycle, and
must not be previously published or accepted for publication
elsewhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".  Papers that do not conform to the
requirements above are subject to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX
or LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final
versions of the papers that will be published in the Springer
Lecture Notes.  Authors using a WORD compatible software for the
final version must use the LNCS template for WORD and within the
submit process ask the Proceedings Editors to convert the paper
to LaTeX format.  For this service a service-and-license fee of
CZK 1500 will be levied automatically.

The paper format for review has to be either PDF or PostScript file
with all required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance,
presenters will receive further information on submitting their
camera-ready and electronic sources (for detailed instructions on
the final paper format see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html#Proceedings).


IMPORTANT DATES

March 15 2012 ............ Submission of abstracts
March 22 2012 ............ Submission of full papers
May 15 2012 .............. Notification of acceptance

Submission of abstracts serves for better organization of the review
process only - for the actual review a full paper submission is
necessary.

The accepted workshop contributions will be published in proceedings
that will be made available to participants at the time of the
conference.

LOCATION

Brno is the second largest city in the Czech Republic with a
population of almost 400.000 and is the country's judiciary and
trade-fair center. Brno is the capital of South Moravia, which is
located in the south-east part of the Czech Republic and is known
for a wide range of cultural, natural, and technical sights.
South Moravia is a traditional wine region. Brno had been a Royal
City since 1347 and with its six universities it forms a cultural
center of the region.

Brno can be reached easily by direct flights from London, Moscow,
Saint Petersburg, Eindhoven, Rome and Prague and by trains or
buses from Prague (200 km) or Vienna (130 km).

For the participants with some extra time, nearby places may
also be of interest.  Local ones include: Brno Castle now called
Spilberk, Veveri Castle, the Old and New City Halls, the
Augustine Monastery with St. Thomas Church and crypt of Moravian
Margraves, Church of St.  James, Cathedral of St. Peter&Paul,
Cartesian Monastery in Kralovo Pole, the famous Villa Tugendhat
designed by Mies van der Rohe along with other important
buildings of between-war Czech architecture.

For those willing to venture out of Brno, Moravian Karst with
Macocha Chasm and Punkva caves, battlefield of the Battle of
three emperors (Napoleon, Russian Alexander and Austrian Franz
- Battle by Austerlitz), Chateau of Slavkov (Austerlitz),
Pernstejn Castle, Buchlov Castle, Lednice Chateau, Buchlovice
Chateau, Letovice Chateau, Mikulov with one of the largest Jewish
cemeteries in Central Europe, Telc - a town on the UNESCO
heritage list, and many others are all within easy reach.
