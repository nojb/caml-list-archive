This URL points to an archived web page, starting with "This is the
archived Findlib page. The new homepage can be found here!", plus a link
to more recent information. Maybe this can be overlooked. The new link is
http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html.

Findlib is fully supported on Win32.

I'd call this a self-made trap. I'd never install Unixish software into a
path with spaces. (I know Windows people think differently about that, but
that's how it is.)

I think it was renamed to libocamlrun.a. But this is wrong for Win32
anyway, because the suffix should be .lib.

Yes, it's not a pleasure to build Ocaml software on Windows.
