Hi Romain,

The compilation of lablgtk2 on windows doesn't have particular issues
or difficulties but it's still windows.

The "for the brave" part is probably a bit too scary (I guess it's
quite old and the situation has worse back then). I think you can
compile it by yourself in a matter of minutes if your environment is
already set-up (i.e. gcc and ocaml).

Regards,
Adrien Nader
