Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Fwd: interval trees

Hello,

I did a naive implementation of interval trees for float intervals.

It is available here:
https://github.com/HappyCrow/interval-tree

I wonder if it is possible to construct the trees in a tail recursive 
fashion. Maybe I knew how to do this when I was still at university.

Regards,
Francois.
