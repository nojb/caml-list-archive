GCC shipped with (current) MingW no longer recognizes -mno-cygwin
argument, my oline searches for a workaround were fruitless, but
turns out there is one, one can create a self specs file and
make gcc (the driver) strip -mno-cygwin from cc1 invokation. This
can be done by putting a file named "specs" into a directory listed
under "install:" in the output of `gcc -print-search-dirs' containing
following line:
*cc1: %<mno-cygwin

Hope that would save someone the trouble of making things run.
