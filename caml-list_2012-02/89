If it's all compiled at once, it's probably one package - don't split it 
up.  I see three options:
1) name your package (in odb) foo-feature1 (ugly, but simple and works)
2) provide a dummy executable `foo` for odb to detect
3) convince me that your requirements are common enough to deserve more 
complexity in odb

There's no need for odb to detect (or even know about) all three 
foo-features, it's perfectly fine for it to only know about one of them 
and base its decision to recompile on that one.

odb doesn't directly access either of those files.  Oasis-db extracts 
lots of info from _oasis files and make them available to odb in a form 
it understands.  Findlib also handles META files on behalf of odb, 
although for different uses.

At the moment, the library/executable distinction is important only for 
detecting installed packages.  If a package is a library, it is 
installed only if ocamlfind knows of an ocamlfind package with the same 
name as the odb package.  Similarly, if a package is a executable, it is 
installed only if `which` knows of that executable name.

Libraries are not a problem - ocamlfind provides a version for them 
trivially (from their META file).  IIRC, I wrote some code that tried to 
run `foo -version` to get the version of foo, but it looks like I'll 
have to parse the output of most programs looking for a version number.
