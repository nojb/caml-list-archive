Let me guess where the problem might be came from:

When i think of code that uses a value
  1_000_000
  and you want to change it to a value ten times higher,
  it should be  changed to
  10_000_000


Coming from notation that does NOT allow "_" in tzhe numbers,
it could be done by just adding one "0" at the end of the value:

  1000000
becomes
  10000000
         ^

with the "0" added at the end.

But also correct ("more correct" would be:

  1000000
becomes
  10000000
   ^

"0" added at the millions.

  "Just add one "0" at the end"

Is the edit-habit, which works fine.


But when allowing "_" inside numbers,
but people don't change the "wrong" editing behaviour,
then allowing the "_" at all means introducing a new kind
of possible errors.

This could be an argument to throw "_" at all,
because adding a "0" after the "1" instead of just
adding a "0" at the end is rarely used behaviour of editing,
and some people might call it "weird". ;-)

So this argument also could be used to disallow "_" at all.


But no, thats not what I want to argue for ;-)



OK, let's stop that discussion now.

If someone thinks the three-digit-distance-"_" is a feature that makes sense,
a feature wish could be added for OCaml. ;-)


Ciao,
  Oliver
