Subject: [Caml-list] Semantic Web Journal: Call for Special Issue Proposals

Semantic Web Journal: Call for Special Issue Proposals

http://www.semantic-web-journal.net

Semantic Web research is interdisciplinary in nature. Indeed, progress 
towards the Semantic Web vision requires the incorporation of 
fundamental state-of-the-art and future developments from many domains 
including Computer & Information Science, Cognitive Science, Geographic 
Information Science, the life sciences, the social sciences, and many 
more. To establish bridges between these domains, it is thus important 
to demonstrate what and how they contribute to the Semantic Web vision, 
and what the Semantic Web can offer in return to these disciplines.

Hence, the Semantic Web Journal calls for Special Issue proposals on 
topics which (a) are within the topical realm of a neighboring domain 
but (b) contribute directly or indirectly to Semantic Web research. 
Research published in such special issues should strengthen the in-depth 
information exchange between disciplines by providing novel and 
high-quality contributions and at the same time demonstrate the impact 
on foundational research questions relevant for Semantic Web. While such 
manuscripts can be written with a specific audience in mind, the key 
ideas and contributions should be accessible to the broader Semantic web 
community.

Proposals for special issues shall be sent to the Editors-in-Chief 
(contact@semantic-web-journal.net) and contain the following information 
in a single PDF file:

* Names and affiliations of all guest editors

* Topic of the special issue

* Tentative list of Guest Editorial Board members

* A short description of the topic

* Why the topic is currently of interest

* Why the topic is relevant to this call

* Credentials of the guest editors regarding their research impact and 
their community standing with respect to the topic

* A draft call for papers, including a suggested time-line

It will be assumed that all proposed guest editors are aware of the 
journal's open and transparent review policy described at 
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/reviewers#review

Proposals for more "traditional" special issues are certainly also 
welcome at any time.

Submission deadline: 31st of March, 2013


Best Regards,

Pascal Hitzler
