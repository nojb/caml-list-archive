Subject: [Caml-list] SLATE 2013 - Second Call For Papers - Symposium on
 Languages, Applications and Technologies


SLATE 2013 - Symposium on Languages, Applications and Technologies
http://slate-conf.org/2013

20 and 21 June, 2013
University of Porto, Portugal

We often use languages. First, to communicate between ourselves.
Later, to communicate with computers. And more recently, with the
advent of networks, we found a way to make computers communicate
between themselves. All these different forms of communication use
languages, different languages, but that still share many
similarities. In SLATE we are interested in discussing these
languages.

SLATE is born from a group of researchers that share the fascination
by the way languages work, being them natural or artificial. This
group organized over a decade two different conferences: XATA, with
interest in XML as the de facto language for computer interaction; and
CoRTA, with interest in Compilers and related techniques to understand
computer languages. SLATE arrives as the generalization of these two
conferences into the abstraction of languages.

Being languages such a broad subject, SLATE is organized in three main
tracks:

1. HCL Track: Processing Human-Computer Languages
2. CCL Track: Processing Computer-Computer Languages
3. HHL Track: Processing Human-Human Languages

A detailed topic list for each one of these tracks is presented below.

HCL Track: Processing Human-Computer Languages

* Programming language concepts and methodologies;
* Language and Grammars, design, formal specification and quality;
* Design of novel language constructs and their implementation;
* Domain Specific Languages design and implementation;
* Programming tools;
* Programming, refactoring and debugging environments;
* Dynamic and static analysis: Program Slicing;
* Program Comprehension;
* Compilation and interpretation techniques;
* Code generation and optimization;

CCL Track: Processing Computer-Computer Languages

* Semantic Web and Ontologies;
* Methodologies for specification in XML
* XML compression, serialization and merging
* XML Parsing and Querying;
* XML Structuring
* XML Transformation
* XML Security
* Web Services -- Architectures and Practical Cases
* Web Technologies and Frameworks
* XML Libraries and digital repositories
* E-learning systems, standards and interoperability
* Serialization languages

HHL Track: Processing Human-Human Languages

* Computational morphology, syntax and semantics;
* Machine translation and tools for computer assisted translation;
* Computational terminology and lexicography;
* Speech synthesis and understanding;
* Information extraction and automatic question answering;
* Corpora linguistics;
* NLP system evaluation;
* Public tools and resources for NLP;
* Ontologies and knowledge representation;
* Statistical Methods applied to NLP;
* Language teaching support tools.

SLATE Publication Policy and Authors Information

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings,
under an ISBN reference, on paper and digital support. They will also
integrate the OASIcs series
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/oasics/).

Selected papers’ authors should have the opportunity to publish
extended versions of their papers in a special issue of ComSIS:
Computer Science and Information Systems.

Papers should be written using the OASIcs LaTeX template, using the
English language, and should not exceed 16 pages. Please refer to the
submissions page in the website for details about the document
preparation.

Relevant Dates
* Paper Submission: March 08, 2013
* Authors Notification: March 28, 2013
