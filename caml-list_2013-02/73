Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml Labs Monthly Update

Yes.  The website was a result of my epic binge of experimenting
with self-hosting using various libraries and experimenting with
Core, and rather predictably led to the end result being a bit
mishmash.  I make no apologies as it was quite fun :)

But Version 2 (tm) will be less thrown together. It also helps that
we've had a few months to settle down the various projects we're
going to be working on.  Now that ocaml.org is up and running,
the goal is to put as much content there as possible, and leave
the OCaml Labs website mainly as a project tracking page.
