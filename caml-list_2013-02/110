Subject: [Caml-list] ReactiveML 1.08.04

We are happy to announce the new release of ReactiveML (http://reactiveml.o=
rg) with its online toplevel (http://reactiveml.org/tryrml)!

ReactiveML is a language similar to OCaml extended with a built-in notion o=
f parallel composition. It is based on the reactive synchronous model, a ki=
nd of cooperative multithreading with a global notion of time.

The language is well suited to program applications with a lot of parallel =
processes which communicate and synchronize a lot such as video games or si=
mulation problems.

ReactiveML is compiled into plain OCaml code and thus can link or be linked=
 to any OCaml code.

This new version includes in particular:
- an online toplevel (thanks to js_of_ocaml, tryocaml and Mehdi Dogguy) wit=
h an interactive tutorial
- a new static analysis which checks that programs are cooperative
- a version of ocamlbuild dedicated to ReactiveML: rmlbuild
