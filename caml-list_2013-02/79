Subject: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

I spent some time last night going through all the "what is a good
(beginner's) ide for ocaml?" threads I could find online, and trying
out the various options suggested. I ruled out the following:

* vim, emacs and eclipse (not beginner-friendly; people who want to
use them will know how to do it)
* anything that did not provide a binary install for Windows and OSX,
and wasn't a simple configure/make/make install on linux
* anything that needed fiddling with config files just to install it
* anything that needed the OCaml sources to be independently present
and configured (!)
* anything that was abandoned, or didn't seem to support OCaml 4

I was left with Geany and Komodo Edit as possibilities, and Geany won
out by letting me open up a test.ml file and immediately being able to
find and run the OCaml compiler. At least on Linux, it was a perfect
beginner-friendly experience.

So what do people think about ocaml.org officially promoting Geany as
the answer to "I'm learning OCaml; what is a good IDE?"? I'd be happy
to write up a page on it and contribute it.
