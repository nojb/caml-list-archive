Subject: Re: [Caml-list] opam http repo, archive downloading

As Thomas noted, this list:
http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform

is available for OPAM-related questions that aren't appropriate
for the tracker. We've got lots of developments planned for OPAM to
better support the upcoming Platform, and that's the place to
discuss broader issues.

However, I'd suggest sticking to Github for feature requests that
might be bugs, as it's easy to cross-reference them and keep track
of what's going on.  You should assume that mails to a list won't
have anyone act on them, whereas issues always get a response.
