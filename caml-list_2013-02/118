I can well imagine such a toolkit - basically an editor without user=20=20
interface. It would just consist of the underlying modules, and would=20=20
solve all difficult tasks - like incremental indentation, or=20=20
transparent network file access. Other developers can then pick things=20=
=20
up - only parts, or everything - and I'm sure we'll see then a couple=20=20
of GUIs on top of this, some expressive, some minimalistic, some=20=20
specializing on certain domains (web, GUI, etc.), some cloning emacs.=20=20
And, as you write, existing editors can be "upgraded" by providing=20=20
bindings.

Let's call this "editor" ModelOnly (following the common=20=20
model/view/controller abstraction).

I think this is just a matter of a simple GUI that focuses on the parts=20=
=20
that are important for beginners, e.g. explaining typing.

This is not something entirely different, but just a special=20=20
application of the general editor library. IMO, the difficult part is=20=20
really the model, not the GUI (let it be desktop or web based), as=20=20
plugging a few Gtk widgets together is not that hard. Once there is a=20=20
good model library we'll certainly see an excellent GUI focusing on=20=20
students.

I completely agree that there are totally different requirements if you=20=
=20
compare the needs of beginners and professionals. However, this is=20=20
mostly a matter of presentation, and implementation-wise, there is a=20=20
lot of overlap, and also an editor for beginners would profit from a=20=20
good model library.
