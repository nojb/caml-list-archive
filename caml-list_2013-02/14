Moreover as ygrek said, his version accumulates lots of bugfixes meant to be integrated into the official branch for a long time already, that could not make it because the original author did not answer at all.

I have no problem with this fork, or the name remaining the same. I
have not used OCaml in a long time and people more active than me
probably are better at taking care of it at this point.
