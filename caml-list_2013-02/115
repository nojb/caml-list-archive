Subject: AW: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

Hi,

it is good to see that there is again some activity on the editor/ide=20=20
issue. However, I see that there is one main problem of all current=20=20
acitivities: nobody asks the potential users what they want.

Of course, there are many "preferences" in this area, and this is=20=20
subjective, and not really debatable. You can like the result or not.=20=20
But - and this is my point - there are also hard requirements. Again,=20=20
this is different per user, but these points are not a matter of taste.

Just to make an example: Personally, I'm still sticking to emacs=20=20
(although latest tuareg-mode is error-prone), mainly because it has one=20=
=20
killer feature: Tramp. You need to know that I'm often not building my=20=
=20
programs on the machine I'm sitting at, but I'm remotely logging in to=20=
=20
another machine (often over continents). Tramp is an emacs module to=20=20
edit files remotely via ssh/sftp.

My guess is that there are many other users who would profit from such=20=
=20
a feature. Nevertheless, it is not popping up anywhere else - strange=20=20
enough, since we left the "PC" era long ago where everything had to=20=20
happen locally on your own computer. The IDEs seem not to have left=20=20
this era, and in a time where everything moves to the cloud this is=20=20
really anachronistic.

It is clear to me that many features of IDEs are more difficult to=20=20
implement with such a requirement, as the latency to open files is way=20=
=20
higher. But on my side there is nothing to discuss, as remotely editing=20=
=20
files is more important than anything else.

Another point from the perspective of a professional: There is=20=20
absolutely no need to integrate build support into the IDE (like=20=20
OCamlEditor tries to do). We have already utilities for this, and these=20=
=20
are scriptable - which is a MUST-HAVE for all professional use (think=20=20
of continuous integration, for instance).

Gerd
