Subject: Re: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

Hi Louis,

That looks very interesting. Sorry if this seems like a rude question;
I truly don't mean it that way, but if your editor needs a few months
of work, why not work on a stripped-down interface for OCamlEditor
[http://ocamleditor.forge.ocamlcore.org/] instead? I remember when I
was learning web development I enjoyed using Evrsoft's "1st Page" IDE,
which had modes that would add or remove bits from the interface as
you progressed from beginner to power user, and something like that
would be very nice to have for OCaml.
