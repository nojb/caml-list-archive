Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ocp-indent beta release

I tried it very quickly, it seems to work fine.

I'm curious though, when did this way of indenting pattern-matching 
became a thing? When I started programming in OCaml, the default Tuareg 
behavior was:

match x with
   | A ->
       b

Now it seems everywhere I go it's like this never existed.

Cheers,
