Subject: RE: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide


I tried to do something similar once but the experience of trying to write
even the simplest GUI app using OCaml was horrific using Emacs and I gave
up. In contrast, I often develop GUI apps using F# and it is very easy. The
main difference is having an IDE (Visual Studio) with Intellisense so you
can explore APIs interactively from the editor without having to go back and
forth between Emacs and OCamlBrowser (a nice tool but completely
unintegrated).

So this is a chicken and egg problem: writing GUI apps is much harder in
OCaml than it could be with a GUI app to help you write GUI apps in OCaml.

I do think this is the right problem to be attacking though. OCaml could be
a fantastic language for GUI development thanks to polymorphic variants and
so on. The marriage of a metalanguage with good GUI support is incredibly
powerful.

Cheers,
Jon.

OCaml is definitely lacking in this area; I am at the moment working
precisely on solving this issue, with a dedicated Gtk editor that runs on
Linux, OSX and Windows. It is pretty basic at the moment but already has
code edition and working toplevel interaction (no compilation or project
yet).

Release is intended in a few months from now, with sufficient features for
beginners and students. If successful, it will then be extended to handle
bigger projects (multi-file, build system integration, etc.).

Until then, you may see the project's github page at
https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-edit-simple (name temporary)
