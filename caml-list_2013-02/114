Subject: Re: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

Hello,

Most of the features of OCamlEditor are closely related to each other and t=
o the=20
GTK library and it would require a considerable effort to make them availab=
le=20
separately for other projects. However there are some widgets that can be r=
eused=20
quite easily such as the search results widget, quick file chooser, locatio=
n=20
history, dependency graph viewer, maybe the cmt view.
OCamlEditor contains also a separated library, "gmisclib", with some generi=
c=20
widgets that can help.

Francesco
