Subject: Re: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

Hi,

No offence taken :). OCamlEditor indeed looks like a very interesting proje=
ct,=20
with lots of features already present. But the scope and project goals are =
not=20
the same though, so I think ocp-editor still has a place on its own ;

One of our main goals is to make IDE bricks available publicly, so I think =
the=20
projects can benefit to one another. I would be glad to borrow some widgets=
 from=20
OCamlEditor, and it could use automatic indentation or better toplevel proc=
ess=20
interaction.

If the author -- Francesco Tovagliari -- is around here, I would be glad to=
 know=20
how he feels about this ?
