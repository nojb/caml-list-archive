As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater
opportunities  arise for  intelligent mathematical  computation. While
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we  are now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these
areas. The  Conferences on  Intelligent Computer Mathematics  offers a
venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.

The   conference  will   take  place   at  the   University   of  Bath
(www.bath.ac.uk),  with James  Davenport  as the  local organiser.  It
consists of four tracks:

Calculemus
  Chair: Wolfgang Windsteiger
Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)
  Chair: Petr Sojka
Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
  Chair: David Aspinall
Systems and Projects
  Chair: Christoph Lange

As  in  previous  years,  there  will  be  a  Doctoral  Programme  for
presentations by Doctoral students.
  
The overall programme  will be organised by the  General Program Chair
Jacques Carette.

==========
Calculemus
==========

Calculemus   2013  invites   the  submission   of   original  research
contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the
conference.  Calculemus  is a series  of conferences dedicated  to the
integration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for
mechanised  reasoning  like   interactive  proof  assistants  (PA)  or
automated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently,  symbolic computation is
divided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional
ones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as  well as
newly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory
exploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to
bring these  developments together in order to  facilitate the theory,
design,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant
systems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer
scientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in
their every day business.

All  topics  in  the  intersection  of computer  algebra  systems  and
automated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.  These
include but are not limited to:

* Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.
* Computer algebra in theorem proving systems.
* Adding reasoning capabilities to computer algebra systems.
* Adding computational capabilities to theorem proving systems.
* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for
computer mathematics.
* Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation and
reasoning.
* Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories.
* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.
* Theory exploration techniques.
* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.
* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages,
and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.
* Homotopy type theory.
* Infrastructure for mathematical services.

===
DML
===

Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked, validated and
verified.   It is  estimated that  the entire  corpus  of mathematical
knowledge  published over  the centuries  does not  exceed 100,000,000
pages,   an   amount   easily   manageable  by   current   information
technologies.

Track objective  is to provide  a forum for development  of math-aware
technologies, standards, algorithms and formats towards fulfillment of
the  dream  of global  digital  mathematical  library (DML).  Computer
scientists  (D)  and librarians  of  digital  age  (L) are  especially
welcome to  join mathematicians  (M) and discuss  many aspects  of DML
preparation.

Track topics  are all topics of mathematical  knowledge management and
digital  libraries  applicable  in  the  context of  DML  building  --
processing of math knowledge expressed in scientific papers in natural
languages, namely:

* Math-aware text mining (math mining) and MSC classification
* Math-aware representations of mathematical knowledge
* Math-aware computational linguistics and corpora
* Math-aware tools for [meta]data and fulltext processing
* Math-aware OCR and document analysis
* Math-aware information retrieval
* Math-aware indexing and search
* Authoring languages and tools
* MathML, OpenMath, TeX and other mathematical content standards
* Web interfaces for DML content
* Mathematics on the web, math crawling and indexing
* Math-aware document processing workflows 
* Archives of written mathematics
* DML management, business models
* DML rights handling, funding, sustainability 
* DML content acquisition, validation and curation 

===
MKM
===

Mathematical  Knowledge Management  is an  interdisciplinary  field of
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop
new and better ways  of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,
based on innovative technology  of computer science, the Internet, and
intelligent   knowledge   processing.  MKM   is   expected  to   serve
mathematicians,  scientists,   and  engineers  who   produce  and  use
mathematical  knowledge; educators  and students  who teach  and learn
mathematics;   publishers  who   offer   mathematical  textbooks   and
disseminate   new    mathematical   results;   and    librarians   and
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:

 * Representations of mathematical knowledge
 * Authoring languages and tools
 * Repositories of formalized mathematics
 * Deduction systems
 * Mathematical digital libraries
 * Diagrammatic representations
 * Mathematical OCR
 * Mathematical search and retrieval
 * Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
 * MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
 * Web presentation of mathematics
 * Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
 * Computer algebra systems
 * Collaboration tools for mathematics
 * Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows

====================
Systems and Projects
====================

The  Systems and  Projects  track of  the  Conferences on  Intelligent
Computer Mathematics  is a forum for presenting  available systems and
new and ongoing  projects in all areas and topics  related to the CICM
conferences:

* Deduction and Computer Algebra (Calculemus)
* Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)
* Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
* Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation (AISC)

The track aims  to provide an overview of  the latest developments and
trends within the CICM community  as well as to exchange ideas between
developers and introduce systems to an audience of potential users.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                       Submission Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions to the  research tracks must not exceed  15 pages and will
be reviewed and evaluated with respect to relevance, clarity, quality,
originality,   and   impact.   Shorter   papers,   e.g.,  for   system
descriptions, are welcome. Authors will have an opportunity to respond
to  their  papers' reviews  before  the  programme  committee makes  a
decision.

System descriptions and projects  descriptions should be 2-4 pages and
should present
* newly developed systems,
* systems that have not previously been presented to the CICM community,
  or
* significant updates to existing systems.
Systems must be available for download.

Project presentations should describe
* projects that are new or about to start,
* ongoing projects that have not yet been presented to the CICM community.
* significant new developments in ongoing previously presented projects.

Presentations of  new projects  should mention relevant  previous work
and include  a roadmap that  outlines concrete steps.  All submissions
should  contain  links  to  demos, downloadable  systems,  or  project
websites.

Accepted  conference submissions  from all  tracks is  intended  to be
published  as a  volume  in  the series  Lecture  Notes in  Artificial
Intelligence  (LNAI)   by  Springer.  In  addition   to  these  formal
proceedings, authors are permitted and encouraged to publish the final
versions of their papers on arXiv.org.

Work-in-progress submissions  are intended to provide a  forum for the
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for
submission as a  full or system description paper.  This includes work
in progress  and emerging  trends. Their size  is not limited,  but we
recommend 5-10 pages.

The  programme   committee  may  offer  authors   of  rejected  formal
submissions to publish  their contributions as work-in-progress papers
instead. Depending on the  number of work-in-progress papers accepted,
they will be  presented at the conference either as  short talks or as
posters.  The  work-in-progress proceedings  will  be  published as  a
technical report, as well as online with CEUR-WS.org.

All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the
requirements of Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style files
can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). By  submitting a paper
the authors agree  that if it is accepted at least  one of the authors
will attend the conference to present it.

Electronic submission is done through easychair 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2013
