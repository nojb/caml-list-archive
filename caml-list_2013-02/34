Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml-Curl - good docs?

To be more precise in the question I had with ocaml-curl...
the cookies will be given back as strings only.
So my question I had was... at which position is which attribute.

I found out that ocaml-curl can be set to be verbose.
The the information, which then will be printed shows,that the cookie attri=
butes are known.
e.g. name and expiration and so on.

But the return value is just a string.
A record with accordingly named fields would make more sense.

I don't know, where the verbosity was coming from,
curllib or ocaml-curl.
At least somewhere the fields are known by name.
And then this information is lost somewehere.

Either curl gives it back unnamed to the caller (and the attributes are som=
ewhere deep in the lib), or ocaml-curl does give it back unnamed.
If the latter, IMHO  the Library should become enhanced.
If it is a curllib problem, at that point things should be enhanced, and oc=
aml-curl then too.

Independent of this IMHO a better layout at the curllib pages could enhance=
 usability=20
a lot (e.g. menues that are exchanged, instead of displaying the menue hier=
archy the whole time,
do not help to get an overview).

Ciao,
