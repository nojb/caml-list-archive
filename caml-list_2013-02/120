I think the major point we raised here, that we all want the same from the
editor: syntax highlighting, parsing in the background, invoking tools,
editing over the network etc. However, each of us, have a completely
different taste of how we interact with the editor and how we use the
GUI. For one person this might be Emacs which wins, other prefer
Code::Blocks. What matters here is not to focus on GUI but the features
that would be accessible from the different frontends. (which seem to be
a little hard, given diversity of the solutions on the market, but
perhaps possible)

Certainly one does not exclude the other option!

I just drew the border of the simple editor, and design requriments for
the "ModelOnly".

One could think about different incarnations of the same editor, did
anybody think about Emacs, beginner mode, with CUA bindings and limited
access to the functionality just so to make it easily accessible for the
beginners?
