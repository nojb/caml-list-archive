My pattern is to avoid console as much as possible, and open a buffer if
I need to. So my Emacs is usually a single monolithic session captured
in a tiling window manager, where I edit the code, send e-mails, sometimes
spawn jobs , run top-level, talk on jabber or irc and refine my patches
with magit.

Gnome-terminal is open on a different screen, just in case I find it
more comfortable to use it. (which usually happens at random times at
random days), but must say it that spawning job in terminal is much more
convenient than in Emacs. I also believe that can't live without
terminal on SSH - even though I edit my files exclusively using Tramp.

Probably your workflow is ideally orthogonal to mine, but that proves
the requirement - that such framework should be generic and scalable as
possible to cover many weird cases that tend to happen when people that
use Unix tools. Interesting idea: providing an OCaml plugin to Visual
Studio might bring up whole bunch of F# individuals that wanted to compile =
to
native code. There is strong move of MS to get towards the native code
instead of .net.

Also, we have some excellent UI console windowing libraries like
lambda-term or zed so maybe perhaps that is the way to go?

At least console encourages to use terminal, and it just works. There
are some famous console UI applications like Midnight Commander used by
many people.

Sadly my response that it often was pointed out in the past - "OCaml is
rubbish does not have a package manager - look at my ruby gems; it just
works.". Well, yes, features and environment just takes equal time and
effort to developing a language itself, and how many years it took to
bring up OCaml to such a state? Look at, how many IDEs are for such
language like C++, and mostly they cut, and that contributes that some
people will think that C++ will be the language of their choice - they
will be scared to run Emacs, but will just approve MS Eula online to
install Visual Studio Express.

>  - will the editor be maintained with new ocaml releases?

OCaml these days  changed rapidly. Therefore having a maintaince
headache with Camlp4 I can imagine it might be an issue.

That's why the basic editor should be very limited, it took 40 years to
bring up Emacs to the current state - surely we don't want to spend another
40 years to come up with new great Emacs for OCaml (only??).

The answer is: if the OCaml is popular enough and the editor of the his
choice is also popular, then might be that we will have a set
intersection, and actually some of these people will write a nice plugin
for they favourite editors. However to do this we'd first need to make
OCaml popular. The real bugs are in people that learn programming, they
tend to be not hampered by the industry and still some their dreams
about the tool they'd like to use in they daily routines. I think it's a
fair chunk of work.

We need to distinguish them; Usually the first needs more support, the
second one needs proper evangelising and brain washing + some impressive
project to convince them to switch over.

Yes, I've heard and wanted to mention. The commercial setting is
different I can't see such thing happening in OCaml community, Java
Enterprise is a strong industry and if any language needs strong support
from the IDE than IMHO Java would be placed in the first league.

I agree.

I didn't know Kate is still alive. Bloodshed Dev-C++ has been around
since day one I tried using C++ on windows.
