That's a good news! Old camlp4 was once ported to MetaOCaml, but it
took really a lot of effort.

The error comes about because the Makefile doesn't build
ocamlbuild. To save time during the development metaocaml, I skip
building ocamlbuild (I don't use it myself). I guess I didn't
reactivated it. I will fix this shortly in the metaocaml.bundle.
In the meanwhile, you can do 
        make ocamlbuild.byte
in the main ocaml-4.00.1 tree, followed by make install. This time
there should be no build/partial-install.sh error. ocamlbuild will be
installed.

As Jacques said, you do need to use metaocamlmktop. This is just a
shell script; you can look inside and see what libraries and object
files it uses and link your own toplevel accordingly (the order
libraries and object files matters!)

Yes, it is possible. It is possible almost immediately but I just had
an idea how to do it much better. If works out it will bring essentially
native metaocaml. I will need time to check it though... Well, better
is the enemy of the good. 

If you want ocamlopt urgently (without
using brackets and escapes) I can make a patch easily -- or tell you one
line to add to one file. Namely, to the file 
asmcomp/cmmgen.ml add at the line 1713 (at the end of the function
emit_constant_field) the following single line:
  | Const_csp_value _  -> assert false

After that, do make ocamlopt followed by make install. You get
ocamlopt that, as a side benefit, understands the let! monadic
notation (which never made it to the official version, but seems quite
handy).
