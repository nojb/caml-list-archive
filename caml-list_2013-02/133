This is not a bug in either vim nor ocp-indent. It is a bug in your
configurations (they are not in sync). You can either setup ocp-indent
to use 4 spaces or vim to use 2. See `ocp-indent --config help` for
the former, and `:h tabstop` and `:h softtabstop` for the latter.

This is the expected behaviour. ocp-indent is only given the selected
text and thus can only work correctly when receiving complete blocks.
(Indentation is relative to the first line of the chunk that is
passed.)

You can pass a full paragraph using `=3Dap` ("ap" stands for "a
paragraph", see `:h ap` for help). You can also use blocks. For more
information on these, see `:h text-objects`.

Note that you can do `gg=3DG` (move, action, move) instead of `ggvG=3D`
(move, mode, move, action). It is only marginally shorter but, more
importantly, it will preserve your `'<` and `'>` marks (see, `:h '>`
for more explanations). (And dually, you can replace `=3Dap` (action,
object) by `vap=3D` (mode, object, action).)
