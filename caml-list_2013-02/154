                         CALL FOR PAPERS
                  Fifth Working Conference on
            Verified Software: Theories, Tools, and Experiments
                          (VSTTE 2013)
                  May 17--19, 2013, Atherton, California

		Last Call for Papers - Extended Deadline
                  Feb 27, 2013: Title/Abstract
                  Mar  6, 2013: Full paper submission

The Fifth IFIP Working Conference on Verified Software: Theories,
Tools, and Experiments follows a successful inaugural working
conference at Zurich in 2005 followed by conferences in Toronto
(2008), Edinburgh (2010), and Philadelphia (2012).  The goal of this
conference is to advance the state of the art in the science and
technology of software verification, through the interaction of theory
development, tool evolution, and experimental validation.

Scope: We welcome submissions describing significant advances in the
production of verified software, i.e., software that has been proved
to meet its functional specifications.  We are especially interested
in submissions describing large-scale verification efforts that
involve collaboration, theory unification, tool integration, and
formalized domain knowledge.  We welcome papers describing novel
experiments and case studies evaluating verification techniques and
technologies.  Topics of interest include education, requirements
modeling, specification languages, specification/verification
case-studies, formal calculi, software design methods, automatic code
generation, refinement methodologies, compositional analysis,
verification tools (e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis, model
checking, theorem proving, satisfiability), tool integration,
benchmarks, challenge problems, and integrated verification
environments.

Submission: We are accepting both long (limited to 20 pages) and short
(limited to 12 pages) paper submissions.  Short submissions also cover
Verification Pearls describing an elegant proof or proof technique.
Submitted research papers and system descriptions must be original and
not submitted for publication elsewhere.  Research paper submissions
must be in LNCS format and must include a cogent and self-contained
description of the ideas, methods, results, and comparison to existing
work.  Submissions of theoretical, practical, and experimental
contributions are equally encouraged, including those that focus on
specific problems or problem domains.

Papers can be submitted at https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vstte2013.
Submissions that arrive late, are not in the proper format, or are too
long will not be considered.  The post-conference proceedings of VSTTE
2013 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series.  Authors
of accepted papers will be requested to sign a form transferring
copyright of their contribution to Springer-Verlag.  The use of LaTeX
and the Springer llncs class files, obtainable from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html, is strongly encouraged.
