Subject: Re: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

OCaml is definitely lacking in this area; I am at the moment working precis=
ely=20
on solving this issue, with a dedicated Gtk editor that runs on Linux, OSX =
and=20
Windows. It is pretty basic at the moment but already has code edition and=
=20
working toplevel interaction (no compilation or project yet).

Release is intended in a few months from now, with sufficient features for=
=20
beginners and students. If successful, it will then be extended to handle=
=20
bigger projects (multi-file, build system integration, etc.).

Until then, you may see the project's github page at
https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-edit-simple (name temporary)
