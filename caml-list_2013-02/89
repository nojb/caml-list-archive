Subject: Re: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

I must say I'm a bit dubious of dedicated editors: people prefer to
use the tools they're familiar with from other languages, and I'm not
really sure what the added value of a different tool would be. There
have been attempts to write editors for OCaml (Cameleon{,2}, zed (
https://github.com/diml/zed )...), so far none of them really gained
traction.

Volunteers work on whatever they fancy and I prefer not to interfere
negatively -- though it's unclear in this case whether this is a
personal side-project or an OCamlPro project. Moreover, all these
efforts have led to interesting byproducts: various libraries from
Cameleon (eg. ocaml-rss http://zoggy.github.com/ocamlrss/ ) and zed (
and in particular the nice toplevel utop https://github.com/diml/utop
).

That said, I would still feel more enthusiastic about a project that
can be used with other tools people use ( this is a good property of
ocp-indent for example ), or directly improving OCaml support about
tools that already have a user base : syntax highlighting libraries
for various editors, etc. For example, Online Client-side
Javascript-implemented In-the-cloud programming editors are all the
rage now, they use a relatively small number of popular Javascript
edition engines under the hood, is there work to do to make sure OCaml
a first-class citizen there?
