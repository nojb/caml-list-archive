Subject: Re: [Caml-list] geany as an ocaml ide

The OCaml installer for windows (
http://protz.github.com/ocaml-installer/ ) optionally downloads and
install Emacs, configured for OCaml use. Couldn't the same approach be
used to install Geany (or whatever modern-beginner-friendly existing
editor that works on Windows) on end-user systems?
