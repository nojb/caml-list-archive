FWIW I'd put color syntax highlighting and autocompletion (like Intellisens=
e) above all else.

Cheers,
Jon.

I think the major point we raised here, that we all want the same from the
editor: syntax highlighting, parsing in the background, invoking tools, edi=
ting over the network etc. However, each of us, have a completely different=
 taste of how we interact with the editor and how we use the GUI. For one p=
erson this might be Emacs which wins, other prefer Code::Blocks. What matte=
rs here is not to focus on GUI but the features that would be accessible fr=
om the different frontends. (which seem to be a little hard, given diversit=
y of the solutions on the market, but perhaps possible)

Certainly one does not exclude the other option!

I just drew the border of the simple editor, and design requriments for the=
 "ModelOnly".

One could think about different incarnations of the same editor, did anybod=
y think about Emacs, beginner mode, with CUA bindings and limited access to=
 the functionality just so to make it easily accessible for the beginners?
