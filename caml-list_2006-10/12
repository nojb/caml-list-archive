The cleaner solution would be to push META support to lablgtk maintainer
directly. Does anyone already tried ?

That was exactly what I needed, thanks. I just have to handle the
conditional META support in lablgtk now.

Well, I hope this won't be necessary anymore with next release, if I
understood correctly how to generate it myself.

You're welcome to checkout current CVS version of camlimages to check.
