I don't really understand what you are doing: why do you generate a list
of continuations instead of a single one? Don't you want a kind of lazy
list?

Does this code really do what you expect? Did you take into
consideration multiple executions of your continuations? I am rather
unconfident with your single mutable variable...

Is this the end of your mail?
