No - rather, it is the ugly intrusion of reality. ;)

As has been already pointed out, it isn't easy to generate code that 
detects this at runtime under a widely varying set of environments and 
conditions... to tighten it up further would likely start costing in 
performance (and what is ocamlopt for?).

A related veiwpoint says that while you still don't understand your 
app's logic and control paths well enough to predict/avoid things like 
runaway stack usage - you use the interpreted version.  THEN you 
switch to the ocamlopt version when you think you are ready (and be 
prepared to switch back if you are proven wrong).
