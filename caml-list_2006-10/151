Hi all,
I'm trying to package my project and I've this small problem on
macosx. As far as know there are 3 ways of deploying ocaml
on mac, namely, via inria, fink, or godi.

My goal is to give a very straightforward way of installing the
compiler, findlib and extlib. My first attempt was via the fink
packages. The problem is that findlib is not available via fink and the
packages in fink/unstable do not provide meta files. In particular
extlib (ocaml-lib package) is installed in `ocamlc -where` instead of
the `ocamlc -where`\extlib directory messing things up.

Then I tried via godi, but as far as I understand, you need to download,
compile everything via godi, and there is no clear way (that I can see,
but I can be wrong) to have a system wide installation. Moreover I see
godi as too 'difficult' to use for my users.

As last attempt, I've installed the ocaml img from the inria website.
It's all nice and good, but this also mean that I've to manually install
both extlib and findlib. Moreover, the mac package from inria does not
install in /sw and therefore isn't easy to mix with fink packages.

Did I miss something ? My ideal solution would be to have fink packages
with meta files for everything ... Did anybody has already done
something similar ? How do people release software with multiple 
dependencies on mac ?

How easy/difficult is to port debian packages to fink ?

thanks :)
