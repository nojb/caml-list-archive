=========================================
Fourth International Workshop on
Practical Aspects of High-level Parallel Programming (PAPP 2007)
part of The International Conference on Computational Science
May 27-30, 2007, University of Beijing, China
http://f.loulergue.free.fr/PAPP2007/index.html
=========================================


Aims and scope


Computational Science applications are more and more complex to develop
and require more and more computing power. Parallel and grid computing
are solutions to the increasing need for computing power. High level
languages offer a high degree of abstraction which ease the development
of complex systems. Moreover, being based on formal semantics, it is
possible to certify the correctness of critical parts of the applications.


Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages such
as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming, parallel
execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries, etc. have
produced methods and tools that improve the price/performance ratio of
parallel software, and broaden the range of target applications.


The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level
programming languages and tools (performance predictors working on
high-level parallel/grid source code, visualisations of abstract
behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors, high-level GRID resource
managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.), applications in all
fields of computational science, benchmarks and experiments. Research on
high-level grid programming is particularly relevant.


The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the
development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing and
computational science researchers who are potential users of these
languages and tools.


Topics


We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:


  * high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for
parallel and grid computing
  * high-level parallel language design, implementation and optimisation
  * functional, logic, constraint programming for parallel,
distributed and grid computing systems
  * algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries
  * generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic
skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries
  * applications in all fields of high-performance computing (using
high-level tools)
  * benchmarks and experiments using such languages and tools


Paper submission and publication


Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as part
of the ICCS proceedings.


Submission must be done through the ICCS website:
http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2007/papers/upload.php.
We invite you to submit a full paper of 8 pages formatted according to
the rules of LNCS, describing new and original results, no later than
December 12, 2006. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of
the authors to register and present the paper. An early email to
papp2007 at free.fr with your intention to submit a paper would be
greatly appreciated (especially if you have doubts about the relevance
of your paper).


Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop. Authors will be
invited to submit extended and revised versions of their papers.
Accepted manuscripts will be published in a special issue of Scalable
Computing: Practice and Experience.
