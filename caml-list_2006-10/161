Yes, this is the point. My users don't have big technical skills and 
godi can be a bit too much for them. I'm looking at all in one solution
to install my software that targets non technical users. 
Asking people to learn how to use godi in order to install my package
defeats my purpose... Nothing wrong with godi. It's a well engineered
system, but it just not the right tool my for goals :)

Reg the system wide installation: MacOsX users are locked in the file
system structure given by their vendor.  Fink solution, it to use a
completely different name-space. Having an other user to handle ocaml
related software via godi, effectively means to use a third name-space.
This can be a bit annoying as it requests non-standard path settings
(that can be set system wide, but still... most mac users don't have a
sys admin to take care of their desktop computer). I totally understand
and subscribe to your security consideration. But while having two or
more name-spaces can be seen as acceptable for some users, it can be too
difficult to deal with for others.

I think, in the end, I'm going to integrate the findlib libraries in my
project and cook it up in a way to avoid any dependencies except for the 
ocaml toolchain.

thanks :)
