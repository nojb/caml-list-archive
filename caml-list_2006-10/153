Hello,

It is not difficult to create or modify fink packages. In fact, I  
think it is easier than creating Debian packages. It involves writing  
an .info file that describes where the source is available, how it  
should be compiled, how the installation tree is constructed, etc. See:
http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/quick-start-pkg/index.php?phpLang=en
http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/packaging/index.php?phpLang=en
And:
find /sw/fink -name "*.info"

You could develop new/alternative packages and offer them through a  
local web server for apt-get. Alternatively, you could consider  
submitting your .info-files to fink. As you say, someone needs to  
package findlib.

Have you considered static linking?

Best,
