Does anyone know of a good SQLite 3 wrapper for ocaml, in particular,  
one they have used with mac os x?  Christian Szegedy's wrapper  
(http://metamatix.org/~ocaml/ocaml_sqlite3.html), seems to fit the  
bill.  However this was tested on linux, and I had a bear of a time  
convincing it to compile on darwin and finally got "Bus errors"  
running the test code.  If anyone could point me to a wrapper they  
are currently having success with on a mac, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Ken Sullivan
