These headers are those of the osx specific image loading =20
abstraction. Camlimages doesn't use this abstraction=13 so there is no =20=

chance you'll be able to compile camlimages using these headers. What =20=

you want is png.h, jpeglib.h, tiff.h, etc. Anyway as I told in my =20
previous email it seems that the dynamic libraries in imageio do not =20
include all the functions you get when you compile the corresponding =20
library by yourself, so they aren't really usefull by their own.

Doesn't really make more sense. First you can use libpng without =20
depending on fink, then iirc camlimage doesn't use ImageMagic at all.

The only real option in my opinion is to statically link against the =20
image libraries to distribute your application.

Best,

Daniel
