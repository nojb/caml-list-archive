Hi all,

I've created two Mac packages for extlib and findlib and I've submitted
patches respectively against extlib-1.5 and findlib-1.1.2pl1.  As far as
I can see, these packages play well with the mac package of the ocaml
toolchain from inria.

For those who are interested, you can get patches and packages here.
http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~abate/macosx/

It would be great if these packages could be hosted somewhere more
official (hint hint :)) 

I haven't tested them very carefully ... so please let me know if I've
done something silly...

:)
