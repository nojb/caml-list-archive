Install the files on your Mac. Then use
/Developer/Applications/Utilities/Package Maker (comes with Apple's
developer tools bundled with OS X) to make a "Single Package Project",
then click "Assist Me...". It'll prompt you for all of the files you
want to include in your package (you can drag&drop from Finder), and
allow you to specify target paths for each. Finally, it'll create a
Mac OS X GUI installer for you to distribute to your users.

You can also make packages for each component and bundle them in a
"Metapackage Project", which bundles several packages into a single
installer.
