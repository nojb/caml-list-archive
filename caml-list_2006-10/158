This is only partly correct. It is absolutely no problem to install
additional libraries. Just do it, these are of course not managed by
godi, and you are on your own in questions of upgrades etc.

What is kind of problematic is to replace godi versions of packages by
your own ones (imagine you want to upgrade or patch a library that is
needed by other libraries). This is possible, though, but requires some
understanding of godi concepts. In particular, you can have local
sources for godi packages that replace or override the official ones.

It is even possible to provide an adapted version of godi to your users.

It is unclear what you want here. The recommended way for a system wide
installation is to have a special "godi" user as owner of the files. You
must see that godi is a management system that does not need superuser
privileges. Although you can install godi as superuser, this is not
recommended because you execute third-party programs even if you only
install packages, i.e. this is a security risk.

This is different from other package managers that depend on superuser
privileges, and maybe announce that as ability for system wide
installations.

Can you please elaborate on that? It is clear that godi isn't made for a
pure consumer of software, but aims at developers who usually also have
basic administration skills.
