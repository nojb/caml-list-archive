My application is basically a front-end (written in camlp4) plus
libraries, to generate ocaml code that then is compiled to generate an
application... The compilation process is all well hidden from the user,
but I still need the ocaml tool-chain to do the job. So yes, I'm going
to distribute the compiled version of my library, but this also needs
ocamlfind and ocamlc to be of any use.

Something that I could do it to create a bundle with the ocaml
tool-chain, findlib and my application all together. Is that I've never
created .app on Mac and I still have to decide if this is the best way.
I've also to say that I don't particularly like to develop for Mac.

Is the xml file (or scripts) that generates the ocaml toolchain binary
(.app) from inria available somewhere ? It can be a good starting point
to learn... is it in the ocaml source tree ?
