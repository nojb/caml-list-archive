You know that there is no fork on Windows?

If there wasn't the Windows requirement I could recommend this:

You may have a look at ocamlnet2. It includes the netplex library that
manages parent/children relationships between either forked processes or
threads. You can use SunRPC for communication (or whatever you like, but
SunRPC support is included). The bad news is that it does not run on the
native Windows port, not even in the threaded variant (because there's
no socketpair...).

Ah yes, I have a war story, but cannot tell it now. I can only say it is
used for a really big commercial project.
