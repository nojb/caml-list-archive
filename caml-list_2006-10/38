There is the ImageIO.framework.

Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Resources/
 > ls *.dylib
libGIF.dylib*           libJPEG.dylib*          =20
libPng.dylib*           libRaw.dylib*
libJP2.dylib*           libOpenEXR.dylib*       =20
libRadiance.dylib*      libTIFF.dylib*

But header files are not included (these libraries are used to =20
implement an osx specific abstraction). Moreover, by looking at the =20
output of

 > otool -T -v *.dylib

it seems to me that not every symbol defined by these libraries are =20
exported.

ocamlsdl I guess. IIRC you don't have access to the menu bar in SDL =20
apps. But you don't have inversion of control -- you own the main =20
loop -- maybe that's what he meant by more "customizable". Compared =20
to glut, a limitation you get is that you can have only one window to =20=

render (this limitation will be lifted in the upcoming version 1.3).
