F# is not viable since i'm developing for Solaris. I also believe the
.NET GC is not good enough for real-time systems. Clojure running
under real-time Java might be interesting.

It's too bad that INRIA is not interested in fixing this bug. No
matter what people say I consider this a bug. Two cores is standard by
now, I'm used to 8, next year 32 and so on. OCaml will only become
more and more irrelevant. I hate to see that happening.

I think right now only Erlang got this right and they have a great
library for developing enterprise applications too!

The first step for OCaml would be to be able to run multiple
communicating instances of the runtime bound to one core each in one
process and have them communicate via lock free queues.
