    Knowledge Representation.
Implementation:  Compilation,  Memory  Management,  Virtual  Machines,
    Parallelism.
Environments:    Program    Analysis,   Transformation,    Validation,
    Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Testing.
Language Issues: Concurrency,  Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher
    Order, Types, Modes, Assertions, Programming Techniques.
Related  Paradigms:  Abductive   Logic  Programming,  Inductive  Logic
    Programming, Constraint Logic Programming, Answer-Set Programming.
Applications:  Databases, Data  Integration  and Federation,  Software
    Engineering,  Natural Language Processing,  Web and  Semantic Web,
    Agents, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics.

In  addition to the  presentations of  accepted papers,  the technical
program will  include plenary invited talks in  association with other
FLoC conferences,  as well as ICLP invited  talks, advanced tutorials,
the doctoral consortium, and several workshops.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

The four  broad categories for  submissions are: (1)  technical papers
for describing  technically sound,  innovative ideas that  can advance
the state  of the  art of logic  programming; (2)  application papers,
where the emphasis will be  on their impact on the application domain;
(3) system and tool papers, where the emphasis will be on the novelty,
practicality, usability  and general  availability of the  systems and
tools described;  and (4) short  papers/posters, for ongoing  work not
yet ready for full publication and research project overviews.

    All   papers  must   describe  original,   previously  unpublished
research,  and must  not simultaneously  be submitted  for publication
elsewhere.   They  must  be  written in  English.   Technical  papers,
application  papers, and  system and  tool papers  must not  exceed 15
pages. The  limit for short papers  / posters is  5 pages. Submissions
must          be         made          in          TPLP         format
(ftp://ftp.cup.cam.ac.uk/pub/texarchive/journals/latex/tlp-cls/)   via
the      Easychair      submission      system,      available      at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp2010.

IMPORTANT DATES
 Paper registration deadline:      January 26, 2010
 Submission deadline:              February 2, 2010
 Notification to authors:          March 20, 2010
 Camera-ready copy due:            April 21, 2010
 Conference:                       July 16-19, 2010

PAPER PUBLICATION

All accepted long  papers will be published in  the journal Theory and
Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge U. Press (CUP), in one
or more special issues.

    In order to ensure the quality of the final version, papers may be
subject  to more  than one  round of  refereeing (within  the decision
period) and/or "shepherding."

    At  the time  of the  conference CUP  will make  the web  page for
this(ese) TPLP issue(s) available  including volume and issue numbers,
table  of  contents, page  numbers,  and  the  papers themselves.  All
registered  attendants  at the  conference  will  get  a password  for
on-line access to this web page during the conference and indefinitely
from then on ("lifetime access"), which  can be used to read papers on
line, download them,  or print them for personal  use. Attendants will
also receive all the papers in a USB memory stick at the conference.

    For short  papers /  posters the journal  issue(s) will  include a
listing of  the titles and authors of  these papers, as well  as a URL
pointing to their printable copy. Short papers / posters will also get
space in the program for presentation.

SPONSOR

The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

The Association for Logic  Programming has funds to assist financially
disadvantaged  participants and,  specially, students  in order  to be
able to attend the conference.

WORKSHOPS

The ICLP  2009 program  will include several  workshops, held  also as
part of FLoC. They are perhaps the best places for the presentation of
preliminary work, undeveloped novel ideas,  and new open problems to a
wide  and   interested  audience  with   opportunities  for  intensive
discussions and project collaboration.

DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM

The  6th  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC)  on  Logic  Programming  provides
research students  with the opportunity  to present and  discuss their
research  directions,  and to  obtain  feedback  from  both peers  and
world-renown experts in the  field. Accepted participants will receive
partial  financial   support  to  attend   the  event  and   the  main
conference. The best paper and  presentation from the DC will be given
the  opportunity to  present in  a special  session of  the  main ICLP
conference.

CONFERENCE VENUE / CO-LOCATION

In 2010  (as in the previous two  FLoC editions) ICLP will  be held as
part of the Fifth Federated  Logic Conference, FLoC 2010 in Edinburgh,
Scotland,  U.K., July  16-19,  2010.  FLoC is  held  every four  years
bringing  together   several  international  conferences   related  to
mathematical   logic  and   computer   science.  Other   participating
conferences are:

   - Computer-Aided Verification (CAV),
   - Int'l Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR),
   - Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP),
   - Logic in Computer Science (LICS),
   - Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA), and
   - Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT).

Plenary events involving multiple conferences are planned.
