Firs of all, mylib.cma is simply an archive of OCaml modules. It may=20
contain multiple modules, and might not contain a module called Mylib.

You have to ensure that mylib.cmo is included in mylib.cma. Moreover,=20
when you create mylib.cma, you also need a compiled interface, i.e. a=20
mylib.cmi file. It's an interface for mylib.cmo. Without it, there's no=20
description of module Mylib in mylib.cma.

> The command used to compile the test app is
>=20
>  ocamlc -verbose mylib.cma -c Main.ml

You've got something fundamentally wrong here:

Out of main.ml (lower case for the the first letter), you first create a=20
main.cmo file. And also a main.mli file with ocamlc -i. You compile the=20
main.mli file to main.cmi. Then you create the mylib.cma archive from=20
main.cmo and main.cmi.

And mylib.cma will contain the module Main. Not the module Mylib.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Here, you're declaring the submodule Mylib of the module Main. Also=20
known as Main.Mylib. Not as Mylib.

There are some tools, such as ocamldumpobj and ocamlobjinfo. Forgot=20
which one applies to .cmas.

Can't help you here.
