Yes, nice goals - but hard to achieve if you only have limited
resources. Also, don't forget that Perl attracted a lot of sysadmins,
and for them it is a lot of fun to create something like CPAN. For the
typical Ocaml developer it is scripting hell. Finally, there is the
question of creating "normative pressure" so sources have some formal
uniformity - normal for sysadmins, but a no-go for the creative
ocamlists.

I'd say it is a different project than GODI to make sources available,
browsable and searchable. There's some overlap, though.
