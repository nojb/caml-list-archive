Hey,

I'm struggling with this for few days.

We have a static C library, instead of "libsomename.a", it's "somename.a",
so we could not link it in the usually way like "-lsomename".
In myocamlbuild.ml, I did try to add it's head files dir into cflags, and
"/somelib/dir/somename.a" to clibs. This works for Mac, however, in Linux,
it won't pass the linking process.

Any idea is appreciated ~

Thank you.
Lin
