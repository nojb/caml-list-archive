Hi!

I've been using Erlang and C++ to build a soft real-time system. As
the project has evolved we've needed to write more and more of the
code in C++ in order to achieve our latency requirements. But C++ is
not as performant as you might think until you start to write your own
allocators and cache aligning mallocs and datastructures. I've never
liked C++ so I decided to try OCaml and built a simple 100 line
program to build order books for Nasdaq. Turns out OCaml has really
competitive performance while being a really nice language.

However OCaml is broken! It does not provide any support for multicore
architectures, which by now is considered a bug! It doesn't even allow
me to load multiple runtimes into one C program.

Please fix OCaml! The first step would be to support multiple runtimes
running in the same process communicating using message queues.
