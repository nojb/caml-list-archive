It's great to hear such an effort, I will be following the
developments. Of course OpenCL will be just as good. Pretty similar,
anyway. I've seen some restrictions in OpenCL's C99 extension for
compiling kernels, which is *not good* and might ultimately impair the
implementation of a functional language.  I don't see how one could
think of putting any restrictions. We didn't have to invent any
restrictions when compiling to hardware!

At any rate, the obvious question from a compiler standpoint is,
cannot we compile ocaml to C, is there a way to translate to C first
and then to whatever works for kernel? I know little about the ocaml
compiler so please forgive my naive questions.

Best,
