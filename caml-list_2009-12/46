Looks interesting -- have you tried compiling it and fixing the SDL
problems?

This is an area where we could do better than CPAN by allowing
non-maintainers to branch inactive projects.  (Backing the whole thing
with git instead of tarballs makes branching easy and lightweight -
the challenge then being to organize it, making the branches
searchable, navigable and possible to merge later).
