I agree with most of what Dario Teixeira wrote, except for one small 
quibble:

Actually, this gives these projects an incentive to insure that Ocaml 
survives, which gives an incentive for some 'maintenance engineers' to 
be kept on-staff to insure that Ocaml does not bit-rot.  This gives only 
quite partial incentive to a team of researchers (the creators of Ocaml) 
to do maintenance (as that is usually not research, thus not the kind of 
work of interest to researchers).  And entropy is a real problem -- 
Ocaml is now quite mature, which means that radical changes are well 
nigh impossible; this is a serious disincentive for researchers.  End of 
quibble.

Personally, I would really really want to see a 4.00 release which 
really warrants that name.  The 3.XX line can be maintained for a few 
more years while people switch, in the same way gcc did this. 

In any case, I have nevertheless voted with my time and effort: I have 1 
large project being implemented in Ocaml, 3 medium ones in metaocaml, 
although I must admit that I have some 'research' code in Haskell (and 
in Maple, but that's another story).
