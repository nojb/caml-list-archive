I've managed to compile this RC on Windows 7 x64 using the MinGW 32-bit port
(with ocaml-calendar 2.02, ocaml-csv 1.1.7, extlib 1.5.1, findlib 1.2.5,
json-static 0.9.8, json-wheel 1.0.6, ocamlnet 2.2.9, ocamlsha 1.5,
ocaml-pcre 6.0.1, pgocaml 1.4 and spiderCaml 0.2).

OCaml seems fine, but.....

The latest version of Cygwin seems to contain a questionable change to the
handling of symlinks which created more trouble building OCaml than previous
versions (as flexlink runs "natively" and not within Cygwin) - although I've
built OCaml and these libraries successfully within bash, I'm having trouble
with ocamlopt when run outside bash (my usual setup is cmd + GnuWin32).

Has anyone else got ocamlopt working properly with non-trivial code (C stubs
and so on) on Windows outside Cygwin? I'm getting errors from gcc trying to
run cc1 which I think is to do with symlink misery and also I can't link
anything with ocamlopt unless running in bash. The Cygwin team's decision to
revert to the default to their own internal symlink format is almost as
questionable as Microsoft's making the API for creating NTFS symlinks in
Vista/2008 require administrator privileges but unlike Microsoft I'm sure
they actually have some good reason for it...
