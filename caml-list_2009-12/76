Well, there's one thing I cannot do for you is to learn to browse.
There are at least 11 direct links to these pages from React.html,
without counting the two direct module definition links which I
thought you would have clicked at some point.

Now I'm very impressed you went that far ignoring all this documentation.

About Lwt, I'm open to any suggestion to make react easier to interact
with (however at the moment I don't want react to depend on Lwt). Lwt
is also something I want to get into at some point but now is not the
time.  I saw some kind of support was added to Lwt for react. If the
authors of Lwt are on this list, maybe they want to comment on what
their vision is.

Best,

Daniel
