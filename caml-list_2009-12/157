Hi,

first of all thanks for the replies, and for not misunderstanding my =
email.

i dont want to go into a which-programming-language-is-best-for-what =
discussion (as this will never end), but at this point i wanted to know =
if ocaml is still alive, i.e. if you can still easily download and =
install it on a variety of OS, and if it will be supported in the =
future. i am working on an open-source project, so beside your arguments =
(which of course are valid), it is also important if people who decide =
not to download the binaries, but rather download the source, will be =
able to compile it. for me personally, i just like functional =
programming, and i like to learn new stuff from time to time. and to be =
honest, i am very happy to have found applications in the project which =
i can use a reason to include a functional programming language in the =
code :)

so, thanks for your replies. i am confident again, and will continue to =
use ocaml.

regards,
keyan=
