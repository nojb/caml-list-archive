I apologize.  I read your message too quickly and thought that you
were using "last_keysym" to define "istr".  (And I chose the word
because it was part of "FRP". :)

Yes, (I think) I did understand what the type "time -> 'a option" was
trying to represent.  It just doesn't seem a very good match for the
concept.  It would appear (from the type) that events could have
nonzero duration, but that doesn't match my intuition of events.
