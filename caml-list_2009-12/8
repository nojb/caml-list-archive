hi,

i am currently getting into caml again, and would like to integrate it =
with my c++ project.

the project i am working on, is completly build with cmake. i tried to =
search the internet to find ready cmake-scripts or tutorials how to =
integrate cmake into an exisisting cmake-project, but could not find =
anything. my question thereore is, how is it done best?

what i want to do is the following:
in addition to the main-project build, i want to build my own =
code-analysis tools.

make -> build main project + all ocaml-tools
make ocaml-tool-1 -> build only cmake-tool-1
etc.

does anyone have any experience with that?

regards,
keyan=
