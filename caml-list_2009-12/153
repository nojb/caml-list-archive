Hi,

i have a large project written in C++, for which i am planing to write =
add-ons and tools in ocaml, e.g. different tools to analyse my code =
(dependency stuff), an interpreter for a script-language i plan to =
include, etc, etc. form my time at the uni i remembered that ocaml =
allows to compile libraries which can be included in c/c++ program, and =
i know people who use it extensively in other projects. therefore, i =
decided to give ocaml a try. i like functional programming, and my first =
steps with ocaml are very promising.

following this discussion, i am not so sure anymore, if ocaml is a good =
decision. may be i got this discussion wrong, but if ocaml is dying out, =
i might have to look for another functional programming language to use =
with my project.

please dont take this email as an offence. i am just curious. at this =
point, i can still easily look for an alternative to ocaml, so its best =
to ask now.

regards,
keyan=
