I think you will have to render the PDF first into a simple image
format like PPM, and then use GTK to display that.  I don't know of
any OCaml bindings for libpoppler, but you can use the standalone
program "pdftoppm" from the poppler-utils package.  Then you can
display the .ppm file as follows:

    let file = Sys.argv.(1) in
    GMain.init ();
    let window = GWindow.window ~title: "Show Image" () in
    let image = GMisc.image ~file ~packing: window#add () in
    window#connect#destroy ~callback: GMain.quit;
    window#show ();
    GMain.main ()
