The PLplot project (http://plplot.sf.net/) uses CMake for its build
system, including bindings for OCaml.  The most relevant files for the
OCaml portion are:

http://plplot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/plplot/trunk/cmake/modules/ocaml.c=
make?revision=3D10526&view=3Dmarkup
http://plplot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/plplot/trunk/bindings/ocaml/CMakeL=
ists.txt?revision=3D10527&view=3Dmarkup
http://plplot.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/plplot/trunk/bindings/ocaml/plcair=
o/CMakeLists.txt?revision=3D10528&view=3Dmarkup

The first file (ocaml.cmake) performs detects the presence of the
OCaml compiler(s), camlidl and a few libraries.  The two
CMakeLists.txt files define the actual compilation steps for two
separate components of the OCaml bindings (camlidl + C + OCaml).

CMake does not have formal OCaml support, so all of the compilation
commands, outputs and dependencies are specified by hand.

Hope this helps.
