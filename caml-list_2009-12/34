If I understand correctly, GODI site does not store any of the source
tarballs, but the makefiles download the sources directly from their
respective home, does it ? Can't we use the MASTER_SITE_BACKUP make
variables to have one or several backup sites ?

If it's usefull I can try to setup a server to download every possible
source tarballs and serve as such a site backup.

But would it be usefull ?

Why is it any better than something like that :

http://docs.camlcity.org/docs/godipkg/3.10/godi-frontc/doc/godi-frontc/html/Ctoxml.html

Ok ; unfortunately no such authority is required to name the few
(compared to perl) ocaml libraries.

That would be nice to have in Godi as well.

I like godi_console (despite laking fancy colors :-), although I'd
like a simpler command line tool to be available as well.
