Reading up on this, I don't think using -fPIC on amd64 has a performance 
penalty since it has the %rip register. Also it appears that gcc by default 
uses indirect addressing via %rip in the generated asm.

I'm first working out the details for a larger application to make sure that 
also works.
I'll file a bug when I have a fully working solution.
