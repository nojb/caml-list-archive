Camlp4 may help here; Thomas Gazagnaire and I have been working on a =
language-integrated ORM, and it has a reliable type-conv hash generator =
library [1].

It works with mutable records as well as immutable ones (the main =
limitation of the built-in polymorphic hash function) but it could be =
used to generate explicit comparison functions for shared memory as =
well.  We need to split out the various support libraries in the ORM =
separately at some point anyway, so if the hash generator is of any use =
I'll cut a release.
