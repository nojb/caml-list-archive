Maybe you stay in L3 cache with the more compact heap, what is your resident set
size with and without the additional compactions? Performance on modern
processors is a riddle inside an enigma (someone once reported improved
performance after removing the -unsafe compile option, which has the single
function of making the code faster by removing array bounds checks).

brown and broken. Thus we have PHP. http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1463
