You cannot do that today easily.

The French OpenGPU project -funded by French public money http://www.competitivite.gouv.fr/spip.php?article581 (in which 
I will be a partner)- will start in january 2010 to deal with such issues (probably with OpenCL, not CUDA). There won't 
be usable results soon (and I have no idea if at end of the project, there will be a simple solution to your problem).

You could try to help the OpenGPU partners involved. Ask Emmanuel Chailloux (in CC).

If you need today to call a CUDA kernel from Ocaml, you have to use C!

Regards.
