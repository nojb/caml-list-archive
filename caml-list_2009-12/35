Yes of course. You can use ocamlcore.org website to do that. I have
already a proof of concept using "uscan" + Debian watch file, to scan
for new upstream on a weekly basis.

Send me a private mail, if you want to proceed.

Once the website is setup, we can use "rsync" to propagate it
(ssh.ocamlcore.org has rsync installed).

Everything is ready on *.ocamlcore.org, we just need some volunteer to
do the work.
