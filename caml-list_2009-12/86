I suspect it will work if only the #include directives pertaining to Caml
header files are marked as 'extern "C"'.  You just need to tell the compiler to
use the C linkage convention rather than the C++ name mangling convention for
the external Caml functions that your program (implicitly or explicitly) calls.
This is done at the function prototype site, not the call site.  Everything
else in the program should be unaffected.

Xavier, could the headers have the guards added?  (I only spot-checked one,
mlvalues.h, and that didn't appear to have it).
