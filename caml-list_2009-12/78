Hello list,

Prompted by Stefano Zacchiroli and Grégoire Henry's recent success in
resurrecting CamlJava, I just migrated a number of my inactive OCaml
side projects to the forge on ocamlcore.org:

- CamlIDL (stub code generator for Caml/C interface)
- CamlJava (low-level interface between Caml and Java through JNI)
- CamlZIP (library to handle zip and gzip files)
- Cryptokit (library of cryptographic primitives)
- OCamlAgrep (library for string searching with errors)
- OCamlMPI (Caml interface for the MPI parallel programming model)
- SpamOracle (Bayesian mail filter)

The purpose of this migration is to make it easy for others to
participate in (or even take over) the maintenance and development of
these projects, two tasks that I've very much neglected lately.

So, if you find these projects useful and feel like participating in
one way or another, just create an account on forge.ocamlcore.org and
ask to join these projects.

Also, the kind folks who package these projects are welcome to update
their upstream URLs to point to the files on ocamlcore.org instead of
my home pages: currently, they are identical, but further releases, if
any, will be on ocamlcore.org.

Cheers,

- Xavier Leroy
