Wolf Hall (2009 Booker Prize winner)




Hilary Mantel takes a slice of Tudor history and allows the reader to view =
it through the eyes of Thomas Cromwell, who rose from his origins as the so=
n of a blacksmith to become the chief minister of King Henry VIII. From his=
 humble origins, he manages to become an important advisor to the ill-fated=
 Cardinal Wolsey, who, as everyone knows, started his downhill slide becaus=
e of his inability to provide Henry VIII with a Church-sanctioned divorce f=
rom Katherine of Aragon. It is, ironically, Wolsey's fall that begins Cromw=
ell's rise. Cromwell survives by his own motto, "inch by inch forward. Neve=
r mind if he calls you an eel or a worm or a snake. Head down, don't provok=
e him." His fortune is on the ascendant, throughout the story, but as every=
one also knows, fortune is fleeting, and especially in this time, largely a=
t the whim of the king.





2666



Written under the specter of his own death, Roberto Bolano's "2666" is a st=
atement of the capacity of cruelty that resides in the darkest heart of hum=
anity. The novel is really five novellas, thematically tied together, and c=
entered around the fictional town of Santa Teresa (Cuidad Juarez in our wor=
ld) where hundreds of young women are being raped and murdered. The plot of=
 the novel takes a back seat to the real driving force which is the nightma=
re landscape of Santa Teresa. There is some great yarn spinning as Bolano i=
s a gifted storyteller, but "2666" lacks any overall narrative with a tradi=
tional beginning, middle, and end. In this way the novel resembles "Infinit=
e Jest", as there are multiple characters who interact peripherally and who=
se meaningful, and potentially fatal, interaction takes place outside of th=
e text as the reader must project more narrative into the end of the novel.




Each character is moving closer and closer to what David Foster Wallace cal=
ls "the default setting" of which there is a "constant gnawing sense of hav=
ing had, and lost, some infinite thing." This is the ultimate reason for "2=
666" as Bolano was racing against his own death to make a final statement a=
bout the world in which we live. When we look back in the year 2666 we will=
 see these horrific acts - the Holocaust, the murders in Cuidad Juarez - no=
t as singular acts of unfamiliar human conduct, but as two examples of the =
all to familiar trait of human cruelty. And just as today no one remembers =
13th century atrocities, in 2666 all the pain, suffering, and questioning o=
f our characters will be dim reflections of the invincible living.




Inherent Vice



Pynchon's first stab at "genre" fiction is a rowdy, rollicking romp through=
 the classic detective noir genre. While it's certainly missing a lot of Py=
nchon's trademark existentialist mischief, Pynchon proves he's adept at wri=
ting a pretty good detective novel; Pynchon does a terrific job of mimickin=
g novelists like Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, and "Inherent Vice"=
 captures the pace, twists and turns of a work like "The Big Sleep."




Superfreakonomics



Whether you read the first installment of "Freakonomics" or not, grab this =
book and read with an open mind. Levitt and Dubner attempt to use principle=
s of economics (i.e. statistical analysis) to uncover the hidden side of cu=
rrent and historical events. Although they are practicing economists, they =
see the fallacy of the premise behind modern economic theory



In this book, the authors cover economic benefits of prostitution, the irre=
levancy of global warming, the near impossible hunt for global terrorists a=
nd the next to impossible means to measure who is a good doctor and who is =
not.




The Brain That Changes Itself




Doidge takes the reader on a tour of the latest happenings in the world of =
brain research and therapies resulting from it. "The Brain That Changes Its=
elf" is a great overview of current neuroscience and an impassioned plea fo=
r humans to use the brain's plasticity so that all of us can be successful =
learners - and unlearners.



New advances in technology over the past few decades have given us a way of=
 mapping living brains, and have shown us the brain has ways of reshaping i=
tself to overcome damage and dysfunction. The brain is, indeed, plastic, an=
d far more adaptable than the current belief in localization allows.





The Pleasures And Sorrows Of Work



Swiss-born, UK-based writer Alain de Botton is the son of the late financia=
l pioneer Gilbert de Botton, who left his family a trust fund of more than =
=A3200 million. However, it has been reported that de Botton leaves this va=
st fortune untapped and lives off only what he earns from writing.



It is thus both ironic and suitable that the title of his latest book is "T=
he Pleasures And Sorrows Of Work": Only one who does not have to work for a=
 living would have the luxury to ponder how and why people spend their live=
s doing so.


Through his keen observation and lyricism de Botton can make a quotidian oc=
currence appear noble and even awe-inspiring. He examines the staggering ac=
cumulation of effort put in to cater to our various needs - a web of activi=
ty which, in today's globalised world, can seem remote, literally unimagina=
ble.


In a bid to expose some of these processes he has traversed the globe, toge=
ther with photographer Richard Baker. A particularly eye-opening photo essa=
y sees them follow a tuna fish (or at least, a haul of tuna), from its bloo=
dy killing in the hands of a Maldivian fisherman all the way to a Bristol, =
England dining table, where a precocious eight-year-old muses how the fishe=
s' ghosts will "one day gather together to exact terrible revenge on humani=
ty for shortening their lives and transporting their corpses around the ear=
th for supper."
