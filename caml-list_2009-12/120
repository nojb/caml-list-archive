Event-based systems are rapidly gaining importance in many application
domains ranging from real time monitoring systems in production, logisti=
cs
and networking to complex event processing in finance and security. The
event based paradigm has gathered momentum as witnessed by current effor=
ts
in areas including event-driven architectures, complex event processing,=

business process management and modelling, Grid computing, Web services
notifications, information dissemination, event stream processing, and
message-oriented middleware. The various communities dealing with event
based systems have made progress in different aspects of the problem. Th=
e
DEBS conference attempts to bring together researchers and practitioners=

active in the various subcommunities to share their views and reach a
common understanding.

The scope of the conference covers all topics relevant to event-based
computing ranging from those discussed in related disciplines (e.g.,
coordination, software engineering, peer-to-peer systems, Grid computing=
,
and streaming databases), over domain-specific topics of event-based
computing (e.g., workflow management systems, mobile computing, pervasiv=
e
and ubiquitous computing, sensor networks, user interfaces, component
integration, Web services, and embedded systems), to enterprise related
topics (e.g., complex event detection, enterprise application integratio=
n,
real time enterprises, and Web services notifications).

The topics addressed by the conference include (but are not limited to):=


Models, Architectures and Paradigms
- Event-driven architectures
- Basic interaction models
- Event algebras, event schemas and type systems
- Languages for event correlation and patterns, streaming and continuous=

=A0=A0queries, data fusion
- Models for static and dynamic environments
- Complex event processing
- Design and programming methodologies
- Event-based business process management and modeling
- Experimental methodologies
- Performance modeling and prediction based on analytic approaches

Middleware Infrastructures for Event-Based Computing
- Federated event-based systems
- Middleware for actuator and sensor networks
- Algorithms and protocols
- Event dissemination based on p2p systems
- Context and location awareness
- Fault-tolerance, reliability, availability, and recovery
- Security issues
- (Self-)Management
- Mobility and resource constrained device support
- Streaming queries, transformations, or correlation engines

Applications, Experiences, and Requirements
- Use cases and applications of event-based systems
- Real-world application deployments using event-based middleware
- Domain-specific deployments of event-based systems
- Real-world data characterising event-based applications
- Benchmarks, performance evaluations, and testbeds
- Application requirements for next-generation event-based solutions
- Relation to other architectures
- Enterprise application integration
- Event-driven business process management
- Information logistics
- Seamless integration of event-based mechanisms into middleware

Author Instructions

Five types of submissions will be accepted: research papers, industry
papers, demos, posters and fast abstract contributions.

Submitted papers should clearly indicate their type. Papers must not
exceed the given number of pages for the respective submission category:=

12 pages for research track papers, 10 pages for industry papers, 4
pages industry experience papers, 2 pages for demo, poster papers, and
for fast abstract submissions. Further details about each submission
type can be found on the DEBS'10 website (http://debs10.doc.ic.ac.uk).

All submissions must be original and unpublished. Submissions must be in=

the ACM format for conference proceedings. The conference adopts a doubl=
e
blind review process. Industry submissions will be evaluated by an
Industrial Programme Committee. Accepted papers will be published by the=

ACM and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library. All contributions
except for fast abstracts will be included in the official proceedings.

More information about tutorial proposals can be found on the DEBS'10
website.
