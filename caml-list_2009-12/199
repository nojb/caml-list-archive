So if you add a (sleep 60) to the ocaml code then ocaml gets even
more worse than F#? You are comparing an implementation that is
specifically optimized to use things F# is good at and ocaml is
bad. To give a fair comparison you need to optimize the implementation
to the language.

I can pin each child to one core and the scheduler will move it there.
I would expect a multi-core ocaml to actualy do this internaly already
so there is on GC threads per core ocaml runs on. But that depends on
the GC implementation that will be used.

You mean that you didn't implement that way. I can easily express that
with closures and pre-forked worker threads.

That seems awfully ineficient. Then you have a million children
running on maybe 4 cores and each job queue holds no job.

I think we mean different things by children. By children I mean what
the kernel sees as children. Newly forked threads. I think you mean
jobs that get put into the queues. There is no reason to fork a new
system thread every time the parallel quicksort splits an array in
two.

No, it is the insane way. Use closures.

Which there is one example so far for ocaml. Maybe not a verry good
one. Last simple benchmarking I remember it was like 3 times slower
than mono-core.

Task deques you can implement given a multi-core GC, worker threads
and using closures.

Or just implement it properly in ocaml. The problem part is the
GC. The rest is easy.

I think there is an ocaml frontend for LLVM. So someone already did.
