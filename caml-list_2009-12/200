The generic ad follows. And a specific note for caml-list consumers:
most of our systems automation software is written in OCaml.

-----

Sysadmin/Programmer combo
(aka Systems Automation Specialist)

Seeking:

Responsible, careful, passionate and skillful technology specialists to help
build and maintain our increasingly automated technology infrastructure.

You'll need to be adept with unix (specifically linux) administration. For
example, you want to be able to format filesystems, install bootloaders, and
make rpm packages. It's even better if you understand system calls, kernel
parameters, IO schedulers, and other lower level internals.

You'll also need to be a good programmer. We only want people who've had
experience writing significant amounts of real-world code. OCaml is our
language of choice, but it's okay if you don't know it so long as you can learn
it. Experience in ruby, python, php, perl, scheme, haskell, erlang, and others
are all acceptable.

About us:

Jane Street is a proprietary trading firm with offices in NYC, London and Tokyo
(this ad is for NYC positions). We have about 200 employees total, the majority
of whom work in NYC. While this makes us a medium-sized business, the culture
more closely resembles that of a small startup: The atmosphere is casual and
informal; we care about doing good work more than dress codes or hours put in;
there's not much room for office politics; and, there's a lot of financial
upside if you do great work.

We have a large datacenter on-site and several colocation facilities, with
hundreds of servers total. We manage all of this with just a small team by
leveraging our programming skills to create scalable, automated systems. We use
a lot of open source tools and write the rest ourselves.

Our systems team is tightly integrated with the rest of the company so you get
exposure to a broad range of concepts and ideas. Unlike at other large
financial firms, our technology group is highly regarded and central to our
business, not just a footnote.

Perks:

In addition to our excellent benefits which you can read about here:

  http://www.janestreet.com/workplace/benefits.php

we have on-site classes taught by employees on subjects ranging from
programming to finance to trading to bridge (yes, the game).


If this sounds like a match to your background, skills, and disposition, let us
know. Send a cover letter indicating why you think you're a good fit, along
with your resume, to ogunden@janestreet.com.
