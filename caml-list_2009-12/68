The tick' on the left is the event you are delaying (i.e. the one you
will receive as an argument to defining function but delayed). The
tick' on the right is what you want to get out from the defining
function, here both are equal but that may not be always the case.

In fact I retract my comment in that case. I thought you were playing
dirty tricks but in fact you were not. Sorry.

I don't think you need Calendar to provide what rtime provides.

No idea I have never used Lwt.
