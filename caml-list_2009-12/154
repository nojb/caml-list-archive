Please don't believe Jon's propaganda. He has just very specific needs
(high performance computing on desktops), and generalizes them in the
way "it's not perfect for me anymore, so it's bad anyway". He has been
doing that for years now, not seeing that he really harms the way ocaml
is seen by newcomers.

The examples you mention are good matches for using ocaml - symbolic
programming with lots of terms and trees. That's the stuff ocaml was
originally developed for, and it delivers excellence performance.

Also, ocaml is still backed by INRIA, and there is still a large
community, including a growing number of industrial users.
