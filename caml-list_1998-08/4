Could I persaude anyone to give me some clues about getting this working
under windows NT? (I tried contacting the author, but no response).  
Basically, I'd be really grateful for a sequence of steps which would
allow me to compile the verious files into a bytecode executable "by
hand" using the ocaml command-line tools.  This distribution does come
with a MAKEFILE, but I've been unable to get it to work for me (I have
the cygnus (win-nt) version of make: do a need a speical one for
objective caml?)
