I think he means something like Javadoc, but for O'Caml instead of Java.
With Javadoc, you put a comment in front of every function or class in your
code, using some special format for the comments, and then run Javadoc with
the source code as input.  It extracts the special comments and generates an
HTML document for your code.  I've seen several programs like this for C++
also, but not for Caml yet.
