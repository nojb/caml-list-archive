Subject: [Bug/Feature]: (#meth) syntax is gone ?
Sender: weis


Hello, 

I realize that this feature was never
documented in the reference manual (at least not in version 1.07).
But it was quite usefull for me, the main usage for it being :

  List.iter (#meth) [ obj1; obj2; obj3 ]

instead of the following :

  List.iter (fun o -> o#meth) [ obj1; obj2; obj3 ]


Will this be avaible again in the future, 
or should I start fixing my sources (or patching parser.mly :) ?
