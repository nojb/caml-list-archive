Subject: Macintosh: caml mode for Alpha

Status: O

For the eyes of mac'users of caml light:

Before I embark on this endeavour, has anyone written 
a caml-mode for "Alpha", the emacs-like extensible editor for
Apple Macintoshes? 

Not knowing much about mac programming I can only think of a very
basic (and slightly awkward) implementation by passing
messages via the system scrap. Is there any documentation on
the mac implementation of caml (especially the mac interface), 
so that I can guess a better way of doing the job? If it works, I'll
be happy to contribute my solution.

Thanks,
Claudio
