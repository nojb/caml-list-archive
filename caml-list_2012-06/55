I'm now maintaining an out-of-tree ppc64 backend (note: not Rhapsody,
this is for IBM POWER and Linux on Mac G5s).  In fact I fixed two bugs
in it just today.

http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=fedora-ocaml.git

If someone wants to pull together all the out-of-tree backends into
one place, let me know.  I'm sort of interested in maintaining the
dropped Itanic backend too, since customers will insist on using it
for some reason.
