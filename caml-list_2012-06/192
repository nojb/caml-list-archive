Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Camllexer v1.1.1


Hello,

On behalf of Nicolas Pouillard, I'm happy that now Camllexer is
available as an Oasis package from [1]. The development version can be
found here [2]. The odb package manager shall be updated soon.

[1] http://oasis.ocamlcore.org/dev/view/camllexer/1.1.1

As read in the distribution's README file:

"
Camllexer is an enhanced lexer for Caml dialects.

The lexer has been extracted from the Camlp4 (> 3.10) lexer, which in
turns was reimplemented as a derivative of the lexer from the OCaml
compiler.

This lexer has the following particularities:

    * Correct and complete: as far as testing gone (~800_000 distinct
      lines over ~3_000_000 lines of Caml like files).
    * Supports most Caml dialects:
          o By re-using the lexer of Camlp4 this lexer works on any
          extension of the OCaml language made with Camlp4. In
          particular it has a support for quotations and
          anti-quotations.
          o Works fine on lexers and parsers (ocamllex, ocamlyacc),
          except when using the C style of comments.
    * Lossless: every single bit of the input file is kept. Blanks,
      comments, newlines, lexical conventions for writing literals, all
      of it is kept in the returned token stream. Undesired information
      can easily be thrown out of the stream.
    * Keyword independent: there is no token for keywords. This is up to
      you to cast some LIDENTs and some SYMBOLs into proper keyword
      tokens of your own token type.
    * Fault tolerant: errors take part of the token stream, allowing to
      write fault tolerant translations.
    * Flexible warnings: the lexer warn about some corner case of the
      lexical conventions that the user might want to avoid, again
      warnings take part of the token stream such that you easily
      control everything.
    * A simple lexer program is provided, it enables quick debugging,
      and simple stream editions using Unix pipelines!
