Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Beta release of OCaml 4.00.0

For people interrested MIPS support is back in, there:

http://github.com/rixed/ocaml-4-for-mips

It was pretty easy, since almost nothing had changed in the backend.
So it was perhaps more work required to remove mips support than to
reintroduce it. :-/
