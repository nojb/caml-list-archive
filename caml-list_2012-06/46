Yes this would be fine.
And maybe "someone" could also mean some people...
...maybe there are people out there, that now one or two of them well,
and other of these libs not or not well.

...so that the information can be gathered by a lot of people.

But it would be fine to have some criteria for classifying.

For example:

  - one / multicore
  - local machine / distributed via net
  - threads / processes
  - just library calls, language extension, or seperate language 
  - toplevel-runtime / byte code / native-code
  - necessity of code rewrite for local and remote/distributive stuff,
     or possibility of transparent usage
  - ...


Ciao,
