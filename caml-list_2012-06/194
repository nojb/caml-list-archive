Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] oasis v0.3.0: Architecture for building OCaml
 libraries and applications

Hi all,

A lot of changes, for this new release. 

Most important:

 Fix bug with scanf %S@\n for ocaml 4.00. We were unfortunetaly using an
 undocumented tolerance of Scanf in the previous version. You should
 consider making new release using this version that fixed this. 

 PACKAGES uploaded to oasis-db will be automatically "derived" before
 OCaml 4.00 release (i.e.  oUnit v1.1.1 will be regenerated with this new
 version as oUnit v1.1.1~oasis1).

 PACKAGES not uploaded to oasis-db need to be regenerated. In order not to 
 break 3rd party tools that consider a tarball constant, I recommend to 
 create a new version.

Thanks to INRIA OCaml team for synchronizing with us on this point.

The project:

OASIS generates a full configure, build and install system for your
application. It starts with a simple `_oasis` file at the toplevel of your
project and creates everything required.

It uses external tools like OCamlbuild and it can be considered as the glue
between various subsystems that do the job. It should support the following
tools:

- OCamlbuild
- OMake (todo)
- OCamlMakefile (todo),
- ocaml-autoconf (todo)

It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an internal
configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through findlib. It has been
tested on GNU Linux and Windows.

It also allows to have standard entry points and description. It helps to
integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools like GODI.
