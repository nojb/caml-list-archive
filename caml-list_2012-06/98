OASIS 0.3.0~rc6 should have a fix for this, quoting from its CHANGES.txt:
" * Version 0.3.0

  * EXTREMLY IMPORTANT changes (read this):

    * Fix bug with scanf %S@\n for ocaml 3.13. We were unfortunetaly using an
      undocumented tolerance of Scanf in the previous version. You should
      consider making new release using this version that fixed this."
