*** Call for Papers: DS-Event-B-2012 ***

Workshop on experience and advances in developing dependable systems in
Event-B
Nov 13 2012, Kyoto, Japan
http://research.nii.ac.jp/eventb2012/
In conjunction with ICFEM 2012


--- Aims ant Scope ---
Event-B is a formal method for system level modelling and analysis of
dependable applications. It is supported by an open and extendable
Eclipse-based toolset called Rodin, that has been developed in a series of
European projects (notably DEPLOY). Recently a wide community of users,
developers, researchers and educators has been formed with a strong interest
in these method and tools.

The workshop aims to bring this community together to discuss new and
emerging issues in application and advancing the Event-B method and the
Rodin platform and to address the questions that the industrial takers are
facing during their deployment.

One of the aims of this workshop is to expand the community of researchers
and practitioners working with Event-B/Rodin. This will be achieved in two
ways: by addressing general scientific challenges and providing information
valuable for the newcomers. In doing this this workshop will complement the
ongoing series of informal Rodin workshops focusing on technical exchange
among Rodin users and developers.

The organisers are specifically interested in submissions from the
industrial partners from Asia.


--- Topics ---
The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Theoretical foundations: refinement, composition, verification and proofs
* Engineering methods: modeling strategy, refinement strategy, integration
with other methods
* Applications: practical usage, case study, use for critical systems, use
for emerging computing paradigms
* Education: teaching and training, positioning in SE or FM educations


--- Submission Types ---
All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted
concurrently for publication elsewhere. Papers of the following types are
solicited.

* Research papers: focus on advanced and novel theories, methodologies, or
mechanisms
* Tool papers: focus on useful and practical tools
* Experience papers: focus on evaluation and lessons learned

Submissions must contain no more than 10 pages for Research papers and 6
pages for Tool/Experience papers in the LNCS format (including all the
materials) - http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

The PDF versions of papers should be submitted through the easychair system.

--- Important Dates ---
Submission Deadline: Aug 10, 2012
Notification: Sep 10, 2012
Workshop: Nov 13, 2012


--- Publication ---
The proceedings will be published as a technical report of Newcastle
University (UK). They will also be made available online in the ACM
Computing Research Repository (CORR) before the workshop.


--- Organisation ---
Workshop Co-Chairs:
Fuyuki Ishikawa (National Institute of Informatics, Japan)
Alexander Romanovsky (Newcastle University, UK).
