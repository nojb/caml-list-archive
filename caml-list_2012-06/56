Thanks a lot for this answer.

As I said in another email, I do not have a problem to solve right
now. But, I was tickled by the Parmap announce, and I wondered how it
fared with the other related systems I knew about. (Yet, I reckon that
I should have made the question more precise, with a detailed lists of
criteria, akin to what Oliver suggested.)

In my mind, asking on the list was the best way to make a good summary
of the current situation on this front. (But I am afraid I do not know
the best place to make public this kind of summaries.)
