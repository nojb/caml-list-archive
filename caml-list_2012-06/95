The first failure I got is from oUnit setup.ml which attempt to
scanf "%S %S@\n", but using the @ after a %S (not %s) does not
work the same as in 3.12.1 : it looks for a '@' instead of interpreting
it as a scanning indication.
The manual says that scanning indications are for %s and %[range],
so it seams setup.ml is to blame, though.
