Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml on Amazon EC2 Instance

Greetings,

Can anybody tell me how to install OCaml on an Amazon EC2 instance?  I'm
running Amazon Linux (because it's free).  None of the preconfigured
repositories seem to include OCaml itself (though a few libraries are
present if you enable EPEL 6 "Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux").

There's some indication that I need the "Optional Packages," but so far
all I have is this name.  I don't know what it refers to or how to access
it from my instance.

Thanks for any help.

Regards,

Jeffrey
Seattle WA
