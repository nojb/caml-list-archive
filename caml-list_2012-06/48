These are very different pieces of software, because they tackle=20=20
problems at various abstraction levels. ocmc is the most level-level=20=20
here, as it "only" tries to improve the runtime so that threads can be=20=
=20
run in parallel on multiple cores. That's it, there is no additional=20=20
abstraction on top of the standard threading API - no distribution, no=20=
=20
computing.

JoCaml uses the normal multi-threading in the runtime, but integrates=20=20
it differently into the language. So, it adds abstraction, but you are=20=
=20
still limited to a single core.

So far I know, all the other libraries base on multi-processing to run=20=
=20
programs on multiple cores. Plasma is the only one with true=20=20
distribution capabiltiies beyond a single computer, but the price is=20=20
that you must use the map/reduce scheme, whereas functory or parmap=20=20
leave you more freedom. However, all multi-processing approaches share=20=
=20
the property that the data flow is limited by process boundaries=20=20
(unless you go really low-level and also take Netmulticore into=20=20
consideration (part of Ocamlnet), which uses shared memory to overcome=20=
=20
these limitations).

I don't know what you are exactly looking for. Knowing the problem it=20=20
would be easier to recommend something.
