Subject: [Caml-list] Re: OCaml on Amazon EC2 Instance

In RHEL, OCaml is in the Optional channel.

Various other people take RHEL packages, recompile them, remove the
RHEL branding and add their own.  CentOS, Scientific Linux etc.  These
distros will take all the packages and recompile them and make them
available.

Since they are not usually concerned with support, they'll just
distribute all the packages together.  For example, in CentOS the
ocaml package is mixed in with all the others:

http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.2/os/x86_64/Packages/ocaml-3.11.2-2.el6.x86_64.rpm

Now I've no idea what Amazon Linux are up to, but they've somehow lost
the OCaml package, which is a problem for Amazon Linux.  If this is
true it doesn't sound like a very competent derivative of RHEL, and I
don't know of any other RHEL derivative distribution which has had any
problem distributing the OCaml packages.  (Even worse really because
'createrepo' would have told them that dependencies are missing ...)

In fact according to this:
https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/2012.03-packages/#o
it looks like they've missed out all the ocaml-* packages from RHEL.
I've no idea what they're doing.

Rich.
