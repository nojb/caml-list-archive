Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Beta release of OCaml 4.00.0

Ok so I've just created the retired-camels organization in github,
with a fork of Benedikt mirror, and then cherry picked the two
commits you mentioned above the 4.00 branch (in a branch named
ppc64). I've done as well with the mips commits.

Could you please check that this ppc64 branch works on ppc64?
I will check as well the mips branch in a few days. When both are
OK we should merge them into a a 'more-arch' branch that we'll
just have to rebase regularly, until a better solution emerge.
