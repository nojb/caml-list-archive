Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] cryptokit v1.6: Cryptographic primitives

Update to oasis v0.3.0~rc6

Download:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/frs/download.php/891/cryptokit-1.6.tar.gz

This library provides a variety of cryptographic primitives that can be used
to implement cryptographic protocols in security-sensitive applications.  The
primitives provided include:

- Symmetric-key ciphers: AES, DES, Triple-DES, ARCfour,
  in ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB modes.
- Public-key cryptography: RSA encryption, Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
- Hash functions and MACs: SHA-1, MD5, and MACs based on AES and DES.
- Random number generation.
- Encodings and compression: base 64, hexadecimal, Zlib compression.

Additional ciphers and hashes can easily be used in conjunction with
the library. In particular, basic mechanisms such as chaining modes,
output buffering, and padding are provided by generic classes that can
easily be composed with user-provided ciphers. More generally, the library
promotes a "Lego"-like style of constructing and composing
transformations over character streams.
