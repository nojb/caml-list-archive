Here is my personal experience with some of them (ocamlbrew, odb, oasis 
and oasis-db):
- ocamlbrew can be used to bootstrap odb (get OCaml and findlib from
   scratch)
- from there, odb can install other OCaml libraries and programs
- odb can install oasis and then use oasis-db to get packages
- you can modify a 'packages' file so that odb can install things
   that are not available publicly or that are not yet packaged for oasis

 From my point of view, these tools definitely have the UNIX taste:
they are fast, they are easy to use and quite easy to troubleshoot in 
case something doesn't work as expected; which make them excellent in my 
opinion compared to other solutions.
