Subject: [Caml-list] Re: OCaml on Amazon EC2 Instance

Greetings OCaml list,

Thanks very much for the suggestions for getting OCaml installed
on Amazon EC2.  I'm going to save them for future use.

We just wanted to do some fairly quick testing, so I was looking
for something simple.  Since Amazon Linux is compatible with CentOS 6,
what I ended up doing is installing the CentOS 6.2 OCaml package
on my EC2 instance.  I wrote up a description of how to do it
here:

    http://psellos.com/2012/06/2012.06.ocaml-amazon-ec2.html

We've run our first round of tests, and it all seems to be working.

Maybe this will be useful to other OCamlers.

Regards,

Jeffrey
