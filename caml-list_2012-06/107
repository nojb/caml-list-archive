Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml-on-iOS resources updated for Lion

For those interested in OCaml apps on iOS, I've updated all the
resources on our site to work with OS X 10.7 (Lion).

Right now, there are compilers for iOS itself and the iOS Simulator, an
OpenGL ES interface, and 5 example apps (with sources).  If you already
have the iOS Simulator (part of Xcode), I repackaged 3 of the apps to
run immediately in the simulator (with just a few clicks).  So you can
try them just for fun.

Everything is listed on the main OCaml page:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/

The old versions of the pages are still available on an archives page:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/ocaml-archives.html

The next thing to look at (I think) is support for OCaml 4.

As always, I'm very happy to hear from anybody interested in running
OCaml on iOS (or anything else I can help with).

Jeffrey
