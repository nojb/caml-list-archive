That's called MODERNITY...

This website sits I don't know where in the world, takes my source
code, runs it on data I don't know how it got (random ? predefined and
preloded on a toplevel perpetually up ? read from the web in some XML
file), compares it with a result I don't know how (diffs with existing
flat files ? runs a code known to be correct and compares results ?)
and tells me how my code performed on a testbed, the point where it
started diverging from expected outputs and diffs, while also allowing
me to create my own testbeds. There is also step-by-step execution
(for examples only, hope it will be extended to user code). I also
miss on-hover inspection of variables which I have in other
environments.

On it 17 000 kids I don't know learn programming and algorithms
(mostly in C/C++ but they can choose Caml, Java, Python, etc) and
probably just like me they don't have any compiler installed on their
laptop.

Here is a website I like to program on (http://codepad.org/) as well
as the usual suspects (http://try.ocamlpro.com/,
http://www.tryfsharp.org/).

There is a little trick however... I work mostly in combinatorial
optimization. If your input takes more than 1s to read or write, it
will take the age of the universe to solve given combinatorial
algorithms are exponential in the input size. And there is little
point in putting a printf on a branch-and-bound algorithm that opens
10^6 nodes.
