            Talk Proposal Submission Deadline 8th June 2012


In 2012, the OCaml Meeting will be renamed the OCaml Users and Developers
workshop (OUD), and be colocated with ICFP in Copenhagen, Denmark. It
will be held on Friday September 14, after the ML workshop (Thu 13)
and before the Commercial Users of Functional Programming (Sat 15).

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop will bring together industrial
users of OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending the
language, type system and tools. Discussion will focus on the practical
aspects of OCaml programming and the nitty gritty of the tool-chain and
upcoming improvements and changes.  Thus, we aim to solicit talks on
all aspects related to improving the use or development of the language,
including, for example:

- compiler developments; new backends, runtime and architectures.
- practical type system improvements, such as (but not exhaustively) 
  GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types.
- new library or application releases, and their design rationales.
- tool enhancements by commercial consultants. 
- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
  situations.

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
meeting, but no formal proceedings for this year. Slides of presentations
will be available online from the workshop homepage.

To submit a talk, please register an abstract or outline (1-2 pages) at
http://oud.ocaml.org/talks with as much information as you feel will
support the proposal.  If you wish to perform a demo or require any
special setup, we will do our best to accommodate you.
