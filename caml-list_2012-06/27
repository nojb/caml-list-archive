Is your program pure OCaml?  This could make a big difference in the
troubleshooting.  Are you using any particular external libraries?

You don't give much to go on, otherwise.  I haven't seen this error in
OCaml but in my experience this kind of error is more often caused
by corruption in memory management than by actually running out
of memory.

With nothing else to go on, my guess would be an error in the OCaml/C
interface to an external library.  Perhaps the code is written assuming
32 bit pointers, or similar.
