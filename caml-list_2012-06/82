Well, I'm not particularly fan of github nor gitorious neither, but both have
good support for git (ie pull requests and online diffs), have a wiki, support
team work, and are well known. Github being more popular I'd also go for it
despite being non free. But if you have a better option I don't really care.

Which RichardJones are you on github? this one:
https://github.com/richard-jones
or rather this one:
https://github.com/RichardJones
??

Also, does anybody know of an up-to-date git mirror for the OCaml source tree?
(yeah this is becoming a F.A.Q). I've seen these:

https://github.com/bmeurer/ocaml
https://github.com/thelema/ocaml-community (not many branches)
https://github.com/multani/ocaml-mirror (not the same branches as bmeurer ones)
https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocaml-testing (not up to date)

but there are a surprising lot of projects related to ocaml in github, which
I'm not going to complain about, but so I might be missing some.

So should we create the `retired-camels` team and fork Benedikt's mirror to
begin with?
