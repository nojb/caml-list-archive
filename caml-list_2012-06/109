I have checked that indeed I get these messages without the unique stamps mostly on the computer where the installed compiler is old.
Still it seems that identifiers are not always made unique, e.g. I just got the following message with 3.12.1:

Error: In this `with' constraint, the new definition of decor
        does not match its original definition in the constrained signature:
        Type declarations do not match:
          type decor = Decor.t
        is not included in
          type decor = Decor.t

In this particular case the stamps would be not useful anyway.
But in general it would be nice if the Ident.stamp values could be translated to some corresponding locations in the source code.
For example Typecore.enter_variable could feed the available loc to Ident.create?
