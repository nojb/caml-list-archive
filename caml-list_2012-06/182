I fail to see why you would use first class modules for that. What you are
"really" trying to use are just functors. Granted the syntax for functors
is awful. But if you are not willing to bear with it, then you would expect
to have some boilerplate. That said, your types monad and monad_state are
the types of a particular monad and a particular state monad (which have
certain initiality property). There is no reason for them to be related,
which may also be the cause of code duplication.
