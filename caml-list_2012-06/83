Unfortunately, all these repos are incompatible, in the sense that there 
is no common commit in their histories ("git svn" creates new commit ids 
every time you create a new checkout from the same svn repo, in my 
experience).

I am not an expert of "git", but can somebody tell me if it is possible 
to "git svn rebase" a fork of Benedikt's mirror, or if only Benedikt can 
do it ?

I remember using "git svn" at some point, and being surprised that the 
svn synchronisation stuff was not saved in the git repository, so that I 
was unable to re-sync from a clone of that repository, I had to do it 
always from the initially created git repo. But maybe --mirror fixes 
that ? (I didn't use it at that time)
