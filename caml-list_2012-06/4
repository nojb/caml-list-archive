     GAMES 2012 - CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

 Annual Workshop of the ESF Networking Programme on

     Games for Design and Verification

     7th - 12th September 2012 - Napoli, Italy

             http://www.games.unina.it/

================================================================

The ESF Networking Programme on Games for Design and Verification is a
European Network pursuing research and training on the design and
verification of computing systems. This network proposes a research
and training programme for the design and verification of computing
systems, using a methodological framework that is based on the
interplay of finite and infinite games, mathematical logic and
automata theory. For details, see www.games.rwth-aachen.de/

GAMES is the annual workshop of the Network and this year edition is the
concluding one.

GAMES 2012 will be held at Universita' di Napoli Federico II, Italy.


SCOPE:
The scope of the workshop includes the mathematical and algorithmic
analysis of finite and infinite games, the interplay of games with
automata theory and logic, and applications of games, automata, and
logic to the design and verification of computing systems.


PROGRAMME:
As in previous years, GAMES 2012 will be an informal workshop, without
proceedings. Its programme consists of 10 invited talks,
contributed talks (30 min) and short presentations (15 min).
Contributed talks and short presentations will be selected by the
programme committee on the basis of submitted abstracts.

SUBMISSIONS:
Researchers who would like to present a talk at GAMES 2012 are invited
to submit an abstract of up to two pages by email to

  esfgames2012@gmail.com

by 27 June 2012.
Decisions about acceptance will be made by 17 July 2012.
