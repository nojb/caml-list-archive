Subject: [Caml-list] StarExec workshop at IJCAR 2012

====================== CALL FOR PARTICIPATION =======================

                 1st StarExec Workshop (StarExec 2012)
                            July 1, 2012
                  http://clc.cs.uiowa.edu/starexec12/

                     Affiliated with IJCAR 2012

Organizers: Aaron Stump, Geoff Sutcliffe, and Cesare Tinelli

StarExec is a cross-community solver execution and benchmark library
service under joint development at the University of Iowa and the
University of Miami. Its goal is to facilitate the experimental
evaluation of logic solvers and other automated reasoning tools by
providing a shared storage and computing infrastructure to store,
manage and make available benchmark libraries; execute comparative
evaluations; and run solver competitions. 

This workshop aims at bringing together developers and users of
logic solvers, to introduce them to the StarExec service and obtain
feedback that will guide the ongoing development. The StarExec team
will present the system as it has been developed thus far. Attendees
will be given access to the service so they can use it and provide
feedback. Selected leaders of logic solver communities will give
presentations highlighting the needs and expectations of their
communities. The workshop will conclude with a panel and discussion.
