SCOPE

The   PEPM  Symposium/Workshop  series   aims  at   bringing  together
researchers  and  practitioners  working   in  the  areas  of  program
manipulation, partial evaluation, and program generation. PEPM focuses
on  techniques,  theory,  tools,  and  applications  of  analysis  and
manipulation of programs.

The  2013 PEPM workshop  will be  based on  a broad  interpretation of
semantics-based   program  manipulation   and  continue  recent  years'
successful effort to expand the scope of PEPM significantly beyond the
traditionally covered  areas of partial  evaluation and specialization
and include practical applications  of program transformations such as
refactoring  tools, and  practical implementation  techniques  such as
rule-based  transformation systems.   In addition,  the scope  of PEPM
covers  manipulation   and  transformations  of   program  and  system
representations such  as structural and semantic models  that occur in
the context  of model-driven  development.  In order  to reach  out to
practitioners, a  separate category of tool  demonstration papers will
be solicited.

Topics of interest for PEPM'13 include, but are not limited to:

* Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
 partial  evaluation, fusion,  on-the-fly program  adaptation, active
 libraries,   program   inversion,   slicing,   symbolic   execution,
 refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

* Program  analysis techniques  that are  used to  drive program/model
 manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
 binding-time analysis,  constraint solving, type  systems, automated
 testing and test case generation.

* Techniques  that  treat programs/models  as  data objects  including
 metaprogramming,  generative  programming, embedded  domain-specific
 languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming,
 staged   computation,  and   model-driven  program   generation  and
 transformation.

* Application  of  the  above  techniques including  case  studies  of
 program   manipulation  in   real-world   (industrial,  open-source)
 projects and software  development processes, descriptions of robust
 tools  capable  of   effectively  handling  realistic  applications,
 benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program
 understanding   and  transformation,  DSL   implementations,  visual
 languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware
 frameworks and  infrastructure needed for  distributed and web-based
 applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To  maintain the  dynamic  and  interactive nature  of  PEPM, we  will
continue the  category of `short  papers' for tool  demonstrations and
for presentations of  exciting if not fully polished  research, and of
interesting academic, industrial and open-source applications that are
new or unfamiliar.

Student attendants  with accepted papers  can apply for a  SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help  cover travel expenses.  PAC also  offers other support,
such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs
for companions of SIGPLAN  members with physical disabilities, as well
as for travel from locations  outside of North America and Europe. For
details on the PAC programme, see its web page.

All  accepted papers,  short papers  included, will  appear  in formal
proceedings   published  by   ACM  Press.   In  addition   to  printed
proceedings,  accepted papers  will  be included  in  the ACM  Digital
Library. Like for recent PEPMs,  selected papers will be invited for a
journal special issue dedicated to PEPM'13.

PEPM has established a Best  Paper award. The winner will be announced
at the workshop.

Authors must transfer copyright to ACM upon acceptance (for government
work, to the extent  transferable), but retain various rights. Authors
are encouraged to publish  auxiliary material with their paper (source
code, test  data, etc.); they retain copyright  of auxiliary material.
The SIGPLAN  Republication Policy and  ACM's Policy and  Procedures on
Plagiarism apply.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES, CATEGORIES, AND PROCEEDINGS

Regular Research  Papers must not  exceed 10 pages in  ACM Proceedings
style.   Tool demonstration  papers must  not  exceed 4  pages in  ACM
Proceedings style.  At least one author of  each accepted contribution
must attend  the workshop and  present the work.  In the case  of tool
demonstration papers,  a live demonstration  of the described  tool is
expected.    Suggested  topics,   evaluation  criteria,   and  writing
guidelines  for both  research  and tool demonstration papers  will be=20
made available on the  PEPM'13  Web-site.   Papers should be submitted
electronically via  the workshop  web site.=20=20
