I completely agree with what you just said, and that was the point of
my question: trying to assess, in a single thread, the  various
possibilities that exist to solve a given problem [1]. Now, it happens
that I had been thinking about the same kind of mail about package
managers, because there is also a huge variety of solutions. So, I
could ask, what are the pros and cons of the following package
managers?

- https://github.com/thelema/odb
- https://github.com/hcarty/ocamlbrew
- https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam
- http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/index.html
- http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/oasis-db.html

But I do not want to fork that thread yet ;).

I think a more general perspective on this was given a while ago on
this list by Xavier, a while ago on this list (trying to paraphrase):
- the community needs a common packaging system
- there is often a lack of convergence between related projects (in
this case, libraries, for instance).

On a related note, I was delighted to see that there are two books
about OCaml in the pipes currently, and I think this is great.

[1] Actually, I did that also a while ago, about openGL bindings, and
the following discussion was quite fruitful
