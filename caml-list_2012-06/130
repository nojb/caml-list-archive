Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Participation: Mancoosi International Solver
 Competition

       The Mancoosi International Solver Competition (MISC)
              http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/
                   Call for Participation
            

IRILL, the the Center for Research and Innovation on Free Software,
calls for the third international competition of solvers for
package/component installation and upgrade problems. Instances of
these problems are given by a set of currently installed or available
software packages, with complex relations between them like
dependencies, conflicts, and features. The problem instances used in
the competition are expressed in a language called CUDF that allows to
express relationships between components like they are known for
instance in GNU/Linux distributions, or for Eclipse plugins. We are
not only interested in finding some solution to such a problem, but in
finding the best solution according to different optimization
criteria. For a detailed description please look at the competition
web page

	    http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/

Participating solvers will be judged by the correctness of the
solution, the quality of the solution according to the respective
optimization criteria, and speed. The results of the competition will
be announced on September, 8, at the LoCoCo workshop at ICLP 2012
(http://lococo.irill.org/2012).
