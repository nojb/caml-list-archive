Dear OCaml users,

The release of OCaml 4.07.0 will take place in a few weeks. We have created=
 a beta version to help you adapt your software to the new features ahead o=
f the release.

The source code is available at this address:
  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.07.tar.gz
and the compiler is also available as the 4.07.0+beta2* set of OPAM switche=
s.

We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here:
  http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/bug_report_page.php

At about the same time as the release, we will also have the pleasure of of=
ficially announcing the creation of the OCaml Software Foundation, a non-pr=
ofit organization dedicated to supporting OCaml, its ecosystem, and its com=
munity. You can already enter a pledge at http://ocaml-sf.org/donate/

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.
