        Trends in Functional Programming in Education

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that=
 use,
or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE=
 aims
to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progres=
s on
the use of functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day
workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process=
 for
publication after the workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2018 will screen
submissions to ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of
interest to participants. After the workshop, presenters will be invited to
submit revised versions of their articles for publication in the journal
Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).



Scope
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

TFPIE 2018 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom,
tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of
functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Computer Science.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

-  FP and beginning CS students
-  FP and Computational Thinking
-  FP and Artificial Intelligence
-  FP in Robotics
-  FP and Music
-  Advanced FP for undergraduates
-  FP in graduate education
-  Engaging students in research using FP
-  FP in Programming Languages
-  FP in the high school curriculum
-  FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
-  FP and Philosophy
-  The pedagogy of teaching FP
-  FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.
-  Best Lectures =E2=80=93 more details below

In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What=
=E2=80=99s your
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to presen=
t FP
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture t=
opics
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees.


Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages)=
 or a
draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted
presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on =
the
workshop's website. Papers and abstracts can be submitted via EasyChair at =
the
link below.

After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version=
 of)
their article for review. The PC will select the best articles for publicat=
ion
in the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTC=
S).
Articles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be forma=
lly
reviewed by the PC.
