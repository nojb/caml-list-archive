Oxford, England, UK

You are warmly invited to participate in FLoC 2018, the 2018 Federated
Logic Conference, to be held in Oxford, UK, on 6-19th July 2018.

Registration is now open and we remind speakers and participants to

ABOUT FLOC

During the past forty years there has been extensive, continuous, and
growing interaction between logic and computer science. In many
respects, logic provides computer science with both a unifying
foundational framework and a tool for modeling. In fact, logic has
been called =E2=80=9Cthe calculus of computer science=E2=80=9D, playing a c=
rucial role
in diverse areas such as artificial intelligence, computational
complexity, distributed computing, database systems, hardware design,
programming languages, and software engineering.

The Federated Logic Conference brings together several international
conferences related to mathematical logic and computer science, and
was first organised in 1996, as part of the DIMACS Special Year on
Logic and Algorithms. Since then FLoC was held in Trento in 1999,
Copenhagen in 2002, Seattle in 2006, Edinburgh in 2010 and Vienna in
2014.

The seventh Federated Logic Conference (FLoC'18) will be held in
Oxford, UK, in July 2018, at the Mathematical Institute and the
Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.
