  * Website : https://popl22.sigplan.org/home/pepm-2022
  * Time    : 17th--18th January 2022
  * Place   : Online or Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States
              (co-located with POPL 2022)

  ** Deadline: 7th October **
  ** Update: We are organizing a special event on the history of PEPM.
     Details will be posted on the workshop website. **

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program
Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been
co-located with POPL every year since 2006. It originated with the
discoveries of useful automated techniques for evaluating
programs with only partial input. Over the years, the scope of PEPM
has expanded to include a variety of research areas centred around the
theme of semantics-based program manipulation =E2=80=94 the systematic
exploitation of treating programs not only as subjects to black-box
execution but also as data structures that can be generated,
analysed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important
semantic properties.

Scope
-----

In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2022
welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:

  * Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and
    program optimisation.

  * Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed
    and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types,
    linear types, and contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2022 include, but are not
limited to:

  * Program and model manipulation techniques such as:
    supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program
    adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic
    execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

  * Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
    languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive
    programming, staged computation, and model-driven program
    generation and transformation.

  * Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination
    checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems,
    automated testing and test case generation.

  * Application of the above techniques including case studies of
    program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
    projects and software development processes, descriptions of
    robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic
    applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains
    include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL
    implementations, visual languages and end-user programming,
    scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure
    needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and
    resource-limited computation, and security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage
submissions describing new theories and applications related to
semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a
question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of
the workshop, please contact the programme co-chairs, Zena M. Ariola
<ariola@cs.uoregon.edu> and Youyou Cong <cong@c.titech.ac.jp>.

Submission categories and guidelines
------------------------------------

Two kinds of submissions will be accepted:

  * Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be
    judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity.
    Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages.

  * Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of
    exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting
    academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or
    unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages.

References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices
may not be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be
typeset using the two-column =E2=80=98sigplan=E2=80=99 sub-format of the ne=
w =E2=80=98acmart=E2=80=99
format available at:

  http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/

and submitted electronically via HotCRP:

  https://pepm22.hotcrp.com/

Reviewing will be single-blind.

Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).

Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings
published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library.
Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will
not appear in the proceedings.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the
workshop (physically or virtually) and present the work. In the case
of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described
tool is expected.

Important dates
---------------

  * Paper submission deadline : **Thursday 7th October 2021 (AoE)**
  * Author notification       : **Thursday 11th November 2021 (AoE)**
  * Workshop                  : **Monday 17th January 2022 to
                                  Tuesday 18th January 2022**

Best paper award
----------------

PEPM 2022 continues the tradition of a Best Paper award. The winner will be
announced at the workshop.
