Martin and I discussed this issue before he posted.  It is true that
we discuss mostly (but not exclusively) Caml here, but I thought
a number of readers of this list might be interested by the work on
Scala, which attacks the problem of integrating OO, functional and
modular programming from a different angle than Caml, but with the
kind of rigour and principled foundations that we Caml folks like very
much.  So, if you think this announcement is spam, I'll share the
blame for that.

This said, further discussions on Scala itself are perhaps best
carried on the Scala mailing list.
