The obvious thing to do is for people to, if they write stuff (Be it big
modules or small little utility functions) that would be useful to the
general population of ocaml users, is release that code so we get those
small libraries. Then the hard part: Advertising them and getting people to
use them.

Something I'm thinking of doing after I finish getting some much-delayed
updates to a couple of the libraries I maintain out the door: A
general-purpose config file library; the sort of thing that'd be useful for
most non-trivial applications that, as far as I'm aware, doesn't exit for
ocaml yet.
