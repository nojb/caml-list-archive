Hello Jean-Christophe,

I'm using a specific graph in one of my program, hence the following
questions.

Would your library allow to store graphs as somethink like hash table of
vertices (to able each all edges of a vertex in constant time)?

Would your library allow to store graphs with valuated edges
(i.e. storing data structure on edges)?

Would you allow several kind of edges in the same graph?

Would you allow to use your algorithms with user defined functions? For
example, for cycle detection, I need to traverse the graph according to
stored values on edges and vertices, as well as accumulated values
during graph traversal.

It would have been nice to have graph display library. But I recognized
it is a difficult and very specific topic.


What would be the (approximate) size of your library? My current
graph-related code is about 475 lines, including code documentation and
autotests. I'm sure that your code is more complete and robust that
mine, and bigger also. However, it is not so easy to use external
code. :)

Yours,
d.
