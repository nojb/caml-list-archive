FROM Mrs.HADJIA REKIYA KOROMA.

Dear friend,

I am a SierraLeonean by nationality, presently residing here in the
Neighboring Benin republic. I got your contact from a representative
officer with the Benin centre for external trade, tourism
department.We therefore solicit for your assistance to grant us 
the all moral and technical advise that we may require to
relocate/invest overseas.

It is true that I had not known you before, but I have no option than to
risk believing that God will not let us alone. It's my pleasure to contact
you for a business venture which I and my Son, intend to establish in your
country. When war erupted in Freetown, there is certain amount of
money totalling USD twenty two million($22,000,000.00) which my late
Husband was able to move out of Sierraleon through a diplomatic channel,
with the assistance of a securities and finance company before he was
assassinated by unknown persons.

Now me and my son decided to invest these money in your country or
anywhere safe enough outside Africa for security and political reasons. We
want you to help us to secure the funds and settle it in your nominated
account in your country for a joint investment purposes on the
followings below.

1) Manufacturing
2) Farming and acquisition of farmlands
3) Hospitality industry

As it pleases you to be of assistance to us, we will be glad to
Offer to you a 15% of the total funds. We are pleased to update you that
the transaction requires little administrative fees to effect the release
of the funds at the securities company, this is also one reason why we
rely on your capability to assist us considering my present situation as a
widow.

As soon as the funds is settled in your account,2% of the total sum shall
be deducted to offset every expenses which both parties must have incurred
in the process of completing the project including travel and
communication.Then reasonable part of the remaining 83% shall be invested
on your personal advise.

I await your soonest response. Feel free to contact me urgently
through my son Kenneth who is presently seeking asylum in Amsterdam
through this email address (ken03@freesurf.fr ) or call him on
telephone number (0031630817302) to enable him give to you further
information relative to the presence/position of funds which will authorize
the securities company to release to you as our partner and beneficiary.

NB.The inclusion of your private telephone and fax numbers will be
appreciated for effective communication between us.

Thanking you in advance for honoring our request and God bless.
