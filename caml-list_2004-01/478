Dear all, 

sorry for multiple postings: please distribute the call for papers for
the Doctoral Programme of IJCAR 2004 attached below to your graduate
students.

Best regards, Ulrike Sattler



======================================================================

	IJCAR 2004 Doctoral Programme

The IJCAR 2004 Doctoral Programme will provide a forum for graduate
students to discuss and explore their research interests and career
objectives with each other and with established researchers in
Automated Reasoning.

The aims of the Doctoral Programme are the following:

    * to provide a forum for students to present their current
      research, and receive feedback from other students and senior
      researchers; 
    * to promote contacts among PhD students working in the same area;
    * to support students with information and advice on academic,
      research, and industrial careers; 
    * to financially support students by covering the conference
      registration fee and by partially contributing to travel
      expenses.  

The programme will consist of students' presentations and tutorials
given by senior researchers in the field. In addition, a mentoring
programme will be organized to help partizipants to meet and talk to
researchers working in related fields.  

======================================================================

Doctoral Programme tutorials

We will have the following short tutorials (this list is not complete,
tenative, and might be subject to change):

    * Sebastian Brandt: How to prepare the perfect slide show
    * Alan Bundy: How to get a PhD in Informatics
    * Ian Horrocks: How to realise experimental implementations
    * Toby Walsh: How to write a PhD thesis 


======================================================================

Partizipation and Submissions:

We encourage submissions from Ph.D. students at any level, and from
any topic area and methodology within automated reasoning. On the
basis of the submissions, the Programme Committee will select a group
of students that will be invited to present their work during the
Doctoral Programme, and also to present a poster at the IJCAR 2004
poster session. We expect a commitment from all participating students
to attend the entire Doctoral Programme. Moreover, for the accepted
students, we will provide free IJCAR conference registration and a
fixed allowance for travel/housing. The students' abstracts will be
made available on the web and included in the conference
proceedings. Partizipation is by invitation only, and invitations will
be based on submissions.

Applicants should submit by e-mail to Ulrike Sattler at

	   sattler@cs.man.ac.uk 

an extended abstract of max. 5 pages in length following the usual
LNCS style format. The extended abstract should be sent either as a
PostScript or as a Pdf file. It should describe original work,
completed or in progress, that is part of the doctoral work of the
student. If an extended version of the paper is also submitted to the
technical programme, please indicate it in the submission. Double
submission is acceptable, but if the paper is accepted for the
technical programme, the student will present the work only in the
technical programme sessions and not during the Doctoral Programme.

In addition, the dissertation advisor should send a letter of
recommendation by e-mail to sattler@cs.man.ac.uk. The letter should
include the expected date for thesis submission, and the
motivation/expected benefit for the student to attend the Doctoral
Programme. This letter can be sent in as either a text or a PostScript
or a Pdf file.  

======================================================================

Important Dates:

    * February 6, 2004: Deadline for application submissions
    * March 19, 2004: Acceptance Notification
    * April 14, 2004: Final version due
    * July 4 - 8, 2003: IJCAR 2004 with Doctoral Programme
