HI there

I've been using heavily annotated graphs for unfolding searches in 
artificial intelligence. I need annotations in both nodes and edges, the 
type of edges being a sum of several informations among them costs.
So incremental building and a control structure for traversal (queues, 
stacks, priority stacks) is a must. Lazy expansion of graphs would also 
be a boon, but I guess this can be coded into the functional recursion 
traversal.

Regards and thank you very much for asking. Please count me as one 
looking eagerly forwards to seeing your code working,

    F. Valverde
