Imagine a guy who ocaml-get's a given bit of code on his laptops, and
then wants to work on it in a plane or somewhere else offline ?

He will then have no access ot the licence, which is not ok.

(But then, i have not looked at your work in detail, and may have missed
something).

The best would be to have, for each bit of source you can ocaml-get, a
link to a licence file, which may be common to many ocaml-gettable
sources, and which get downloaded only if it has not already, maybe with
a md5sum check to make sure it is indeed the same licence.

Then, you can just have the licence tag or whatever refer to a file on
the client harddisk, and there will be no problem.

BTW, how does ocaml-get integrate (or not) with the debian packaging
effort ? Will it be possible to use it to install non-packaged stuff in
a debian policy friendly way or something like that ?

Friendly,
