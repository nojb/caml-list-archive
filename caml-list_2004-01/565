Thanks for sharing you "humble opinion" with us. Let me share mine with 
you: my company has chosen Ocaml as it's primary general purpose 
language and is devoting most of it's R&D efforts towards new 
development based on/for Ocaml.

Ever heard about message passing? Did you ever try running a 
multithreaded application on a server cluster?

No one. Except maybe Xavier et al. in the Cristal group. Except maybe 
myself and all of my colleagues. Except all of those who subscribe to 
the mailing list. Except hundreds of researchers and students.

How about "No one you know would use Ocaml with Java bindings".  No one 
I know would use a language with Java bindings for any realistic project.

> Are any plans about these two features exists ?

I definitely hope Xavier will not waste his time coding JNI's to use 
ocaml within Java.
