      The Second International Workshop on
  Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT-2004)
http://centria=2Edi=2Efct=2Eunl=2Ept/~jleite/dalt04/index=2Ehtm


                 to be held at the
  The Third International Joint Conference on Autonomous
Agents & Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2004) New York, USA
                19 or 20 July 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------


----------
Overview:
----------

Building multi-agent systems still calls for models and technologies
that ensure system predictability, enable feature discovery and
verification, and accommodate flexibility=2E  Declarative approaches
offer to satisfy precisely these properties of large-scale multi-agent
systems=2E Recent advances in the area of computational logics provide a
strong foundation for declarative languages and technologies=2E Equipped
with such strong foundation, declarative approaches can enable agents
to reason about their interactions and their environment and hence not
only establish the required tasks but also handle exceptions that
arise in many systems=2E

However, a great effort still has to be done to make formal methods
and declarative technologies available to the broader agent community,
and to apply theoretical results to enable practical implementation of
agent systems=2E  Accordingly, Declarative Agent Languages and
Technologies (DALT) workshop aims at bringing together (1) researchers
working on formal methods for agent and multi-agent systems design,
(2) engineers interested in exploiting the potentials of declarative
approaches for specification of agent-based systems, and (3)
practitioners exploring the technology issues arising from a
declarative representation of systems=2E


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 Declarative agent communication and coordination languages
 Declarative approaches to the engineering of agent systems
 Experimental studies of declarative technologies
 Industrial and commercial experiences with declarative agent technologies=

 Formal methods for the specification and verification of agent systems
 Computational logics in multi-agent systems
 Argumentation and dialectical systems
 Declarative description of contracts and negotiation issues
 Lessons learned from the design and implementation of agent systems
 Declarative paradigms for the combination of heterogeneous agents
 Constraints and agent systems
 Declarative policies and security in MAS
 Knowledge-based and knowledge-intensive MAS
 Modeling of agent rationality

already been made towards collecting the papers presented at DALT 2004
in the form of a journal special issue or a book from an international
publisher=2E
