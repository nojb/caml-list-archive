Without going quite so high-tech...  The moderator of comp.risks
has asked people to include the word "notsp" in their subject
lines, in order to quickly tell the spam from the legitimate
mail, and he says it works quite well.

We could transpose this technique, for example by saying that
mails whose subject already starts with "[Caml-list]" or
"Re: [Caml-list]" go through even if they don't come from a
subscribed address.
