Dear ocaml users,

Sylvain  Conchon, Julien  Signoles  and myself  have  started a  graph
library for ocaml. Before going further and releasing this library, we
would like to get some  feedback from people currently using graphs in
ocaml applications or willing to  do so. More precisely, we would like
to  know what  kind of  operations on  the graph  structure  and graph
algorithms are commonly used by such users.

Could you please tell us if you  are the author of a graph library not
already mentioned in the ocaml hump?

Please answer privately.
