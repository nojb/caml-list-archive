Ahem. The last release is dated 2004-01-20 ;-)  (added support for
escaping strings).

The library is used by a non-negligible number of people, including by
some companies and for other libraries (e.g. mod_caml, Chartpak, DBForge,
...). And according to some mails I got, the users are quite satisfied
with the current library. Moreover, it has been packaged for some Linux
distributions.

It's a good thing to add documentation (even though the users would need
to read the libpq doc anyway). Actually, this is the only feature request
for Postgres that I have not honoured. But changing the interface
(changing names, types, and removing all the non-OO low-level interface)
would force existing users to rewrite there code for no benefit (AFAICT).
So I'm not going to stop maintaining the existing library, even though I'd
be glad to give maintenance to you since I'm not using the library, and
even though I feel it's somewhat a waste of resources for the community
to maintain and package two libraries.

I would have appreciated to know about your intention to "fork" the
library before the public annoucement so that we could have agreed on a
policy. Well anyway, not a big deal.
