Hello,

I have read message about Skala language, and I think (it's only my IMHO),
that ocaml have no future without some features, like concurrent programming
(CP) and chance to use libraries from the other languages.

1) Erlang uses build in CP, but Skala has a library for it, IMHO it would be a
good way for ocaml feature. Thread module isn't enough for effective usage of
CP.

2) No one would use ocaml without libraries, and it's so hard to rewrite them
all in ocaml. external functions aren't enough to use libraries from Languages
like java or c++.

Are any plans about these two features exists ?

Thanks.
