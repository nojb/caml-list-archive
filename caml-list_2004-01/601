I actually haven't asked Alain yet what he thinks about it :-)

Since I currently need PostgreSQL-bindings, I just took his version and
adapted it to my taste. The interface was hardly documented (its most
serious shortcoming), which usually prevents libraries from widespread
use so I also did that.

Alain hasn't changed anything in three years so I suppose this library
would otherwise have been unmaintained anyway?

There is hardly anything left to add to this library so there are no
foreseeable major changes. The new additions and cleanups also do not
make such a big difference. If Alain wants to add or change anything,
he will still recognize the code and can do so easily. I'd say it's safe
to use the new version...

Regards,
Markus
