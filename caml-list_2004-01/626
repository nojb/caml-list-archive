Sounds very useful.  One item I would very much like to see: when one is merely interested in using some (efficient!) 
graph algorithm, there is often a choice of data structures to be made.  Figuring out the asymptotics of each 
algorithm over each data structure is feasible, but should be quite unnecessary: it would be quite convenient if there 
were information functions [as part of the functor modules] which would output the asymptotic behaviour of the 
instantiations.

This would be especially useful as some data structure-algorithm pairs are woefully inefficient, especially when it 
comes to graphs!
