It works, but produces results that are slightly (but insignificantly) 
different from the ones that I get without camlp4. For example:

with camlp4:

> Raised by primitive operation at file "unify_mm.ml", line 1, character 20504
> Re-raised at file "unify_mm.ml", line 1, character 22067
> Called from file "unify_mm.ml", line 1, character 27263
...

Without:

> Raised by primitive operation at file "unify_mm.ml", line 560, character 63
> Re-raised at file "unify_mm.ml", line 595, character 11

...

Character 20504 in the file is indeed "line 560, character 63", but 
"character 22067" is not the same as "line 595, character 11".

the code in question is:

          ...
       else begin
          if ...

and non-camlp4 "line 595, character 11" one points to the space between 
"else" and "begin", while camlp4's "character 22067" points to the space 
right before the "if".

P.S. Why would an exception (supposedly raised inside the "true" branch 
of an if) be re-raised at the end of the "if" branch?
