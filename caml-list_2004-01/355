I have lablgtk. It would appear Redhat -- not to mention
the GNU people -- regard Gtk as the standard GUI, and
consider Tk obsolete. Tk isn't installed on RH9 by default
and there is no install option to include it.

I agree. I don't run Tcl/Tk as a matter of principle.
It sucks .. :-)

[Funny .. the man pages are still there .. but package
integration was never Un*x's strong point ..]
