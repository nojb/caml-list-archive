Hi all,

I'm working on a project where I need to extend large portions of the
grammar.  This has been pretty straightforward with camlp4 for most things
but I'm having some trouble getting at the guts of the grammar in a few
spots.  For instance, I would like to modify the entries for module
declarations ala:
  DELETE_RULE
    str_item: "module"; UIDENT; module_binding
  END;
  EXTEND
  str_item:
    [ [	"module"; i = UIDENT; mb = module_binding ->
	(* call a few funcs *)
        <:str_item< module $i$ = $mb$ >>
      ]
    ];
  END;

However, since the entry "module_binding" is not defined to be GLOBAL, I
can not access it here.  Does anyone have any suggestions about how to get
around this?  Is there any specific reason that some of the grammar
entries are defined locally?

thanks,
-mike
