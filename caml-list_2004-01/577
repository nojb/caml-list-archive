The central IT of California State University Northridge. We're 
currently working on an open source
middleware suite written (largely) in Ocaml.
	Part of our R&D effort has involved taking over maintenance of 
ocamldap, and adding
significant features to it. We've also been working with GPS to add 
fast-cgi support to ocamlnet
(working code is in cvs awaiting release). In the future we'd like to 
do a native Ocaml ldap protocal
implementation for ocamldap. That means that we will probably end up 
implementing an ASN.1
compiler, and BER, DER, etc.. There is an ASN.1 compiler laying around 
that we might try to
resurrect, but we'll still need to implement BER, etc.. A working ASN.1 
environment would be great
for Ocaml, as it would allow lots of really cool protocals (such as 
SNMP) to be implemented easily.
We don't currently have a time frame for getting this done, and our 
metadirectory will probably take
priority.

Our directory managment daemon (written in ocaml) can be found at
www-qa.csun.edu/opensource/rmwd
(this site is in development, I'm literally scrambling to get it up :P. 
the final url may change.
I'll be posting  to the link database when its ready.)

Info on our meta-directory will be going up soon, it is not currently 
written in Ocaml, but we're planning
to do a rewrite in Ocaml fairly soon.

So that's the 5 minute summery of CSUN :P
