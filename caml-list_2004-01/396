I know about this minor mode. But I want to hide only a body of
function except a header (let binding).

This is note from the folding.el file:

;;  Please note, that the maintainers do not recommend to use only
;;  folding for you your code layout and navigation. Folding.el is on
;;  its best when it can "chunk" large sections of code inside
;;  folds. The larger the chunks, the more the usability of folding will
;;  increase. Folding.el is not meant to hide individual functions: you
;;  may be better served by hideshow.el or imenu.el (which can parse
;;  the function indexes)

And I agree with above note.

This is my example code with special fold markers:

let foo a b c =
(* {{{ *)
   List.iter (fun x -> x*a + x*b + x*c)
(* }}} *)

Folding mode works fine:

let foo a b c =
(* {{{ *) ...

But the code looks ugly. ;)

It would be nice if above code would look like this (when folding
mode is enabled):

let foo a b c = int -> int -> int -> int list -> int list
