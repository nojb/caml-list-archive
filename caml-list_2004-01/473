I agree with you completely.  It'd just be nice to have the library
included in standard OCaml.  No, in fact not just 'nice', necessary -
so that it becomes a standard idiom which can be taught to students of
the language.

Sometimes, but mostly I think regexps are used appropriately.  Writing
a full-blown parser is something of an undertaking.  Writing a simple
script which just reads a config file or a data file or similar
shouldn't need this effort.  (Another related argument: Give me the
choice of shooting myself in the foot if I want to.)

Mmmm ... perhaps.  Actually I think 'unless' specifically is very
useful.  I've even written a trivial camlp4 extension for it, and we
use it in lots of Merjis code.
