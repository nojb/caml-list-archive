   If there's going to be a "new improved version", I think maybe it 
should work with multiple databases.  ODBC, JDBC, and DBI all attempt 
this.  There could be a signature (perhaps called "DBI" to appeal to 
Perl people , and structs Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, etc., which implement 
this.
   Different databases have varying levels of standards-conformance, of 
course, and there's all sorts of variation between databases, so I 
wouldn't expect one to be able to take one OCaml program written with 
this interface, and blithely switch databases, especially for 
complicated stuff.  But you should be able to write simple "select * 
from customers"-type queries, against any database, without totally 
re-working your OCaml code.
   Database independence seems like a good goal to move towards.  If 
there's going to be potential interface changes anyways, now might be a 
good time to plan a more general interface.
   (I used the old Postgres module, and it worked well.)
