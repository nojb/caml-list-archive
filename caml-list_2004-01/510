Some licences .. most licences unfortunately ..
create problems for such fine granularity.
Technically to 'element-get' a single element 
which is a 3 line function .. you'd have to include
the whole licence blurb of 60 lines or whatever.

In interscript (my literate progamming/packaging system),
I created some mechanism in which a single copy of each 
required licence could be shipped with a package..
but the licences were never included in the actual sources.
[The typeset output contained a link to the file for html,
or a reference for latex, etc ..).

Anyhow, when you 'element-get' an element, you probably
have to ensure the element is

(a) at least tagged in the fragment source with the licence name
(b) a copy of the required notice is fetched as well

.. even if the whole notice isn't included with each element.
