I'm trying to call an already-written C function from
my OCaml code. I've written a wrapper for the C
function (in C) that calls CAMLparam on the incoming
arguments and uses CAMLreturn for the return value. 

Somewhere in the middle of my program, I get a seg
fault, which, when I use a debugger, looks like it's
coming from the garbage collector. Weirdly, when I
call Gc.compact() in my OCaml code-- either directly
before or after calling my C wrapper function-- I
don't get a seg fault and everything seems to work
properly.

Does anyone have any idea what might be going on?

Thank you very much,
Lauren
