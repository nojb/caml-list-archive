Supposedly Sun has an OS written in Java.  I wouldn't touch it with a ten 
foot cattle prod, myself.  I'd rather use Pascal to write an OS (I'd shoot 
myself first in either case, it'd be less painfull).

As a day-job systems programmers, throw C++ out of that group.  Systems 
programming (device drivers, OSs, BIOSs, etc- things that beat directly on 
hardware) tends to be either C or assembly.

See previous rant.
