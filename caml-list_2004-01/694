It is interesting that the authors of the C++ Boost Graph Library wrote a
paper comparing languages for their ability to support generic programming =
by
using the development of a graph library as an example, and one of the lang=
uages
they look at is SML. It's in the OOPSLA '03  proceedings I think.

Selfishness forces me to put in a plea for including a graph isomorphism
algorithm in your library. The application I have in mind is netlist compar=
ison.
