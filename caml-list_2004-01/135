It does not 'replace' Iox, but the fact is I haven't worked on 
improving Iox in quite some time.  I didn't like the semantics of the 
Iox library after I started trying to build complicated components with 
it.

So I went back to the drawing board, and looked at more things that 
others have done-- particularly in the area of using functional 
programming techniques for interactive applications.  I carefully 
studied Thomas Hallgren's and Magnus Carlsson's Ph.D. thesis on the 
Fudget system in Haskell.  (See 
<http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hallgren/Thesis/> for details.)  I've been 
experimenting around that for several months now, and I'm pretty sure I 
like my new approach over the old one.

I quickly discovered, however, that I needed a core foundation of 
miscellaneous code that didn't really belong in the I/O component 
framework itself.  That core foundation is what you now see in this 
release.  (I decided I needed to get some code published before it 
started to grow mold on it and die.)

In addition to the core foundation, I am currently working on several 
other libraries that are all part of my Pagoda project:

- Iom	a replacement for Iox built with Cf_gadget and Cf_socket.
- Mime	parsing/emitting MIME entities and content-transfer encodings
- Xml	yet another wrapper around Expat, plus some glue for Cf parsers
- Beep	a general implementation of RFC 3080 and RFC 3081 using Iom

These are all in various states of unreleasable incompleteness.  
Though, the Iom, Mime and Xml libraries are fairly close (they just 
need reference documentation).

I also plan to write a DNS resolver for Iom.  I hope to support 
Multicast DNS with it too, i.e. Rendezvous.  I also want to write a 
RADIUS client, and I will need a good wrapper around OpenSSL if I'm 
going to implement the required TLS profile for RFC 3081.  Eventually, 
I'd like to have a nice implementation of RFC 3341, 3342 and 3343 using 
Iom.

> What is pagoda project ?

It's a project I fart around with in my limited spare time, mostly for 
research purposes.  The Iox library came from research early in my 
Pagoda project.  I called it "Pagoda" because that was where I started 
stacking up all my bits and bobs of componentry that I hope will be 
useful in building distributed network service applications.  In 
actuality, it appears to be a dark, mysterious tower filled with shiny 
bits of seemingly useless artifacts whose guardians regard as sacred 
relics.  A pagoda.
