Precedence: bulk

You lucky guy. Only 60 s-p-a-m-s a day. I'm getting
as many as 1000. Unfortunately, our domain name
located on what seems to be an "open relay." Our
ISP says they can do something about it and I am
now pursuing that.

After proving his famous incompleteness theorems,
Kurt Godel proved a result that implies that s-p-a-m
filters cannot be 100% effective. :(

I had hoped to set up the domain to run Caml & Haskell
based software, but that's not allowed. So, we're just stuck
until I can figure a better solution that is not a lot more
expensive.

I won't be able to read any replies until my ISP fixes that
email that won't download. Oh, yes...  I moved my office in
December and everything is still in chaos. That slows things
down a bit too. :)

Best Regards,

Byron Hale
