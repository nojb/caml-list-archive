Speaking of GDB, just as a quick poll, are there many people who
strongly feel that they would like to have ocaml support in GDB for
native binaries? Or am I unique?

I'm not volunteering right now, but I've done a bit of work in GDB
for work in the past. Of course ocamlopt would have generate stabs or
dwarf output, which would be contingent on the willingness of Xavier
et al. to commit it.

Thanks.
