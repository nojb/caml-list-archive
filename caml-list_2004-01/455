 From my personal view, 3.07 had a number of minor, but annoying issues 
that are currently fixed in CVS. Also, the current CVS version seems to 
work fine on AMD Opterons we have, while 3.07 had some issues. Finally, 
a recent CVS version of OCaml works fine for our project _without any 
additional patches_ - this have not been the case for any released 
version of OCaml for a very long time!

So yeah, I will also be pretty happy to see 3.08 released soon.
