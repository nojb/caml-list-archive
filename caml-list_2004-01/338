Well, on a similar subject, is there any chance of implementing a
workaround in spamoracle to counter those spams specifically designed to
fool the bayesian filters ? You know, those who have 4 lines of random
words in a text attachement, and then some html spam. 

I don't know if the bayesian filters or a modification thereof is able
to counter this kind of email, but i don't think so.

What about adding a way to whitelist a given email address, so you could
post from a list of email addresses you have previously declared,
without necessarily being subscribed to all of those.

Another idea would be to provide all subscribed persons some hash value
they can add to a specific header, which is then removed by the list
software once it is checked to be a valid one. Could easily be automated
on both sides, and would allow to post from everywhere.
