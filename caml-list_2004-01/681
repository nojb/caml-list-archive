It throws Sql_error when it can determine an error.  I'm not very
familiar with JDBC, except that I know a lot of people don't like it.
mod_caml's Dbi is much more closely related to Perl DBI, as you might
have guessed.

Since we use PostgreSQL for everything at Merjis, we use the 'text'
and 'byte' types which are much more useful and flexible than BLOBs.
So there's no specific support, although it wouldn't be too hard to
add it.  I've no idea how Perl DBI handles BLOBs either, since all the
databases I've ever used with it have had proper unlimited length text
types, so there's no need for them.
