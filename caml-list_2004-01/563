The particular 'feature' of the Skala language is that it compiles to
the JVM.  Unfortunately if you've ever used the JVM you'll know that
typical implementations are slow as hell and have an awful garbage
collector.  Give me the OCaml VM any day (or native code - even
better).

The other features of Skala - data matching on objects, generic
programming - should be added to OCaml (eg. by adding GCaml).

Yes.  You can use Perl libraries directly in OCaml right now.  And
believe me, Perl libraries are more powerful and more thought out than
Java libraries any day.
