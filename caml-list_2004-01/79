Yes, but the severity of the current problem is new. Up until maybe two
weeks ago, I would get perhaps one spam message from Caml-list every
week or two. Now it's 2-3 dozen a day. If this keeps up, I (like many
other list members, no doubt) can try to teach SpamAssassin to filter
out spam from Caml-list, but if there are false positives they will be
diverted to my spam folder, which I only review every 2 or 3 weeks.

So I'd rather not have to do that. The fact that this is a new problem,
and is not occurring on other lists I subscribe to, suggests that the
spammers are exploiting a weakness in the way this list is administered.
I hope the list maintainers will look into it.
