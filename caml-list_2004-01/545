SoCaml is a binding for the object-oriented 3D scene library Open
Inventor (tm) (http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/).

Here's what can be done in SoCaml so far:

o Create an Inventor scene graph from a string.
o Display the scene graph with an examiner viewer.
o Type in commands that are echoed in a heads-up display. 
o Run your own event loop, for greater flexibility and compatibility
  with other graphical systems.

SoCaml is available at

  http://redwood.ucdavis.edu/~issac/software/socaml-1.1.tar.gz 

To try it, edit the Makefile to fit your system and then type make.
Some demos are created.  The documentation is sparse, but the demo
sources should be helpful.

Requirements:
  o OCaml 3.07beta2
  o Camlidl
  o g++ 2.95
  o SGI's version of Open Inventor

Caveats:
  So far it has only been tested on an Intel/Debian system, using the
  inventor-dev package.  I haven't yet made it work with Coin
  (www.coin3d.org) because of some linking issues.  No attempt has been
  made to use it with TGS's version of Inventor.  Also, lots of things
  haven't been wrapped yet.
