Bookman Publishing has been offered a unique opportunity by a network of 
nine hundred AM and FM radio stations to advertise our books in two-minute 
segments.

We are producing and broadcasting this series of two-minute "vignettes" 
which are guaranteed air time on at least 400 of the stations.  

If two minutes is not enough time, we still have our one hour broadcast, 
"Authors Corner" now heard on 8 stations.

Whether you self-published, or your book was produced by a subsidy 
publisher or print-on-demand publisher, we will sell your book.  (And no, 
you don't have to reprint or republish with us.)

If you would like more information on this, or our other unique services, 
reply or call:
