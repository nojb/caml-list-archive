You want to use ocaml for yourself only? Do You need more popularity of
ocaml ? OCaml isn't used a lot for commercial projects.

I agree with you, JNI isn't the best solution. But what time do you need to
implement the part of CPAN's libraries for example ? Ocaml is the great
language for the BIG projects. but it hasn't simple libraries for small
projects. Of course, It doesn't need them for "academical" language.
