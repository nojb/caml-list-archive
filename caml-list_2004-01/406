As far as the core O'Caml team is concerned, I don't think it will
make much difference.  It may make it harder for us to get access
to a RedHat machine for testing and debugging, but the differences
with other Linux distributions are extremely small (maybe even
nonexistent), so this shouldn't be a problem in practice.

Of course I can't speak for the numerous contributors who make
libraries and tools for O'Caml.  I had to read your email several
times before I noticed that your question was addressed to them
as well.  Maybe that explains their silence on your question.
