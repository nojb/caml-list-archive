Hey !  ...

It's me again Ashley .... I'm wondering why I haven't heard from you still :/ . Don't know if you got this message but here it goes.. You sound very interesting in your profile and I really would like to talk to you, but I guess it's up to you.... Maybe it's because of the verification thingie on my site ? Well I would love to put it on differently somehow, but how else would I have to put on my webcam ?, I'm very confused with this technology stuff :[ ... Maybe you know how to make webcam work without any other programs that need verification ?
Anyways come to my page  http://nvquwx@www.redemix.biz/tbo/fre/   I think I connected everything right :-)), waiting for you....


Bye, Ashh...
