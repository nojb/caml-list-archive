Doesn't the lexer already have regular expressions?  I think you mean 
something to make regular expressions into first-class values in the 
language.  I'm not sure that's necessary.

In my recently released Pagoda Core Foundation library, there is an 
implementation of lazily evaluated deterministic finite automata.  It 
also contains a functional lexical analyzer implementation that uses 
it.  What remains to be done-- and I'm sorta planning to get around to 
doing it myself one of these years-- is to compile regular expressions 
from string values and to do appropriate syntactical glucose with 
CamlP4.

Since I released the library under a BSD style license, it's certainly 
*possible* that someone could write an extension that doesn't require 
any changes to the core language.
