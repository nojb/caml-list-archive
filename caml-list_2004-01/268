Dearest,
Complements of the season=20
I am the manager United Bank of Egypt(UBE). in my bank I discovered an aban=
doned sum $33.3usd(thirty three million three hundred thousand U.S.dollars =
only) in an account that belongs
to one of our foreign customer, by name, Mr. Bob Robert Chapman, African ar=
ea director for Wycliffe bible translators international,who died along wit=
h his wife, Ruth Chapman,in January 2000 in a Kenyan plane crash in the coa=
st of Abidjan,ivory=20
coast.=20
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next o=
f kin to come over and claim his money because we can notrelease it unless =
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indic=
ated in our banking guidelines.unfortunately I learnt that his supposed nex=
t of kin died along with him at the
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. it is therefore upon this =
discovery that I decided to make business with you and release the money to=
 you as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for safety and subseque=
nt disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money =
to go into federal goverment account as unclaimed bill. the banking law and=
 the guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after=
 four years the=20
money will be transferred into banking treasury as=20
unclaimed fund.=20
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this=20
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer=20
was a foreigner and an Egyptian cannot stand as next=20
of kin for a foreigner. It is agreed that a certain=20
percentage of this money will be for you as my=20
foreign partner. there after I will=20
visit your country for disbursement according to=20
the percentage agreed.=20
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the fund to you as arranged. =
you must apply first to the bank as a relation or next of kin=20
of the deceased indicating your bank account number and location wherein th=
e money will be remitted. upon receipt of your reply I will send to you the=
