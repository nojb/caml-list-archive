CP is not the main feature. For example, Perl has no good and stable CP 
support, but it is very popular.
There are no so many task, that need CP.

http://wiki.tcl.tk/critcl - here is interesting idea how to make 
bindings wuickly. I think it can be implemented in Ocaml,

The language will be preffered in many projects only when it have good 
repository of packages, policy of packaging libraries, modules, etc., 
simple mechanism to install this packages over the net and so on. So I 
think that for more popularity Ocaml need for something like CPAN 
http://www.cpan.org/ . Thats why I don't use Tcl, Ruby, Ocaml in real 
applications. If Ocaml community create packaging policy and network 
archive, than number of Ocaml developers will increase much faster.

Not CP, not multithreading can make programmer happy :), but CPAN can.

P.S.: I know, my English is terrible, I will try to make it better :)
