I agree with you on all items.
I've written a lot of java applications. "Java - slow sux" - it's right.
I don't think the JVM is a good solution. I told about scala, which used JVM,
but I don't want to tell "We need to use JVM".

The basic problem in projects in which I took part, was that I could not use
ocaml _only_ to make project complete. I wrote a lot of C/C++ functions to use
ocaml with CORBA or SNMP for example.
