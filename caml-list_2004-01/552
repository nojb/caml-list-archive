IIRC you cannot marshal/unmarshal functions safely.  It only works in
the limited case where you are unmarshaling in the exact same compiled
program.

What's needed is for someone to rewrite the marshal code to work
safely.  However there's not enough type information available at
runtime for this to work.  eg. [1; 2; 3] looks the same as (1, 2, 3)
at runtime.
