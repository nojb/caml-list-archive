Don't want to start a religious war here, but I beg to disagree - When 
Tcl/Tk appeared in the early 90s, it was quick and usable on the Sun 
stations in our lab (<100MHz, 32MByte if I remember well), and allowed 
you to do some amazing things due to the tight integration of the 
windowing toolkit and Tcl. And the canvas is still a wonderful piece of 
software. Gtk on the other hand has a very sluggish feeling on my 
Pentium 2.4 GHz notebook with 512 MByte, and the C API is just awful 
when it comes to hooking widgets and signals together - nowhere as 
simple as Tcl's bind commands for widgets and canvas items. And then the 
config database... OK, I have to admit that design-wise, some of the GTK 
skins look a bit nicer that the clunky Tk widgets ;)
 I guess that a native OCaml toolkit would be a real killer.
