Subject: [Caml-list] TSD 2020 - Last Call for Papers

	 *********************************************************
		     TSD 2020 - LAST CALL FOR PAPERS
	 *********************************************************

Twenty-third International Conference on TEXT, SPEECH and DIALOGUE (TSD 2020)
              Brno, Czech Republic, 8-11 September 2020
                    http://www.tsdconference.org/


THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE has been EXTENDED to:

    April 27 2020 ............ Submission of full papers


NO CHANGES IN SUBMISSION DUE TO COVID-19
CONFERENCE WILL BE ORGANIZED WITH REMOTE PARTICIPATION

Even though the COVID-19 spread is kept in limits in the Czech
Republic, government regulations influence travelling possibilities.
As the situation in September cannot be easily predicted, the TSD 2020
PC members have decided to choose the virtual TSD 2020 conference
(with substantially reduced fees) as the default option.

The actual organization of the TSD 2020 conference in September is
thus not at risk and the preparation process continues without changes
regarding the publication and submissions - Springer publication is
already approved.


KEYNOTE SPEAKERS

    Paolo Rosso, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain
    Diana Maynard, University of Sheffield, UK
    Joakim Nivre, Uppsala University, Sweden

The conference is organized by the Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk
University, Brno, and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of
West Bohemia, Pilsen.  The conference is supported by International
Speech Communication Association.

Venue: virtual conference running from Brno, Czech Republic


FORMAT OF THE CONFERENCE

The conference will be organized with remote participation using video
conference tools.  The conference program will include presentation of
invited papers, oral presentations, and poster/demonstration sessions.
Papers will be presented in plenary or topic oriented sessions.

The registration fee has been substantially reduced:

    Student: Remote participation, early discount
	-- CZK 3000 (approx. EUR 115)

    Full participant: Remote participation, early discount
	-- CZK 5000 (approx. EUR 190)


SUBMISSION OF PAPERS

Authors are invited to submit a full paper not exceeding 8 pages
formatted in the LNCS style (including references). Those accepted
will be presented either orally or as posters. The decision about the
presentation format will be based on the recommendation of the
reviewers. The authors are asked to submit their papers using the
on-line form accessible from the conference website.

Papers submitted to TSD 2020 must not be under review by any other
conference or publication during the TSD review cycle, and must not be
previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere.

As reviewing will be blind, the paper should not include the authors'
names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the
author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...",
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith previously
showed (Smith, 1991) ...".  Papers that do not conform to the
requirements above are subject to be rejected without review.

The authors are strongly encouraged to write their papers in TeX or
LaTeX formats. These formats are necessary for the final versions of
the papers that will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes.
Authors using a WORD compatible software for the final version must
use the LNCS template for WORD and within the submit process ask the
Proceedings Editors to convert the paper to LaTeX format.  For this
service a service-and-license fee of CZK 2000 will be levied
automatically.

The paper format for review has to be in the PDF format with all
required fonts included. Upon notification of acceptance, presenters
will receive further information on submitting their camera-ready and
electronic sources (for detailed instructions on the final paper
format see https://www.tsdconference.org/tsd2020/paper_instr.html).

Authors are also invited to present actual projects, developed
software or interesting material relevant to the topics of the
conference.  The presenters of demonstrations should provide an
abstract not exceeding one page. The demonstration abstracts will not
appear in the conference proceedings.


TSD SERIES

TSD series evolved as a prime forum for interaction between researchers in
both spoken and written language processing from all over the world.
Proceedings of TSD form a book published by Springer-Verlag in their
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. TSD Proceedings
are regularly indexed by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation
Index/Web of Science.  Moreover, LNAI series are listed in all major
citation databases such as DBLP, SCOPUS, EI, INSPEC or COMPENDEX.
