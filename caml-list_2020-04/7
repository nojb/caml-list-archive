Hi Gabriel,

Thanks for your remarks; I have made a few improvements to the documentation
based on your remarks. In particular, the default value of T is 
currently 64.

This is true. We debated various options (described in NOTES.md) but 
chose the
version whose specification is simplest (no undefined behavior, no 
exception).
Because we would prefer to avoid offering many variants of each 
operation, we
will probably keep things this way.
