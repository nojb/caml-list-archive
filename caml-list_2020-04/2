Subject: [Caml-list] Announcing Sek, an efficient implementation of
 sequences


Fellow OCaml users,

We are pleased to announce the first release of Sek, an OCaml library that
offers an efficient implementation of sequences.

The library offers both ephemeral (mutable) sequences and persistent
(immutable) sequences, and offers constant-time conversions between these
flavors.

It supports all of the standard operations on stacks, queues, deques (e.g.
push, pop at either end), catenable sequences (concat, split), and random
access sequences (get, set).

Data is stored internally in chunks (fixed-capacity arrays),
which is why this data structure is known as a chunK SEquence.

It is intended to achieve excellent time complexity and memory usage.

This is an initial release. The library has not been tested in production,
but has received extensive unit testing, via afl-fuzz and ocaml+afl --
which are remarkably effective tools, by the way!

This is work in progress; more features, such as iterators, will be added
in the future.

To install Sek, just type

   opam update && opam install sek
