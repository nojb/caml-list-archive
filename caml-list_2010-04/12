Chess III Arena is a chess game that uses Quake 3 characters as the
chess pieces.  Version 0.8 includes many improvements over the last
version.  I'll only go into two major improvements here:

1) The distribution now includes everything you need to play.  Previous
versions required access to an official copy of Quake 3 to get the
character art.  This version now includes gpl licensed character art
courtesy of the openArena project.

2) C3A can now be used as a graphical front-end for gnuchess, allowing
you to play a computer opponent.

More information, source downloads, and a binary Windows download can be
found here:

Enjoy!
