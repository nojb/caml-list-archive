OASIS
-----

This is the first public release of OASIS. It aims to provide a clean
and efficient way to create a configure/build and install system for
your OCaml applications and libraries using a single '_oasis' file.

It is inspired by Haskell's Cabal.

Features:
* generate a standalone setup.ml which provides standard entry points in
* the build system,
* plugin system that allows to choose the best sub-system: OCamlbuild,
* custom build (Makefile based)...
* the file _oasis can be used as a metadata storage to help other tools
* analyze your source code
* customization of every piece of the generated build system by just
* editing the files concerned
* full OCaml script, no Unix call involved
* tested on Linux and Windows

Bonus features:
* available in french, using ocaml-gettext
* binary installers for Linux and Windows (32bits)

ocamlify && ocaml-data-notation
-------------------------------

These two tools are needed to build OASIS. They are released in separate
projects because I use it elsewhere and they are just pre-requisites of
OASIS. 

ocamlify helps to include files as OCaml code. The beginning of a build
rule can be copy-and-pasted from OASIS myocamlbuild.ml.

http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=oasis;a=headblob;f=/myocamlbuild.ml

ocaml-data-notation, aka odn, dumps OCaml data in OCaml notation. It 
is inspired by JSON. It uses type-conv to create data dumper functions,
you just have to add "with odn" in the type definition.  There is no
load scheme, since it is used to dump datastructure into OCaml scripts.
It is mainly a code generator helper.
