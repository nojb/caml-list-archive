                      CALL FOR PAPERS

 
                         WADT 2010
                20th International Workshop on
               Algebraic Development Techniques


               July 1-4, 2010, Etelsen, Germany

       http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/WADT2010/

Aims and Scope:
  The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many
  aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born
  as formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now
  covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms
  (such as object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic
  and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range
  of application areas (including information systems, concurrent,
  distributed and mobile systems).

  The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and
  ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and
  future trends.

Topics of interest:
  Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:
  - Foundations of algebraic specification
  - Other approaches to formal specification, including process
    calculi and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing
  - Specification languages, methods, and environments
  - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
  - Model-driven development
  - Graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems
  - Integration of formal specification techniques
  - Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification

INVITED SPEAKERS
  Hans-Dieter Ehrich, Institut f\"ur Informationssysteme, Braunschweig
  Frantisek Plasil, Charles University, Prague
  Martin Wirsing, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\"at, M\"unchen

IMPORTANT DATES
  Submission deadline for abstracts:   April 30, 2010
  Notification of acceptance:          May 23, 2010
  Final abstract due:                  June 13, 2010
  Workshop:                            July 1-4, 2010

Workshop Format and Location:
  The workshop will take place over four days, Thursday to Sunday,
  at Schloss Etelsen, www.schloss-etelsen.de, a castle located near
  Bremen. Presentations will be selected on the basis of submitted
  abstracts. Three talks will be given by invited speakers.

Submissions:
  The scientific program of the workshop will include presentations
  of recent results and ongoing research.  The presentations will be
  selected by the Steering Committee on the basis of the submitted
  abstracts according to originality, significance, and general
  interest.

  The abstracts have to be submitted electronically according to the
  instructions published on the workshop web site. The final
  versions of the selected abstracts will be included in a hand-out
  for the workshop participants.

  After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit
  full papers for the refereed proceedings, which is expected to be
  published as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science
  (Springer Verlag).

Sponsorship:
  The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3, and is
  sponsored by IFIP TC1, University of Bremen, and DFKI GmbH. The
  event is organized by the Computer Science Department of the
  University of Bremen and the DFKI Bremen group Safe and Secure
  Cognitive Systems.
