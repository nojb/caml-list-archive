I think this kind of dot output can be very informative if accurate
enough, for instance as a pedagogical or debug purpose.

Large graphs are like to nightly skies : it's always nice to stare at
them even if you are not knowledgeable in the field :)

May I suggest gitorious instead of github for hosting this ?
