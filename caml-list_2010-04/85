Not at all, github is shiny and efficient to manage a git repository.

A good solution, is to host your git/bug tracking on github and download
section/website/news/mailing list on a forge.ocamlcore.org project. You
just have to remove the "SCM" tab and redirect the homepage to github or
write your own project homepage and put a link to github there.

This way you can benefit of the best of each hosting service.

Good luck with ocaml-inspect.

Regards,
Sylvain Le Gall

ps: maybe one day we will be able to integrate nicely github with
forge.ocamlcore.org and you will just have to hit the button "Share my
projects on github through forge.ocamlcore.org"... Any taker send me an
email ;-)
