This is an updated version of the call for participation for CUFP.
Most importantly, the proposal deadline has been updated.

Commerical Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) is a workshop that
is co-located with ICFP.=A0 If you have experience using OCaml (or
another functional language) in a pragmatic setting, consider
submitting a proposal to give a talk about it at CUFP!

------------------------------------------

Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop (CUFP) 2010
Call for Participation

Sponsored by SIGPLAN
Co-located with ICFP 2010

Baltimore, Maryland
Sep 27-29, 2010

Submission Deadline: 15 June 2010

Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic
research for over 35 years, and have seen an ever larger practical
impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial firms to
biomedical research labs. =A0At the same time, a vigorous community of
practically-minding functional programmers has come into existence.

CUFP is designed to serve this community. =A0The annual CUFP workshop is
a place where people can see how others are using functional
programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and
collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about
the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn
practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work.

# Giving a CUFP Talk #

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical
setting, we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the
workshop. =A0We're looking for two kinds of talks:

*Experience reports* are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to inform
participants about how functional programming plays out in real-world
applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights
gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical;
reflections on the commercial, management, or software engineering
aspects are, if anything, more important. You do not need to submit a
paper!

*Technical talks* are expected to be 30-45 minutes long, and should
focus on teaching the audience something about a technical technique
or methodology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play
out in practice. =A0These talks could cover anything from techniques for
building functional concurrent applications, to managing dynamic
reconfigurations, to design recipes for using types effectively in
large-scale applications. =A0While these talks will often be based on a
particular language, they should be accessible to a broad range of
functional programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, send an e-mail to francesco(at)erlang-consulting(dot)com or
yminsky(at)janestreet(dot)com by **15 June 2010** with a short description
of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should
give a talk about. Such descriptions should be about one page long.

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.
