Hi,

after using Nethtml for HTNML-parsing (nice!) and Pcre (nice!)
I now want to use other modules from the ocamlnet stuff.


At the moment I want just write a simple webfile retriever.
So, some http-get stuff for webpages.
But later I may need more advanced features.

Some years ago I tried some of the ocamlnet stuff,
but have forgotten the details.

As far as I can remember, there was an OO-based lib, which makes web  
access very easy, but for more specialized stuff, such as cookies, one  
should use the http_client library, because that OO-stuff did only  
provide simple protocoll stuff.

I'm not sure if the other OO-stuff was enhanced since then.

Is there an overview on the different libs, with recommendations,
which library is useful for what task?

Some examples also would be fine.

BTW: there is Pcre as well as Netstring_pcre. When to use which?
  Should I always prefer Netstring_pcre for web stuff?


Ciao,
    Oliver
