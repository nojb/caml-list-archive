                4th International Workshop on Foundations and Techniques for
                         OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE CERTIFICATION


                           Pisa, Italy - 17-18 September 2010
                              Satellite Event to SEFM 2010


                              http://opencert.iist.unu.edu/


                          Submission deadline: 28 June, 2010




CONTEXT & OBJECTIVES

Over the past decade, the Open Source Software (OSS) phenomenon has had 
a global impact on
the way software systems and and software-based services are developed, 
distributed and deployed.
Widely acknowledged benefits of OSS include reliability, low development 
and maintenance costs,
as well as rapid code turnover. Linux distributions, Apache and MySQL 
serve, among many other examples,
as a testimony to its success and resilience.

However, state-of-the-art OSS, by the very nature of its open, 
unconventional, distributed
development model, make software quality assessment, let alone full 
certification, particularly
hard to achieve and raises important challenges both from the 
technical/methodological and
the managerial points of view.

This makes the use of OSS, and, in particular, its integration within 
complex industrial-strength
applications, with stringent security requirements, a risk. And, 
simultaneously an opportunity and
a challenge for rigourous, mathematically based, methods in software 
analysis and engineering.

In such a context, the aim of this  workshop is to bring together 
researchers from academia and industry
who are broadly interested in the quality assessment of open source 
software projects, ultimately leading
to the establishment of coherent certification processes, at different 
levels.

Following the success of the three previous editions (colocated to 
ETAPS'07, in Braga, and OSS'08,
at IFIP WCC, in Milan, and ETAPS'09, in York), the workshop will focus 
on formal methods and
model-based techniques that appear promising to facilitate OSS 
certification.
Both foundational, methodological and pragmatic  issues will be 
addressed, through both standard
technical communications and reports on concrete case-studies and 
experimental data.

CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are expected to foster a broad debate on OSS assessment 
and certification, integrating
techniques and elements from areas as different as

    - product and process certification
    - certification standards
    - formal modelling and verification (model checking and theorem proving)
    - software quality and reverse engineering
    - static analysis, testing and inspection
    - safety, security and usability certification
    - language design and evolving systems
    - automated source code analyses
    - empirical studies


SUBMISSION
The two-day workshop will feature invited talks, a pannel discussion and 
contributed
paper presentations.  All contributions, in the form of either full 
technical papers,
between 10 and 16 pages, or short position papers, will undergo a 
peer-review process.
All papers should be written in English and in ECEASST format.

Detailed information on the submission procedure are available at 
opencert.iist.unu.edu/


PUBLICATION

Accepted papers will be published in Electronic Communications of the 
EASST (ECEASST)
Publication of selected papers in a journal is currently under negotiation.

   - Abstract submission: 21 June, 2010
   - Paper submission deadline: 28 June, 2010
   - Acceptance notification: 30 July, 2010
   - Final version due: 14 August, 2010
