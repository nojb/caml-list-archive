------------------------------------------------------------
Fourth International Workshop on
High-level Parallel Programming and Applications (HLPP 2010)
Baltimore, Maryland, September 25, 2010
Affiliated to ICFP 2010
------------------------------------------------------------
	
AIMS AND SCOPE

As processor and system manufacturers adjust their roadmaps towards increasing
levels of both inter and intra-chip parallelism, so the urgency of reorienting
the mainstream software industry towards these architectures grows.

At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies are
dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or
equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.

Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have a
key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.

This workshop provides a forum for discussion and research about such high-level
approaches to parallel programming.
Topics

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on topics
including (but not limited to) the following aspects of multi-core, parallel,
distributed, grid and cloud computing:

    * High-level programming and performance models (BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.)
and tools
    * Declarative parallel programming methodologies
    * Algorithmic skeletons and constructive methods
    * Declarative parallel programming languages and libraries: semantics and
implementation
    * Verification of declarative parallel and distributed programs
    * Applications using high-level languages and tools
    * Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods
