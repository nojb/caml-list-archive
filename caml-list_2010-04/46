I need to be able to lex/parse and pretty-print unicode with caml.

I am aware of several 'solutions' for each part, but I would choose to 
use whatever library seamlessly allows me to both parse and build 
pretty-printers for unicode-based input.

For example, it is unclear to me that module Print in Batteries 
integrates well with UTF8.t - but that could just be a documentation 
issue.  Camomile seems to be good for the representation part, but does 
not seem to offer lex/parse and pretty-print modules.

It seems like ulex + dypgen works for the front-end part.  Back-end?
[It's not clear to me that ulex + menhir works]

Jacques
