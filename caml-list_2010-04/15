Hello,

It is my pleasure to announce that Xavier Leroy and Didier R=C3=A9my's
course on Unix system programming in Objective Caml is now available
in english at this address :

http://ocamlunix.forge.ocamlcore.org/

If you had a look at the individual publications of the chapters
announced on the project feed you may want to have a look again: some
parts of the text were improved and a few translation errors were
corrected in the final version.

The translation was made by :

* Eric Cooper
* Eliot Handelman
* Priya Hattiangdi
* Thad Meyer
* Prashanth Mundkur
* Richard Paradies
* Till Varoquaux
* Mark Wong-VanHaren
* Daniel C. B=C3=BCnzli

And the resulting text was proofread by :

* David Allsopp
* Erik de Castro Lopo
* John Clements
* Anil Madhavapeddy
* Prashanth Mundkur.

A big thank to all of them for the time they provided for the project.

A special mention goes to Prashanth Mundkur who was very supportive
and responsive all along. He not only proofread more than one chapter
but also provided fixes and improvements for every part of the
document.

Thanks also to all the people working on ocamlcore.org for the hosting
resources.

Best,

Daniel
