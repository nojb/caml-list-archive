Hi,

I've started to write a GUI with lablgtk and got stuck when trying to
"update" a persistent data structure from a callback. That made me
look at FRP and thought it would probably be worth a try..

Is there any FRP library I can use with GTK? I think I saw something
about React and gtk but I can't find it anymore. I'm not afraid of
working on that aspect myself but wanted to know if there was already
something or maybe at least some work on that.

Thanks.
