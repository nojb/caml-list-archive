DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP

It has been understood since the late 1960s that tools and structures arisi=
ng in mathematical logic and proof theory can usefully be applied to the de=
sign of high level programming languages, and to the development of reasoni=
ng principles for such languages. Yet low level languages, such as machine =
code, and the compilation of high level languages into a low level ones hav=
e traditionally been seen as having little or no essential connection to lo=
gic.

However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been that low leve=
l languages are also governed by logical principles.
>From this key observation has emerged an active and fascinating new researc=
h area at the frontier of logic and computer science.
The practically-motivated design of logics reflecting the structure of low =
level languages (such as heaps, registers and code pointers) and low level =
properties of programs (such as resource usage) goes hand in hand with the =
some of the most advanced contemporary researches in semantics and proof th=
eory, including classical realizability and forcing, double orthogonality, =
parametricity, linear logic, game semantics, uniformity, categorical semant=
ics, explicit substitutions, abstract machines, implicit complexity and sub=
linear programming.

The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together researchers in=
terested in the various aspects of the relationship between logic and low l=
evel languages and programs.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

       - Typed assembly languages
       - Certified compilation
       - Proof-carrying code
       - Program optimization
       - Modal logic and realizability in machine code
       - Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code,
       - Implicit complexity, sublinear programming and Turing machines
       - Parametricity, modules and existential types
       - General references, Kripke models and recursive types
       - Closures and explicit substitutions
       - Linear logic and separation logic
       - Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis
       - Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects

   "What could be the right balance between abstract and fine-grain computa=
tional properties?"

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

       * Amal Ahmed (Indiana University)
       * Nick Benton (MSR Cambridge, co-chair)
       * Lars Birkedal (IT University of Copenhagen)
       * Dan Ghica (University of Birmingham)
       * Paul-Andre Mellies (CNRS & University Paris Diderot, co-chair)

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of useful interaction =
 amongst the participants, welcoming proposals for talks on work in progres=
s, overviews of larger programmes, position presentations and short tutoria=
ls as well as more traditional research talks describing new results.

The programme committee will select the workshop presentations from submitt=
ed proposals, which may take the form either of a short abstract or of a lo=
nger (published or unpublished) paper describing completed work.

The submissions should be made by easychair at http://www.easychair.org/con=
ferences/?conf=3Dlola2010
