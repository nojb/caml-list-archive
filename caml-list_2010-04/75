You may be interested in Amthing( https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/amthing/ ) is, 
under development, a FRPed GUI library written by OCaml.
Amthing dose not have GUI components yet, but has simple sprite system
( labels, images, rectangles and any visible objects can be puted on screen). 
It's already work well on X11. You can read some examples in the source repository.
