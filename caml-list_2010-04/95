Poster/demo/fast abstract submission: May 1, 2010
Author notification: May 15, 2010
Conference: July 12-15, 2010

POSTER PAPERS provide an excellent forum for authors to present their wo=
rk in an informal and interactive setting. Posters are ideal to showcase=
 speculative, late-breaking results or to introduce interesting, innovat=
ive work. Posters sessions are highly interactive. They allow authors an=
d interested participants to connect to each other and to engage in disc=
ussions about the work presented. Posters provide authors with a unique =
opportunity to draw attention to their work during the conference. Accep=
ted contributions will be published in electronic form and are limited t=
o 2 pages.

DEMO PAPERS report on an existing research prototype by clearly identify=
ing the original contributions and ideas demonstrated. The authors are e=
xpected to prepare a poster and perform a live software demonstration on=
 their own laptop during an exhibit-style conference reception. Any spec=
ial requirements should be identified in the appendix of the paper. Acce=
pted contributions will be published in electronic form and are limited =
to 2 pages.

FAST ABSTRACTS at DEBS are short presentations (5 minutes), either on ne=
w ideas or work in progress, or opinion pieces that can address any issu=
e relevant to distributed events. Because they are brief and have a late=
r deadline, Fast Abstracts enable their authors to summarise work that i=
s not yet complete, put forward novel or challenging ideas, state positi=
ons on controversial issues, suggest new approaches to the solution of o=
pen problems without having fully verified it. Fast Abstracts are aimed =
at academics and practitioners, junior and senior researchers, promoting=
 a rich exchange of experiences. Thus, they provide an excellent opportu=
nity to introduce new work, or present radical opinions, and receive ear=
ly feedback from the community. Please note however that fast abstracts =
will NOT be included in the proceedings.

Contributions are particularly solicited from industrial practitioners a=
nd academics that may not have been able to prepare full papers due to t=
ime and work pressure, but nevertheless seek an opportunity to engage wi=
th the DEBS community.

The topics addressed by the conference include (but are not limited to):=


Models, Architectures and Paradigms
- Event-driven architectures
- Basic interaction models
- Event algebras, event schemas and type systems
- Languages for event correlation and patterns, streaming and continuous=

=A0=A0queries, data fusion
- Models for static and dynamic environments
- Complex event processing
- Design and programming methodologies
- Event-based business process management and modeling
- Experimental methodologies
- Performance modeling and prediction based on analytic approaches

Middleware Infrastructures for Event-Based Computing
- Federated event-based systems
- Middleware for actuator and sensor networks
- Algorithms and protocols
- Event dissemination based on p2p systems
- Context and location awareness
- Fault-tolerance, reliability, availability, and recovery
- Security issues
- (Self-)Management
- Mobility and resource constrained device support
- Streaming queries, transformations, or correlation engines

Applications, Experiences, and Requirements
- Use cases and applications of event-based systems
- Real-world application deployments using event-based middleware
- Domain-specific deployments of event-based systems
- Real-world data characterising event-based applications
- Benchmarks, performance evaluations, and testbeds
- Application requirements for next-generation event-based solutions
- Relation to other architectures
- Enterprise application integration
- Event-driven business process management
- Information logistics
- Seamless integration of event-based mechanisms into middleware
=A0=A0platforms

SUBMISSION CONTENT. Submissions will be evaluated both on their contribu=
tions and on how effectively they communicate those contributions.

All *posters* should include the following information:

- The purpose and goals of the work.
- Any background and motivation information needed to understand the wor=
k=20
  as well as any critical hypotheses and assumptions that underlie the w=
ork, if=20
  appropriate.
- A summary of the contribution and/or results, in sufficient detail for=
 a=20
  viewer to understand the work and/or results; especially key details, =
results=20
  and contributions, or the anticipated contributions if the work is at =
an early=20
  stage.
- The relationship to other related efforts, where appropriate. Authors =
of=20
  accepted posters may be asked to point out relationships to work repre=
sented=20
  by other accepted posters.
- Where to find additional information. This should include but is not=20=

  restricted to:
    ~ a web site where viewers can go to find additional information abo=
ut the=20
      work
    ~ how to contact the authors, including email addresses
    ~ citations for any papers, books, or other materials that provide=20=

      additional information

*Demo submissions* must describe the purpose of the demo as well as key =
ideas that have gone into building the tool or prototype. They can also =
showcase results that can be verified by the demo. In addition to the el=
ectronic submission, demo submissions MUST provide a link to the demo th=
at is available for the period of evaluation.

*Fast abstracts* must have a clear picture of the problem being solved o=
r the opinions being stated. They are not required to be as structured a=
s a poster but must argue the thesis concisely and clearly.

POSTER LAYOUT GUIDELINES. The presentation guide drawn up by IEEE and AC=
M for the Student Research Competition contains a lot of very useful inf=
ormation on how to produce a successful poster. In particular: "A pictur=
e is worth a thousand words." Guide viewers to the main issues and help =
them to understand the work quickly in order to attract more attention t=
o your work. Few attendees will stop to read a large poster with dense t=
ext. If you use screen shots, please ensure that the shots print legibly=
 and that the fonts are large enough to be read comfortably.

SUBMISSION PROCESS. Electronic submission of Poster papers, Demo papers =
and Fast Abstracts is required through the DEBS submission system:

      http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ddebsposters2010

The two-pages paper or fast abstract is to be submitted initially for ev=
aluation and selection. If selected, we would require you to finally sub=
mit the camera ready version of the initial version taking into account =
comments by the program committee. Electronic versions of the poster pri=
ntout do not need to be submitted through DEBS submission system.

ATTENDANCE. At least one of the authors are required to register and att=
end DEBS 2010 and the scheduled interactive poster/demo session, staying=
 with their poster/demo so that they can discuss their work with confere=
nce attendees. Fast abstracts will receive a 5 minute presentation slot =
during the conference. Authors of demos/posters may post an informal sch=
edule along with their poster/demo, listing times when they plan to be a=
vailable for discussion later on during the conference. Sign-up sheets a=
llow interested viewers to obtain further information. Posters, Demos & =
Fast Abstracts are advertised in the Final Program, and authors' two-pag=
e papers for posters and demos will appear in the DEBS 2010 Conference P=
roceedings, which will be distributed at DEBS 2010. Attendees will be ab=
le to learn more about individual posters continuously during the whole =
of the conference.
