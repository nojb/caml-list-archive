Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.07.0

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Nikola Tesla and Marcel=
 Proust by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.07.0. This is a major =
release with a lot of new features, see the changelog below.

It is available as a bunch of OPAM switches, or as a source download here: =
< http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07 >.

Happy hacking,
--=20
Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.


OCaml 4.07.0 (10 July 2018)
---------------------------

(Changes that can break existing programs are marked with a "*")

### Language features:

er)

p the
  bigarray library as on overlay adding the deprecated map_file functions

  which is the default opened module (Stdlib itself includes Pervasives) to=
 free
  up the global namespace for other standard libraries, while still allowin=
g any
  OCaml standard library module to be referred to as Stdlib.Module). This is
  implemented efficiently using module aliases (prefixing all modules with

  (Nicol=C3=A1s Ojeda B=C3=A4r, review by Gabriel Scherer, David Allsopp, X=
avier Leroy)
