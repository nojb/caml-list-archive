You could, in the "external build" command passed to CMake, wrap the
build invocation with code to create the symlinks before the build,
and remove them after the build.

That said, If I understand oasis' philosophy correctly (but I'm far
from an expert), the file that are generated by the oasis setup are
not to be understood as "generated files never to be looked at", but
rather *source* files that you may want to modify and customize
yourself, and just contain some snippets produced by oasis. I would
understand this as a kind of "we created the basic boilerplate
structure of your project for you", rather than "those are hidden
files only used during the build". In particular, you may be expected
to include these files in your version-control repository (something I
have been a bit reluctant to do myself; I think that the newish
"dynamic" setup mode of oasis avoids versioning any cruft).

(That said, many users never have to touch the oasis-generated files.)

I'll let oasis developers triage this issue, but it is not as clear as
you describe. It's not that this oasis setup works in simple cases and
breaks in other, but rather than oasis does not support this setup at
all, yet sometimes ocamlbuild can do what it needs without any help
whatsoever.


One other option would be to enhance ocamlbuild to support the
scenario where the build-description files it needs (_tags and
myocamlbuild.ml) are located outside the source repository, which is a
reasonable assumption if we assume they have been generated rather
than user-written (your situation). We could add a (-config-dir $DIR)
option for that, or separate options (-plugin-source /path/to/foo.ml)
and (-tag-file /path/to/_tags). It strikes me as a bit odd to have a
_tags file in another directory, that contains glob patterns relative
to the source directory (in your case the _tags file will refer to
<src/...>). But I like the idea and created a feature request to track
it:
  http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6997
But if you go this route, it means that you would have to wait for the
next ocamlbuild release, so an oasis-level solution or workaround
would currently be more helpful for you.
