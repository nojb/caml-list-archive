The 4th International Conference on the Theory and Practice of
Natural Computing (TPNC 2015) invites authors to submit poster
presentations. TPNC 2015 will be held in Mieres (Spain) on 15-16
December, 2015. See

conference participants, at the same time allowing for in-depth
discussion.

- nature-inspired models of
computation, 

- synthesizing nature by means of computation, 

-
nature-inspired materials, 

- information processing in nature, 

-
applications of natural computing. 

Posters do not need to show final
research results. Work that might lead to new interesting developments
is welcome.
