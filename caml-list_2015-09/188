Subject: Re: [Caml-list] whither portability?

Exciting to hear! Thank you and your contributors for this work. I
know there are ways people can be parochial, but I have never been
able to fathom how the core OCaml team can ignore mobile so actively,
it seems. It is to sigh, oy veh.

Throwing out random ideas as a potential some-day user of such a thing:

* Getting anything working as simply as possible would be a nice first
step, even if it isn't the most performant. I.e. bytecode. It seems
Apple has loosened up on that a bit over the years? And I wonder if
LLVM bytecode would be no problem with them now.

* FFI will be essential. It is one thing to have 2+2 working on
mobile, it is another to be able to get any real app work done. (In
the past I have had some negative experiences with OCaml and FFI for
OpenGL so I am always a little worried about trying to reignite my
relationship with OCaml.)

* Ideally it has to integrate well with the platform toolchains,
including the preferred IDEs. E.g. if there's no good installer, if I
have to do a lot of work to build things, etc., then I'm way less
likely to even try to use it. I know that is work most people do not
like to do. I say that empirically.

* If you can find some commerical users and support, that could help
drive some of the above issues further faster (although of course the
vector along which they proceed is subjective).
