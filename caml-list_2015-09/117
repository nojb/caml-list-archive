Subject: [Caml-list] LablGtk-documentation...

Hello,

possibly some people who are responsible for the LablGtk-documentation  
are reading here on this list.

The ressources are spread over different documents, and these documents
contain a lot of broken links.

What seems to be the main page for LablGtk, IMO, is this one:

http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/


There are links to API-descriptions as well as a README and tutorials.

Let's look at the API-documentation:
   http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/index.html

Nice to have that document. But the links to GtK (C-API) are not available.

Example: http://lablgtk.forge.ocamlcore.org/refdoc/GEdit.html
If you look for "val entry_completion" there is a linkt to the  
documentation of
"GtkEntryCompletion".
But that link is the following:  
"file:///usr/share/gtk-doc/html/gtk/GtkEntryCompletion.html"
and thats, why the document is not avaialable.

I think, it would be much better to have detailed information inside the
API-description itself (instead of comparing LablGtk/OCaml and GtK/C  
documentation),
but as long as that is not the case, the link to GtK itself would be better
than not to have such a link.

So it would be nice, to make these links avaialable.

Let's look at the "LablGtk2 Tutorial by SooHyoung Oh", which is very  
helpful, btw.
But it suffers from the same broken-link desease.

Example:  
http://plus.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/lablgtk2/lablgtk2-tutorial/x459.html
There is a link to "GPack.table"-documentation.
But following the link gives "Server not found".
So, izt seems the document has changed it's location a while ago,
and the links weren't updated in the document.

Let's look at the "Treeview Tutorial by SooHyoung Oh", which I did not  
explored
in depth so far. But just testing for broken links, arbitrarily picking a page
immediately also brought a broken link.

Example:  
http://plus.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/lablgtk2/treeview-tutorial/ch03s05.html
The link to the "get" method gives "Server not found", and the link to  
"gtk_tree_model_get"
gives document not found.

(Looks like the Gnome-documents have changed location.)


These are just some examples.
I assume there will be more issues to find.

I would like to ask the people, who maintain these documents,
to fix these (and possibly other) issues, so that the quality of the
documentation could become better.

Also, if there are other docs abozt GtK/LablGtk, it would be nice if  
they could be added
to the above mentioned main page, so that these other docs are  
available easily.


Thanks In Advance,
     Oliver
