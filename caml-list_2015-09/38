Subject: [Caml-list] Dynlink

Dear all,

It seems that, at least at some point in the past, Dynlink was not
available everywhere. For instance as far as I could see it seems it was
available for byte-code only. Is that correct? And if so, since which
OCaml version is Dynlink available for both byte-code and native-code?

Are there other environments in which Dynlink is not supported?

Many thanks for any information.

Best wishes,

SÃ©bastien.
