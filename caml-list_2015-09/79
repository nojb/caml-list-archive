2ND
INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOLON BIG DATA 

  

BIGDAT 2016 

BILBAO, SPAIN


FEBRUARY 8-12, 2016 

Organized by: 

Deusto University 

Rovira i
Virgili University 

http://grammars.grlmc.com/BigDat2016/


******************************************************** 

--- Early
registration deadline: September 22, 2015 ---


******************************************************** 

AIM:


BigDat 2016 will be a research training event addressed to graduates
and postgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a
global scope, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in
the critical and fast developing area of big data, which covers a large
spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation with an
extraordinary potential for a huge impact on scientific discoveries,
medicine, engineering, business models, and society itself. Renowned
academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with
the audience. 

Most big data subareas will be displayed, namely:
foundations, infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and
privacy, and applications. Main challenges of analytics, management and
storage of big data will be identified through 5 keynote lectures, 16
six-hour courses, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active
and promising topics. The organizers are convinced that outstanding
speakers will attract the brightest and most motivated students.
Interaction will be a main component of the event. An open session will
give participants the opportunity to present their own work in progress
in 5 minutes. 

ADDRESSED TO: 

Graduates and postgraduates from around
the world. There are no formal pre-requisites in terms of academic
degrees. However, since there will be differences in the course levels,
specific knowledge background may be assumed for some of them. BigDat
2016 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep
themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. All will
surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researchers,
industry leaders and innovators. 

REGIME: 

In addition to keynotes, at
least 2 courses will run in parallel during the whole event.
Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be
willing to attend as well as to move from one to another. 

VENUE:


BigDat 2016 will take place in Bilbao, the capital of the Basque
Country region, famous for its gastronomy and the seat of the
GuggenheimMuseum. The venue will be: 

DeustoTech, School of Engineering


DeustoUniversity 

Avda. Universidades, 24 

48014 Bilbao
