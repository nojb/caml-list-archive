-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --

ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers
and tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the
proceedings and have presentations during the conference.=20

ESOP and FoSSaCS accept only research papers.=20

A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one
of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original
research. They must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. In particular, simultaneous submission of the same
contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is forbidden. The
proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research in Computing
and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series.

Papers must follow the formatting guidelines specified by Springer at
the URL

   http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

and be submitted electronically in pdf through the EasyChair author
interface of the respective conference.

Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately.

FASE will try a light-weight double-blind review process (see
http://www.etaps.org/2016/fase).


- Research papers

FASE, FOSSACS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pp (excluding
bibliography of max 2 pp) for research papers, whereas POST allows at
most 20 pp (excluding bibliography of max 2 pp) and ESOP 25 pp
(excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication
in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page
limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers
must be understandable without them.

In addition to regular research papers, TACAS solicits also case study
papers (at most 15 pp, excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).

Both TACAS and FASE solicit also regular tool papers (at most 15 pp,
excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).


- Tool demonstration papers

Submissions should consist of two parts:

* The first part, at most 4 pages, should describe the tool
   presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and
   provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of
   the tool. (This part will be included in the proceedings.)

* The second part, at most 6 pages, should explain how the
   demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including
   screen dumps and examples. (This part will be not be included in the
   proceedings, but will be evaluated.

ESOP and FOSSACS do not accept tool demonstration papers.

TACAS has a page limit of 6 pages for tool demonstrations.

Around 20 satellite workshops will take place before and after the
main conferences.
