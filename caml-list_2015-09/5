The opposite also holds true -- OPAM remains relatively consistent across
operating system distributions, in an age when students are bringing their
own laptops running various strands of Linux, *BSD and MacOS X.  Only
Windows languishes behind at the moment.  Our experience in Cambridge is
that our sys-admins have had no problem installing OPAM on our centrally
managed (Ubuntu LTS) lab machines, while students followed the online
instructions to get it running on their own flavours.  Windows students
run a Vagrant or Virtualbox VM, or can soon use Boot2Docker.

My view on packaging is that it ultimately needs to be automated from
a central metadata source held in the package, with only OS-specific
concerns being put into the upstream port.  Right now, individual
distributions go to great pains to separately calculate packing lists
for (e.g.) native vs bytecode, where this should all really be information
provided by a standardised build system.  That's the intention of various
efforts such as OASIS, oasis2opam, and the early efforts to get opam2deb
and opam2rpm working: https://github.com/ocaml/opam/wiki/opam2%7Brpm,deb%7D
The OPAM `depext` mechanism also tracks external OS packaging metadata
in order to do a better job of continuous integration.

Don't get me wrong -- I have a huge respect for the efforts poured into
Debian and Fedora packaging of individual libraries, and I also spend
significant time myself maintaining OpenBSD ports of OCaml libraries.
But I also appreciate being able to get the latest libraries and
manipulate them at a source-code level much more easily via OPAM.
These are all complementary efforts :-)

Any specific concerns here?  We run quite a bit of automated testing
on the OPAM repository, and the only real source of non-reproducibility
in a well-controlled base environment (as found when running in a Linux
container or BSD VM) is if the external aspcud package solver is changed.

No, old versions are never deleted from the OPAM repository and remain
available to install.

The build is also never run as root, only as the user uid that invoked
OPAM.  The `OPAMROOT` variable can be set to a system-wide area if
desired.  See `opam --help` for a full list.
