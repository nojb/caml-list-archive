My intent was not to fling accusations at anyone, nor to engender defensive
remarks. It was simply to say,

1. Let us learn from this for next year.
2. Let's push through to get something up on youtube, because given the
fact that every other workshop is up, there's a possibility that the OCaml
workshop will be forgotten about at the end of the day, simply because
that's what happens -- busy people forget or put off things that no longer
seem relevant.
3. The biggest movers and shakers in the OCaml community were probably
already at ICFP, and so aren't necessarily lobbying for the videos to be
put up. These videos serve a huge function, however, in getting people
(including myself) excited about the future of the language.
