And a *huge* thanks for bringing us all this fantastic language, Xavier!

I keep as one of my most fond memories the fantastic teamwork at Formel,
then Cristal, then Gallium, that brought together under your direction some
of the brightest minds on the many challenges in language design, and that
led to what OCaml is today, one of the most beautiful languages I know.

Let me offer the best whishes for the future of OCaml: I'm looking forward
to see the sound, principled, elegant approach that lies at the heart of
OCaml expand to all its ecosystem.

Long live OCaml!

<br>
Announcing Caml Special Light 1.06, the first public release of the<br>
Caml Special Light system.<br>
<br>
Caml Special Light is a complete reimplementation of Caml Light that<br>
adds a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML. The module<br>
system is based on the notion of manifest types / translucent sums; it<br>
supports Modula-style separate compilation, and fully transparent<br>
higher-order functors (see the papers in the POPL 94 and 95<br>
proceedings).<br>
<br>
Caml Special Light comprises two compilers: a bytecode compiler in the<br>
style of Caml Light (but up to twice as fast), and a high-performance<br>
native code compiler for the following platforms:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Alpha processors: DecStation 3000 under OSF1<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Sparc processors: Sun Sparcstation under SunOS =
4.1 or Solaris 2<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Intel 386 / 486 / Pentium processors: PCs under=
 Linux<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Mips processors: DecStation 3100 and 5000 under=
 Ultrix 4<br>
<br>
The native-code compiler delivers excellent performance (better than<br>
Standard ML of New Jersey 1.08 on our tests), while retaining the<br>
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler.<br>
<br>
Caml Special Light is still in the experimental state: the base<br>
language has changed and will change again in significant ways,<br>
source-level compatibility is not ensured, the implementation is<br>
alpha-release quality, and many Caml Light tools and libraries have<br>
not yet been ported to Caml Special Light. The present release is<br>
targeted towards testers, adventurous souls, and users with strong<br>
interest in modules and high-performance compilation; other users are<br>
encouraged to stay with Caml Light 0.7 for a while.<br>
<br>
The source distribution (for Unix machines only) is available by<br>
anonymous FTP on <a href=3D"http://ftp.inria.fr" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=
