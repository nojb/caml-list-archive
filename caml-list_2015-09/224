Please consider adding more comments to the following bug, which seems
close to what you are discussing:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=3Ddetail&aid=3D1473&grou=
p_id=3D54&atid=3D291

I must admit that I totally miss the whole point of the discussion,
probably if you can make a summary of what you precisely need in the BTS, I
will be able to understand the problem better.

Regards
Sylvain
