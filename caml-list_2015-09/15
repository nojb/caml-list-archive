Subject: [Caml-list] LPAR-20 Short Presentation Papers

===============================================================================
                   The 20th International Conference on
        Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning
                   Suva, Fiji, 23rd-28th November 2015
                             www.LPAR-20.info

                    CALL FOR SHORT PRESENTATION PAPERS

In keeping with the tradition of LPAR, researchers and practitioners are
invited to submit short presentation papers (the papers can be full length, the
presentation slots will be short), reporting on interesting work in progress,
system and tool descriptions, experimental results, etc. They need not be 
original, and extended or revised versions of the papers may be submitted 
concurrently with or after LPAR to another conference or a journal. Authors of
accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them will be
present at the conference. Papers that do not adhere to this policy will not
be published.

The short presentation papers will be published electronically as a volume in 
the EPiC series, see http://www.easychair.org/publications/EPiC. The LaTeX 
and Microsoft Word templates for the EPiC series can be downloaded from 
http://www.easychair.org/publications/for_authors. Short papers may be up to 
15 pages long, and must be submitted through the EasyChair system using the 
web page https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar20.

Paper submission deadline: 19th October 2015
Notification of acceptance: 2nd November 2015
Final version: 9th November 2015

... however, in order to facilitate authors making travel arrangements, papers
submitted before the deadline will be reviewed immediately, and a decision
made in approximately one week. Submit early, and submit often!
