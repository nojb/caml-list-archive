Subject: [Caml-list] How can I change the margin size in the toplevel?

Hello,

I=E2=80=99m writing some slides for an ocaml course that contain the output=
 sent
by the toplevel, such as the following:

# let x =3D 1 + "toto";;
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of ty=
pe
         int

As the messages are too wide to fit on the width of the slide, they are
put in an environment that wraps them. The results look like this:

Characters 12-18:
  let x =3D 1 + "toto";;
              ^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of
      type
         int

I=E2=80=99m trying to get rid of the line break before =E2=80=9Cint=E2=80=
=9D, and looking at the
code, I see that the toplevel uses Format with break hints for these
messages, so I should be able to do this by setting the margin to a big
number. Unfortunately I don=E2=80=99t seem to be able to change the margin =
of
the formatter used in the toplevel. I tried both:

Format.pp_set_margin Format.err_formatter 200

and

Format.pp_set_margin Format.std_formatter 200

inside the toplevel but it does not change the formatter for these
messages.

Is there a way to access the formatter used by the toplevel? And if not,
is it possible to change the column at which word wrap happens?

Thanks,

Alan
