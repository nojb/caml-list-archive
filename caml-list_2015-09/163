Yes, CMake lets me do pretty much anything, but it does make the build a
little more complex and I'm already sneaking in OCaml without telling ;)

Yes, I am aware of that, and with "dynamic" mode `oasis` seems to
generate little enough that I wouldn't mind putting it in VCS.

I tend to land in the camp of "if the behaviour is surprising (without
delighting) to a user, then it's a bug".  I'm fully aware that what I'm
trying to do might not have been a scenario the `oasis` devs ever
considered.

Thanks, I'll keep an eye on that request.

For the time being I get by with using `ocamlbuild` (via `corebuild`)
and its `-build-dir` option.  Hopefully there'll be more support for
out-of-source building when I get to the point of replacing all C code
with OCaml ;)
