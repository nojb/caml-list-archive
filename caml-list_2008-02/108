As soon as the following function is rewritten:

debugger/input_handling.ml

(* Handle active files until `continue_main_loop' is false. *)
let main_loop () =
  let old_state = !continue_main_loop in
    try
      continue_main_loop := true;
      while !continue_main_loop do
        try
          let (input, _, _) =
            select (List.map fst !active_files) [] [] (-1.)
          in
            List.iter
              (function fd ->
                 let (funct, iochan) = (List.assoc fd !active_files) in
                   funct iochan)
              input
        with
          Unix_error (EINTR, _, _) -> ()
      done;
      continue_main_loop := old_state
    with
      x ->
        continue_main_loop := old_state;
        raise x

here Unix.select() waits for both network and user input events. We
could split this into 2 threads, but how to interrupt network select()
when we going to exit? Well, we could use some small timeout value for
select() (say 500ms) and restart it the loop when !continue_main_loop
is set, but this looks not very elegant... Or it's OK?

The point is not to modify win32unix library or write Win32-specific C
functions for ocamldebug. I believe it's necessary to be ever accepted
by INRIA.
