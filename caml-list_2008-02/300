X-Spam: no; 0.00; camlidl:01 arrays:01 camlidl:01 allocating:01 malloc:01 sizeof:01 allocates:01 hand-written:01 bindings:01 mlname:01 rectangular:98 int:01 int:01 data:02 argument:02 

I am attempting to use camlidl to wrap a function with the following C
prototype portion (see [1] for the full prototype):

... void c_plriddata( ... int nptsx, ... int nptsy, [out,
size_is(nptsx,nptsy)] double ** zg ...);

There is a lot more in the full prototype [1], but these are the
important bits for this question.  In this form, the 2D zg array is
not allocated as I would have expected.  Rather than allocating a
rectangular nptsx by nptsy array, the generated C is:

zg = camlidl_malloc(nptsx * sizeof(double *), _ctx);

This is then passed in to the c_plgriddata function as-is, which in
turn causes a segmentation fault as c_plgriddata expects that zg has
already been fully allocated as a two dimensional double array.

If I add the "in" attribute to the zg argument in the annotated C
prototype, then camlidl fully allocates the required space.  I do not
want to have to do this, as the zg array is only needed as an output
from this function, not an input.

If there is no fix/solution to my problem with camlidl then I can
write the binding for this particular function by hand.  I would
prefer to keep the amount of hand-written C bindings I need to
maintain to a minimum.  camlidl has made wrapping almost all of the
rest of this library (PLplot) very straightforward.

Sincerely,
Hez

[in, size_is(nptsy)] double * yg, int nptsy,
