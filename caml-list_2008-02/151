1ST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
6TH INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL ON ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 2008 
(AFP ’08)
RADBOUD UNIVERSITY NIJMEGEN AND UTRECHT UNIVERSITY, THE NETHERLANDS
MAY 19-24, 2008
http://www.st.cs.ru.nl/AFP_TFP_2008/



AFP is a series of international summer schools which aims to
bring computer scientists, in particular young researchers and
programmers, up to date with the latest advances in practical
advanced functional programming. Functional programming
emphasizes the evaluation of expressions rather than the
execution of commands. We focus on functional programming
techniques in “programming in the real world” and bridge the
gap between results presented at programming conferences and
material from textbooks on functional programming. In this
school you will receive in depth lectures about advanced
functional programming techniques, taught by experts in the
field. Lectures are accompanied by practical problems to be
solved by the students at the school.

AFP 2008 is hosted by the Radboud University Nijmegen, and
Utrecht University, The Netherlands, and will be held in the
rural setting of Center Parcs “Het Heijderbos”, Heijen (in the
vicinity of Nijmegen), The Netherlands.

AFP 2008 is co-located with the 9th Symposium on Trends in
Functional Programming (TFP’08), which is held after AFP’08.


PROGRAM INFORMATION
The following speakers will give the lectures (in alphabetic
order):
Umut Acar          (Toyota Technological Institute,
                    University of Chicago, US)
Richard Bird       (University of Oxford, UK)
Olivier Danvy      (University of Aarhus, DK)
Johan Jeuring      (Utrecht University, NL)
Mark Jones         (Portland State University, US)
Ulf Norell         (Chalmers University, SE)
Simon Peyton Jones (Microsoft Research, UK)
Rinus Plasmeijer   (Radboud University Nijmegen, NL)

During the summer school, all participants receive printed
lecture notes. Participants are expected to have a notebook,
in order to be able to participate with the practical problems.

After the summer school, all lecture notes will be revised,
reviewed, and published in the LNCS series of Springer. All
registered participants receive a copy of these lecture notes.


VENUE INFORMATION
AFP (and TFP) is held in The Netherlands, at Center Parcs “Het
Heijderbos” which is a holiday resort in the woodlands near the
city of Nijmegen. We accomodate participants in DeLuxe Cottages,
each of which has three separate bed-rooms, shared bathroom,
toilet, kitchen, and terrace. Cottages will be shared by three
participants. If you wish to reduce costs, you can choose to
share a bedroom. The summer school and symposium will take place
in the business center of the venue. Breakfast, lunch and diner
is included within the limits of the venue. The resort features,
amongst others, a sub-tropical swimming pool (free for
participants), restaurants, shops, water sports lake, midget golf
court, squash court, and outdoor and indoor tennis courts.

Nijmegen is considered to be the oldest city of the Netherlands,
being approximately 2000 years old. Nijmegen is located at the
east border of the Netherlands, near Germany. Nijmegen can be
reached easily from several airports such as Schiphol airport,
Eindhoven airport, and Düsseldorf airport, as well as by train
and car. Conveniently close to Center Parcs “Het Heijderbos” you
will find airport Weeze in Germany. The venue Center Parcs “Het
Heijderbos” can be reached from Nijmegen by train to Boxmeer
(25 minutes). From there you will need to order a taxi. The venue
can also be reached by car: parking is free for participants of
AFP and TFP.


SUMMER SCHOOL FEES
AFP 2008 includes accommodation, conference, breakfast – lunch –
diner, speakers, and proceedings costs. The early registration fee
is € 995; the late registration fee is € 1095. Please note that if
