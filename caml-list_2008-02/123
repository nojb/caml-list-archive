Hello,

I should have changed the Subject to: "Shocking Performance!!!"

but then possibly the spam-filter would become active ;-)


The performance dramatically increased now!

I first had about 3min34  on my dataset.
After throwing out some of the "^"-using
functions, the time was about 1min55.

Now, after I threw out the rest of that "^"-stuff
(which btw. made more of the catanations then
the first thrown out functions, but was not called
as often as trhe other functions) I'm under 20 seconds!
(17..18 seconds!)

That's amazing! :-)

Especially, because my dataset is about 300 times bigger
than the normal data which the tool will see, I think,
it's nice now :-)


   ......aaaaaaaaand the winneeeeer iiiiis:   OCaml !!!   :-)

Yes, that's coooooool! :)


Hurray, party :-)


Ciao,
  Oliver
