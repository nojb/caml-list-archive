That would be an appalling thing to do! The way Julien has versioned this is
exactly correct - it's a major version increment so totally incompatible
code changes are acceptable (even though, as Richard has pointed out, it
does create a little bit of pain for libraries that depend on Calendar).
That said, it's not too much work as far as I can see to hide the difference
in a module generated in a configure script... perhaps a bit of code that
could be included in Calendar to help package authors.

As things stand, I can stick with Calendar 1.10.0 until I want/need to shift
to 2.0.0 - and Julien could release any pertinent *bug-fixes* to the 1.x and
2.x branches if he wishes.

To make a change like that (even where the code alterations required are
relatively small) is IMHO not an acceptable thing to do with a minor version
increment.
