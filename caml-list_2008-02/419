I think that different projects have different trade-offs that are
hard, if not impossible, to combine.  Deriving is a very elegant,
general approach, but last time I checked it would be hard to generate
highly optimized code with it, and it was also not complete (e.g.
handling hard cases like polymorphic variants with inherited types,
etc.).  Type-conv was mostly factored out of sexplib to make it
possible to have different type converters in different preprocessors,
because we are planning to release our binary protocol library very
soon.  Type-conv only combines a few often needed constructs, but in
my experience the very vast part of new type converters has to be
written by hand anyway (at least if you care about performance / good
code generation) so there is little to gain here.  I don't know much
about OCaml-Templates.

Regards,
Markus
