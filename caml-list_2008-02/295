I agree with your motivation. In the meantime, a quick solution which
can help having more "lively" update notifications can be to just keep
an online version of the list of broken links you've just sent to the
list.

I'm thinking at a link on the main page "broken links", containing a
daily generated list of broken links. That way people, including both
contributors and users, can look at the list and send you an email with
the up to date link. It won't be a wiki, but at least it would enable
users to improve the content and diminish the overall update time of
links .... I think :)

Thanks for your work on The Humps.
Cheers.
