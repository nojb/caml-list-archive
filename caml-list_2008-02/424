Dear OCaml folks,

I am an happy OCaml amateur programmer since many years now, and I ever
wondered why the language has ``functors'' --- I was puzzled by the
name.

My curiosity had a renewal when I found this book in the math department
library: Categories for types, by Crole. Before checking the book out, I
would like to know if the term ``functor'' was chosen because they are
actually functors. Maybe someone can also suggests other readings to me.
(I have a strong math education, although I am not used to work with
categories.)
