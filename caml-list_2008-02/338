That was stupid.

Actually that's a solution to another problem, as the overflow is
probably not due to hash collisions - we are talking of the same keys here.

But I have a solution: do not use the Hashtbl to store multiple entries per key;
use a Queue per entry for that.  Queues include some Obj.magic and are actually pretty
cheap.

let q =
   try
     Hashtbl.find movieMajor m
   with
   | Not_found ->
       let q = Queue.create () in
       Hashtbl.add movieMajor m q;
       q
in
Queue.push (u, rFloat) q
