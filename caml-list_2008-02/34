Yes, it does. My interpretation is as you have described above: to
create a separate, backwards- or forwards-incompatible version of the
core compiler without INRIA's cooperation. I think a "fork" under this
interpretation would be a mistake.

I agree: it is extremely unclear exactly where this "Community OCaml"
initiative is going to go. It seems probable that it will provide a
channel through which your suggestions for evolving the language can
be considered and potentially accepted into an official or
quasi-official release. Probably the most productive way you could
advance your concerns right now is to advocate for just such a
channel: some JSR-like arrangement that will bring INRIA into the loop
and allow the community to form a consensus around feature requests.

Perhaps no such arrangement will come to pass, or perhaps the
community will reject your proposals after a full and fair hearing. I
suggest that we wait and see before we resort to loose talk of forking
the code.

Best regards,
Chris
