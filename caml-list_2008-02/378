      The Foundations of Global Computing - Trinity College Dublin
               Two postdoctoral Research Fellowships

Applications are invited for TWO post-doctoral  positions to
undertake research into the foundations of Global Computing.  The
posts are within the Software Systems Lab  of the Department of
Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin as part of a new SFI-funded
research project, under the direction of Matthew Hennessy, which seeks
to establish a firm mathematical and logical basis for the next
generation of widely distributed computing computing environments.

Applicants should have a PhD in Computer Science, or a closely related
discipline. Candidates with  expertise in following areas are
particularly welcome:

- operational semantics
- concurrency theory
- model checking
- verification techniques
- type theory
- program logics


These posts are tenable from April 2008 at a salary commensurate with
the successful candidates' qualifications and experience. Appointments
will be made initially for a 24 month period, although there will be
scope for extension. Further particulars of the posts may be obtained
from the address below, and informal enquiries are also welcomed.

Applications   should include
  - detailed curriculum vitae, in pdf format
  - copies of relevant publications, or url-pointers to them
  - the names of two referees
  - a statement outlining  the applicant's suitability to the project.

Applications should be sent to:
