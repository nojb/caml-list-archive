Jon, pretty please, stop it. You already know that we (Debian), me
(Zack), and whatever else entities which are associated to my free will
are *NOT* going to fork OCaml or any of its parts. (The reason being
that I don't think it would be beneficial to the community in any way at
this point, but this motivation is OT here.)

Now you can go back, read the minutes of the meeting and other messages
from Sylvain and you can find out by yourself that we are not going to
provide novel software, but rather services.

Cheers.
