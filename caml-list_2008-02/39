I'm completly agnostic on the tool used and I agree that it should be more =
an=20
issue of a common interface.

The other needs I was expressing where:
 * Standard location for installation
 * Standard way to check if a system can provide build environment for a gi=
ven=20
module, for compilation checks and build in projects using the module.
