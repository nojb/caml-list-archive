That's an interesting question. I believe we all agree, starting with
Xavier Leroy, that 'Failure of string' was a quick-and-dirty solution
with which we're stuck but should be brushed under the carpet as soon as
possible. In fact, that's one of the problems this recommendation should
help resolve.

Now, concerning hierarchies. My personal experience with Java's
exception hierarchies (which I assume are similar to .Net's) is that the
only circumstance in which I've taken advantage of subtyping was to
relate every exception to the mother-class Exception:

try
 ...
catch(Exception e) //Deal with all exceptions at once, for instance
                   //by turning them into instances of RuntimeError 
 ...

Does anyone have a different experience on the subject ?

Cheers,
 David
