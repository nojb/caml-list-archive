I think I wouldn't use objects at all in this situation. You're trying
to model the location-tree of "physical" things. A tree must be uniform
in its contents, but you want to put different things into it. That
means you must use an algebraic type, or variants. I'd probably either
use a zipper, or connect the tree nodes with "refs" for the non-pure
version. 

Attaching operations like "go" to a specific object is also a leftover
from the "everything is an object" philosophy. If you must move a physical
thing, just move it. If you need to attach special behaviour for some
sort of movements, find out what it depends on (source, destination,
thing moved, or a combination) and handle those cases in the move-routine.
