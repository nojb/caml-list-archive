I am not sure there is a clear conclusion about this thread. Well, in
fact, there is ONE solution simple and direct which is to create a
FTP/HTTP area where all upstream tarball can be stored. This is a good
first step for beginning. It will serve all current distributions
(Debian/GODI) by providing an alternate download site. It could also be
the first step to make something more complex.

Concerning doing something better, i am not sure we can reach a
consensus for now.

However, just storing tarball somewhere is not a Package Management
System.
