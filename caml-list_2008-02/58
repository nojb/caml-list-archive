Hallo,
A little distraction from discussions on language development to our 
daily problems.

We use camlp4 for code generation. However, camlp4 has a bug associated 
with optional parameters -it does not work for standard syntax. It works 
only for revised syntax. This is the reason why we have passed on to it. 
Basically, revised syntax is more correct and the code reads easier, it 
also eliminates certain drawbacks of standart syntax. One serious 
problem is that there are no correct editor-programs which support this 
syntax.

If someone from distribution uses revised syntax, could you please tell 
what you use. There no plugins for emacs or eclipse. There is one only 
for vim, but it also fails to work correctly.

Thanks in advance!
