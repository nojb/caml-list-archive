I wrote quite a comprehensive answer (almost) to this on the lablgtk list.

In short, your probelms have nothing to do with Ocaml or lablgtk, but
rather with your inexperience with installing software from source on
a Unix system and/or problems with MacPorts.

For problems with MacPorts try the MacPorts mailing list. For help with
installing software from source, maybe someone in your department at
Rice University can help.
