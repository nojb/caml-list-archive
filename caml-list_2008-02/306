GLCaml version 20080215 is now available at http://glcaml.sourceforge.net

GLCaml is a collection of three modules:

1. Glcaml, which offers dynamic bindings to OpenGL 1.1 through 2.1 plus 
all ARB and vendor specific extensions.

2. SDLCaml, which offers bindings to SDL (http://libsdl.org), a graphics 
library

3. Win, which allows OpenGL calls to be used from an Ocaml Graphics 
window without requiring other libraries such as SDL or GTK.

This version of GLCaml has major API changes with respect to the 
previous versions.
The following changes have been made:

1. Bigarrays are no longer necessary for using OpenGL functions. 
Standard Ocaml
types (ints, floats, bools and strings, and corresponding arrays) are 
now used.

2. Enumerated constants (glenums) have been replaced by ints. As a 
result, there
are no more GL_ALL_CAPS constants; these have been replaced by 
gl_no_caps ints

3. An exception is now always thrown if an OpenGL call is not available. 
This is
because silent fails can leave mutable parameters in an undefined state.

Extra examples have been added that make use of the Win module, 
including an example demonstrating the use of OpenGL shaders.

Regards,

Elliott Oti
