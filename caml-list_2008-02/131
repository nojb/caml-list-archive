Alas, I have not migrated to Vista yet. But once the reporter has
Visual C++ experience I would recommend him to build OCaml from
sources with debug info enabled (if won't compile out-of-the-box but
the fix is trivial) and launch ocamlwin under debugger. When it should
become obvious where the access violation occurs.

Indeed, porting select() to Windows would be preferable.
WaitForMultipleObjects() can wait for console, pipe and network events
simultaneously so this should not be that hard (and multiple threads
are probably not necessary). Of course, there are some pitfalls like
this (taken from Cygwin sources):

      /* Some types of object (e.g., consoles) wake up on "inappropriate" events
         like mouse movements.  The verify function will detect these
situations.
         If it returns false, then this wakeup was a false alarm and
we should go
         back to waiting. */

But at least I'll try.
