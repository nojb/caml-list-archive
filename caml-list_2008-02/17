I think that for the moment it's useless to strive to convert every and
each ocaml developer to use the same build system. As I suggested
before, what we should do is only to agree to an interface and then let
the various distribution to deal with build dependencies. In your
example, if a library don't use ocamlfind, this is ok. The only
important thing is to honor the build interface. 

As a developer (and as a software maintainer) I imagine a world where if
I want to use library x.y I've only to take care to give it the right
tools to build, but with the assurance that if I call 'make install',
the library will end up in the right place. Ocamlcore.org would contain
all these libraries so fetching a new version from the net and
re-compiling it would be a snap.

One day we could hope for a convergence in the building tool department
as well, but I think is far too early to call for this kind of
standardization. For example it would be great if all developers would
integrate the debian patches to their build systems...
