You are preaching to the choir.  I'm not Gerd Stolpmann and I don't use
objects very much because every time I try I get seven-page-long errors.

However it seems that objects could be actually useful in situations
where you have a hierarchy of objects with behaviours, such as a graphical
user interface made of widgets, or, say, a text adventure.
