IMHO it would be improper to consider OMake as being make-like and group
it together with various make variants. While some very basic elements
of OMake syntax are made to resemble make in order to facilitate
learning OMake for those familiar with make, but in most respects it is
a lot closer to, say, ocamlbuild than to make.

Of course, this is just a biased opinion of an OMake co-author ;-)
