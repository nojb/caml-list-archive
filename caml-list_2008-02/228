I would like to re-use a file dir/a.ml from another project. This file
depends on dir/b.ml.  Assume I can't modify the contents of dir/ in
any way.

I need to provide a new implementation of just b.ml for my
project. If I just use
    <dir>: include
then the compilation of a.ml uses dir/b.ml instead of my ./b.ml.

I can make it work by symlinking dir/a.ml, but in my real project
there are lots of these files and the project directory gets very
cluttered with symlinks.  I'm sure there must be a better way, but I
couldn't find much documentation on how to use the plugin APIs.
