Actually, it does work here as well, I probably tested earlier with extra
blend modes enabled in C. Sorry about the confusion, should've done a
more thorough test before posting.

The C macros were more about making the code shorter by emulating HOFs,
blend2.ml does inline everything. Coming within 2x of C with no major hackery
on this sort of code is impressive though.
