It was a good occasion to pass the message "do not forget to warn caml-hump
about modifications" ;-)

It's just to keep it consistent, and the number of adds/updates is not
high, so the time spent on administrating the hump is by far shorter than
the time it would take to develop a registering system and moderate the
modifications.

I agree. The hump does not aim to be any kind of repository, just a list of
links with some order. If/when an official place with files and
classification where to find all contribs existed/exists, the hump
would/will be useless.
