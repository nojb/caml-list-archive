Sounds like a good idea. How hard would that be ?

I agree that, whenever module barriers are crossed, interfaces become
specifications. However, as soon as you're remaining inside one module,
it's nice to be more lightweight and just let inference handle
everything. This is where a warning (or something like a "close"
operator) would come in handy.
