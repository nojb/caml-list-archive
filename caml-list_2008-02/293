I should have said "many" instead of "most" but then you wouldn't bother
writing to the list :)

I appreciate the humps for being a nicely organized and aesthetically-
pleasant official place to put Ocaml stuff, and I know it's your work that made it that way.

However, the model where one person updates the entries for hundreds of contributions can't
and doesn't scale and you just gave numbers proving it.  Do you really want to spend your
days updating link entries?  I don't want you to.  You have better things to do.

Why not just allow contributors to update their fields, in the LinkDB way?
You can of course keep moderating and ensuring that there is no spam or misclassifications.

Having that permanent archive we are talking about is also part of the solution.
