Do I understand that this would be combined with dependencies written in
OCamlBuild ?

If you're reading this, Nicolas, how difficult would it be to add a tag
"tgz" and be able to write, say

<my_file.ml>: use_tgz(http://www.ocamlcore.org/global_repository/)

To automatically http-download and unpack a tgz in some central
directory, create a link to whichever directories are contained inside
the tgz and then consider them as subdirectories ? 

That wouldn't be a package management system but, well, it would start
to look like one. At a later stage, this could be completed with
accessing more complex kinds of repositories.

Cheers,
 David
