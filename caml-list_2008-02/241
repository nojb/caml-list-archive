I've had a look at this now, and there are a few difficult issues with
this:

(1) Toplevel modules called 'Utils' and 'Version'.  This is really bad
because not only are you staking a claim to those module names, but
also it will prevent anyone using those module names in their own
programs (and surely that's quite common - I've got both used in my
own programs).

It's much better to call them Calendar_utils and Calendar_version
(note: underscore _not_ period).

(BTW, the same applies to 'Printer', but that's not new in this
release).

(2) Is the library source-compatible with 1.x?

Rich.
