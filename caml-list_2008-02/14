	Hi all !

I have two question related to the recent discussions around ocaml community.

First of all, I'd like to know if we should continu discussing here, or we 
better switch to a new mailing list.

There's a mailman almost ready on ocamlcore.org, so perhaps it should be 
better to continue on a mailing list there ?


Second questions is ocaml modules that we are going to distribute there.
While we have discussed that different way we could use to collect projects 
from different places, I don't think we discussed the minimal support that 
the module should provide when it comes to installing and registering the 
module.

For instance, all perl modules on CPAN share a common build and install 
system, the same for PHP pear and etc..

This can be a real trouble sometimes, like for the xml-light parser: while it 
does not support ocamlfind, the debian package added it, which I think is 
fine. But, our configure script detects xml-light based on ocamlfind, so it 
is screwed up when users want to build the software but installed xml-ligth 
from upstream tarball...

I would recommend that we agreee on a minimal support the a module should ship 
to be part of ocamlcore.org. 

My point would be that it should provide a META file that should work with 
ocamlfind.
Others might have a better idea, but it would be nice to choose something, 
don't you think ?

Then, we should also provide templates for doing so. We have templates for 
configure+ocamlfind which works for all our bindings...
