looking at the page, I find a proposal (beginning), and a lots of people
disaggreeing at the end.

I can see lots of people are concerned by using polymorphic variant (and
I certainly agree with those), and people asking for a monadic approch
(haskell's either like). I can see anything change in the proposal
regarding people's concerned, so what are you going to call for a vote ?
