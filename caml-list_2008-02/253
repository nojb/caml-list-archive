Indeed it is one of my arguments for packing calendar.

You're obviously right: as calendar is now packed, everything which uses 
calendar v1.* does not work anymore with calendar v2.* (and vice-versa).

But the only change to do in your code is: add "open CalendarLib" at the 
top of your files and all is fine because the API is backward compatible 
inside the pack.

For your application(s), a possible trade-off is:
- do this tiny change
- release a new version requiring calendar v2.*
