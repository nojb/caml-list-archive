Personally, I would be enthusiastically happy to provide such a description.

I have seen many, many cases where the dependency information compiled
by non-developers is just awful.  I've seen packages that depend on
Firefox (and want me to build it from source!) because the software
uses HTML help files.  I recently installed KOffice on OS X using
MacPorts and got a chuckle when I learned that gtk2 was a dependency.
It would be much better if dependencies were specified by the
developers directly and the packagers used that info.
