Well, we expect a massive crowd to cheer and applause and the world to
be changed for the better :)

More seriously, these recommendations are just that, recommendations.
Unless people do follow them, they're useless.

However, once Sylvain has officially launched the OCamlForge, I'm
planning to launch an "OSR standard library" project consisting on a
layer on top of the INRIA standard library, with all the features of the
INRIA standard library but upgraded to compliance with OSR. I hope
distributions would eventually treat as the official standard library.
And yes, this will probably mean including a reworked version of ExtLib.

For this, of course, we'll need volunteers. I'm personally willing to
work on adapting the standard library to exceptionless error management.
I hope someone else will be willing to work on character ropes and
Unicode management, which I believe are the other most critical issues
at hand, once we have an OSR agreement.

Cheers,
 David
