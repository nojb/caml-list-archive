I've modified the function and I'm still getting the same behavior. Here 
is my new code:

let points item =
  let prop = {Gobject.name = "points";
          Gobject.conv = GnomeCanvas.Conv.points} in
  let x = Gobject.get prop item in
  match x with
    None -> print_string "NONE!\n"; []
  | Some ary ->
      print_string "SOME!\n";
      Array.to_list ary

Is there a particular thing that I have to do before I can get the 
points? Does anyone have an example where they are able to do this?

Thanks.
