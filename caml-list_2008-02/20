Funny, on the contrary, i would strongly urge Jon to do it... He asks
some many times for a fork when most of the people i know are not
interested in -- to my mind. I think it is important that he tries to do
it because:
* he will be able to face the huge amount of work done by the INRIA
* he will have to create a community around his fork
* he will have to handle many differents arch -- some of them pretty
 exotic
* he will stop sending mail about it

Maybe after considering all this, he will simply stop to ask for a fork.

I think forking is a *BAD* thing to do -- but if Jon really think it is
worth, i really think he should try rather than asking for it in half of
the mail he sends.

I hereby declare that this will be my only mail about this subject.
