Hello Dmitry,

I'm delighted to see your attempts at getting ocamldebug to work under
Windows.

Generally speaking, the Windows port is the part of OCaml where we
most desperately need outside help, as (1) it consumes quite a bit of
my very limited time, (2) it's a cost center for the Caml development
team (none of us uses Windows for our research activities), and (3)
none of us is competent with Win32 programming.

(For example, if anyone could help debugging PR#4399, that would be
much appreciated.)

Coming back to ocamldebug:

Actually, I would be happy with a Win32 implementation of Unix.select
that works over any combination of sockets and file descriptors.
Unfortunately, it looks like we'd need a gross hack involving threads,
WaitForMultipleObjects() and select(), but if someone comes up with an
implementation that isn't too gross, I'll be interested.
