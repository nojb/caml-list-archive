2ND CALL FOR PAPERS
TRENDS IN FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 2008
RADBOUD UNIVERSITY NIJMEGEN, THE NETHERLANDS
MAY 26-28, 2008
INVITED SPEAKER: PROF. HENK BARENDREGT
http://www.st.cs.ru.nl/AFP_TFP_2008/

The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming languages, focusing on providing a broad view
of current and future trends in Functional Programming. It aspires to
be a lively environment for presenting the latest research results
through acceptance by extended abstracts and full papers. A formal
post-symposium refereeing process selects the best articles presented
at the symposium for publication in a high-profile volume.

TFP 2008 is hosted by the Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands,
and will be held in the rural setting of Center Parcs “Het Heijderbos”,
Heijen (in the vicinity of Nijmegen), The Netherlands.

TFP 2008 is co-located with the 6th Int’l. Summer School on Advanced
Functional Programming (AFP’08), which is held immediately before TFP’08.


SCOPE OF THE SYMPOSIUM
The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various
routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify
the following five article categories. High-quality articles are
solicited in any of these categories:

Research: leading-edge, previously unpublished research.
Position: on what new trends should or should not be.
Project: descriptions of recently started new projects.
Evaluation: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project.
Overview: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject.

Articles must be original and not submitted for simultaneous publication
to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional
programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or more
experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques
to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Contributions on the following subject areas are particularly welcomed:
* Dependently Typed Functional Programming
* Validation and Verification of Functional Programs
* Debugging for Functional Languages
* Functional Programming and Security
* Functional Programming and Mobility
* Functional Programming to Animate/Prototype/Implement Systems from
Formal or Semi-Formal Specifications
* Functional Languages for Telecommunications Applications
* Functional Languages for Embedded Systems
* Functional Programming Applied to Global Computing
* Functional GRIDs
* Functional Programming Ideas in Imperative or Object-Oriented
Settings (and the converse)
* Interoperability with Imperative Programming Languages
* Novel Memory Management Techniques
* Parallel/Concurrent Functional Languages
* Program Transformation Techniques
* Empirical Performance Studies
* Abstract/Virtual Machines and Compilers for Functional Languages
* New Implementation Strategies
* Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP,
please contact the TFP 2008 program chairs, Peter Achten and Pieter
Koopman, at afp_tfp_2008@cs.ru.nl.


SUBMISSION AND DRAFT PROCEEDINGS
Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on the
review of full papers (15 pages) and extended abstracts (at least 3 pages)
by the program committee. TFP encourages PhD students to submit papers. PhD
students may request the program committee to provide extensive feedback
on their full papers at the time of submission. Full papers describing
work accepted for presentation must be completed before the symposium for
publication in the draft proceedings and on-line. Further details can be
found at the TFP 2008 website http://www.st.cs.ru.nl/AFP_TFP_2008/.


POST-SYMPOSIUM REFEREEING AND PUBLICATION
In addition to the draft symposium proceedings, we continue the TFP
tradition of publishing a high-quality subset of contributions in the
Intellect series on Trends in Functional Programming.
