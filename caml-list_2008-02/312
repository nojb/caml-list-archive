Hi,

I've got a problem with antiquotations and strings in camlp4. I've got a
parser (xmlp4, used in Ocsigen) written with camlp4 which has to deal
with strings.=20
This parser provides a quotation mechanism to let the user input XML in
a natural way within an Ocaml program.

Basically, the problem is the following expression (in the parser's
code):

  | PCData(s) -> [ <:expr< XHTML.EncodedPCData $str:s$ >> ]

where s is a (potentially unescaped) string. Here is a typical output:

  [XML.EncodedPCDATA " "bar \" ]

corresponding to the following input file:

  <:xml< "bar\ >>

(assuming that this quotation is parsed as PCData of course)

As you can see, it's weird and it took me some time to find out what was
happening (real-life examples being much more intricate).

Of course, I would like to get:

  [XML.EncodedPCDATA "\"bar \\" ]

instead, and of course, I could obtain it through:

  | PCData(s) -> [<:expr< XHTML.EncodedPCData $str:String.escaped s$ >>]

But I wonder whether this should be considered as a camlp4 bug (or
possible enhancement). When I write << EncodedPCData $str:s$ >>, I=20
expect to get something consistent, not some kind of "let's evaluate s
and copy/paste it blindly there".

Shall I submit a bug report? Or is there something I got wrong in my
code (which is very likely)?

Anyway, if this is an intended behavior, the explanation should be put=20
in BIG BOLD RED letters on the camlp4 wiki, on the quotation page. This
would help a lot (plus I would like to understand what is exactly going=20
on there).

NB: I simplified the examples for the shake of clarity. You can find the
relevant code here:
http://ocsigen.org/trac/browser/xmlp4/newocaml/xhtmlparser.ml
You may also want to have a look at:
http://ocsigen.org/trac/browser/xmlp4/newocaml/xmllexer.mll and
http://ocsigen.org/trac/browser/xmlp4/newocaml/xhtmlsyntax.ml
I'd welcome any remark regarding this code.

Kind regards,
