Mail system is not enough tested to let people use it for now. I hope it
will be fixed soon, but we have to do some extended checking before
announcing on a public mailing list the availability of ocamlcore.org!

I think your question worth to be asked, but i don't think it is related
to ocamlcore.org.

The forge hosted at this location will be for all ocaml related project.
I don't think we will enforce the use of any particular build system. In
the future, we can set up another system to centralize modules -- like a
CPAN for ocaml. But this is another topic (i.e we should take time to
build something strong).
