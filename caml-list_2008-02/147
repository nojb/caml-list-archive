Argh ! I now understand Alain's comment about the need to keep that =20
information. This is a complete misuse of the namespace recommandation =20=

which says nothing about binding pefixes in attribute and character =20
data. The w3c is really hopeless.

You tell me.

As mentionned in my previous email with xmlm you can do that by =20
yourself since all the info is there and you have full control on the =20=

parsing result. However for the aformentionned case this may mean a =20
lot of work. On the other hand xml schema seems to be seen as a broken =20=

technology (even the xml spec editor says so iirc). So the question =20
is, is it worth complexifiying the interface to facilitate the parsing =20=

of this obviously broken and marginal (is it ?) case.

Thanks for the link, I will have a look at it (functional programming =20=

languages are no enemies).

Best,

Daniel
