Scope

Generative and component approaches are revolutionizing software
development similar to how automation and components revolutionized
manufacturing. Generative Programming (developing programs that
synthesize other programs), Component Engineering (raising the level
of modularization and analysis in application design), and
Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) (elevating program specifications to
compact domain-specific notations that are easier to write, maintain,
and analyze) are key technologies for automating program development.

The International Conference on Generative Programming and Component
Engineering provides a venue for researchers and practitioners
interested in techniques for enhancing the productivity, quality, and
time-to-market in software development that stems from deploying
components and automating program generation. In addition to exploring
cutting-edge techniques for developing generative and component-based
software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between
the software engineering research community and the programming
languages community.

Submissions

Research papers:

10 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls) reporting
original research results that contribute to scientific knowledge in
the areas listed below (the PC chair can advise on appropriateness).

Experience reports:

2 to 4 pages in length in SIGPLAN proceedings style
(sigplanconf.cls). We encourage experience reports that provide
concrete evidence with regards to the efficacy of generative
technologies in industrial applications.

Topics

GPCE seeks contributions in software engineering and in programming
languages related (but not limited) to:

     * Generative programming
           o Reuse, meta-programming, partial evaluation, multi-stage  
and
             multi-level languages, step-wise refinement,
             and generic programming
           o Semantics, type systems, symbolic computation, linking and
             explicit substitution, in-lining and macros, templates, and
             program transformation
           o Runtime code generation, compilation, active libraries,
             synthesis from specifications, development methods,  
generation of
             non-code artifacts, formal methods, and reflection
     * Generative techniques for
           o Product-line architectures
           o Distributed, real-time and embedded systems
           o Model-driven development and architecture
           o Resource bounded/safety critical systems.
     * Component-based software engineering
           o Reuse, distributed platforms and middleware, distributed
             systems, evolution, patterns, development methods,  
deployment and
             configuration techniques, and formal methods
     * Integration of generative and component-based approaches
     * Domain engineering and domain analysis
           o Domain-specific languages including visual and UML-based  
DSLs
     * Separation of concerns
           o Aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming,
           o Intentional programming and multi-dimensional separation of
             concerns
     * Industrial applications of the above

Experience reports on applications of these techniques to real-world
problems are especially encouraged, as are research papers that relate
ideas and concepts from several of these topics, or bridge the gap
between theory and practice. The program chair is happy to advise on
the appropriateness of a particular subject.

Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy. Please  
contact
the program chair if you have any questions about how this policy  
applies
to your paper (gpce2008 at gpce.org).
