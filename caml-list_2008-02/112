Then, you should rather try something like:

   ocamlopt -output-obj -o foo.so simple.ml wrapper.c

In the CVS version, -output-obj has been extended to allow producing 
directly "standalone" .so/.dll libraries that can be loaded from C (or 
anything else).

But does the linker really accept "-read_only_relocs suppress"?

http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Id/index.html
seems to indicate the opposite.

Yes, correct.
