Subject: [Caml-list] PhD/Postdoc in programming models for heterogeneous
 infrastructures



The IMDEA Software Institute (software.imdea.org) and the Universidad
Polit=C3=A9cnica de Madrid (www.upm.es/internacional) have openings at the
Ph.D. and post-doctoral levels within the 3-year POLCA (Programming
Large Scale Heterogeneous Infrastructures) European project, starting
on September 2013.  POLCA aims at developing a methodology and tools
to support a programming model to efficiently exploit heterogeneous
computing infrastructures (CPUs / GPUs / ASICs / FPGAs) while reducing
the burden on the programmer and the need to port code between
architectures.  The project will build upon the design and use of
high-level source code annotations ("pragmas") which describe code
properties which can then be used to perform aggressive,
mathematically sound, source-to-source transformations capable to
adapt the code to the target architecture.

We seek applicants with a strong background in some of the following
fields:

  * High-level architectural and system-design languages (such as
    Clash or ForSyDe).

  * Source-to-source program transformation for optimization and
    parallelism.

  * CPUs, GPUs, ASICs and FPGAs programming (OpenMP, OpenCL, CUDA,
    HDL, etc.).

  * Analysis of functional and non-functional program properties.

Knowledge in the following topics will be a strong plus:

 - Existing compiler infrastructures (LLVM / Clang / ...).
 - Abstract syntax.
 - Embedded domain specific languages.
 - Meta-programming.

Successful applicants are expected to actively contribute to the
development of the project toolset and must have an interest to carry
research at the intersection between specifications, programming
languages, program transformation, and parallelism.  Collaboration in
usual EU research project chores is also expected.

All positions are initially for one year, renewable for up to three
years (in total) in the case of post-doctoral candidates, and for up
to four years in the case of PhD students, contingent on the
availability of funds.  Other mutually agreed arrangements are
possible.  In any case, satisfactory progress will be monitored and
required for renewal.

The starting date is negotiable, but preference may be given to
candidates able to adapt to the project starting dates.

For further information, please contact Manuel Carro (manuel.carro at
imdea.org).

Applying
--------

Candidates are kindly asked to submit their application through the
URL:

                  https://careers.imdea.org/software/

When completing your application, please indicate "POLCA Project" as
one of the research lines.

Applications must be received by September 5th, 2013 to receive full
consideration.  However, applications will continue to be accepted
until the positions are filled.


Salary
------

An internationally competitive salary will be offered, negotiated with
the candidate.  Selected candidates will have access to an excellent
public healthcare system.


Work Environment
----------------

The IMDEA Software Institute and the School of Computer Science of the
UPM are located in the vibrant area of Madrid, Spain, and offer an ideal
working environment where researchers can focus on developing new ideas
and projects. The working language is English.
