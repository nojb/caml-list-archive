- SAC 2014

For the past twenty-eight years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SA=
C) has=20
been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer en=
gineers,=20
software engineers, and application developers from around the world.

SAC 2014 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computin=
g (SIGAPP),=20
and will be held at Gyeongju, Korea.=20

- Call For Student Research Abstracts:

Graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on their r=
esearch ideas=20
are invited to submit original abstracts of their research work in areas of=
 experimental=20
computing and application development related to SAC 2014 Tracks. The Stude=
nt Research=20
Competition (SRC) program is designed to provide graduate students the oppo=
rtunity to meet=20
and exchange ideas with researcher and practitioners in their areas of inte=
rest.

- OOPS Track

Object-oriented programming (OOP) has become the mainstream programming par=
adigm for=20
developing complex software systems in most application domains.

However, existing OO languages and platforms need to evolve to meet the con=
tinuous=20
demand for new abstractions, features, and tools able to reduce the time, e=
ffort, and=20
cost of creating object-oriented software systems, and improving their perf=
ormance, quality=20
and usability.

To this aim, OOPS is seeking for research advances bringing benefits in all=
 those typical=20
aspects of software development, such as modeling, prototyping, design, imp=
lementation,=20
concurrency and distribution, code generation, analysis, verification, test=
ing, evaluation,=20
deployment, maintenance, reuse, and software evolution and adaptation.

The specific OO related topics of interest for the OOPS track include, but =
are not limited to,=20
the following:

*    Aspects and components
*    Code generation, and optimization, just-in-time compilation
*    Context-oriented programming
*    Databases and persistence
*    Distribution and concurrency
*    Dynamic and scripting languages
*    Evaluation
*    Feature Oriented Software Development and Programming
*    Formal verification
*    Integration with other paradigms
*    Interoperability, versioning and software evolution and adaptation
*    Language design and implementation
*    Modular and generic programming
*    Reflection, meta-programming
*    Secure and dependable software
*    Static analysis
*    Type systems and type inference
*    Virtual machines

OOPS offers a great opportunity to the OOP community to gain visibility, an=
d to=20
exploit the inter-disciplinary nature of SAC.

- Submission Instructions

Prospective papers should be submitted in pdf format using the provided aut=
omated submission system
(https://www.softconf.com/d/sac2014 for regular papers, and https://www.sof=
tconf.com/d/sac-src2014
for SRC papers.

All papers should represent original and previously unpublished works that =
are currently not under=20
review in any conference or journal. Both basic and applied research papers=
 are welcome.

Hardcopy and fax submissions will not be accepted. Submission of the same p=
aper to multiple tracks is=20
not allowed. The format of the paper must adhere to the sig-alternate style=
.=20
Full papers are limited to 6 pages with the option for up to 2 additional p=
ages at cost (US$80 per page).=20
Posters are limited to 2 pages with the option for up to 1 additional page =
at cost (US$80).=20

Papers that fail to comply with length limitations risk rejection. All pape=
rs must be submitted by=20
September 13, 2013. For more information please visit the SAC 2014 Website.

- Proceedings=20

Accepted papers will be published by ACM in the annual conference proceedin=
gs. Accepted posters will be=20
published as extended abstracts in the same proceedings.

Please note that full registration is required for papers and posters to be=
 included in the conference=20
proceedings and CD. Papers and posters NOT presented at conference will NOT=
 be included in the ACM digital=20
library. Student registration is only intended to encourage student attenda=
nce and does not cover inclusion=20
of papers/posters in the conference proceedings.

Finally, following the tradition of the past OOPS editions, depending on th=
e quality and the overall number=20
of accepted papers, authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an=
 extended version for a journal=20
special issue, after the conference.
