Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Need help installing OCaml-Cygwin packages!

Hello,

64-bit cygwin is still a very new thing, and unfortunately OCaml is not
yet ported to it. I managed to get the bytecode running, but now I have to
concentrate on doing the release of 4.01.0. Then I'll be on vacation, so
I can't promise a 64-bit cygwin package of OCaml before about mid-November.
