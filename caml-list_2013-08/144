ICFEM 2013 CALL FOR PARTICIPATIONS
-----------------------------------

15th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM 2013)

Queenstown, New Zealand, 29 October - 1 November 2013

http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/icfem2013/


The 15th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods
(ICFEM 2013) will be held at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in
Queenstown, New Zealand from 29 October to 1 November 2013.
Since 1997, ICFEM has been serving as an international forum for
researchers and practitioners who have been dedicated to
applying formal methods to practical computer systems.
Researchers and practitioners, from industry, academia, and
government, are encouraged to attend, and to help advance the
state of the art. We are interested in work that has been
incorporated into real production systems, and in theoretical
work that promises to bring practical and tangible benefit.

ICFEM 2013 is organized and sponsored by The University of
Auckland and will be held in the world renowned travel
destination - Queenstown. Around 1.9 million visitors are drawn
to Queenstown each year to enjoy their own unforgettable travel
experience. We are looking forward to your submissions and
participation.
