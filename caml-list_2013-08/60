Subject: [Caml-list] ANN: CamlPDF 1.7

Hi,

The first new release of the CamlPDF library for a while is here:

http://www.github.com/johnwhitington/camlpdf

(Or, shortly, via OPAM.)

The documentation is online here:

http://www.coherentpdf.com/camlpdf

A little introduction is here:

http://www.coherentpdf.com/introduction_to_camlpdf.pdf

Most importantly, CamlPDF is now open source, being under a standard 
LGPL with linking exception licence.

This release is much cleaner: development has moved to Github for 
transparency, ocamlfind is supported, and it should compile 
out-of-the-box with no dependencies on Windows, Mac and Linux. 
Documentation is much improved.

And, of course, there's lots of new functionality, such as 256 bit AES 
encryption, reading of malformed files, support for writing with object 
streams, and new modules for merging files, bookmarks, destinations. 
It's also very much faster.

There have, however, been significant non-backward-compatible API 
changes. These will be minimized in the future. Contact me directly or 
via the Github issue system if you need help updating code from a 
previous version.

Thanks,

--
