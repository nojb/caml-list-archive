**************************************************
      The Sixth NASA Formal Methods Symposium

         http://www.NASAFormalMethods.org/

               29 April - 1 May 2014
   NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA
**************************************************


Theme of the Symposium:
-----------------------
The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission- and 
safety-critical systems require advanced techniques that address their 
specification, verification, validation, and certification requirements.

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum for theoreticians and 
practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with the goals of 
identifying challenges and providing solutions to achieving assurance in 
mission- and safety-critical systems. Within NASA such systems include 
autonomous robots, separation assurance algorithms for aircraft, Next 
Generation Air Transportation (NextGen), and autonomous rendezvous and 
docking for spacecraft. Moreover, emerging paradigms such as 
property-based design, code generation, and safety cases are bringing 
with them new challenges and opportunities. The focus of the symposium 
will be on formal techniques, their theory, current capabilities, and 
limitations, as well as their application to aerospace, robotics, and 
other safety-critical systems in all design life-cycle stages. We 
encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches marrying formal 
verification techniques with advances in safety-critical system 
development, such as requirements generation, analysis of aerospace 
operational concepts, and formal methods integrated in early design 
stages carrying throughout system development.


Topics of Interest:
-------------------
     * Model checking
     * Theorem proving
     * Static analysis
     * Model-based development
     * Runtime monitoring
     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance
     * Applications of formal methods to aerospace systems
     * Formal analysis of cyber-physical systems, including hybrid and 
embedded systems
     * Formal methods in systems engineering, modeling, requirements, 
and specifications
     * Requirements generation, specification debugging, formal 
validation of specifications
     * Use of formal methods in safety cases
     * Use of formal methods in human-machine interaction analysis
     * Formal methods for parallel hardware implementations
     * Use of formal methods in automated software engineering and testing
     * Correct-by-design, design for verification, and property-based 
design techniques
     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods; e.g. 
abstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, parallel and 
distributed techniques
     * Application of formal methods to emerging technologies


Important Dates:
----------------
Abstract Submission: 14 Nov 2013
Paper Submission:    21 Nov 2013
Paper Notifications: 14 Jan 2014
Camera-ready Papers: 11 Feb 2014
Symposium: 29 April - 1 May 2014


Location & Cost:
----------------
The symposium will take place at the Gilruth Center, NASA Johnson Space 
Center, Houston, Texas, USA, 29 April to 1 May 2013.

There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested 
individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen 
to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees 
must register.


Submission Details:
-------------------
There are two categories of submissions:

    1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete 
results (15 pages)
    2. Short papers describing tools, experience reports, or 
descriptions of work in progress with preliminary results (6 pages)

All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not 
been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully 
reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a 
volume of Springer's Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and must 
use LNCS style formatting. Papers should be submitted in PDF format.


Keynote Speakers:
-----------------
* Larry Paulson, University of Cambridge, UK
* Moshe Y. Vardi, Rice University, USA
* Special Guest Talk: "NASA Future Challenges in Formal Methods"
