CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

25th SYMPOSIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES - IFL 2013

RADBOUD UNIVERSITY NIJMEGEN, THE NETHERLANDS
ACM In-Cooperation / ACM SIGPLAN

AUGUST 28 - 30 2013

"Landgoed Holthurnsche Hof"

http://ifl2013.cs.ru.nl

[program available - late registration still open]


We are proud to announce that the 25th edition of the IFL series returns to its roots at 
the Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The symposium is held from 28th 
to 30th of August 2013.

Scope
-----
The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively engaged in the 
implementation and application of functional and function-based programming languages. 
IFL 2013 will be a venue for researchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, 
work in progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation and 
application of functional languages and function-based programming. 

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2013 will use a post-symposium review process to 
produce the formal proceedings which will be published in the ACM Digital Library. All 
participants of IFL 2013 are invited to submit either a draft paper or an extended 
abstract describing work to be presented at the symposium. At no time may work submitted 
to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to 
ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:

    http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to make sure they are 
within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the draft proceedings distributed at the 
symposium. Submissions appearing in the draft proceedings are not peer-reviewed 
publications. Hence, publications that appear only in the draft proceedings do not 
count as publication for the ACM SIGPLAN republication policy. After the symposium, 
authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the feedback from discussions at 
the symposium and will be invited to submit a revised full article for the formal 
review process. From the revised submissions, the program committee will select papers 
for the formal proceedings considering their correctness, novelty, originality, 
relevance, significance, and clarity. 

Invited Speaker
---------------
Lennart Augustsson, currently employed by the Standard Chartered Bank, well-known for 
his work on Haskell, parallel Haskell, Cayenne, and Bluespec, is the invited speaker of 
IFL 2013. The title and abstract of his talk is:

    "Implementation and Application of Functional Languages - A personal perspective"

    It is now over 30 years ago since I implemented my first functional language, 
    and over 15 years ago since I wrote my first commercial application. In this 
    talk I will look back to those bygone days and remind you of things that you 
    might have forgotten or never known. The talk will be absolutely free of 
    anything new. 

Peter Landin Prize
------------------
The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the symposium every 
year. The honoured article is selected by the program committee based on the submissions 
received for the formal review process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent to 
150 Euros.
