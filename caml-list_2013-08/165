Subject: [Caml-list] How to explain static typing to other people?

Hello,

did you ever get the response, that one could use Java,
when you talked about the static typing advantages of
languages like OCaml or Haskell?

I often heard that and after trying to explain the differences
for a while, I  started to stop the discussion, because the other person
will not understand it. (Maybe it needs to be tried in the real world
to see the differences... discussing about it alone can't work, I guess.)

Here is a talk, that I enjoy(ed) viewing, because it's clearly
showing the advantages of static typing and IMHO this
guy has a lot of humor, making the talk fun to view:

  [ny-haskell] A Pragmatic Case for Static Typing with Brian Hurt

Ciao,
   Oliver
