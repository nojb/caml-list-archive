Subject: [Caml-list] 2nd CFP Post-proceedings TYPES 2013 Types for Proofs
 and Programs (open call)

2nd call for papers: Types for Proofs and Programs,
   post-proceedings of TYPES 2013 (open call)
--------------------------------------------------

[This is just a reminder before the "deep" Summer holidays for many
of you. Nothing has changed in comparison with the call sent 7 weeks ago,
except for the addition of the policy to avoid conflicts of interest that
was already put on the web site 4 weeks ago.]

TYPES is a major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of type theory and its applications. The post-proceedings of TYPES
2013, which was held in Toulouse, are open to everyone, also those who
did not participate in the conference. We would like to invite all
researchers that study type systems to share their results concerning
type-based theorem proving environments or type-based formal modelling, in
particular we welcome submissions on any topic in the following list:

  - Foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics.
  - Applications of type theory.
  - Dependently-typed programming.
  - Industrial uses of type theory technology.
  - Meta-theoretic studies of type systems.
  - Proof-assistants and proof technology.
  - Formalisation of proofs in type theory.
  - Extraction of implementations from proofs.
  - Automation in computer-assisted reasoning.
  - Links between type theory and functional programming.
  - Links between type theory and object-oriented programming.
  - Type theory in linguistics.


Important dates
---------------

Abstract submission deadline:  2013-09-09
Paper submission deadline:     2013-09-16
Notification of acceptance:    2014-02-17

Details
-------

* Papers must be submitted in PDF format using EasyChair:
   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=types13postproceedin

* Authors have the option to include an attachment (.zip or .tgz)
   containing mechanised proofs, but reviewers are not obliged to take
   these attachments into account. Attachments will not be published
   together with the papers.

* The post-proceedings will be published in LIPIcs (Leibniz
   International Proceedings in Informatics,
   http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics), an open-access series
   of conference proceedings.

* Authors of accepted papers retain copyright, but are expected to sign
   an author agreement with Schloss Dagstuhl—Leibniz-Zentrum für
   Informatik, see
   http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/.

* For information about how to prepare submissions, see
   http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/.
   In general, please refer to the dedicated web site
   http://www.irit.fr/TYPES2013/Postproceedings.html
   for more detailed/specific information.

* We recommend to keep the length of the contributions in the range of
   15-25 pages, and 25 pages is the upper limit for the submissions.

* Policy to avoid conflicts of interest:
   Since the PC members of the TYPES'13 meeting and the SC members of the
   TYPES series are not involved in the editing process (other than
   potentially as normal reviewers), they are allowed to submit their work
   to the post-proceedings volume. However, a slightly higher quality
   threshold will be applied. The editors cannot be authors or coauthors of
   submissions.

* In case of questions, please contact one of the editors.
