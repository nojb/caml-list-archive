[...]

It's possible (and possibly good style) to start with the signature.
If the problem is clear enough stated in the beginning.

Otherwise, it's possible to start with type inference as the helping tool,
and when the code is somewhat mature, create an mli-file to make things
less variable.

Which way to go depends on how much planning si done (and can be done)
in advcance.

But the talk had mentioned a lot more problems, not only type inference.
The comparision with unit testing also was nice. And many other aspects also.
