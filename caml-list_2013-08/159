CiE 2014 is the tenth conference organized by CiE (Computability 
in Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians, 
computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others 
interested in new developments in computability and their 
underlying significance for the real world. Previous meetings 
have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena 
(2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponte Dalgada (2010), 
Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), and Milan (2013). Please mark the 
conference dates in your agendas for 2014.

The motto of CiE 2014 "Language, Life, Limits" intends to put a 
special focus on relations between computational linguistics, 
natural computing, and more traditional fields of computability 
theory.

This is to be understood in its broadest sense including 
computational aspects of problems in linguistics, studying models 
of computation and algorithms inspired by physical and biological 
approaches as well as exhibiting limits (and non-limits) of 
computability when considering different models of computation 
arising from such approaches.

As with previous CiE conferences, the allover glueing perspective 
is to strengthen the mutual benefits of analyzing traditional and 
new computational paradigms in their corresponding frameworks 
both with respect to practical applications and a deeper 
theoretical understanding.

The conference will address these aspects besides the more 
established lines of research of Computational Complexity and the 
interplay between Proof Theory and Computation.

Novel views that rely on physical and biological processes and 
models to find new ways of tackling computations and improving 
their efficiency are welcome.  Also, massive data analysis and 
computations are a recent subject of attention, since the most 
recent technologies produce huge amounts of data, and managing 
such data requires some theoretical frameworks.

In all cases we are looking for fundamental and theoretical 
submissions. In line with other conferences in this series, CiE 
2014 has a broad scope and provides a forum for the discussion of 
theoretical and practical issues in Computability with an 
emphasis on new paradigms of computation and the development of 
their mathematical theory.

We particularly invite papers that build bridges between 
different parts of the research community.

invite all researchers in the area of the conference to submit 
their papers for presentation at CiE 2014.  The best of the 
accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings 
within the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series of 
Springer, which will be available at the conference.
