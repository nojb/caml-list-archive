Sometimes, sometimes not. This is what the Pdftext module does. Modern 
PDFs have a /ToUnicode for each font, which is a special data structure 
mapping bytes or sequences of bytes directly to unicode codepoints or 
sequences of unicode codepoints.

In the absence of this, one can fall back to the other parts of the font 
metadata (or even the font itself) which might give the encoding in use.

So it looks like only the ffi part will be doable. I can't really 
comment more without seeing the PDF and your code...

Thanks,
