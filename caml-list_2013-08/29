ABOUT THE CONFERENCE
ECSCW is a series of international conferences on computer-supported
cooperative work. The conference series is affiliated with the European
Society for Socially Embedded Technologies (EUSSET).

CSCW is committed to grounding technological development and systems
design in an understanding of "the specifics of practical, situated
action". ECSCW remains committed to this program.

ECSCW has been instrumental in defining the agenda of CSCW research
since the beginning, and it still is. It has been the key forum for
identifying and exploring issues such as
=B7 the situated nature of action and interaction and its implications;
=B7 the role of ethnography in CSCW and in computing in general,
=B7 the role and nature of 'awareness' in cooperative work;
=B7 the role of paper-based and other material artifacts in cooperative wor=
k;
=B7 highly flexible collaboration infrastructures and tailorable systems.

The ECSCW conferences are single-track conferences in order to
facilitate critical discussion across the disciplinary and national
subdivisions of the field. The acceptance rate for papers has been between =
20 and 25%.

The ECSCW conference is sponsored by the ECSCW Foundation (sometimes
also called the European CSCW Foundation). The role of the ECSCW Foundation
is to foster research on computer-suppoted cooperative work in Europe and g=
lobally,
primarily by safeguarding and facilitating the continuation of the ECSCW co=
nference
series.
