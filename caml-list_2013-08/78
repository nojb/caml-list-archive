So 0o019 looks like a floating acute in that encoding, followed by a 
kern of 486/1000 of a point to shift leftward, followed by an 'e'. So, 
this is an accented character built by composition of glyphs.

In the font in use here, character 0o014 appears to be a single glyph 
for the ffi ligature.

Drop me a note off-list with the example file and I'll take a look.

Text extraction is almost always possible with modern PDFs. With older 
PDFs, text extraction sometimes isn't possible. You can test this by 
trying to copy & paste the text in Adobe Reader -- if it comes out 
correct, CamlPDF will be able to extract the text too -- if not, it won't.

With Thanks,
