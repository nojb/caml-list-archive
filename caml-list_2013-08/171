Subject: Re: [Caml-list] How to explain static typing to other people?

I haven't used Java in a while but if I remember correctly, although 
Java features static typing, it allows you to use not so safe tricks 
such as cast and null, while OCaml doesn't.

Moreover, OCaml allows to define complex types (and use them with 
pattern matching) very easily and thus makes you want to use the type 
system instead of trying to circumvent it.

type 'a option = Some 'a | None
How many lines to express that in Java?

OCaml's type inference is also very useful even if you choose to write 
some type information as good practice.

Last but not least, OCaml is a functional language. Well, I haven't 
tried Java 7.
