ACM SIGPLAN 2014 WORKSHOP ON PARTIAL EVALUATION AND PROGRAM MANIPULATION
Mon-Tue, January 20-21, 2014
San Diego, California, USA
co-located with POPL'14

Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN

http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM14

SCOPE 

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims at bringing together researchers and 
practitioners working in the areas of program manipulation, partial evaluation, 
and program generation. PEPM focuses on techniques, theory, tools, and 
applications of analysis and manipulation of programs.
The 2014 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of semantics-based 
program manipulation and continue last years' successful effort to expand the 
scope of PEPM significantly beyond the traditionally covered areas of partial 
evaluation and specialization and include practical applications of program 
transformations such as refactoring tools, and practical implementation techniques 
such as rule-based transformation systems. In addition, the scope of PEPM covers 
manipulation and transformations of program and system representations such as 
structural and semantic models that occur in the context of model-driven 
development. In order to reach out to practitioners, a separate category of tool 
demonstration papers will be solicited.

Topics of interest for PEPM'14 include, but are not limited to:

    Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, 
      partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries,
      program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, 
      and obfuscation.

    Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation  
      such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time 
      analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and 
      test case generation.

    Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including 
      metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, 
      program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, 
      and model-driven program generation and transformation.

    Application of the above techniques including case studies of program 
      manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software 
      development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively 
      handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application 
      domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL 
      implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific 
      computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed 
      and web-based applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will continue the 
category of `short papers' for tool demonstrations and for presentations of 
exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial 
and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to 
help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support, 
such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for 
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for travel 
from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on the PAC 
programme, see its web page.

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal proceedings 
published by ACM Press. In addition to printed proceedings, accepted papers will 
be included in the ACM Digital Library. A special issue for Science of Computer 
Programming is planned with recommended papers from PEPM'14.

PEPM has also established a Best Paper award. The winner will be announced at 
the workshop.

SUBMISSION CATEGORIES AND GUIDELINES

Regular Research Papers must not exceed 12 pages in ACM Proceedings style 
(including appendix). Tool demonstration papers and short papers must not 
exceed 6 pages in ACM Proceedings style (including appendix). At least one 
author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop and present the 
work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the 
described tool is expected. Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writing 
guidelines for both research and tool demonstration papers will be made available 
on the PEPM'14 Web-site. Papers should be submitted electronically via the 
workshop web site.

Authors using LaTeX to prepare their submissions should use the new improved 
SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls, 9pt template).
