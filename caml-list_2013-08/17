Subject: [Caml-list] Real World OCaml beta2 now available (final beta)

The second and final public beta of Real World OCaml is now available:
  <https://realworldocaml.org>

Release notes:

* Over 2,000 comments from proofreaders have been resolved.  We realize that
  reading early content is hard work, and hugely appreciate the spirited
  feedback!  The book is now a week away from being handed over to the
  O'Reilly production team for copyediting, so the window for changes are
  limited after that.  Comments reset between milestones and so beta2 is a
  clean slate; we're still working through some remaining older issues.

* The chapters on first-class modules, parsing with Menhir, and objects
  and classes have been significantly revised from beta1. Our thanks to
  Leo White for contributing significantly to the latter two chapters.

* All the code snippets and terminal outputs are now mechanically generated.
  The source code is as close to public domain as practical, at:
      <https://github.com/realworldocaml/examples>

* The final version will have the installation chapter moved to be online
  only, and we intend to publish updates there to elaborate on installation
  and packaging mechanisms.

* Exercises will be available after we go into production, and also only be
  available online. We really like the collaborative spirit of the commenti=
ng
  system, and will likely extend this to collecting exercises from our read=
ers
  on an ongoing basis.
