ICLP DC 2019 - 15th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming
***

The 15th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides students wi=
th the opportunity to present and discuss their research directions, and to=
 obtain feedback from both peers and experts in the field.=20
It will take place during the 35th International Conference on Logic Progra=
mming (ICLP) https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/ALP/iclp2019/ (September 20-25, 2019, =
in Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA).=20
Accepted participants will receive partial financial support to attend the =
event and the main conference. The best paper from the DC will be given the=
 opportunity to make a presentation in a session of the main ICLP conferenc=
e.=20

Important Dates=20

Paper submission (Updated date): June 30, 2019
Notification: July 15, 2019
Camera-ready copy: July 31, 2019
DC presentations: Sunday, September 22, 2019=20
However, DC students are highly recommended to attend the Autumn School on =
Logic Programming on: Friday and Saturday, September 20-21, 2019 https://si=
tes.google.com/cs.stonybrook.edu/iclp2019dc/autumn-school-on-logic-programm=
ing=20=20

Audience

The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, thou=
gh we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a Master's p=
rogram and interested in doctoral studies). Students at any stage in their =
doctoral studies are encouraged to apply for participation in the DC. Appli=
cants are expected to conduct research in areas related to logic and constr=
aint programming; topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

Theoretical Foundations of Logic and Constraint Logic Programming
Sequential and Parallel Implementation Technology
Static and Dynamic Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Compilation Technolog=
y, Verification
Logic-based Paradigms (e.g., Answer Set Programming, Concurrent Logic Progr=
amming, Inductive Logic Programming)
Innovative Applications of Logic Programming
Submissions by students who have presented their work at previous ICLP DC e=
ditions are allowed, but should occur only if there are substantial changes=
 or improvements to the student's work. The DC offers participants a conven=
ient, more informal way to interact with established researchers and fellow=
 students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussio=
ns, and invited presentations. The Doctoral Consortium will also provide th=
e possibility to reflect - through short activities, information sessions, =
and discussions - on the process and lessons of research and life in academ=
ia. Each participant will give a short, critiqued, research presentation.

Discussants

Renowned experts and researchers in the fields of logic and constraint prog=
ramming will join in evaluating submissions and will participate in the DC,=
 providing valuable feedback to DC participants.=20

Goals

To provide doctoral students working in the fields of logic and constraint =
programming with a friendly and open forum to present their research ideas,=
 listen to ongoing work from peer students, and receive constructive feedba=
ck.
To provide students with relevant information about important issues for do=
ctoral candidates and future academics.
To develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative=
 research.
To support a new generation of researchers with information and advice on a=
cademic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths.
Submission Details
The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, howe=
ver Master's students who are actively involved in research (please see the=
 list of topics below) can also participate in the DC program.

Applicants are expected to conduct research in areas related to logic and c=
onstraint programming.

Topics included, but not limited to:

Foundations: Semantics, Formalisms, Nonmonotonic reasoning, Knowledge repre=
sentation.
Languages: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher Order, Type=
s, Modes, Assertions, Modules, Meta-programming, Logic-based domain-specifi=
c languages, Programming Techniques.
Declarative programming: Declarative program development, Analysis, Type an=
d mode inference, Partial evaluation, Abstract interpretation, Transformati=
on, Validation, Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Testing, Execution visu=
alization.
Implementation: Virtual machines, Compilation, Memory management, Parallel/=
distributed execution, Constraint handling rules, Tabling, Foreign interfac=
es, User interfaces.
Related Paradigms and Synergies: Inductive and Co-inductive Logic Programmi=
ng, Constraint Logic Programming, Answer Set Programming, Interaction with =
SAT, SMT and CSP solvers, Logic programming techniques for type inference a=
nd theorem proving, Argumentation, Probabilistic Logic Programming, Relatio=
ns to object-oriented and Functional programming.
Applications: Databases, Big Data, Data integration and federation, Softwar=
e engineering, Natural language processing, Web and Semantic Web, Agents, A=
rtificial intelligence, Computational life sciences, Education, Cybersecuri=
ty, and Robotics.

Submissions of the research summary must be made in EPTCS format (http://in=
fo.eptcs.org/) and submitted via EasyChair. All papers must be written in E=
nglish and should be between 5 and 10 pages. For all accepted DC papers, th=
e student is required to attend the DC program and give a presentation of 2=
0 minutes followed by discussions. A program committee consisting of expert=
s in various areas related to logic and constraint programming reviews the =
submissions. Papers are reviewed by at least two, and usually three, refere=
es.

The submission package should consist of the research summary in the format=
 mentioned above and the additional documents mentioned below in the financ=
ial support section - all students must submit these documents even if they=
 don't apply for financial aid (a short vita or cover letter of the applica=
nt, a letter of recommendation from applicant's faculty advisor, and one pa=
ragraph statement outlining how the school will benefit the applicant). All=
 material is to be submitted electronically, in PDF format on the Easychair=
 system.

Easychair link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp2019 (Doctora=
l Consortium track)

Research summary (make sure to include your complete name, address, and aff=
iliation):
The body of your research summary (no more than 10 pages, but 5 is fine as =
well!) should provide a clear overview of your research, its potential impa=
ct, and its current status. You are encouraged to include the following sec=
tions:

Review Criteria

The DC program committee will select participants based on their anticipate=
d contribution to the DC objectives. Participants typically have settled on=
 their thesis directions and have their research proposal accepted by their=
 thesis committee. Students will be selected based on clarity and completen=
ess of their submission package, relevance of their research area w.r.t. th=
e focus of ICLP, stage of research, recommendation letter, and evidence of =
promise towards a successful career in research and academia, such as publi=
shed papers or technical reports.

Financial Support

Students are invited to submit to the Doctoral Consortium (within the submi=
ssion deadline) to receive financial assistance. A number of scholarships f=
or students that cover local expenses for the duration of the DC and school=
 are available. To apply for these scholarships, students should submit the=
 following information as part of their DC application:
