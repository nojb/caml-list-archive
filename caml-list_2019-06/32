ICLP DC 2019 - 15th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming
***

The 15th Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides students wi=
th the opportunity to present and discuss their research directions, and to=
 obtain feedback from both peers and experts in the field.
It will take place during the 35th International Conference on Logic Progra=
mming (ICLP) https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/ALP/iclp2019/ (September 20-25, 2019, =
in Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA).
Accepted participants will receive partial financial support to attend the =
event and the main conference. The best paper from the DC will be given the=
 opportunity to make a presentation in a session of the main ICLP conferenc=
e.

Important Dates

  *   Paper submission (Updated date): June 25, 2019
  *   Notification: July 15, 2019
  *   Camera-ready copy: July 31, 2019
  *   DC presentations: Sunday, September 22, 2019

However, DC students are highly recommended to attend the Autumn School on =
Logic Programming on: Friday and Saturday, September 20-21, 2019 https://si=
tes.google.com/cs.stonybrook.edu/iclp2019dc/autumn-school-on-logic-programm=
ing

Audience

The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, thou=
gh we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a Master's p=
rogram and interested in doctoral studies). Students at any stage in their =
doctoral studies are encouraged to apply for participation in the DC. Appli=
cants are expected to conduct research in areas related to logic and constr=
aint programming; topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  *   Theoretical Foundations of Logic and Constraint Logic Programming
  *   Sequential and Parallel Implementation Technology
  *   Static and Dynamic Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Compilation Tec=
hnology, Verification
  *   Logic-based Paradigms (e.g., Answer Set Programming, Concurrent Logic=
 Programming, Inductive Logic Programming)
  *   Innovative Applications of Logic Programming

Submissions by students who have presented their work at previous ICLP DC e=
ditions are allowed, but should occur only if there are substantial changes=
 or improvements to the student's work. The DC offers participants a conven=
ient, more informal way to interact with established researchers and fellow=
 students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussio=
ns, and invited presentations. The Doctoral Consortium will also provide th=
e possibility to reflect - through short activities, information sessions, =
and discussions - on the process and lessons of research and life in academ=
ia. Each participant will give a short, critiqued, research presentation.

Discussants

Renowned experts and researchers in the fields of logic and constraint prog=
ramming will join in evaluating submissions and will participate in the DC,=
 providing valuable feedback to DC participants.

Goals

  *   To provide doctoral students working in the fields of logic and const=
raint programming with a friendly and open forum to present their research =
ideas, listen to ongoing work from peer students, and receive constructive =
feedback.
  *   To provide students with relevant information about important issues =
for doctoral candidates and future academics.
  *   To develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collabo=
rative research.
  *   To support a new generation of researchers with information and advic=
e on academic, research, industrial, and non-traditional career paths.

Submission Details

The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, howe=
ver Master's students who are actively involved in research (please see the=
 list of topics below) can also participate in the DC program.
Applicants are expected to conduct research in areas related to logic and c=
onstraint programming.

Topics included, but not limited to:

  *   Foundations: Semantics, Formalisms, Nonmonotonic reasoning, Knowledge=
 representation.
  *   Languages: Concurrency, Objects, Coordination, Mobility, Higher Order=
, Types, Modes, Assertions, Modules, Meta-programming, Logic-based domain-s=
pecific languages, Programming Techniques.
  *   Declarative programming: Declarative program development, Analysis, T=
ype and mode inference, Partial evaluation, Abstract interpretation, Transf=
ormation, Validation, Verification, Debugging, Profiling, Testing, Executio=
n visualization.
  *   Implementation: Virtual machines, Compilation, Memory management, Par=
allel/distributed execution, Constraint handling rules, Tabling, Foreign in=
terfaces, User interfaces.
  *   Related Paradigms and Synergies: Inductive and Co-inductive Logic Pro=
gramming, Constraint Logic Programming, Answer Set Programming, Interaction=
 with SAT, SMT and CSP solvers, Logic programming techniques for type infer=
ence and theorem proving, Argumentation, Probabilistic Logic Programming, R=
elations to object-oriented and Functional programming.
  *   Applications: Databases, Big Data, Data integration and federation, S=
oftware engineering, Natural language processing, Web and Semantic Web, Age=
nts, Artificial intelligence, Computational life sciences, Education, Cyber=
security, and Robotics.

Submissions of the research summary must be made in OpenAccess Series in In=
formatics (OASIcs) format (template available here) and submitted via EasyC=
hair. Accepted DC papers will be published as technical communications (TCs=
) by Dagstuhl Publishing in the OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs). =
All papers must be written in English and should be between 5 and 10 pages.=
 For all accepted DC papers, the student is required to attend the DC progr=
am and give a presentation of 20 minutes followed by discussions. A program=
 committee consisting of experts in various areas related to logic and cons=
traint programming reviews the submissions. Papers are reviewed by at least=
 two, and usually three, referees.

The submission package should consist of the research summary in the OASIcs=
 format mentioned above and the additional documents mentioned below in the=
 financial support section - all students must submit these documents even =
if they don't apply for financial aid (a short vita or cover letter of the =
applicant, a letter of recommendation from applicant's faculty advisor, and=
 one paragraph statement outlining how the school will benefit the applican=
t). All material is to be submitted electronically, in PDF format on the Ea=
sychair system.

Easychair link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp2019 (Doctora=
l Consortium track)

Research summary (make sure to include your complete name, address, and aff=
iliation):
The body of your research summary (no more than 10 pages, but 5 is fine as =
well!) should provide a clear overview of your research, its potential impa=
ct, and its current status. You are encouraged to include the following sec=
tions:

presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited pre=
sentations. The Doctoral Consortium will also provide the possibility to re=
flect - through short activities,
 information sessions, and discussions - on the process and lessons of rese=
arch and life in academia. Each participant will give a short, critiqued, r=
esearch presentation.</div>
