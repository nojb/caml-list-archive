Hello,

Please, find below the call for papers for IFL 2019. With respect to the
previous call,
the deadline for submitting regular papers has been changed to June 15th.
Please forward these to anyone you think may be interested.
Apologies for any duplicates you may receive.

best regards,

================================================================================

                                    IFL 2019

    31st Symposium on Implementation and Application of Functional Languages


                        National University of Singapore
                            September 25th-27th, 2019

                          http://2019.iflconference.org

================================================================================

### Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2019 will be a venue for researchers to present
and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe
results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.

Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:

- language concepts
- type systems, type checking, type inferencing
- compilation techniques
- staged compilation
- run-time function specialization
- run-time code generation
- partial evaluation
- (abstract) interpretation
- metaprogramming
- generic programming
- automatic program generation
- array processing
- concurrent/parallel programming
- concurrent/parallel program execution
- embedded systems
- web applications
- (embedded) domain specific languages
- security
- novel memory management techniques
- run-time profiling performance measurements
- debugging and tracing
- virtual/abstract machine architectures
- validation, verification of functional programs
- tools and programming techniques
- (industrial) applications


### Keynote Speaker

* Olivier Danvy, Yale-NUS College


### Submissions and peer-review

Differently from previous editions of IFL, IFL 2019 solicits two kinds of
submissions:

* Regular papers (12 pages including references)
* Draft papers for presentations ('weak' limit between 8 and 15 pages)

Regular papers will undergo a rigorous review by the program committee, and
will
be evaluated according to their correctness, novelty, originality,
relevance,
significance, and clarity. A set of regular papers will be conditionally
accepted for publication. Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be
provided with committee reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions.
Regular papers not accepted for publication will be considered as draft
papers, at the request of the author.

Draft papers will be screened to make sure that they are within the scope of
IFL, and will be accepted for presentation or rejected accordingly.

Prior to the symposium:
  Authors of conditionally accepted papers and accepted presentations will
  submit a pre-proceedings version of their work that will appear in the
draft
  proceedings distributed at the symposium. The draft proceedings does not
  constitute a formal publication.

  We require that at least one of the authors present the work at IFL 2019.

After the symposium:

  Authors of conditionally accepted papers will submit a revised versions of
  their paper for the formal post-proceedings.
  The program committee will assess whether the mandatory revisions have
been
  adequately addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final
  accept/reject status of the paper.
  Our interest is to ultimately accept all conditionally accepted papers.
If you
  are an author of a conditionally accepted paper, please make sure that you
  address all the concerns of the reviewers.


  Authors of accepted presentations will be given the opportunity to
incorporate
  the feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to
submit a
  revised full article for the formal post-proceedings.
  The program committee will evaluate these submissions according to their
  correctness, novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity,
and
  will thereby determine whether the paper is accepted or rejected.


### Publication

The formal proceedings will appear in the International Conference
Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library.

At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other
venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:


         http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

### Peter Landin Prize

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the
symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program
committee
based on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize
carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
