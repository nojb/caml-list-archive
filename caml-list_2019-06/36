Yes, you are perfectly right, very sorry about that and many thanks for
having pointed this out.

I have just submitted https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/8759 as an
attempt to improve the situation.

Yes and also between ocamlrun and ocamlrund

The difference is not so much in the debug symbols, rather in the fact
that, as the INSTALL files rightly explains, the debug version contains
assertions and sanity checks that the valinna versioon does not contain.

Why did you try to link rather than using the runtime's executable,
actually?

Best wishes,

Sébastien.
