Subject: [Caml-list]  [ANN] yypkg 1.7.0

Hi,

I am happy to release yypkg 1.7.0. This is the release that goes into
win-builds.org 1.3.

Yypkg is a very simple package manager that is also very fast and
portable. Its main selling point is the support of native windows.

Rough changelog:
- symlink emulation on Windows through hardlinks and directory
  junctions; none of them is the same as a symlink but in yypkg's and
  win-builds' context, it's fine.
  (and if you think junctions are good, they're not; they're nothing
  more than hooks on directories at the filesystem/kernel level)
- relevant sexplib sources have been copied inside yypkg and
  (de)serializers are written by hand, avoiding the need for camlp4 and
  type_conv and reducing binary size.
- OCaml 3.11 compat dropped.
- Instead of spawning bsdtar and xz independently with logic to pipe
  between the two, use bsdtar and its bindings the xz' library.
- Remove the GUI; it was probably one of the best example on how to
  create horrible code by first writing a functional CLI core, strapping
  GUI code on it and adding some lwt as a work-around for a blocking
  design.
- Bundle patches against fileutils for symlink handling; I lack time to
  make them mergeable now and I needed this 1.7.0 release and the
  symlink fixes (among others) in time for FOSDEM. Details can be found
  in the corresponding commit message:
