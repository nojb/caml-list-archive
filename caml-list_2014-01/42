Wow, I wasn't aware of any of this!

That tutorials page is really incredible... just so much material (and in
different languages too!). And I'm really happy to see those wiki pages as
well. So I guess now there are... too many places to put material? I think
there has to be one centralized location for a thorough, wiki-like
repository.

The tutorials page looks excellent, although I have a feeling people just
aren't going to want to fork, edit, and then submit a push request. The
thing about wikis is that contributing takes minimal effort. Is it possible
to allow anyone with a github account to contribute to parts of the site
(as if it were a wiki?) Also, in a wiki, if you want to create a hierarchy
(ie. split off into sub-pages) at any point, you can easily do so. Is this
doable in the tutorial page? For example, I think it makes more sense to
have a page other than 'tutorials' as the topic for discussions such as
compiler internals and parallelism.

Regarding the existing wikis, how hard would it be to centralize
everything? I'm not so fond of the fact that there is one wiki for compiler
hacking, and one for ocaml internals. Wikis generally include everything on
a wide topic. So to me it would make more sense to have an 'ocaml' wiki,
with sub-categories for compiler hacking, internals, parallelism etc.

Any other opinions?
