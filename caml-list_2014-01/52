AIM:

SSTiC 2014 is the second edition in a series started in 2013. For the
previous event, see  http://grammars.grlmc.com/SSTiC2013/

SSTiC 2014 will be a research training event mainly addressed to PhD
students and PhD holders in the first steps of their academic career. It
intends to update them about the most recent developments in the diverse
branches of computer science and its neighbouring areas. To that purpose,
renowned scholars will lecture and will be available for interaction with
the audience.

SSTiC 2014 will cover the whole spectrum of computer science through 5
keynote lectures and 24 six-hour courses dealing with some of the most
lively topics in the field. The organizers share the idea that outstanding
speakers will really attract the brightest students.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduate students from around the world. There are no formal pre-requisites
in terms of the academic degree the attendee must hold. However, since there
will be several levels among the courses, reference may be made to specific
knowledge background in the description of some of them.

SSTiC 2014 is also appropriate for more senior people who want to keep
themselves updated on developments in their own field or in other branches
of computer science. They will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss
with scholars who are main references in computing nowadays.

REGIME:

In addition to keynotes, 3 parallel sessions will be held during the whole
event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be
willing to attend as well as to move from one to another.

VENUE:

SSTiC 2014 will take place in Tarragona, located 90 kms. to the south of
Barcelona. The venue will be:

Campus Catalunya
