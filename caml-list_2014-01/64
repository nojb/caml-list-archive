This is a bit too snarky for me to guess what you want.

I'm already doing a few reviews on mantis, and occasionally uses the
github in-patch-commenting interface when people send a link to a
github-hosted patch (eg. http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=3D6274
). I would be ready to experiment with a mailing-list or a specialized
review tool, based on what people would prefer. We have a solid github
mirror in place ( github.com/ocaml/ocaml ), people of OCamllabs have
kindly offered to host mailing-lists on several occasions, and have
experimented with, for example, gitlab in the past.

People of the list, if you have sent or reviewed patches or consider
doing so in the future, do you have a strong preference? If your
peer/friend/colleague wishes to contribute and asks you the place to
go, what will you wish we had?

(Keep in mind that we don't have a lot of patches sent around for now
(less than a dozen a month), and even less people*time to do the
reviews, so we don't necessarily need a highly tuned =FCber-process.)
