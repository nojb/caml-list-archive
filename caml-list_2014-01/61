Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Doing compiler patch review with a dedicated
 mailing-list

During the last "why no ocaml on github" thread, I had a discussion
with Jonathan Protzenko, which suggested precisely that we encourage
pull requests on the existing Github mirror as a way to send patches
-- to lower the participation cost for those that are too cool to use
a bug tracker of the previous decade. Adrien's suggestion of using a
mailing-list seems equally interesting (I'm in favor of everything
that can increase community participation to OCaml), but indeed we
should probably make a choice between the several options.

The nice thing with mailing-list is that they have easy-to-browse
archives, that in my experience work more reliably than search stuff
in a github repository (in Batteries we tend to have things scattered
across a web of issues, pull-requests, and commit comments that
cross-reference each other, and I'm not always even sure where I
should write). They're also based on a stable, well-established, *free
software* stack that is there to stay (about Github, a Wise One
remarked that "yesterday the same people were commanding that we host
OCaml on Sourceforge; look where it is now!"). On the other hand,
reacting to a perceived lack of sexiness of Mantis with a
mailing-list... I'm not sure.

I'm not personally afraid of having several places where patches are
proposed (it is de facto already what happens, between the bugtracker,
direct communication/review, people that post a link to a
gitweb/github/gitlab view...), but I would be fine with blessing one
"preferred" place and documenting it where it needs be.

Re. wiki/documentation/whatever, we could take inspiration from the
fine work done in the Cambridge are (
https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking ). Let me take this as
an occasion to remind that patches to insert enlightening comment in
the admittedly-not-always-commented-enough compiler and distribution
are welcome, and can be contributed right now.
