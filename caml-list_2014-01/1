Thanks for the replies!

Ah, I didn't realise that that was one of the optimisations which installin=
g the .cmx file allows. In fact, that seems to be a good case for *never* u=
sing external in the .cmi file, as that way you have transparent control ov=
er a future version which just might need to put an OCaml wrapper around th=
e stub.

True, but the introduction of native dynlink (on most platforms, at least) =
does seem to make worrying about very small optimisations (i.e. non-algorit=
hmic) for bytecode silly :o)

ocamldoc/trunk/manual/cmds/intf-c.etex was updated by Damien at the end of =
November with a warning in the explanation of the [external] keyword that t=
his can happen (was glad I spotted that *before* attaching a documentation =
patch to your PR!)

Judging by Jacques note connecting it to PR#6063 it will be soon - though g=
iven that installing the .cmx files enables the optimisation as well, I'm w=
ondering if never using [external] in .mli files is actually the better rou=
te?
