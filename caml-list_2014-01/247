Subject: [Caml-list] Vienna Summer of Logic Announcement

**Vienna Summer of Logic Announcement**

In the summer of 2014, Vienna will host the largest event in the history of
logic. The Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) will consist of twelve large
conferences and numerous workshops, attracting an expected number of 2500
researchers from all over the world.

The conferences and workshops will deal with the main theme, logic, from
three important aspects: logic in computer science, mathematical logic and
logic in artificial intelligence.

This unique event will be organized by the Kurt Goedel Society at Vienna
University of Technology from July 9 to 24, 2014 (see website for more
details: http://vsl2014.at)

*Keynote Speakers*
The VSL keynote speakers are Franz Baader (Technische Universitaet Dresden),
Edmund Clarke (Carnegie Mellon University), Christos Papadimitriou (University
of California, Berkeley) and Alex Wilkie (University of Manchester).
Dana Scott (Carnegie Mellon University) will speak in the opening session.

*Kurt Goedel Research Prize Fellowship Competition*
At the Vienna Summer of Logic, the Kurt Goedel Society will award three
fellowship prizes endowed with 100.000 Euro each to the winners of the Kurt
Goedel Research Prize Fellowship Competition "Logical Mind: Connecting
Foundations and Technology."

*FLoC Olympic Games - Citius, Maius, Potentius*
The Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) 2014 will host the 1st FLoC Olympic
Games.  Intended as a new FLoC tradition, the Games will bring together a
multitude of established solver competitions by different research communities.
In addition to the competitions, the Olympic Games will facilitate the exchange
of expertise between communities, and increase the visibility and impact of
state-of-the-art solver technology. The winners in the competition categories
will be awarded Kurt Goedel medals at the FLoC Olympic Games award ceremonies.
