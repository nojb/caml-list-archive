15th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
May 26-28, 2014
Utrecht University
Soesterberg, The Netherlands
http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/TFP2014/WebHome

*** Submission for TFP 2014 is now open: please direct your browser to
*** http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/TFP2014/PaperSubmission

The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional 
programming,
taking a broad view of current and future trends in the area. It aspires to
be a lively environment for presenting the latest research results, and 
other
contributions (see below), described in draft papers submitted prior to the
symposium. A formal post-symposium refereeing process then selects a subset
of the articles presented at the symposium and submitted for formal
publication.

Selected revised papers will be published as a Springer Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) volume.

TFP 2014 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming events.
The other is the International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming
in Education (TFPIE). TFPIE will take place on May 25th. Its website is 
located
at http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/

The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish 
Functional
Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in
Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003, in Munich (Germany) in 2004,
in Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005, in Nottingham (UK) in 2006,
in New York (USA) in 2007, in Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008,
in Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009, in Oklahoma (USA) in 2010, in Madrid 
(Spain) in
2011, St. Andrews (UK) in 2012 and Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013.
For further general information about TFP please see the TFP homepage.

INVITED SPEAKERS

TFP is pleased to announce talks by the following two invited speakers:

John Hughes of Chalmers, Goteborg, Sweden, is well-known as author of
Why Functional Programming Matters, and as one of the designers of 
QuickCheck
(together with Koen Claessen); the paper on QuickCheck won the
ICFP Most Influential Paper Award in 2010. Currently he divides his time 
between
his professorship and Quviq, a company that performs property-based 
testing of
software with a tool implemented in Erlang.

Dr. Geoffrey Mainland received his PhD from Harvard University where he was
advised by Greg Morrisett and Matt Welsh. After a two year postdoc with the
Programming Principles and Tools group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, 
he is
now an assistant professor at Drexel University. His research focuses on
high-level programming language and runtime support for non-general purpose
computation.

SCOPE

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes.
As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the
following five article categories. High-quality articles are solicited 
in any
of these categories:

     Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
     Position Articles: on what new trends should or should not be
     Project Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects
     Evaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project
     Overview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not submitted for simultaneous publication to
any other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:
theoretical, implementation-oriented, or more experience-oriented.
Applications of functional programming techniques to other languages are
also within the scope of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include:

     Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
     Functional programming in the cloud
     High performance functional computing
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
     Dependently typed functional programming
     Validation and verification of functional programs
     Using functional techniques to reason about 
imperative/object-oriented programs
     Debugging for functional languages
     Functional programming in different application areas:
       security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded 
systems,
       global computing, grids, etc.
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages
     Novel memory management techniques
     Program analysis and transformation techniques
     Empirical performance studies
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
     (Embedded) domain specific languages
     New implementation strategies
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP,
please contact the TFP 2014 program chair, Jurriaan Hage at J.Hage@uu.nl.

BEST PAPER AWARDS

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper
accepted for the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new subject
trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state that the paper
is mainly the work of students, the students are listed as first authors,
and a student would present the paper. A prize for the best student paper
is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize.
In case the best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then
receive both prizes.

SPONSORS

TFP is financially supported by NWO (Netherlands Organisation for 
Scientific
Research), Well-Typed and Erlang Solutions.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on a
lightweight peer review process of extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in
length) or full papers (16 pages). The submission must clearly indicate
which category it belongs to: research, position, project, evaluation,
or overview paper. It should also indicate whether the main author or
authors are research students. In the case of a FULL STUDENT paper, the
draft paper will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members 
shortly
after the symposium has taken place.

We use EasyChair for the refereeing process.
