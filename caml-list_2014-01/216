2nd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STATISTICAL LANGUAGE AND SPEECH PROCESSING

SLSP 2014

Grenoble, France

AIMS:

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying
excellent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are
currently in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at
attracting contributions from both fields. Though there exist large,
well-known conferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these
areas, SLSP is a more focused meeting where synergies between subdomains and
people will hopefully happen. In SLSP 2014, significant room will be
reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular
focus will be put on methodology.

VENUE:

SLSP 2014 will take place in Grenoble, at the foot of the French Alps.

SCOPE:

The conference invites submissions discussing the employment of statistical
methods (including machine learning) within language and speech processing.
The list below is indicative and not exhaustive:

phonology, phonetics, prosody, morphology
syntax, semantics
discourse, dialogue, pragmatics
statistical models for natural language processing
supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods
applied to natural language, including speech
statistical methods, including biologically-inspired methods
similarity
alignment
language resources
part-of-speech tagging
parsing
semantic role labelling
natural language generation
anaphora and coreference resolution
speech recognition=20
speaker identification/verification
speech transcription
