Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Adding functions to Pervasives

Hi,

Yes, the new OCaml bootstraps successfully at the first attempt.

I'll have a look at typing/env.ml -- thanks for the suggestion.

> There's also the -nopervasives switch to ocamlopt (it's undocumented, but I think you'll find it does almost exactly what it says on the tin!) which might yield clearer code?

How do you mean? I'm adding functions to Pervasives because I want these 
patches to eventually be applied to trunk (I'm playing with solutions to 
Bug 5443).

I had assumed I was running into a common problem, since functions get 
added to Pervasives from time to time.

For now, I'll add these functions in another module and continue with 
the rest of the patch.

Thanks,
