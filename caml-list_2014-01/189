Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] Announcing yet another Makefile for OCaml

Hello,

could you explain differences with OCamlMakefile (and pros!) , which 
seems to be similar to your project, but which is maintained from quite 
a long time now ?
https://bitbucket.org/mmottl/ocaml-makefile

why not contribute to this project if you introduced compatible clever 
ideas ?

Regards
