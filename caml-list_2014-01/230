The 2nd French Singaporean Workshop in Formal Methods and Applications (FSF=
MA 2014) aims at sharing research interests and launching collaborations in=
 the area of formal methods and their applications.

The scientific subject of the workshop covers (but is not limited to) areas=
 such as formal specification, model checking, verification, program analys=
is/transformation, software engineering, and applications in major areas of=
 computer science, including aeronautics and aerospace.

The workshop will bring together researchers and industry R&D experts from =
all countries together to exchange their knowledge, discuss their research =
findings, and explore potential collaborations.

Round tables will focus on French-Singaporean funding and cooperation oppor=
tunities.

A PhD session will allow Master and PhD students to present their work.

The workshop will take place on 12th-13th May, 2014, in Singapore as a sate=
llite event of FM 2014.

TOPICS OF THE WORKSHOP
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The main theme of the workshop is to establish links between academic and i=
ndustry scientists interested in methods and techniques for constructing re=
liable systems using formal methods. The scientific topics of the workshop =
include, but are not limited to:
- concurrent and distributed systems
- formal specification and semantics
- infinite-state and parameterized systems
- model checking algorithms
- SAT and SMT solvers
- security and privacy
- software engineering and formal methods
- specification and verification (hardware and embedded systems, probabilis=
tic and real-time systems, etc.)
- case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods
- tools and industrial applications
- applications in aeronautics and aerospace

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Two kinds of papers are welcome:
- regular papers
- PhD papers (for the doctoral session).
The content of papers should be original and not submitted elsewhere. All p=
apers will be assigned to at least three reviews.

The page limit is 12 pages (regular paper) and 6 pages (PhD paper) in the E=
PTCS format.
Accepted papers in both categories will be published by the Electronic Proc=
eedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS), a free open-access and onl=
ine electronic proceedings series, referenced in major databases such as DB=
LP.
The proceedings are published under the Creative Commons CC-BY license.
Hereby, the authors retain their copyright.

Submission will be made in English in PDF format through Easychair:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfsfma2014

Additional remarks:
- There are no restrictions on authors' citizenships and working countries.
- For PhD papers, at least one author must be Master or PhD student.
