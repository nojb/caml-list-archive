Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] OPAM 1.1.1 released

We are proud to announce that OPAM 1.1.1 has just been released.

This minor release features mostly stability and UI/doc improvements over OPAM
1.1.0, but also focuses on improving the API and tools to be a better base for
the platform (functions for opam-doc, interface with tools like opamfu and
opam-installer). Lots of bigger changes are in the works, and will be merged
progressively after this release.


== Installing ==

Installation instruction are available here:

  http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html

Note that some packages may take a few days until they get out of the pipeline.
If you're eager to get 1.1.1, either use our binary installer:

  https://raw.github.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/opam_installer.sh

or compile from source:

  https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/1.1.1


== About OPAM ==

OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and a
Git-friendly development workflow. OPAM is edited and maintained by OCamlPro,
with continuous support from OCaml Labs and the community at large (including
its main industrial users such as Jane-Street and Citrix).

The "official" package repository is now hosted at https://opam.ocaml.org,
synchronised with the Git repository at http://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository,
where you can contribute new packages descriptions. Those are under a CC0
license, a.k.a. public domain, to ensure they will always belong to the
community.

Thanks to all of you who have helped build this repository and made OPAM such a
success.
