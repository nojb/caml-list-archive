It is probably a matter of what you're used with, for me - coming from Bugzilla - reporting an issue on Github is more complicated,
and less obvious than on Bugzilla.
For example I don't know how to mark an issue as a 'feature request', or 'enhancement' as there are no severities; and I always
have to be careful of special characters that mess up formatting in the body of the issue, and need to put those in <pre> blocks.

I didn't have any considerable problems reporting bugs on Mantis, in fact its probably easier for me than Github, although
I have to admit that I didn't really try searching for bugs on Mantis or Github, and Github might have an advantage there.
