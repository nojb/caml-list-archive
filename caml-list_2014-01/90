Then, if nothing has been started yet, it's probably already too late.
GSoC is fairly constraining and time-consuming. Nowadays, projects which
manage to do it have actually gotten experienced at it and this makes it
more difficult for new participants: they don't only have to do things
well, they have to do things better than projects which have been doing
it for 10 years.

There's also a feeling that Google doesn't care about what happens in
OCaml-land (that's mostly speculation).

I believe it might be worth trying again. Many things have changed and
the projects that could be worked on now might appeal more to the GSoC
organizers. That would be for 2015 in my opinion though.

Regards,
Adrien Nader
