The idea is nice. I don't know the compiler's internals and would
certainly be interested in being familiar with them. Is a new mailing
list necessary - do you envision massive traffic on the list - or could
the current ocaml list, which is usually quite quiet, be used for
compiler discussions?

The parallel with the recent suggestion to host wikis on ocaml.org to
centralize information about how to do parallelism (or other
similar topics regarding the high-level use of OCaml) may be interesting.
Would a small-ish wiki about the compiler and compiler's hacking be
useful? Can a mailing-list play the same role as a wiki?

Cheers,

--=20
Simon
