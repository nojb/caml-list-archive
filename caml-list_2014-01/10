*3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in
Education (TFPIE 2014)*
May 25, 2014
Utrecht University
Soesterberg, The Netherlands
(http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/)


The 3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in
Education, TFPIE 2014, will be co-located with the Symposium on Trends in
Functional Programming (TFP 2014) <http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/TFP2014/> at
Soesterberg, at the =93Kontakt der
Kontinenten=94<http://www.kontaktderkontinenten.nl/conferentiehotel/home.as=
px?lang=3Den-US>hotel
in the Netherlands on Sunday, May 25th.  TFP will follow from May
26-28.


The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals that
use, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in education.
TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and
work-in-progress on the use of functional programming in education are
discussed. The one-day workshop will foster a spirit of open discussion by
having a review process for publication after the workshop. The program
chair of TFPIE 2014 will screen submissions to ensure that all
presentations are within scope and are of interest to participants.
Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages)
or a draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted
presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on
the workshop's website/wiki. Visitors to the TFPIE 2014 website/wiki will
be able to add comments. This includes presenters who may respond to
comments and questions as well as provide pointers to improvements and
follow-up work.  After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit
(a revised version of) their article for review. The PC will select the
best articles for publication in the journal Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) <http://published.eptcs.org/>.
Articles not selected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be
formally reviewed by the PC.

TFPIE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012)
and in Provo Utah, USA (2013).
