I don't know how you generate and _manage_ patches with svn. Indeed the 
linux kernel developers never used svn with their mailing-list review 
workflow and developed git for simplifying this workflow.

It seems counterproductive to have more than one place for discussing 
one thing so I think the developers must make a choice:
- keeping patch review in mantis
- going to a mailing-list review workflow and moving from svn
- going to a merge-request workflow on github, specific gitlab instance, 
bitbuckets, ...

The last two points have the benefit to allow to easily comment inside 
the patches.

The third point (at least on github) subsume the second point since you 
can answer to github issues or merge-requests by email. You can also ask 
to be notified for every issues or merge-requests of a project.

Best,
