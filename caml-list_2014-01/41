Regarding the need for a wiki, why not create a new Parallel Programming
page under tutorials [1]. A "tutorial" can be as simple as listing the
libraries available and a brief description about the high level goal of
each.

Note ocaml.org is now almost entirely written in Markdown. A new page can
be written quite easily, see for example The Basics tutorial [2].
