*** Last Mile ***

Fifth International Conference on Software Business (ICSOB 2014)

Azia Resort and Spa, Paphos Cyprus
June 15-18, 2014

http://www.icsob.org

Online submission: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicsob2014

Extended Deadline for submissions: February 1, 2014

Conference Theme
Shortening the time-to-market: from short cycle times to continuous value d=
elivery

Advancements in the software industry have had a substantial impact not
only on productivity and on GDP growth globally, but also on our daily work
and lives. Moreover there is a noticeable spillover within other industries
(e.g. manufacturing, entertainment industry) enabling new business models:
companies bundle their physical products and software services into
solutions (e.g. using subscription models or in-app purchases) and start to
sell independent software products in addition to physical products.
Software business refers to commercial activities in and around the software
industry, aimed at generating income from the delivery of software products
and software services. Although the software business shares common
features with other international knowledge-intensive businesses, it carries
many inherent features making it a challenging domain for research. In
particular software companies have to depend on one another to deliver a
unique value proposition to their customers or a unique experience to their
users. Moreover recent developments like the emerging app economy offer a
variety of opportunities for entrepreneurs or start-up companies. The recent
acquisition of the three-year old Finnish mobile game startup Supercell with
the total value of 2.2 billion Euros shows that the future of software is n=
ot
only in utility and but also in entertainment and increasing freetime of pe=
ople
globally. This will have a profound effect on software business and requires
novel business models and new approaches to software product development
as well.

ICSOB 2014 addresses researchers and practitioners, who are concerned with
software business in different ways as well as the start-up community, which
is increasingly focusing on mobile and social software. The main theme of
2014 focuses on speeding up the time from idea to value delivery, towards
continuous delivery of added value.
