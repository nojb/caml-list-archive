That's a troll. What some of us are asking for is a usable bugtracker (cf. =
#6052). Frankly, mantis doesn't even know how to properly escape markup whe=
n you are commenting issues. Having proper ways to introduce code (and, les=
s essential, lightweight formatting) on a bugtracker seems an essential fea=
ture to me and that's just one example, I won't even talk about having a qu=
ick look at patches that you can't even see in context but will download to=
 your computer. If you want to use broken and inhumane software it's your p=
roblem but don't try to label those that actually prefer usable software as=
 being attracted by cool and shiny things.

It's not only easy to browse, it's *great* to browse: all the web-based mai=
ling list archives I interact with are not even able to follow a thread run=
ning across two month. I really feel we're in 2014.=20=20

Sure, if you move to that kind of (free or paid) service always factor in t=
he costs of entering and leaving it, as it certainly won't help you forever=
. What's forever anyways ?=20=20

I think that's a rather bad idea.=20=20

P.S. Since you mentioned gitlab et al, I was recently pointed to this aswel=
