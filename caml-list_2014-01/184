Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN]Releases of xtmpl, ocaml-rdf, stog, stog-rdf,
 stog-writing and genet

Hello,

It is my pleasure to announce new releases of various tools and
libraries of mine. The opam packages are already submitted and will be
available soon.

# Xtmpl 0.8 [http://zoggy.github.io/xtmpl/]

Xtmpl is a small XML templating library for OCaml.
This release changes the API to allow fold-like style rewriting.


# OCaml-RDF 0.8.0 [http://zoggy.github.io/ocaml-rdf/]

OCaml-RDF is an OCaml library to manipulate RDF graphs and execute
Sparql queries. This release fix a small bug and adds convenient
functions.


# Stog 0.10.0 [http://zoggy.github.io/stog/]

Stog is a static web site compiler. It is able to handle blog posts as
well are regular pages.
This release contains a lot of changes, listed here:
  http://zoggy.github.io/stog/posts/release-0.10.0.html


# Stog-rdf 0.10.0 [http://zoggy.github.io/stog/plugins/rdf.html]

This Stog plugin allows to easily specify RDF triples within elements,
to produce a RDF graph for the whole generated site. It also permits
executing Sparql queries to include data in the generated pages. 
This release follows Stog's new architecture.


# Stog-writing 0.10.0 [http://zoggy.github.io/stog/plugins/writing.html]

This plugin adds new rewrite rules to use foonotes and bibliographies
in generated pages, with also auto generation of paragraph ids. 
This release follows Stog's new architecture, and include some minor
changes.


# Genet 0.6 [http://zoggy.github.io/genet/]

Genet is tool to build a continuous integration platform. It is
particulary adapted to developments involving various tools working in
chain, that is some tools producing files used by other tools and so
on. This release follows the new API of Xtmpl 0.8.

Regards,

Maxence Guesdon
