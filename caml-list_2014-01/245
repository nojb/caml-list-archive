**********************************************************************
     5th International Symposium on Unifying Theories of Programming
                       co-located with FM2014
                          May 12 - 13, 2014
                              Singapore

CALL FOR PAPERS

Interest in the fundamental problem of the combination of formal notations and theories of programming has grown consistently in recent years.  The theories define, in various different ways, many common notions, such as abstraction, refinement, choice, termination, feasibility, locality, concurrency and communication.  Despite these differences, such theories may be unified in a way which greatly facilitates their study and comparison.  Moreover, such a unification offers a means of combining different languages describing various facets and artifacts of software development in a seamless, logically consistent way.

Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) is widely acknowledged as one of the most significant such unification approaches. Based on their pioneering work, the aims of the UTP Symposium series are to reaffirm the significance of the ongoing UTP project and to stimulate efforts to advance. The Symposium provides a focus for the sharing of results by those already actively contributing, and raises awareness of the benefits of such unifying theoretical frameworks among the wider computer science and software engineering communities.

To this end the Symposium welcomes contributions on all the themes that can be related to the Unifying Theories of Programming.

SUBMISSIONS

Papers may be up to 20 pages in length and should be prepared using LaTeX in Springer LNCS paper format.  Submissions should be made through the UTP 2014 EasyChair site; instructions are at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/UTP2014
