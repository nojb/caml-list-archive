I'd really like to meet... if I were in Paris! But I'm way over here in
Canada. :( I discovered OCaml due to a student we hired (while I was
in Los Angeles) -- he talked about wanting to learn more OCaml if he
went back to school. I looked into it and was hooked. Now I have yet
to meet another OCaml programmer in person, as there are so few in
the wild!

I know there have been several people expressing interest in game
development with OCaml, but I got most of that impression from
reddit. I'm unsure who some of the people are, or where they are
geographically, but there must be several others in the Paris area.

Hopefully you can find some like-minded folks nearby -- good luck!
