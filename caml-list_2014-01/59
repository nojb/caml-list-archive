I don't think there would be massive traffic but probably some bursts
(especially when there are 10 patches or more in a series) and that
could be annoying to some.

Also, I'd say the caml-list actually has some traffic on it.

Well, I don't know compiler internals very well either so it's difficult
for me to say. However having information on how to contribute back (be
it a wiki page or a static page updated through git) would definitely be
useful as there is a growing number of people asking for such infos (at
least on IRC on #ocaml).
