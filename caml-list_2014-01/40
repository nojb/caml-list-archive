We do have a fledgling service for "domain-specific" conversations, in the =
form of lists.ocaml.org.  In fact, we set up a "wg-parallel" mailing list l=
ast year, but never announced it for various reasons.  This seems like a go=
od time to advertise its existence:

http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-parallel/

(note that if anyone else would like an archived list on lists.ocaml.org fo=
r a project or community group, then please do drop a line to infrastructur=
e@lists.ocaml.org to request it)

Regarding other services on ocaml.org, we (the "infrastructure team") are h=
appy to set them up, but please bear in mind that they all come with a main=
tenance burden.  Dealing with security issues, backups, software updates, o=
utages all take up time, and I confess a preference for sipping martinis an=
d hacking on code instead of sysadmin work. Jeremy and Leo got tired of wai=
ting for me to set up the wiki too, and started:
https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki

If you follow the links through there, there is a 'compiler internals' page=
 that would be good to contribute to, and you (or anyone else) is extremely=
 welcome to add more information on topics such as parallel programming lib=
raries there.  I think we could have a decent stab at a wiki.ocaml.org by b=
acking it against a GitHub repository, and not have to do any special hosti=
ng for it at all (the OPAM web pages work in a similar fashion at the momen=
t).  But for now though, I'd recommend focussing on the problem at hand (pa=
rallel programming) and getting some information down somewhere, and less o=
n the lack of a central wiki.
