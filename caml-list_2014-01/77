Reducing reviewer work and/or having more reviewers was the actual goal
behind my proposal.
Another core aspect is that setting up a mailing-list and putting up a
"howto contribute" page takes a few minutes of work unlike migrations of
whole systems or the use of forges(*).

I was also not thinking of replacing patches and reviews on mantis, more
having an additional tool to conduct code review although, of course, I
would prefer a single place for that. In any case, having something
agreed upon and documented is probably what matters most.

On a personal note, I also prefer getting fed with emails for which I
will use a decent client with an editor I enjoy rather than a web
browser (especially when there's flash on the pages).

(*) A word about phabricator too: it has some very nice things on paper
and on demo but I've found it makes things easier for frequent
users/devs and very bad for others
