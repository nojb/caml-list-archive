=D8  I can say that the main part is coming up with a webpage full of ideas
for projects.

=20

If anyone wants to pursue anything like HLVM, please do get in touch with
me.

=20

I=92ve been discussing student projects recently and a couple of ideas I=92=
ve
had are:

=20

1.       Merge core (stdlib) collections with the GC. For example, mutable
stacks and queues are currently represented as arrays filled with NULL
pointers whereas a collection-aware GC could skip the unreachable pointers
and the collection wouldn=92t have to NULL out its elements. Collections co=
uld
also be shrunk by the GC.

2.       Allow objects to morph their representation as they go from one
generation to another. For example, long-lived immutable sets could morph
from a tree of heap-allocated blocks into a sorted array.

=20

I also think it would be interesting to study how fast purely functional
data structures could be if their representation was optimized (within the
confines of a memory-safe VM) for the performance characteristics of a na=
=EFve
mark-sweep GC. For example, list cons in OCaml currently heap allocates a
new block based on the assumption that the GC can do this quickly (which
OCaml can) but the list implementation could pre-allocate a block of cons
cells in an array and use a CAS to claim the next one, amortising
allocations and greatly reducing the stress on the GC. I=92ve implemented t=
his
for lists in F# where it is about as fast as the generational GC. I don=92t
know if the same can be done effectively for trees like Set and Map. The
motivation is avoiding the pathological performance for programs that
violate the generational hypothesis.

=20

Cheers,

Jon.

I actually don't think it's very hard to apply (in general). The
requirements page is here
(http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc20
14/help_page?ModPagespeed=3Dnoscript#1._How_does_a_mentoring_organization).
It's certainly much easier than applying for a grant.

Having participated as a mentor in another organization, and having seen the
application process every year, I can say that the main part is coming up
with a webpage full of ideas for projects. I think that already exists
partially on the ocamllabs wiki. I'd really like to see that wiki be
centralized and available from the ocaml.org site. The key thing is to
figure out which projects are doable by people in one summer. The next step
is that people need to volunteer for mentorship. Even 2 people are enough
for a start, but 3-4 are better. Finally, one person takes on the process of
filling out the application and submitting it.

One of the things that concern google, as can be seen in the webpage, is
that there's enough effort from the mentors to=20
a. weed out the poor candidates and=20
b. be in touch with/demand enough from the candidates to make sure that
they're actually working and not just slacking off for the summer. In my old
organization, the participants had to post blog updates every week or so
about their progress.

Other than that, there's not much to it.

Then, if nothing has been started yet, it's probably already too late.
GSoC is fairly constraining and time-consuming. Nowadays, projects which
manage to do it have actually gotten experienced at it and this makes it
more difficult for new participants: they don't only have to do things
well, they have to do things better than projects which have been doing
it for 10 years.

There's also a feeling that Google doesn't care about what happens in
OCaml-land (that's mostly speculation).

I believe it might be worth trying again. Many things have changed and
the projects that could be worked on now might appeal more to the GSoC
organizers. That would be for 2015 in my opinion though.

Regards,
Adrien Nader
