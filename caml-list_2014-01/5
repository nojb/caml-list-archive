Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Papers: FormaliSE 2014 (3 June 2014,
 Hyderabad, India)

                  Call for Papers: FormaliSE 2014
       2nd FME Workshop on Formal Methods in Software Engineering=20
           to be held on June 3th 2014 in conjunction with=20
          ICSE 2014 (May 31th=96June 7th), in Hyderabad, India
                      http://www.formalise.org/

INTRODUCTION
The software industry has a long-standing and well-earned reputation for
failing to deliver on its promises and it is clear that still nowadays, the
success of software projects with the current technologies cannot be assure=
d.
For large complex projects ad hoc approaches have proven inadequate to assu=
re
the correct behavior of the delivered software. The lack of formalization in
key places makes software engineering overly sensitive to the weaknesses th=
at
are inevitable in the complex activities behind software creation. Aids to
precision in each phase of software development and crosschecking are
essential, and this is precisely one the objectives of formal methods.

Formal methods (FMs) are intended to provide the means for greater precisio=
n in
both thinking and documenting the preliminary stage of the software creation
process. When done well, this can aid all aspects of software creation: user
requirement formulation, implementation, verification/testing, and the crea=
tion
of documentation. However, the maturing of formal techniques into real-life
software engineering involves providing notations and tools that are readily
understood and used by practitioners, and the integration of such tools with
activities that are far from the unrealistic assumptions that characterized
some earlier research in formal methods.=20

After decades of research, and despite significant advancement, formal meth=
ods
are still not widely used in industrial software development. This may be d=
ue
to the fact that the formal methods community has not enough focused its
attention to software engineering needs, and its specific role in the softw=
are
process. At the same time, from a software engineering perspective, there c=
ould
be a number of fundamental principles that might help to guide the design of
formal methods in order to make them more easily applicable in the developm=
ent
of software applications.=20

The main goal of the workshop is to foster integration between the formal
methods and the software engineering communities with the purpose to examine
the link between the two more carefully than is currently the case.

AREAS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to:
- integration of FMs in the software development life cycle
- ability of formal methods to handle real-world problems=20
- prescriptive/objective guidance in the use of FMs
- Formal methods in a certification context
- =93lightweight=94 or usable FMs
- application experiences
- scalability of FM applications
- experimental validation

The program will start with an invited speaker, followed by presentations of
submitted papers. The workshop will end with a round table discussion (PC
members and workshop audience), focusing on the subjects that came up during
the workshop.

SUBMISSIONS are limited to 7 pages in ACM Formatting Guidelines (LaTeX user=
s,
please use the "Option 2" style). They will be published as part of the
(electronic) proceedings of ICSE 2013. All papers submitted to the workshop
must be unpublished original work and should not be under review or submitt=
ed
elsewhere while being under consideration. All submissions must be in Engli=
sh
and in PDF format through online upload to the workshop submission website =
at
the following URL: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dformalise2=
014.
Three or four PC members will review all submissions. Papers will be judged=
 on
the basis of their clarity, relevance, originality, and contribution to the
field.

IMPORTANT DATES
24 January 2014: submission deadline for workshop papers
24 February 2014: notification of acceptance/rejection to authors
14 March 2014: camera-ready copy deadline for workshop papers
7 June 2014: FormaliSE workshop held in Hyderabad, India
