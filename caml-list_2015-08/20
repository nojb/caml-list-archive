I agree that it matches many use cases of the M.(); but not all of them.=20
And, I am not sure that the
  splitting should be done on the operators/alphanumeric identifiers=20
criterion: If I define an exotic
  operator, for instance "@->", it would be very sensible to emit a=20
warning if this exotic operator is
shadowed. Similarly, in a Triple module defining a "fst" function is=20
very natural. It could be nice to be
able to disactivate the warning on the shadowing of Pervasive 's "fst".=20=
=20
For these reasons, I think
that it is could be useful to let the choice to library authors.

A broad rule is clearly easier to remember, so it is a question of=20
compromise.

I think that it is partially true. For instance, with a vector library,=20
"*" is always quite ambiguous: Is this the original scalar=20
multiplication? The vector product? The tensor product? The external=20
product? The Clifford algebra product? These ambiguities already needs=20
to be resolved in the documentation; where the eventual [@shadow]=20
annotations also ought to be mentionned.
