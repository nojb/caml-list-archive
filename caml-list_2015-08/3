Subject: Re: [Caml-list] A way to have certain file suffixes treated as
 .ml/.mli with ocamlbuild.

I think it should not be terribly hard to implement -intf-suffix and
-impl-suffix in ocamlbuild (you should open a feature wish on the
bugtracker http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/ to keep track of this need).

In the meantime, you can work around the compiler error messages by
using a .xyz -> .ml rule that prepends a lexer directive. At the
beginning of each "foo.ml", have
  # 1 "foo.xyz"
to inform the compiler that the "real filename" is foo.xyz

(This affect compiler-generated errors. OCamlbuild errors (during the
build itself) will still mention the foo.ml file, as the dependency of
foo.xyz that failed to build.)
