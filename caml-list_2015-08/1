Subject: [Caml-list] PEPM 2016: Call for Papers


CALL FOR PAPERS
Workshop on PARTIAL EVALUATION AND PROGRAM MANIPULATION (PEPM 2016)

St. Petersburg, Florida, January 18 - 19, 2016
http://conf.researchr.org/track/POPL-2016/pepm-2016-main


The 2016 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation and continues efforts to expand the sc=
ope
of PEPM beyond the traditionally covered areas of partial evaluation and
specialization. Specifically, PEPM will include practical applications of
program transformations such as refactoring tools, and practical
implementation techniques such as rule-based transformation systems. In
addition, the scope of PEPM covers manipulation and transformations of prog=
ram
and system representations such as structural and semantic models that occur
in the context of model-driven development. In order to reach out to
practitioners, a separate category of tool demonstration papers will be
solicited.


Topics of interest for PEPM=E2=80=9916 include, but are not limited to:

* Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, part=
ial
 evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, progr=
am
 inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and
 obfuscation.

* Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
 manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
 binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing
 and test case generation.

* Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
 metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific language=
s,
 program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged
 computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.

* Application of the above techniques including case studies of program
 manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software
 development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively
 handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application
 domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL
 implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific
 computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed
 and web-based applications, resource-limited computation, and security.=20

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will continue the
category of `short papers=E2=80=99 for tool demonstrations and for presenta=
tions of
exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic,
industrial and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar.

Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant=
 to
help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers other support,
such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details on t=
he
PAC program, see its web page.

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal proceedin=
gs
published by ACM Press. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital
Library. Selected papers from PEPM=E2=80=9916 will be published in a specia=
l issue of
the journal Science of Computer Programming.

PEPM has also established a Best Paper Award. The winner will be announced =
at
the workshop.


Submission Categories and Guidelines

Regular Research Papers must not exceed 12 pages in ACM Proceedings style
(including appendix). Tool demonstration papers and short papers must not
exceed 6 pages in ACM Proceedings style (including appendix). At least one
author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop and present t=
he
work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the
described tool is expected. Suggested topics, evaluation criteria, and writ=
ing
guidelines for both research tool demonstration papers will be made availab=
le
on the PEPM=E2=80=9916 web site.

Papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair.

	easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dpepm2016

Authors using LaTeX to prepare their submissions should use the new improved
SIGPLAN proceedings style. Specifically, use the sigplanconf.cls 9pt templa=
te.


Important Dates

* Abstract submission:	Tue, September 8, 2015
* Paper submission:	Sun, September 13, 2015 (FIRM)
* Author notification:	Tue, October 20, 2015
* Camera ready copies:	Fri, November 20, 2015
* Workshop: Monday, January 18 - Tuesday, January 19, 2016

Note: The paper submission deadline is firm. The above schedule is tight: We
have absolutely no time to wait for late submissions, and we will have no
deadline extension.
