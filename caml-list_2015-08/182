Subject: [Caml-list] We need a rich standard library distributed with OCaml,

Dear OCaml developers,
    I would like to spend one hour in writing down my experience that why I=
 had to write some small utilities again and again, since this happened so =
many times that I believe you might come across such issues before.
    I am doing some compiler hacking tonight, I needed a utility function =
=E2=80=9CString.split=E2=80=9D which split a string into a list of strings =
by whitespace, it is just one liner if you use str library. However, since =
I am doing some low level stuff, I would try to avoid such big dependency, =
and I am pretty sure that I have ever written it  for at least three times,=
 I just hoped that I could get it done quickly, so I am looking into batter=
ies that if I can steal some code, I have to copy some code instead of depe=
nd on batteries, batteries is too big for my projects. `BatString.nsplit` s=
eems to fit for what I needed, I copied the definition of `BatString.nsplit=
` into REPL, no luck, it depends on some previously defined functions, then=
 I copied the whole module `BatString` into REPL, still no luck, it depende=
d on another module `BatReturn`, then I stopped here, it=E2=80=99s time to =
write my own ad-hoc thrown-away `String.split` function again.
   OCaml is my favorite programming language, and I am very productive at i=
t, however, I was annoyed by such things from time to time. We do have four=
 *standard libraries* alternatives: batteries, core, extlib and ocaml-conta=
iners. In my opinion, none of them matches the beauty of the OCaml language=
 itself and probably will never catch up if we don=E2=80=99t do anything.=20
    Note that I don=E2=80=99t want to be offensive to any of these librarie=
s, just my personal feedback that why I think it is not a good standard lib=
rary, I appreciated a lot to people who contribute their precious time in m=
aintaining these libraries, better than nothing : )
    - Batteries(extlib)
      It=E2=80=99s big with dependencies between different modules (OCaml d=
oes not have a good story in dead code elimination), some of its modules ar=
e of low quality, for example, batEnum is used everywhere while its impleme=
ntation is buggy. batIO makes things even worse since it is not compatible =
with standard library, some type signatures mismatched IIRC.
    - ocaml-containers
      Mostly one man=E2=80=99s project
    - core
      I believe core has high quality, however, it suffers the same problem=
 as batteries, a big dependency. There is a blocking issue, its development=
 process is opaque, for an open source community, I would prefer a standard=
 library developed in an open environment.=20
    I am not expecting that we could have a  standard library as rich as py=
thon, but for some utilities, I do believe that shipped with standard libra=
ry or officially supported is the best solution.
   Thanks =E2=80=94 Hongbo=20=
