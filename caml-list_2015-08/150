It expresses intuitively, "Something which is exactly a nothing", so
naturally, I would categorize that as a nothing directly of course. And
you've just done precisely that with your code; foo = Some None => set that
field to NULL could only represent saying that field is just exactly
nothing directly. So, it's just like I said-you have to deal with the
instance because it comes up in practice, and pragmatically we have to
represent such cases in machine code as has been discussed. But in
practicality almost never would an author sensibly keep the expanded form
of Some None directly, it shows up due to code combinations only to be
reduced.
