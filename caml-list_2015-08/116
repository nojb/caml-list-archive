Let's see.  OCaml steals a bit to indicate whether a valus is a pointer 
or not, right?  Could that bit see duual usage for the option type?  So 
that if it's an optional pointer type, the bit is left off, and if it's 
an optional nonpointer type, it's turned on (and set to point to 
location zero, which the GC couls check for)?

THe proble I see with this is if the 'a is passed to a generic function 
where iti isn't statically known where it's a pinter or not.  The 
conpiler will not know whether to test for absence or presence of the 
bit.
