Subject: [Caml-list] Open engineer & scientist positions at CEA LIST - LSL

--089e0122af2a28c784051e38673d
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hello,

The LSL laboratory at CEA LIST [#] has open permanent positions.  If you
are interested, please consider applying. More details are available below.


==== Next generation tools for formal verification. ====

The LSL Software Security Laboratory helps developers and validation
experts ship high-confidence software and systems. With everyday
objects getting more and more complex, we have built a reputation for
efficiently applying formal reasoning techniques to establish their
trustworthiness.

As part of the CEA LIST Institute, at the heart of Campus Paris
Saclay, teams at LSL are researching the best possible means to
conduct formal verification.
We design tools such as Frama-C, GATeL, and UNISIM, that ensure
production-level systems can comply with the highest safety and
security standards. And in doing so, we get to interact with the most
creative people in academia and the industry.

Our organizational structure is simple: those who pioneer new concepts
are the ones who get to lead their implementation. We are a
fast-growing thirty-person team, and your work will have a direct and
visible impact on the state of formal verification.


== You ==

You dream of devising the next breakthrough in verification and to see
it through low-level implementation details. You read research papers
with a passion, but you are well aware that a toy prototype is quite
different from a hardened tool. You understand that what stands
between both is a series of challenging implementation problems. And
that's great, because it means getting
your hands dirty and coming up with ground-breaking code.

You enjoy being a constructive member of a team of talented and
dedicated people; you are extremely reliable and the nightly builds
will prove it every time. Last week's bleeding-edge release of obscure
packages is not really your thing. You want the source code, you want
scalability, and you want results.

If this sounds like you, we have a job for you.

== Role ==

We need you to help us develop our formal tools and platforms, both by
improving current verifiers and by designing new approaches. You will
contribute to growing the community of users, handling feedback and
helping real people solve real problems.

You will take an active role in research activities and industrial
partnerships, alongside other members of the laboratory. This can
include writing proposals, managing projects, publishing papers, and
attending scientific and technical events worldwide.

== Requirements ==

- Background in formal methods and programming languages.
- Hands-on experience with significant OCaml developments - other
languages are fine too, but you'll need to convince us you can adapt
in a snap.
- Self-organized, with an ability to prioritize effectively.
- Team-minded - you know when to let someone else take the lead.

== Pluses ==

Various areas of our overall activity can also benefit from specific skillsets.

- Break new ground with us:
    * Hands-on expertise in the fields of software security or hybrid systems.
    * Flawless understanding of `C++` and object-oriented semantics.
- Precision-drive our infrastructure:
    * Technical administration of Linux environments and development tools.
    * Robust grasp of IT service management processes.
- Help us spread the word:
    * Strong proficiency in foreign languages.
    * A knack for writing and editing longform content.

== Applying ==

If you're interested in joining LSL, send us an email to share what
inspires you, and why you think you are a good match for the team.
Send it with a resume at florent.kirchner@cea.fr.
