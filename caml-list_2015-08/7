There is an unsafe way to do this, that you should only do, if you understa=
nd, what you're doing. It is a typecasting in fact:

    external pango_of_cairo : Cairo.context -> Pango.context =3D "%identity"

This will define a function that will create (typecast) pango context from =
a cairo.=20

If underneath they're different type, then at best you will get segfault.=20

Maybe it is for good reason, I don't know. I need to view the implementatio=
n, that
is not currently under hand.
