Possibly that's not a questio of a tool,
but rather a question of lawyers.

Are there already schemes / tables, that suggest what combinations
of licenses do fit, and which not?
And: the result may also be different, depending on the question
(which aspects of the problem of licenses is looked at).

So, I think a tool would be the step that comes after classification of the
problem.

Also a "which license do I choose", or "what do I have to add"
(e.g. linking exception for OCaml and GPL-like licenses) would pop up.

=> which license can be used / derived for the project that someone  
wants to program,
    from those licenses that are available in the libs (which might  
have different licensing schemes)

So, thats the reverse question of "what libs can I chose to fit in license X".


So possible questions are:

  - what lib(s) can I use, which to fit into "I need license X for my program"
  - what license(s) can I chose for my program, if I use library Y

Ah, didn't knew that.

More of "we have a lot of documents, cluttered through the web".

Also seems like some (a lot of?) entries are missing there...


Ciao,
