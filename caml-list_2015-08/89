********************************************************

The WorldCIS-2015 is an international forum dedicated to the
advancement of the theory and practical implementation of security
on the Internet and Computer Networks. The inability to properly
secure the Internet, computer networks, protecting the Internet
against emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and sustaining privacy
and trust has been a key focus of research. The WorldCIS aims to
provide a highly professional and comparative academic research
forum that promotes collaborative excellence between academia and
industry.

The objectives of the WorldCIS are to bridge the knowledge
gap between academia and industry, promote research esteem
and to fostering discussions on information technologies,
information systems and global security applications.
The WorldCIS-2015 invites speakers and researchers to submit
papers that encompass conceptual analysis, design implementation
and performance evaluation.

Original papers are invited on recent advances in Internet,
Computer Communications and Networking Security.

The topics in WorldCIS-2015 include but are not confined
to the following areas:

*Internet Security
*Security, trust and privacy
*Self-organizing networks
*Sensor nets and embedded systems
*Service overlays
*Switches and switching
*Topology characterization and inference
*Traffic measurement and analysis
*Traffic engineering and control
*Trust and Data Security
*Virtual and overlay networks
*Web services and performance
*Wireless mesh networks and protocols
*Ad hoc mobile networks Security
*Addressing and location management
