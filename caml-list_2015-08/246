Packages in OPAM do not benefit from QA done in e.g. Debian or Fedora.

Besides, a regular Debian user (for example) is used to Debian policies,
not OPAM ones. Don't assume that anyone wanting to use software written
in OCaml is part of the OCaml community. I am happy as a Debian user to
not have to deal with CPAN / CTAN / PyPI / whatever.

In my experience, they are not...

... but I've never tried that. Aren't old versions of packages removed
at some point?

AFAICT, opam only "trusts" packages to install things in a user's home.
