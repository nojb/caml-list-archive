Part of the promise of an ecosystem of small libraries is that you should
be able to use them for any code you write, including other libraries. This
is not the same thing as API coupling; as an end user of library C you
should be able to use it without caring about whether it is self-contained
in terms of code or whether it uses libraries A and B internally. The fact
that dependencies need to be installed manually on windows is a failure of
the ocaml windows ecosystem (which I'm definitely sympathetic towards; I
once had to manually copy a bunch of code from batteries into my own
project just to avoid depending on it); it is not a sign that libraries
need not to depend on each other.
