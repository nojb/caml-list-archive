Information
-----------

The  International   Conference  on  Compiler  Construction   (CC)  is
interested in work  on processing programs in the  most general sense:
analyzing, transforming or executing input that describes how a system
operates,  including traditional  compiler construction  as a  special
case.

Original contributions are solicited on the topics of interest which
include, but are not limited to:

- Compilation   and  interpretation   techniques,  including   program
  representation,  analysis, and  transformation; code  generation and
  optimization;
- Run-time techniques, including  memory management, virtual machines,
  and dynamic and just-in-time compilation;
- Programming   tools,   including  refactoring   editors,   checkers,
  verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers;
- Techniques  for   specific  domains,   such  as   secure,  parallel,
  distributed, embedded or mobile environments;
- Design  and   implementation  of   novel  language   constructs  and
  programming models.

CC 2016 is the 25th edition  of the conference.  It will be co-located
with CGO, HPCA, PPoPP, and EuroLLVM on March 17-18 2016, in Barcelona,
Spain.

Submission
----------

Papers   should  be   submitted   electronically   via  EasyChair   at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcc2016.    Papers    must   be
written in English and be submitted  in pdf in ACM SIGPLAN proceedings
format  (http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).   The  proceedings
will  be  published in  the  ACM  Digital  Library  and will  be  made
available freely for the period around the conference.

Both regular  papers (up to  11 pages)  and tool papers  (up to 2  + 3
pages), are invited.   In tool papers the first part  (2 pages) should
describe the tool and the second (3 pages) explain the contents of the
demo that will be presented with examples and screenshots.

Submissions  must  adhere  strictly  to  the  page  limits,  including
bibliography, figures,  or appendices.   Submissions that  are clearly
too long  may be  rejected immediately.  Additional  material intended
for reviewers but not for publication in the final version ( listings,
data, proofs) may be included  in a clearly marked appendix. Submitted
papers  must  be unpublished  and  not  be submitted  for  publication
elsewhere.  A  condition of submission  is that, if the  submission is
accepted,  one of  the  authors  attends the  conference  to give  the
presentation.
