Subject: Re: [Caml-list] We need a rich standard library distributed with
 OCaml, really

--001a11c044a2a73584051e5090c4
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I'd like to mention the merits of not having a large standard library.
Consider the evolution of OCaml. Many of the paradigms with which OCaml was
born, such as using exceptions everywhere, have gone out of favor.
Hopefully, sometime in the near future, we'll have Modular Implicits
integrated into the language. Assuming this happens, it will almost
certainly impact what would be expected to belong in a standard library.
The official standard library already carries around with it vestigial
organs, such as the Stream module. This will only get worse if we add to it.

At the same time, I recognize a need for a library to represent a large
collection of data types and the functions over said types. It cannot all
be miniature libraries in opam IMO -- for basic programming, there should
be a curated source of basic and even some extended functionality.

What seems to me better than a built-in standard library, though, is a
reference to the best currently available libraries in each area, including
a 'standard' collection of utilities/data structures. Such a reference
could include space for the community to debate the pros and cons of
various libraries, and perhaps even a voting system to indicate to
potential users what the community thinks about said libraries. This is
something I currently have trouble with in opam, since I have no idea if a
given library is a) ancient and unmaintained b) the best in its class c)
rising in popularity d) written by a pro and solid, even if not used much.
The closest I have to that in opam is number of downloads, but given how
much the ecosystem now relies on opam, I think a more advanced display is
needed.
