So there should be a superuser option, telling opam to install in the
system-wide installation area.  Of course that wouldn't work if you 
don't have the relevant permissions, not should it.  And the details of 
the superuser option (such as where to install what) may be 
system-dependent.

There are Debian packages that access the net during installation; most 
notably some device drivers on Debian, where the manufacturer releases 
its own installation procedure, but does not allow redistribution.  So 
the Debian package, during installation, downloads the manufacturer's 
installer and executes it.

No reason why the, say ocaml packages shouldn't do likewise using 
opam.  One bit of hackery could wrap all the available opam packages.
