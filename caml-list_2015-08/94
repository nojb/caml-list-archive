IFL 2015 - Call for papers

27th SYMPOSIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES - =
IFL 2015

University of Koblenz-Landau, Koblenz, Germany

In cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN

September 14-16, 2015

http://ifl2015.wikidot.com/

Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively enga=
ged in the implementation and application of functional and function-based =
programming languages. IFL 2015 will be a venue for researchers to present =
and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe =
results related to the implementation and application of functional languag=
es and function-based programming.

Peer-review

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2015 will use a post-symposium review proc=
ess to produce the formal proceedings. All participants of IFL2015 are invi=
ted to submit either a draft paper or an extended abstract describing work =
to be presented at the symposium. At no time may work submitted to IFL be s=
imultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIG=
PLAN's republication policy:

http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to make sur=
e they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the draft proceeding=
s distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing in the draft proceedi=
ngs are not peer-reviewed publications. Hence, publications that appear onl=
y in the draft proceedings do not count as publication for the ACM SIGPLAN =
republication policy. After the symposium, authors will be given the opport=
unity to incorporate the feedback from discussions at the symposium and wil=
l be invited to submit a revised full article for the formal review process=
. From the revised submissions, the program committee will select papers fo=
r the formal proceedings considering their correctness, novelty, originalit=
y, relevance, significance, and clarity.

Important dates

August 15: Submission deadline draft papers
August 17: Notification of acceptance for presentation
August 19: Early registration deadline
August 26: Late registration deadline
September 7: Submission deadline for pre-symposium proceedings
September 14-16: IFL Symposium
December 1: Submission deadline for post-symposium proceedings
January 15, 2016: Notification of acceptance for post-symposium proceedings
March 1, 2016: Camera-ready version for post-symposium proceedings

Submission details

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended abstracts t=
o be published in the draft proceedings and to present them at the symposiu=
m. All contributions must be written in English. Papers must adhere to the =
standard ACM two columns conference format. For the pre-symposium proceedin=
gs we adopt a 'weak' page limit of 12 pages. For the post-symposium proceed=
ings the page limit of 12 pages is firm. A suitable document template for L=
aTeX can be found at:

http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

Authors submit through EasyChair:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Difl2015

Topics

IFL welcomes submissions describing practical and theoretical work as well =
as submissions describing applications and tools in the context of function=
al programming. If you are not sure whether your work is appropriate for IF=
L 2015, please contact the PC chair at rlaemmel@acm.org. Topics of interest=
 include, but are not limited to:

- language concepts
- type systems, type checking, type inferencing
- compilation techniques
- staged compilation
- run-time function specialization
- run-time code generation
- partial evaluation
- (abstract) interpretation
- metaprogramming
- generic programming
- automatic program generation
- array processing
- concurrent/parallel programming
- concurrent/parallel program execution
- embedded systems
- web applications
- (embedded) domain specific languages
- security
- novel memory management techniques
- run-time profiling performance measurements
- debugging and tracing
- virtual/abstract machine architectures
- validation, verification of functional programs
- tools and programming techniques
- (industrial) applications

Peter Landin Prize

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the sympos=
ium every year. The honored article is selected by the program committee ba=
sed on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize ca=
rries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
