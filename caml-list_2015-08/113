Only since you ask: "disambiguates" :o) That said, it's quite common to see=
 words like "disambiguises" being invented by Americans!

But this isn't related to the disambiguation features of OCaml 4.01+. Those=
 allow you to write things like:

type t =3D {x : int}
type u =3D {x : int; y : string}

let foo =3D {x =3D 1}
let bar =3D {x =3D 42; y =3D ""}

This is actually a much older notation added in OCaml 3.08. Prior to that, =
if you hadn't opened a module you had to qualify each label:

{M.x =3D 1; M.y =3D y; M.z =3D depth}

but this was "silly", since it's not possible to use non-equivalent module =
paths for labels, so OCaml 3.08 changed it so that you only needed to put t=
he module path on one label (and it doesn't have to be the first one, it's =
just a bit weird to put it in the middle!).

OCaml 3.12 added, amongst other record-related goodies, the shorthand {y} t=
o mean {y =3D y}. So while you can use local open as you're using it, you'v=
e been able to do it as a totally unambiguous language feature for quite so=
me time.
