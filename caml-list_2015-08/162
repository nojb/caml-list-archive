*** Final Call for Posters & Demos and Doctoral Symposium ***

8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud
Computing (UCC 2015)

December 07-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/ucc2015

*** EXTENDED DEADLINE: 7 September, 2015 ***


CONTEXT AND SCOPE

Cloud Computing delivers computational resources on-demand as services
that are commoditized and delivered analogous to traditional utilities such=
 as
electricity, gas, water and telephony. Cloud service offerings for compute,
storage and communication resources as well as for hosted software and data
are growing at a tremendous rate, and it is essential to understand how to
effectively transform these services into Utilities that provide value to b=
oth
users and providers. There is also increasing interest from commercial
providers to offer business and revenue models around the services they
offer. Understanding how these models could be used to provide utility for
users, intermediary brokers (aggregators) and providers is also an area of
active research. UCC is the premier IEEE/ACM conference covering all areas
related to Cloud Computing as a Utility and provides an international forum
for leading researchers and practitioners in this important and growing fie=
ld.
UCC 2015, to be held in Cyprus, will happen as Cloud providers worldwide
add new services and increase Cloud utility at an accelerated pace, and Clo=
ud
service users explore new usage modes.

This will be the 8th UCC in a successful conference series. Previous events
were held in Shanghai, China (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010
& UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden,
Germany (UCC2013), and London, UK (UCC 2014).

published by the IEEE Computer Society and will be made available online
through the IEEE Digital Library.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES FOR POSTERS & DEMOS

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished research posters and
demos to the UCC 2015 conference. The submission areas of interest
include but are not limited to the topics listed above.

Authors are required to submit a 2-page short paper describing the
poster/demo content, research, relevance and importance to the cloud
computing community. If accepted, these 2-page short papers will be
published in the proceedings of the conference. Participants will be able to
display the poster and showcase the demo during the conference. Authors
are invited to submit their contributions electronically through EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ducc2015posters

The authors of accepted posters will be given a 3-minutes time slot to
present their work, following the three minutes thesis (3MT) style, at the
UCC 2015 Poster Session. The authors will also present their posters and
discuss their research with the conference attendees and visitors in the
poster exhibition session. The recommended poster size is A0
(33.1 x 46.8 in, portrait).

The best poster will receive a best poster award based on evaluation rating
from the Award/Review Committee.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES FOR DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM

The aim of the Doctoral Symposium of UCC 2015 is to provide PhD
students at all stages of their research a supportive environment to
discuss their research proposal, practices and methods, and to promote
networking and collaboration.The Doctoral Symposium is an opportunity
for students to obtain helpful feedback of their research from leading
academics and practitioners in cloud computing technology.

PhD Students are invited to submit new contributions describing their
research. The submission areas of interest include but are not limited to
the topics listed above.

Submissions will be assessed by at least three members of the Program
Committee. They will be evaluated on the basis of their relevance to the
UCC conference series, research potential, and the quality and rigour of
the research methods described.

All contributions must be in IEEE double-column format, available for downl=
oad:

https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.ht=
ml

and should describe, in English, original work that has not been published
or submitted for publication elsewhere. PDF versions of papers should be
submitted electronically via EasyChair, using the link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ducc20150

We solicit three categories of contributions:

=B7 Doctoral Research Papers, maximum 6 pages
=B7 Extended Research Abstracts, maximum 4 pages
=B7 Posters Presentations, maximum 2 pages.


IMPORTANT DATES

=B7 All types of submissions due: 7 September, 2015 (extended deadline!)
=B7 Notification of Acceptance for all types of submission: 18 September, 2=
015
