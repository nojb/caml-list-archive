Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml release roadmap

I can answer two of your points:

I think it's unlikely that multicore support is going to be in a
production-ready state for 4.03, although I may be proven wrong.  It
seems plausible that a beta version of the support will be ready at
that time, however.

Degradation of the performance of code not using the new parallelism
features (but possibly using the existing thread support) is a matter
of serious concern for some users, and best efforts will be made to
minimize or eliminate it.  We will know more on this front in the next
few months.
