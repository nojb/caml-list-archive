                         ======== TFP 2015 ===========

               16th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
                                June 3-5, 2015
                        Inria Sophia Antipolis, France
                           http://tfp2015.inria.fr/


The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see
below). Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised
papers based on the feedback receive at the symposium.  A
post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these
articles for formal publication.

The selected revised papers will be published as a Springer Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (www.springer.com/lncs) volume.

TFP 2015 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming
events. TFP 2015 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take
place on June 2nd.

The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish
Functional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in
   * Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003;
   * Munich (Germany) in 2004;
   * Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005;
   * Nottingham (UK) in 2006;
   * New York (USA) in 2007;
   * Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008;
   * Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009;
   * Oklahoma (USA) in 2010;
   * Madrid (Spain) in 2011;
   * St. Andrews (UK) in 2012;
   * Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013;
   * and in Soesterberg (The Netherlands) in 2014.
For further general information about TFP please see the TFP homepage.
(http://www.tifp.org/).


== INVITED SPEAKERS ==

TFP is pleased to announce talks by the following two invited speakers:

   * Laurence Rideau is a researcher at INRIA and is interested in the
     semantics of programming languages , the formal methods, and the
     verification tools for programs and mathematical proofs.  She
     participated in the beginnings of the Compcert project (certified
     compiler), and is part of the Component Mathematical team in the
     MSR-INRIA joint laboratory, who performed the formalization of the
     Feit-Thompson theorem successfully.

     Thirty years ago, computers barged in mathematics with the famous
     proof of the Four Color Theorem.  Initially limited to simple
     calculation, their role is now expanding to the reasoning whose
     complexity is beyond the capabilities of most humans, as the proof of
     the classification of finite simple groups.  We present our large
     collaborative adventure around the formalization of the Feit-Thompson
     theorem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feit%E2%80%93Thompson_theorem)
     that is a first step to the classification of finite groups
     and that uses a palette of methods and techniques that range from
     formal logic to software (and mathematics) engineering.

   * Anil Madhavapeddy

== SCOPE ==

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various
routes.  As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles
are solicited in any of these categories:

     Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
     Position Articles: on what new trends should or should not be
     Project Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects
     Evaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project
     Overview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or
experience-oriented.  Applications of functional programming
techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the
symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include:

     Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
     Functional programming in the cloud
     High performance functional computing
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
     Dependently typed functional programming
     Validation and verification of functional programs
     Debugging and profiling for functional languages
     Functional programming in different application areas:
       security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded 
systems,
       global computing, grids, etc.
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages
     Novel memory management techniques
     Program analysis and transformation techniques
     Empirical performance studies
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
     (Embedded) domain specific languages
     New implementation strategies
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of
TFP, please contact the TFP 2015 program chair, Manuel Serrano.


== BEST PAPER AWARDS ==

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper
accepted for the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed
as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for
the best student paper is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the
best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive
both prizes.

== SPONSORS ==

TFP is financially supported by Erlang Solutions.

The program features two invited talks by Laurence Rideau and Anil 
Madhavapeddy
and one comprehensive Dart tutorial by Florian Loitsch.
