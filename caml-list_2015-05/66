Note that the readability benefits of inline records on value-manipulating
code can already be reaped by just using variant constructors with only one
argument, a record. The feature is more of an optimization of the memory
representation of this case (won't matter much for most applications) --
and also, admittedly, the readability of the type declaration. Its future
availability could be taken as a mere encouragement to use this style
already today.
