IFL 2015 - Call for papers

27th SYMPOSIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES - IFL 2015

University of Koblenz-Landau, Koblenz, Germany

In cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN

September 14-16, 2015

http://ifl2015.wikidot.com/

Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively engaged in the implementation and application of functional and function-based programming languages. IFL 2015 will be a venue for researchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation and application of functional languages and function-based programming.

Peer-review

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2015 will use a post-symposium review process to produce the formal proceedings. All participants of IFL2015 are invited to submit either a draft paper or an extended abstract describing work to be presented at the symposium. At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:

http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to make sure they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the draft proceedings distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing in the draft proceedings are not peer-reviewed publications. Hence, publications that appear only in the draft proceedings do not count as publication for the ACM SIGPLAN republication policy. After the symposium, authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to submit a revised full article for the formal review process. From the revised submissions, the program committee will select papers for the formal proceedings considering their correctness, novelty, originality, relevance, significance, and clarity.

Important dates

August 10: Submission deadline draft papers
August 12: Notification of acceptance for presentation
August 14: Early registration deadline
August 21: Late registration deadline
September 7: Submission deadline for pre-symposium proceedings
September 14-16: IFL Symposium
December 1: Submission deadline for post-symposium proceedings
January 15, 2016: Notification of acceptance for post-symposium proceedings
March 1, 2016: Camera-ready version for post-symposium proceedings

Submission details

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended abstracts to be published in the draft proceedings and to present them at the symposium. All contributions must be written in English. Papers must adhere to the standard ACM two columns conference format. For the pre-symposium proceedings we adopt a 'weak' page limit of 12 pages. For the post-symposium proceedings the page limit of 12 pages is firm. A suitable document template for LaTeX can be found at:

http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

Authors submit through EasyChair:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifl2015

Topics

IFL welcomes submissions describing practical and theoretical work as well as submissions describing applications and tools in the context of functional programming. If you are not sure whether your work is appropriate for IFL 2015, please contact the PC chair at rlaemmel@acm.org. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- language concepts
- type systems, type checking, type inferencing
- compilation techniques
- staged compilation
- run-time function specialization
- run-time code generation
- partial evaluation
- (abstract) interpretation
- metaprogramming
- generic programming
- automatic program generation
- array processing
- concurrent/parallel programming
- concurrent/parallel program execution
- embedded systems
- web applications
- (embedded) domain specific languages
- security
- novel memory management techniques
- run-time profiling performance measurements
- debugging and tracing
- virtual/abstract machine architectures
- validation, verification of functional programs
- tools and programming techniques
- (industrial) applications

Peter Landin Prize

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program committee based on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
