The area of Implicit Computational Complexity has grown from several
proposals for using logic and formal methods to provide languages for
complexity-bounded computation (such as polynomial time, polynomial
space or logarithmic space computation). Its aim is to study
computational complexity without reference to external measuring
conditions or particular machine models, but only in terms of language
restrictions or logical/computational principles implying complexity
properties.

We welcome contributions on various aspects of Implicit Computational
Complexity, including (but not exclusively) the following topics:
- types for controlling complexity
- logical systems for implicit computational complexity
- linear logic
- semantics of complexity-bounded computation
- complexity analysis
- rewriting and termination orderings
- interpretation-based methods for implicit complexity
- programming languages for complexity bounded computation
- application of implicit complexity to other programming paradigms
(e.g. imperative or object-oriented languages)
- application of implicit complexity to security

This special issue of Information & Computation follows the informal
workshops on Developments in Implicit Computational Complexity (DICE),
DICE 2014 in Grenoble (http://dice14.tcs.ifi.lmu.de) and DICE 2015 in
London (http://dice15.computing.dundee.ac.uk).

Submission to this special issue is open to everyone, including those
who did not participate in DICE 2014 or DICE 2015.

DICE workshops have been held annually as satellite events of ETAPS:
DICE 2010 in Paphos, DICE 2011 in Saarbr=C3=BCcken, DICE 2012 in Tallinn,
DICE 2013 in Rome, DICE 2014 in Grenoble and DICE 2015 in London.
Previous post-conference publications have appeared in
- Information & Computation for DICE 2011,
- Theoretical Computer Science for DICE 2012 (in press), and
- Information & Computation for DICE 2013 (to appear).
More information on the DICE workshop series is available at:
http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/patrick.baillot/DICE

Information & Computation solicits high quality papers reporting
research results related to the topics mentioned above. All papers must
be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
- Contributions should be submitted electronically to both addresses
<m.gaboardi@dundee.ac.uk> and <schoepp@tcs.ifi.lmu.de>.
- Papers must be in PDF format and be formatted using Elsevier's
elsarticle.cls LaTeX macro package. Formatting instructions
can be found at
http://www.elsevier.com/author-schemas/latex-instructions
- Submissions must be sent to us no later than JULY 1st 2015.
Papers will be processed as soon as they are submitted.
We are aiming for a turnaround of no more than six months.

We encourage authors to look at the author guide at
