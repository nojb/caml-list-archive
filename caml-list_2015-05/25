Subject: [Caml-list] 3rd FMCAD Student Forum

               FMCAD 2015 STUDENT FORUM

FMCAD 2015, the fifteenth conference on the theory and applications of formal 
methods in hardware and system verification, will host the

               3rd FMCAD Student Forum
               (September 28-30, 2015)

providing a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce 
their research to the wider Formal Methods community.

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission Deadline: June 21, 2015
Acceptance notification: July 19, 2015
Forum date: September 28-30, 2015

Details are provided on

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/hunt/FMCAD/FMCAD15/student-forum.shtml

Submissions for the event must be short reports describing research ideas or 
ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must be within the  
scope of FMCAD.  Work, part of which has been previously published, will be 
considered; the novel aspect to be addressed in future work must be clearly 
described in such cases.  All submissions will be reviewed by a select group 
of program committee members.

The event will consist of short presentations by the student authors of each 
accepted submission, and of a poster that will be on display throughout the 
duration of the conference.  Accepted submissions will be listed, with title
and author name, in the event description in the conference proceedings. The 
authors will also have the option to upload their poster and presentation to 
the FMCAD web site.  The best contribution (determined by the committee based
on the quality of the submission and the presentation) will be given public 
recognition and a certificate at the event.

Limited funds will be available for travel assistance for students with 
accepted contributions.

We kindly ask faculty members to help us advertise the event by displaying 
the posters available from the web-page in their departments.

If you have questions, please contact the forum chair Georg Weissenbacher 
(Vienna University of Technology, Austria).
