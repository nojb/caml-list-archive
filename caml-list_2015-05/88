**********************************************************************

ICTAC 2015 will take place at the campus of Universidad Javeriana,
Cali, Colombia during October 29-31, 2015.
The ICTAC conference series aims at bringing together practitioners
and researchers to exchange ideas and experiences addressing
challenges in theoretical aspects of computing as well as in
exploiting
theory through methods and tools for system development.  ICTAC also
aims to promote cooperation between participants and institutions from
developing and industrial countries in research and education.


THEMES AND TOPICS OF PAPERS
Topics of interest include theories of computation and programming,
foundations of software engineering and formal techniques in software
design and verification, as well as  tools that support formal
techniques
for software modeling, system design and verification.


The topical areas of the conference include, but are not limited to
*     Automata theory and formal languages;
*     Principles and semantics of programming languages;
*     Theories of concurrency, mobility and reconfiguration;
*     Logics and their applications;
*     Software architectures, their models, refinement and verification;
*     Relationship between software requirements, models and code;
*     Program static and dynamic analysis and verification;
*     Software specification, refinement, verification and testing;
*     Model checking and theorem proving;
*     Models of object and component systems;
*     Coordination and feature interaction;
*     Integration of theories, formal methods and tools for
engineering computing systems;
*     Service-oriented architectures: models and development methods;
*     Models of concurrency, security, and mobility;
*     Theory of distributed, grid and cloud computing;
*     Real-time, embedded, hybrid and cyber-physical systems;
*     Type and category theory in computer science.

* Camera ready:  Monday, August 3, 2015.


=3D=3D Paper Categories and Format
We call for submissions, related to the above areas and topics,
according to the following three categories:
* Regular papers, with original research contributions;
* Short papers, with original work in progress or with proposals of
new ideas and emerging challenges;
* Tool papers, on original descriptions of tools that support formal
techniques for software modeling, system design, and verification.

Submissions must be written in English and should adhere to the LNCS
format (see http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for
details). Regular papers should not exceed 18 pages.
Short and tool papers should not exceed 10 pages.

Submissions to the colloquium must not have been published or be
concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions
will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field,
technical and presentation quality, as well as their relevance to the
conference.

Submissions not conforming to the above requirements may be rejected
without further consideration.
