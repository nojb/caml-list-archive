CiE 2015:  Call for Participation and Registration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPUTABILITY IN EUROPE 2015: Evolving Computability
Bucharest, Romania
June 29 - July 3
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/


IMPORTANT DATES:
EARLY REGISTRATION DEADLINE: May 20, 2015
Details on the registration: 
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/registration.html
Details on accommodation possibilities: 
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/accommodation.html
(please note the individual deadlines for each variant)

CiE 2015 is the 11-th conference organized by CiE (Computability 
in Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians, 
computer scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested 
in new developments in computability and their underlying 
significance for the real world. Previous meetings have taken 
place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens 
(2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011), 
Cambridge (2012), Milan (2013) and Budapest (2014)

Evolution of the universe, and us within it, invite a parallel 
evolution in understanding. The CiE agenda - fundamental and 
engaged - targets the extracting and developing of computational 
models basic to current challenges. From the origins of life, to 
the understanding of human mentality, to the characterising of 
quantum randomness - computability theoretic questions arise in 
many guises. The CiE community, meeting this year for the first 
time in Bucharest, carries forward the search for coherence, depth 
and new thinking across this rich and vital field of research.

In line with other conferences in this series, CiE 2015 has a broad 
scope and provides a forum for the discussion of theoretical and 
practical issues in Computability with an emphasis on new paradigms 
of computation and the development of their mathematical theory.

We invite everyone who is interested in the topics and program of 
CiE 2015 to register for the conference. Details on the program of 
the conference are given below. The details regarding the registration 
procedure are given at: 
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/registration.html


PROGRAM:

The papers accepted for CiE 2015 can be seen here:
http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/accepted.html

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer 
Verlag, and there will be a best student paper award presented to 
the best paper written solely by students, sponsored by Springer.

INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:

While computer science conferences usually host formal presentations 
based on papers published in a proceedings volume, mathematics 
conferences allow for informal presentations that are prepared very 
shortly before the conference and inform the participants about 
current research and work in progress. So, continuing the tradition 
of past CiE conferences, CiE 2015 hosts a series of informal 
presentations, in addition to the presentations based on the papers 
in the LNCS proceedings volume. These will be soon published on the 
CiE 2015 website. 

ASSOCIATED WORKSHOPS, JUNE 26-28:

http://fmi.unibuc.ro/CiE2015/workshops.html

The Turing Centenary Research Project: Mind, Mechanism and 
Mathematics (MMM 2015), 3rd Workshop - joint with 
Workshop on Computability Theory (WCT 2015), 
June 27-28, 2015 (free registration)

Days of Computer Science (DACS 2015), 2nd Workshop, 
June 26-27, 2015


STILL AVAILABLE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES:

CiE 2015 has received funding from EATCS (European Association for 
Theoretical Computer Science) that allows students who are members 
of EATCS and want to attend CiE 2015 to apply for travel funds or a 
reduction of the early registration fee. Applications for EATCS 
travel grants have to be sent to <cie2015@fmi.unibuc.ro> prior to 
the early registration deadline.
