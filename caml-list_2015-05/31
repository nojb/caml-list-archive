                            Call For Papers

HaPoC 3: Third International Conference for the History and Philosophy 
of Computing

October 8--11, 2015

Pisa, Italy

URL: http://hapoc2015.sciencesconf.org/

The DHST commission for the history and philosophy of computing 
(www.hapoc.org) is happy to announce the third HAPOC conference. The 
seriesaims at creating an interdisciplinary focus on computing, 
stimulating a dialogue between the historical and philosophical 
viewpoints. To this end, the conference hopes to bring together 
researchers interested in the historical developments of computing, as 
well as those reflecting on the sociological and philosophical issues 
springing from the rise and ubiquity of computing machines in the 
contemporary landscape. In the past editions, the conference has 
successfully presented a variety of voices, contributing to the creation 
of a fruitful dialogue between researchers with different backgrounds 
and sensibilities.



For HaPoC 2015 we welcome contributions from historians and philosophers 
of computing as well as from philosophically aware computer scientists 
and mathematicians. Topics include but are not limited to

     History and Philosophy of Computation (interpretation of the 
Church-Turing thesis; models of computation; logical/mathematical 
foundations of computer science; information theory...)
     History and Philosophy of Programming (classes of programming 
languages; philosophical status of programming...)
     History and Philosophy of the Computer (from calculating machines 
to the future of the computer; user interfaces; abstract architectures...)
     History and Epistemology of the use of Computing in the sciences 
(simulation vs. modelisation; computer-assisted proofs; linguistics...)
     Computing and the Arts: historical and conceptual issues 
(temporality in digital art; narration in interactive art work...)
     Social, ethical and pedagogical aspects of Computing (pedagogy of 
computer science; algorithms and copyright; internet, culture, society...)



We cordially invite researchers working in a field relevant to the main 
topics of the conference to submit a short abstract of approximately 200 
words and an extended abstract of at most a 1000 words (references 
included) to the EasyChair conference page.

Abstracts must be written in English and anonymised. Please note that 
the format of uploaded files must be either .pdf or .doc. In order to 
access the submission page, an EasyChair account will be required. 
Please notice that what is called “abstract” in the EasyChair “Title, 
Abstract and Other Information” section corresponds to the short 
abstract of this call, and what is called “paper” in the EasyChair 
“Upload Paper” section corresponds to the extended abstract of this call.

A post-proceedings volume is going to appear in the IFIP Advances in 
Information and Communication Technology series, published by Springer.
