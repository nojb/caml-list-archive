Manpower is one such reason. Also, we like to thoroughly test our
code before we release it. And there are several important features
in the works.

I see it as a rather small feature. It's not in the same league as GADTs
or Modular Implicits, for example.

I know our release schedule is rather slow, but OCaml is a really
complex system and we like to think things through before we
release, and this has already saved us from several bad design
decisions.
