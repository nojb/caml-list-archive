*** Last Call for Workshop Proposals ***

8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud
Computing (UCC 2015)

December 07-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

Co-located with the 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference
on Big Data Computing (BDC 2015)

http://cyprusconferences.org/ucc2015

*** Deadline for submitting workshop proposals: May 8th ***


CONTEXT AND SCOPE

Cloud Computing delivers computational resources on-demand as services
that are commoditized and delivered analogous to traditional utilities such=
 as
electricity, gas, water and telephony. Cloud service offerings for compute,
storage and communication resources as well as for hosted software and data
are growing at a tremendous rate, and it is essential to understand how to
effectively transform these services into Utilities that provide value to b=
oth
users and providers. There is also increasing interest from commercial
providers to offer business and revenue models around the services they
offer. Understanding how these models could be used to provide utility for
users, intermediary brokers (aggregators) and providers is also an area of
active research. UCC is the premier IEEE/ACM conference covering all areas
related to Cloud Computing as a Utility and provides an international forum
for leading researchers and practitioners in this important and growing fie=
ld.
UCC 2015, to be held in Cyprus, will happen as Cloud providers worldwide
add new services and increase Cloud utility at an accelerated pace, and Clo=
ud
service users explore new usage modes.

This will be the 8th UCC in a successful conference series. Previous events
were held in Shanghai, China (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010
& UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden,
Germany (UCC2013), and London, UK (UCC 2014).


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

=B7 Big Data and Analytics

=B7 Principles and theoretical foundations of Utility Computing, including
   pricing and service models

=B7 Policy languages and Programming models

=B7 Utility driven model and mechanisms for Cloud federations

=B7 Autonomic techniques for Clouds and Cloud applications

=B7 Utility-driven platforms for Clouds

=B7 Architectural models to achieve Utility in Clouds

=B7 Designs and deployment models for Clouds: private, public, hybrid,
   federated, aggregated

=B7 Cloud Computing middleware, stacks, tools, delivery networks and
   services at all layers (XaaS)

=B7 Virtualization technologies and other enablers

=B7 Economic models and scenarios of use

=B7 Scalability and resource management: brokering, scheduling, capacity
   planning, parallelism and elasticity, as well as marketplaces

=B7 Cloud management: autonomic, adaptive, self-*, SLAs, performance
   models and monitoring

=B7 Applications: games, social networks, scientific computing (e-science)
   and business

=B7 Mobile and energy-efficient use of Clouds

=B7 Beyond technology: Cloud business and legal implications, such as
   security, privacy, trust and jurisdiction, especially in Utility contexts


WORKSHOP PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

Proposals for workshops should be no more than 2 pages in length and
should contain the following information:

=B7 Title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying the g=
oals
   and the technical issues that will be the focus of the workshop.

=B7 A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest.

=B7 A list of related workshops or similar events held in the last 3 years,=
 or to
   be held in 2015.

=B7 The names and contact information (web page, email address) of the
   proposed technical program committee. This committee should consist
   of at least 10 people knowledgeable about the technical issues to be
   addressed and preferably not more than two members of the same
   institution.

=B7 A description of the qualifications of the organizers (who would be the
   Workshop Chairs) with respect to organizing this workshop. This can
   include papers published in the proposed topic area, previous workshop
   organization, and other relevant information.

=B7 Workshop proposals should be submitted in PDF format by email to the
   workshop chairs by the 8th of May, 2015.


RESPONSIBILITIES

Workshop chair(s) will be responsible for the following:

=B7 Producing a web page and a "Call for Papers/Participation" for their
   workshop. The URL should be sent to the UCC Workshops chairs. The call
   must make it clear that the workshop is open to all members of the Cloud,
   Big Data, Grid and Cluster Computing community. It should mention that
   at least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop
   and that all workshop participants must pay the UCC 2015 workshop
   day or conference registration fee. The CfP should make it clear that the
   registration of at least one author requires the full (non-student, non-
   workshop) rate.

=B7 Ensure that all workshop papers are a maximum of 6 pages in length (in
   IEEE format). It is the responsibility of the workshop organizers to ens=
ure
   that this page limit has been adhered to. Additional pages may be
   purchased (in some circumstances) subject to approval by the proceedings
   chairs.

=B7 Provide a brief description of the workshop for the conference web page
   and program.

=B7 Selecting the participants and the format of the workshop. The publicat=
ion
   of proceedings will be by the IEEE in the same volume as the main
   conference. The acceptance notification (by workshop chairs) therefore
   should be the same as the conference paper acceptance notification (i.e.=
 the
   dates should be the same). All other details can be up to workshop
   organizers to set.

=B7 Advertising the workshop beyond the conference web page.

=B7 Assistance in producing a camera-ready version of the workshop
   proceedings.


IMPORTANT NOTE

If the workshop is too small (i.e. does not attract enough submissions) the
UCC 2015 Organizing Committee may decide to merge that workshop with
another. So we encourage workshop organizers to attract a large community.
In extreme situations we may also cancel workshops if there are not enough
submissions.

Workshop organizers must ensure that suitable quality measures have been
taken to ensure that the accepted papers are of high quality. All papers mu=
st
be reviewed by an International Technical Program Committee with a
minimum of 3 reviews per paper. The workshop organizers should also try
to observe an acceptance rate that is no higher than 50%.

Unless indicated on the UCC website, there will be no travel support and
no registration discounts for authors and organizers.

Workshops are not automatically endorsed by IEEE or ACM and should not
use the names of these organisations in their titles.

The UCC 2015 Conference Organizing Committee will be responsible for the
following:

=B7 Providing a link to a workshop's local page.

=B7 Providing logistics support and a meeting place for the workshop.

=B7 In conjunction with the organizers, determining the workshop date and
   time.

=B7 Providing copies of the workshop proceedings to attendees.


IMPORTANT DATES

=B7 Workshop proposals due: 08 May, 2015
=B7 Notification of workshop proposals: 22 May 2015
