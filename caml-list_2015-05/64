            Call for Papers and Demos : FARM 2015

           The 3rd ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on
           Functional Art, Music, Modelling and Design

            Vancouver, Canada, 5 September, 2015
                affiliated with ICFP 2015

                    http://functional-art.org

EXTENTED Submission Deadline : 27 May, 2015
(optional abstract submission : 17 May, 2015)

************************************************************

The ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
Modelling and Design (FARM) gathers together people who are harnessing
functional techniques in the pursuit of creativity and expression.

Functional Programming has emerged as a mainstream software
development paradigm, and its artistic and creative use is booming. A
growing number of software toolkits, frameworks and environments for
art, music and design now employ functional programming languages and
techniques. FARM is a forum for exploration and critical evaluation of
these developments, for example to consider potential benefits of
greater consistency, tersity, and closer mapping to a problem domain.

FARM encourages submissions from across art, craft and design,
including textiles, visual art, music, 3D sculpture, animation, GUIs,
video games, 3D printing and architectural models, choreography,
poetry, and even VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. The language used need not be purely functional
(=93mostly functional=94 is fine), and may be manifested as a domain
specific language or tool. Theoretical foundations, language design,
implementation issues, and applications in industry or the arts are
all within the scope of the workshop.

Submissions are invited in two categories:

 * Full papers

   5 to 12 pages using the ACM SIGPLAN template. FARM 2015 is an
   interdisciplinary conference, so a wide range of approaches are
   encouraged and we recognize that the appropriate length of a paper
   may vary considerably depending on the approach. However, all
   submissions must propose an original contribution to the FARM
   theme, cite relevant previous work, and apply appropriate research
   methods.


 * Demo abstracts

   Demo abstracts should describe the demonstration and its context,
   connecting it with the themes of FARM. A demo could be in the form
   of a short (10-20 minute) tutorial, presentation of
   work-in-progress, an exhibition of some work, or even a
   performance. Abstracts should be no longer than 2 pages, using the
   ACM SIGPLAN template and will be subject to a light-touch peer
   review.

If you have any questions about what type of contributions that might
be suitable, or anything else regarding submission or the workshop
itself, please contact the organisers at:

   farm-2015@easychair.org
