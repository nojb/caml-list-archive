Subject: [Caml-list] LPAR-20 in Fiji - Call for Papers and Workshops


                The 20th International Conference on
    Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning
                             LPAR-20

               University of the Pacific, Suva, Fiji
                       http://www.LPAR-20.org

                    CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOPS

The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning,
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 20th LPAR
will be held at the University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji in 2015
(see dates below).

== Topics

New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome.
Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open
questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
+ Abduction and interpolation methods
+ Automated reasoning
+ Constraint programming
+ Decision procedures
+ Description logics
+ Foundations of security
+ Hardware verification
+ Implementations of logic
+ Interactive theorem proving
+ Knowledge representation and reasoning
+ Logic and computational complexity
+ Logic and databases
+ Logic and games
+ Logic and machine learning
+ Logic and the web
+ Logic and types
+ Logic in artificial intelligence
+ Logic of distributed systems
+ Logic programming
+ Logical aspects of concurrency
+ Logical foundations of programming
+ Modal and temporal logics
+ Model checking
+ Non-monotonic reasoning
+ Ontologies and large knowledge bases
+ Probabilistic and fuzzy reasoning
+ Program analysis
+ Rewriting
+ Satisfiability checking
+ Satisfiability modulo theories
+ Software verification
+ Specification using logic
+ Unification theory

== Submission Details

Submissions of two kinds are welcome:

- Regular papers  that describe solid new research results. They can be up to
  15 pages long in LNCS style, including figures and references, but excluding
  appendices (that reviewers are not required to read).

- Experimental and tool papers that describe implementations of systems, report
  experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems. They
  can be up to 8 pages long in the LNCS style.

Both types of papers must be electronically submitted in PDF via EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar20

== Participation

Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract a week
before the paper submission deadline (see below). Authors of accepted papers 
are required to ensure that at least one of them will be present at the 
conference. More details about the venue and organisation can be found on the
conference website.

== Important Dates

Abstract Submission: 30 June
Paper Submission: 7 July
Notification: 23 August
Workshops: 23 November
Conference: 24-28 November
