Subject: [Caml-list] Two years R&D engineer position available in Computer
 Science & Arts,  Bordeaux, France

Inria Bordeaux opens a R&D engineer position in the PoSET research project,=
 located at LaBRI, Bordeaux, France

Object: research and development on new modeling and programing methods for=
 realtime computerized artistic systems.

Duration: two years from Autumn 2015.

Where : Inria Bordeaux/CNRS LaBRI, within the research project PoSET.

Salary: from 2000 to 2500 Euros monthly netto (including health insurance) =
depending on candidate qualification.

Keywords: functional programing (Haskell or Ocaml), reactive programming, r=
eal-time system, graphical modeling, computational music, science and arts.

More details below. To apply, send CV and motivation letter to David Janin,=
 david.janin@labri.fr

*********************
** Research Context

The Inria research project PoSET is a new research team in Bordeaux with fo=
ur permanent researchers and at least as many PhD students. It aims at deve=
loping a new approach to the design, implementation and execution of comple=
x interactive media systems such as augmented musical pieces or interactive=
 museographic installations. It aims in particular at developing the notion=
 of tiled temporal media, a mathematically well-defined and rich model of t=
emporal media, with a clean and efficient implementation of this model in t=
he functional programming language Haskell. The resulting software platform=
 should offer uniform, robust and easy-to-use tools for the homogeneous cap=
ture, transformation and production of heterogeneous temporal media: music,=
 video, animation, etc.

** Mission

Within the PoSET research and development team, the engineer will be the ma=
in developer of the project. His task will consists in developing consolida=
ted versions of the existing programming modules and the current on-the-fly=
 rendering kernel. Further developments, to be designed in collaboration wi=
th researchers and artists, will include interactive extensions of the rend=
ering kernel, graphic modeling extensions based on higher dimensional tiles=
, and various domain-specific libraries (audio, music, video, control). His=
 task will also include technical assistance to artists in residence creati=
ng artistic systems.

** Profile

Master degree / engineering diploma in Computer Science
- Creative and highly motivated
- Solid programming skills in functional programming (Haskell, Ocaml)
- Prior exposure to Human-Machine Interface and Computational Music would b=
e a bonus
- Language requirements: fluent spoken English or French and fluent written=
 English

** Environment

Hired by Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest, the engineer will be located within CNRS=
 LaBRI in the lively city of Bordeaux which hosts many foreign students and=
 researchers. Located in the heart of one of the most famous wine region of=
 France, the direct surrounding of Bordeaux offers great outdoor recreation=
 including surfing, sailing and cycling. The Pyrenees mountains (hiking, cl=
imbing and skiing) can be reached from Bordeaux in 3h by car. Paris can be =
reached from Bordeaux in 3h by train.

** About Inria:

=AB Established in 1967, Inria is the only public research body fully dedic=
ated to computational sciences. Combining computer sciences with mathematic=
s, Inria=92s 3,500 researchers strive to invent the digital technologies of=
 the future. Educated at leading international universities, they creativel=
y integrate basic research with applied research and dedicate themselves to=
 solving real problems, collaborating with the main players in public and p=
rivate research in France and abroad and transferring the fruits of their w=
ork to innovative companies. The researchers at Inria published over 4,500 =
articles in 2013. They are behind over 300 active patents and 120 start-ups=
. The 172 project teams are distributed in eight research centers located t=
hroughout France. =BB
