Such errors usually indicate a linking problem: something was not
linked in or was not found. In fact, this specific error is emitted in
the following four cases:

  >   Undefined_global of string
  > | Unavailable_primitive of string
  > | Wrong_vm of string
  > | Uninitialized_global of string

I think the most likely problem was Undefined_global: that is, the
generated code you run depends on some .cmo file, which could not be
located. All needed .cmo files should either be in the current
directory, the standard library directory, or the directories you
specifically add to the search path of the evaluator. There is a
special function in the Runcode module that lets you set the search
path. For an example, please see the file
        metalib/test/test_path.ml
in the MetaOCaml distribution.
