Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release roadmap

Dear OCaml users,

We are now preparing release 4.02.2, mostly a bug-fix release with a
few new features. We are planning to release it in the first week of
June (about 1 month from now). If you want to try a preview, get it:
  - from github: < https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/4.02 > (don't
forget to switch to branch 4.02 after cloning)
  - through OPAM: opam switch 4.02.0+trunk (watch out for the misnomer)
If you find bugs, please report them as quickly as possible.

As for the next major release, it will include a number of new
features (including, if all goes well, support for multicore). It will
be released some time around the end of this year.
