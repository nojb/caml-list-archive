Is there some convenient way to set up a makefile so that it will
ensure that foo.cmi is generated (or re-generated) before foo.cmo or
foo.cmx?  

Not being a magician of `make', I didn't see an easy way to express
the conditional on there existing a foo.mli file.  Of course, in the
ideal case one would actually see whether it was possible to make
foo.mli, e.g. from foo.mly.

Thanks.
