This is reasonable. Indeed, the Filename standard library module
defines the equivalent of strrchr for its internal usage.

Str.split (from the OCaml regexp library) is strictly more powerful
than strtok, since it supports arbitrary regexps as delimiters.

When programming in C, I've never found scanf() very useful. It does
not allow enough flexibility in defining the scanning syntax.
I'd rather scan lines the Perl way, using regular expressions
(Str.string_match + extraction of \(...\) components using
Str.matched_string and conversion to int or float if needed).
