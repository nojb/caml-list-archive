In my experience, nested modules are not very useful in (O)CAML because you
cannot have a recursive definition cross a module boundary, and I find that
I quite often have mutual dependencies between sets of definitions whose
namespaces I would nevertheless like to separate.

I suspect that the reason package nesting in Java works so well is partly
due to the fact that recursion, etc. is hardly ever used.

On the other hand, SML seems to use module nesting quite freely, though,
and as far as I know it has the same restrictions on module dependencies...
