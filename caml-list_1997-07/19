I don't think this will work, since mletags relies on parsing of .ml and
.mli files to extract symbols. (*tags programs for other languages generally
use regexps and ad-hoc strategies, but this is a bit weak for Caml.)

I started writing the skeleton program for ocamletags, but was too lazy to 
fill-in the blanks (eg. the zillion of mutually recursive functions to walk
an AST and extract the "binder" global symbols). I can send this incomplete
piece of code to anyone feeling impatient.
