Frequently when compiling a file foo.ml files with ocamlopt
on a Sun Sparc, I get a message like:

	I/O error: foo.cmi: No such file or directory

Note that it's complaining about the .cmi file for the
file currently being compiled, not some other module.

I can usually workaround this problem by removing any
.cmi and .mli files, running ocamlc -c on foo.ml,
and then rerunning ocamlopt.  This strategy is 
haphazard, though, because I don't know what the
true cause of the problem is.

How can I avoid the error to begin with?
