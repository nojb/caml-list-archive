The latest release of Objective Caml (1.05) supports the

        # linenum "filename"

directive (same format as the directives emitted by the C
preprocessor). It has not been tested extensively yet, but if it works
well and there is interest, we might fold it back into Caml Light later.

This should work pretty well as long as you're careful about copying
whole lines from the .nw file to the generated .ml file.
