You would expect to see some calls to caml_call_gc from functions in 
David's code (statistically, some allocations triggering gc would come 
from the user code).

So just <spontaneous> for the whole thing is very suspicious, especially 
for long-running code - see all the 1/4988 etc. lines in my original 
example.
