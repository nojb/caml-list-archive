Thank-you Oleg, for limiting my hunt for a red-herring. :) I only looked
through the web-svn changes to 3.12.1 and nothing stood out as a
problematic change... I should have installed 3.12.1 to try it out.

With 4.00.0 (and this is a new machine with no prior installs) I pulled the
corresponding files from 4.0 source into an ocaml-byterun-4.00 directory,
and the native test segfaults. Just now I tried pointing to the 3.11
directory and it also segfaults. I expect going to 4.x there's been a
change of some significance for delimcc.

I'm not using GADTs or other 4.x features yet, and delimcc is more
important to me -- so I'm happy enough using 3.12 while casually prodding
at delimcc+4.x.

 -Tony

P.S. Thanks for the nifty gadgets! (I keep eyeing metaocaml too...)

If you have several versions of OCaml on your system, it could be that<br>
delimcc&#39;s Makefile picks a wrong version (inconsistent with<br>
