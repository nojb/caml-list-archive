Thanks for the compliment.

To my defence, my main programming goal because of my employer
and colleagues is to deliver fast and correct (software) in order to 
investigate research ideas.
We don't deliver libraries or things targeting at a wide developer
audience (we don't do research in computer science, also).

I don't have any problem reading my code.
It reads like an English text usually.

functions/types that are local to a module and those that are used by 
other part of the program is immensely useful.

Well, if I want to know this, I change the function parameters
and let the compiler tell me where it was used with the initial parameters.
I also quite know my swiss knives (egrep and co).

OK, so you too are a top-down design practitioner
and use .mli files to this end.

Thanks,
