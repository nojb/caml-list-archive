Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml Labs

Hi,

Since the topic of package managers has been started, I'd like to
stress a few things about yypkg which I write.

Yypkg is a dumb binary package manager which works everywhere OCaml,
bsdtar and xz work. It doesn't care about what is inside packages, it
works in any directory (not only /), and it's meant for developers
more than for admins (it doesn't try [yet] to provide safe upgrade
paths for the whole universe).

As for other features of yypkg, it's very fast with very small
packages and the core code is only 500 lines of OCaml, comments
included.

That said, for other package managers, you also need to compare what
they're aiming at. Godi is a full-fledge system, odb.ml has a way
smaller scope. I don't know enough about OPAM to comment on it.

As for the library you'd be writing, please, please, forget about
specific package managers when writing it! You only need a few things:
don't make your own build system but use a well-known one and use
pkg-config if it's C/C++ or ocamlfind if it's OCaml. Nothing more.
