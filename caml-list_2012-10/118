Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Compiler can't find a stub anymore

Answering my own question for my old days:
the problem was that parmap library was not compiled with -custom
while it's META file does not set any linkopts. I fixed it using
-custom since I find it easier, but I wonder what's the prefered
way to add these link flags between custom or linkopts?

BTW, I couldn't find where to add -custom in ocamlbuild. Hopefully
parmap wraps ocamlbuild into Makefile so I could work around it. Any doc
on how to add -custom flag?  I tried with -lflag but for some reason the
flag was also added to ocamlopt invocations.

Anyway, much ado about nothing as usual.
