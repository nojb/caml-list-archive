Subject: Re: [Caml-list] opam update failing

On a side note, I was very surprised when an 'opam upgrade' didn't
actually bring me to the latest versions of everything.  Specifically
all of the jane st stuff was an older version than the latest.  I
ended up wiping my entire opam, "opam remove" was not working for me
either, and starting from scratch, which worked.  I'm sure that makes
sense for someone that knows opam but I found it counter intuitive.
