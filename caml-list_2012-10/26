          ------            SR 2013            -----
*****************************************************************

First International Workshop on Strategic Reasoning
Rome, Italy, March 16th-17th, 2013

http://www.strategicreasoning.net/


      **********************************************************
      |       PRELIMINARY   CALL   FOR   CONTRIBUTIONS         |
      **********************************************************


OBJECTIVES

Strategic reasoning is one of the most active research area in multi-agent
system domain. The literature in this field is extensive and provides a
plethora of logics for modeling strategic ability.
Theoretical results are now being used in many exciting domains, including
software tools for information system security, robot teams with
sophisticated adaptive strategies, and automatic players capable of
beating expert human adversary, just to cite a few. All these examples
share the challenge of developing novel theories and tools for agent
strategies that take into account the likely behavior of adversaries.

The SR international workshop aims to bring together researchers working
on different aspects of strategic reasoning in computer science, both from
a theoretical and a practical point of view.


LIST OF TOPICS

The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to, the
following:

- Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities
- Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis
- Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems
- Strategic reasoning in formal verification
- Automata theory for strategy synthesis
- Strategic reasoning under perfect and imperfect information
- Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning
- Robust planning and optimization in multi-agent systems
- Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems
- Quantitative aspects in strategic reasonings


CO-LOCATED EVENT

SR 2013 is an ETAPS 2013 workshop.
ETAPS 2013 will be held on March 16th-24th, 2013.


INVITED SPEAKERS

- Krishnendu Chatterjee (IST Austria)
- Alessio R. Lomuscio (Imperial College London)
- Jean-Francois Raskin (Université Libre de Bruxelles)
- Michael Wooldridge (University of Oxford)


PAPER SUBMISSION

Submitted papers should not exceed five pages using EPTCS format
(http://style.eptcs.org).
If necessary, the paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix,
which will be consulted at the discretion of the programme committee.

Submissions must be in PDF format and will be handled via EasyChair
( https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2013 ).

Two types of submission are invited:

- Papers reporting on novel research, and

- Expository papers reporting on published work.

Each submission should be clearly identified as belonging to one category
or the other. In both categories, strong preference will be given to
papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, and
all papers should be written so that they are accessible to such an
audience.

Novel research abstracts will be held to the usual high standards of novel
research publications. In particular, they should

1) contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify
the main contribution of the work;

2) explain the significance of the work its novelty and its practical or
theoretical implications; and

3) include comparisons with and references to relevant literature.

Expository abstracts, which will be held to similarly high standards, may
survey an area or report on a more specific previously published work; the
submission should make clear the relevance to the strategic reasoning
audience.
Papers accepted for presentation (in both categories) will be collected as
an EPTCS volume.
Submissions from PC members are also allowed.
Note that, as we accept short papers, extended versions of the accepted
works could be also submitted elsewhere.


IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission:     December 15, 2012
Paper submission:        December 20, 2012
Acceptance notification: January 17, 2013
Final version:           January 31, 2013
Workshop:                March 16-17, 2013


PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings will be published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical
Computer Science.
A special issue of a major international journal to publish an extended
and revised version of the best workshop papers is also under
consideration.
