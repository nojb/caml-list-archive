Subject: [Caml-list] EXTENDED DEADLINE: Program Protection and Reverse
 Engineering Workshop (PPREW '13)

CALL FOR PAPERS (Extended Submission Deadline: 11 October)

2nd ACM SIGPLAN Program Protection and Reverse Engineering Workshop (PPREW
2013)
Co-Located with Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2013)
Parco dei Principi Hotel, Rome, Italy
January 26, 2013
http://www.pprew.org

Sponsored by the Digital Asset Protection Association (DAPA)

Important Dates:
***********************
Paper Submission:  October 11, 2012
Author Notification: November 1, 2012
Camera Ready: November 13, 2012

Workshop Aims:
***************
Program protection and reverse engineering are dualisms of good and evil.
Beneficial uses of reverse engineering abound: malicious software needs to be
analyzed and understood in order to prevent their spread and to assess their
functional footprint; owners of intellectual property (IP) at times need to
recover lost or unmaintained designs. Conversely, malicious reverse
engineering allows illegal copying and subversion and designers can employ
obfuscation and tamper-proofing on IP to target various attack vectors. In
this sense, protecting IP and protecting malware from detection and analysis
is a double-edged sword: depending on the context, the same techniques are
either beneficial or harmful. Likewise, tools that deobfuscate malware in good
contexts become analysis methods that support reverse engineering for illegal
activity.
PPREW invites papers on practical and theoretical approaches for program
protection and reverse engineering used in beneficial contexts, focusing on
analysis/deobfuscation of malicious code and methods/tools that hinder reverse
engineering. Ongoing work with preliminary results, theoretical approaches,
tool-based methods, and empirical studies on various methods are all
appropriate. Studies on either hardware/circuit based methods or software/
assembly based mechanisms are within scope of the workshop. We expect the
workshop to provide exchange of ideas and support for cooperative
relationships among researchers in industry and academia.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following.

- Obfuscation / Deobfuscation
- Tamper-proofing / Hardware-based protection
- Theoretical proofs for exploitation or protection
- Software watermarking / Digital fingerprinting
- Reverse engineering tools and techniques
- Side channel analysis and vulnerability mitigation
- Program / circuit slicing
- Information hiding and discovery
- Theoretical analysis frameworks:
  o Abstract Interpretation
  o Term Rewriting Systems
  o Machine Learning
  o Large Scale Boolean Matching
- Component / Functional Identification
- Program understanding
- Source code (static/dynamic) analysis techniques

Best Paper Awards:
**********************
There will be a best paper award to acknowledge the scientific quality of the
best contribution.

Workshop Keynote Addresses:
