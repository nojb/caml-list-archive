Subject: [Caml-list] Re: ocaml 3.12.1 and delimcc


It so happened that I had to upgrade to amd64 (Intel Core 2) last
week. I have installed FreeBSD 9.0 from scratch and OCaml 3.12.1 
from ports. I have just recompiled delimcc. All tests passed,
both for byte-code and the native compiler.

I'm really not sure what the reported problem might be. I have used
the following line in delimcc's Makefile
	OCAMLINCLUDES=./ocaml-byterun-3.11
That OCAMLINCLUDES worked with 3.12.0 (and with 3.12.1, it seems). I'm
not sure if it works with 4.x though.

Could you check your Makefile? Could you check that 
	$(LIBDIR)/Makefile.config
has sane values, where
	LIBDIR := $(shell ocamlc -where)
If you have several versions of OCaml on your system, it could be that
delimcc's Makefile picks a wrong version (inconsistent with
OCAMLINCLUDES). Such an inconsistency could certainly cause a
segfault.
