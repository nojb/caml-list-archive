----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CiE 2013 is the ninth conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe),
a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists,
philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in
computability and their underlying significance for the real world. Previous
meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007),
Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponte Dalgada (2010), Sofia (2011) and
Cambridge (2012). Please mark the conference dates in your agendas for 2013.

=A0The Nature of Computation is meant to emphasize the special focus of CiE
2013 on the unexpected and strong changes that studies on Nature have
brought in several areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science.
Starting from Alan Turing, research on Nature with a computational
perspective has produced novel contributions, giving rise even to new
disciplines.

=A0Two complementary research perspectives pervade the Nature of Computation
=A0theme. One is focused on the understanding of new computational paradigms
=A0inspired by the processes occurring in the biological world, while focus=
ing
=A0on a deeper and modern understanding of the theory of computation.

=A0The other perspective is on our understanding of how computations really
=A0occur in Nature, on how we can interact with those computations, and on
=A0their applications.

=A0The conference will address all these aspects besides the more establish=
ed
=A0lines of research of Computational Complexity and the interplay between
=A0Proof Theory and Computation.

=A0Novel views that rely on physical and biological processes and models to
=A0find new ways of tackling computations and improving their efficiency are
=A0welcome. =A0Also, massive data analysis and computations are a recent su=
bject
=A0of attention, since the most recent technologies produce huge amounts of
=A0data, and managing such data requires some theoretical frameworks.

=A0In all cases we are looking for fundamental and theoretical submissions.=
 In
=A0line with other conferences in this series, CiE 2013 has a broad scope a=
nd
=A0provides a forum for the discussion of theoretical and practical issues =
in
=A0Computability with an emphasis on new paradigms of computation and the
=A0development of their mathematical theory.

=A0We particularly invite papers that build bridges between different parts=
 of
=A0the research community.

=A0The PROGRAMME COMMITTEE consists of:

=A0 =A0 =A0Gerard Alberts (Amsterdam)
=A0 =A0 =A0Luis Antunes (Porto)
=A0 =A0 =A0Arnold Beckmann (Swansea)
=A0 =A0 =A0Laurent Bienvenu (Paris)

=A0In a Call for Papers to be sent out in October 2012, the PC will invite =
all
=A0researchers in the area of the conference to submit their papers for
=A0presentation at CiE 2013. The best of the accepted papers will be publis=
hed
=A0in the conference proceedings within the Lecture Notes in Computer Scien=
ce
=A0(LNCS) series of Springer, which will be available at the conference.
