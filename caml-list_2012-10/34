This is actually correct behaviour, although OPAM could explain its
reasoning to the user better.

The latest JSC packages (108.07.00+) introduced a backwards-incompatible
API change in type_conv.  Type_conv is very commonly used by third-party
packages such as OASIS (via ODN) and would break if compiled against the
newest version.

Luckily, OPAM supports constraints on the package versions that let it
figure out a workable strategy, which in this case will use the older
version of type_conv.  Since the Core suite has an exact dependency on
type_conv, this will also pin the rest of Core and Async to that older
version.

I've been patching a few of the type_conv packages to support the newer
API, and once these are merged [1], an 'opam upgrade' should recompile
your packages up to the latest version.
