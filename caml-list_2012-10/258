Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Why should I use .mli files?

They are good for documentation.  Most projects don't fit in one human head=
, at any one moment.  When you approach code that is new to you or that you=
 forgot, it is helpful to know which are the important bits.  MLI files are=
 one good mechanism to point to the important parts of a big module.  I rea=
d MLI files like this: "Out of these 60 functions you are most likely to ne=
ed these 3."

If an MLI file is big, then it fails to identify the important parts.  Thos=
e big MLI files are also annoying to maintain.  So, just don't write big ML=
I files.  The one case where MLIs tend to be big is when the module include=
s many type declarations.  In that case you can often pull out all type dec=
larations into a separate ML file, which you *don't* pair up with an MLI fi=
le.

On a more advanced level, you need interfaces when you mess around with fun=
ctors.  But, playing with functors in OCaml feels a bit like playing with t=
emplates in C++ or with Arrows in Haskell: more seductive than productive.
