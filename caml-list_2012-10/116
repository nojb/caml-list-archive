Adrien's message has explained very well the problem : it makes it
impossible to upgrade all installed copies of a library when it
becomes necessary. This is particularly bad when there is a security
problem with a certain version of a library. In other words, using
custom copies of libraries may be easier at the moment, but it
is not sustainable in the long run.

That depends on the kind of version constraints that your packaging system
allows for, and how you use them when you build a package for your 
application. Debian gives you the choice of version constraints
(<<, <=, >>, >=, ==, !=), and I imagine other packaging system do the
same. It is up to the packager to use the constraints that fit the best
for his case (or use the right tools that generate these).

Cheers -Ralf.
