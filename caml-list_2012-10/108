Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml Labs

Again, I want to stress that my message was not intended to be a
superficial and uninformed critics to OPAM.

[16 minutes later]

I just watched Thomas's talk and I admit there are many very good
ideas, OPAM is in my TODO list now :-)

This is a very high profile goal, I hoped OASIS was that "integrated
whole" you are speaking about. My wish is to see a more connected and
collaborative OCaml community, where the limitations of a "system" are
solved by contribution, rather than writing another, possibly better,
system. That's why I was scared by OPAM when I read Yaron's post.

A question: can OPAM live in peace with odb.ml or GODI? In this moment
my environment is built with GODI (for compiler and major libraries)
and what is not present in GODI is installed with odb.ml, which
installs everything in ~/.odb, no conflict with /opt/godi/... Can I
say to OPAM to ignore a dependency, for example can I install an OPAM
package which depends on Batteries, while Batteries installed with
GODI?
