Say you have a 1MLOC .ml(a) that uses something from 100LOC one(b), if you
do not use .mli then every time (b) is touched not only (a) but also (b)
must be recompiled, in .mli case however (a) will be rebuilt only when
the public interface changes. So .mli is a good way to keep separate 
compilation useful. However this (in general) only applies to the bytecode
compiler (ocamlopt uses .cmx files for inlining, making it necessary
to play build system games if one cares more about compile rather than
run time).
