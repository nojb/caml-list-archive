CALL FOR PAPERS

**********************************************************************
10th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2013)

June 10 - 14, 2013 - Turku, Finland
http://www.it.abo.fi/iFM2013/

**********************************************************************

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
Applying formal methods may involve the modeling of different aspects
of a system that are expressed through different paradigms.
Correspondingly, different analysis techniques will be used to examine
differently modeled system views, different kinds of properties, or
simply in order to cope with the sheer complexity of the system.
The iFM conference series seeks to further research into hybrid
approaches to formal modeling and analysis; i.e., the combination of
(formal and semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding
modeling and analysis, and covering all aspects from language design
through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their
integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

- Formal and semiformal modelling notations;
- Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice;
- Refinement;
- Theorem proving;
- Tools;
- Logics;
- Model checking;
- Model transformations;
- Semantics;
- Static Analysis;
- Type Systems;
- Verification;
- Case Studies;
- Experience reports


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
iFM 2013 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or
experience reports related to the overall theme of method integration.=20
The conference proceedings will be published by Springer Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series. All papers must be original, unpublished,
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions must be
in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; we suggest to use
the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, available in llncs2e.zip=20
and the typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip as a template for your
contribution). Submissions should be made using the iFM 2013 Easychair=20
web site. Papers should not exceed 15 pages in length. Each paper will
undergo a thorough review process.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their
authors must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement.
At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the
conference by the early date indicated by the organizers, and
present the paper.


IMPORTANT DATES
Abstract Submission: January 10, 2013
Paper submission: January 17, 2013
Paper notification: March 11, 2013
Final version paper: March 31, 2013

To celebrate the 10th edition of the iFM conference, we will
extend the event in the following two directions:
- We are currently negotiating the publishing of extended
versions of the best papers in a formal methods journal,
after the conference. This will mark the maturity and
significance of the conference theme.
- The iFM conference will be accompanied by two days of
workshops and tutorials. The conference will take place during
12-14.6.2013 and the tutorials and workshops right before it,
during 10-11.6.2013.
