                          CALL FOR PAPERS 

                           *** KR 2018 ***

                 16th International Conference on 
         Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

		      Tempe, Arizona (USA) 
                   October 30-November 2, 2018
                                              
                           kr2018.org/ 

Co-located with DL 2018 [dl.kr.org/] and NMR 2018 [www.kr.org/NMR]


KR 2018 IMPORTANT DATES
-----------------------
 *  Submission of title and abstract: 13 May 2018
 *  Paper submission deadline: 20 May 2018
 *  Author response period: 25-27 June 2018 
 *  Notification: 11 July 2018
 *  Camera-ready papers due: 3-10 August 2018
 *  Conference date: 30 October-2 November 2018

------------------------

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is an exciting, well-established
field of research. In KRR a fundamental assumption is that an agent's
knowledge is explicitly represented in a declarative form, suitable for
processing by dedicated reasoning engines. This assumption, that much of
what an agent deals with is knowledge-based, is common in many modern
intelligent systems. Consequently, KRR has contributed to the theory and
practice of various areas in AI, such as automated planning, natural language
understanding, among others, as well as to fields beyond AI, including
databases, verification, and software engineering. In recent years KRR has
contributed to new and emerging fields including the semantic web,
computational biology, and the development of software agents.

The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely in-depth presentation
of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation and
computational management of knowledge.  Contrary to previous editions, KR 2018 
will also feature an open call for workshop and tutorial proposals. The 
deadline for submissions is 21 February 2018. Workshops and 
tutorials will precede the KR technical program and will run on 27-29 October 
2018. Please check the KR 2018 website for further information and updates.

We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KRR that
clearly contribute to the formal foundations of relevant problems or show the
applicability of results to implemented or implementable systems. We also 
welcome papers from other areas that show clear use of, or contributions to, 
the principles or practice of KRR. We also encourage "reports from the field" 
of applications, experiments, developments, and tests. 

Papers must be submitted in AAAI style and PDF format. We invite two kinds of 
submissions:

 *  full papers of up to 9 pages including abstract, figures, and appendices 
    (if any) but excluding references and acknowledgements, which may take up 
    to one additional page; submission of additional material (e.g. proofs) as 
    separate documents is allowed, but this material should not form an 
    integral part of the submission and will only be consulted at the 
    discretion of reviewers, PC members and (area and program) chairs, as 
    appropriate;

 *  short papers describing applications, systems and/or demos, of up to 4 
    pages including abstract, figures, and appendices (if any) but excluding 
    references and acknowledgements, which may take up to one additional page.
