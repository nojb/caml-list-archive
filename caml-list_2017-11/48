For the Innovative Training Network (ITN) project ACHIEVE - AdvanCed Hardwa=
re/Software components for Integrated/Embedded Vision systEms (H2020-MSCA-I=
TN-2017), we are looking for one motivated early stage researcher in at lea=
st one of the two following scientific domains:

	- Design and implementation of programming languages (compilation, formal =
semantics, models of computation ...)=20
	- Synthesis of digital systems (hardware description languages, FPGA archi=
tectures...).=20

The researcher fellow will be hosted at the Institut Pascal (http://www.ins=
titutpascal.uca.fr/) in the DREAM research group of Universit=E9 Clermont-A=
uvergne (UCA), for a period of 36 months with the aim of obtaining a PhD. T=
he DREAM group is working on hardware and software development of advanced =
computer vision architectures. It was formed in 2008 and until now we have =
been lucky to work with five visiting professors/researchers and more than =
15 graduate students. The group is performing research in the following are=
as:=20
		- Design of smart cameras=20
		- Image processing architectures=20
		 - Software methods and tools for embedded systems=20

The PhD training includes a second internship in the company NVIDIA (http:/=
/www.nvidia.com), the famous producer of GPU. Nvidia is located in Paris.
The new researchers will therefore work as a team with existing researchers=
. They will also cooperate with the other researchers in the ACHIEVE networ=
k and participate in the ACHIEVE's training program.=20

Offer
------
You will receive a PhD scholarship according to the general conditions at U=
niversit=E9 Blaise Pascal. Tax- fee scholarship includes full social securi=
ty coverage (net monthly amount starting at =B1 2.300 EUR/month + 250 EUR/m=
onth mobility allowance + (if applicable) family allowance of 500 EUR). The=
 initial contract will be for a period of 1 year and will start in the firs=
t quarter of 2018; this contract should be extended for a total of 3 years,=
 subject to good performance. You will work at the IP research group. Infor=
mation about IP can be found on the web: http://dream.ispr-ip.fr=20
Objectives=20

Objectives
--------------
The PhD subject focuses on the development of the CAPH High Level Synthesis=
 System (http://caph.univ-bpclermont.fr), which has been developed and used=
 within the group for almost one decade for implementing embedded vision ap=
plications of reconfigurable architectures such as FPGAs. Starting from a h=
igh-level formulation as a data-flow graph, CAPH generates RT-level, synthe=
sis-ready VHDL code. In the current version, the generated RTL descriptions=
 are typically fine grain, each actor being implemented as a FSM+datapath m=
icro-architecture. For some applications, especially in the embedded vision=
 field, it would be interesting to implement as sequential, imperative code=
 running on soft or hard-core processors (either on the FPGA itself or on a=
 on-chip micro-processor). This would allow the definition the actor behavi=
or using classical, sequential programming languages such as C or C++, reus=
e of existing sequential code and use of the CAPH system in coarse grain re=
configuration (CGR) frameworks. The proposed work therefore aims at extendi=
ng the CAPH language - which is entirely written in OCaml - with adequate c=
oncepts and constructs on the one hand - building on platform-agnostic capa=
bilities of the underlying dataflow model of computation -, and implementin=
g, in the most portable and efficient way as possible, these extensions in =
the compilation and synthesis flow on the other hand. Validation will be ca=
rried out on carefully selected, realistic, embedded vision applications.=20

Profile of the candidate
-------------------------------
You have a Master of Science degree (at the start of the PhD) and a strong =
background in Computer Science. Candidates with an MsC in another disciplin=
e but with good skills in programming languages, signal/image processing ma=
y also be considered.

You have a strong interest in image processing, embedded systems for comput=
er vision, a good knowledge of mathematics, signal or image processing, and=
 very good programming skills. As stated in the preamble, you must have a w=
orking experience in digital system design (VHDL) and/or programming langua=
ge implementation (C, C++ and OCaml).

You function well in a team. You have good or excellent English and scienti=
fic writing skills. You combine a strong interest in scientific research wi=
th a desire to see your work applied in industry. Due to EC funding rules, =
only candidates with less than 4 years of research experience can be consid=
ered. Candidates may not have carried out their main activity (work-studies=
 ...) in France for more than 12 months in the past 3 years. Universit=E9 C=
lermont Auvergne implements gender-neutral recruitment and selection proced=
ures. Female candidates are especially encouraged to apply.

r research (e.g., scientific=20
papers, master thesis, report on project work, etc.). These documents need =
not be on the topic of the positions.=20
