So far so good.
After following the above instructions, I was able to tweak the Emacs behav=
ior in the desired way.
Thank you!

What puzzled me was that once I restart Eamcs, I get the old behavior.

I am guessing that this is because I need to "save" the configuration someh=
ow, which I failed to figure out.

So, first, one must "save SMIE configuration" to "customize setting".

And then one must "save customize settings" to ~/.emacs

QUESTION: Is that right?

MY ASSUMPTION WAS: Yes.

I have tried two things (and I failed in both cases);

the 1-st attempt:
-----------------

  After doing "M-x smie-config-save", I have tried to use "M-x customize-sa=
ve-variable smie-config".
  Emacs responded:

    Wrote /home/mkosik/.emacs

  This sounded like a progress.

  After I looked at ~/.emacs, I can see this:

    (load "/home/mkosik/.opam/4.06.0/share/emacs/site-lisp/tuareg-site-file=
")
    (custom-set-variables
     ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
     ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
     ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
     ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
     '(inhibit-startup-screen t)
     '(smie-config nil))
    (custom-set-faces
     ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
     ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
     ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
     ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
     )

  This does not seem currect, does it?
  (At least I would expect "smie-config" variable to be set to something in=
teresting, not "nil".)

  To confirm, I restarted Emacs and I can confirm, that the Emacs behaves a=
gain in the original undesired way
  (defined in my first email)

  FAIL

the 2-nd attempt

  After repreating your helpful instructions and doing "M-x smie-config-sav=
e",
  I tried to use "M-x customize-save-customized"
  Emacs responded:

    Wrote /home/mkosik/.emacs

  That file changed in the following way:

    (load "/home/mkosik/.opam/4.06.0/share/emacs/site-lisp/tuareg-site-file=
")
    (custom-set-variables
     ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
     ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
     ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
     ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
     '(inhibit-startup-screen t)
     '(smie-config
       (quote
        ((tuareg-mode
          (2 :after "->" 1)
          (0 :before "|-or" nil))))))
    (custom-set-faces
     ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
     ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
     ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
     ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
     )

  This is more like it (I thought).
  I optimistically restarted Emacs and again, unfortunatelly, Emacs behaves=
 again in the original undesired way
  (defined in my first email).
  I find this strange because "M: (print smie-config)" gives me:

    (tuareg-mode (2 :after "->" 1) (0 :before "|-or" nil)))
    (tuareg-mode (2 :after "->" 1) (0 :before "|-or" nil)))

  FAIL

Is this a bug?
Is this the expected behavior and I merely do not understadn SMIE and shoul=
d read some more documentation? If yes, then which one?

I haven't noticed many questions about Ocaml indentation in Emacs, so I am =
guessing that this works for everyone perfectly.
Is that the case?
