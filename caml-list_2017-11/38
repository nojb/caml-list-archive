                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                     17th International Conference on
           Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science
                               RAMiCS 2018

         29 October to 2 November 2018, Groningen, The Netherlands
                  URL: http://www.ramics-conference.org/
         PDF: http://www.ramics-conference.org/ramics-2018-cfp.pdf


GENERAL INFORMATION:

Since 1994, the RAMiCS conference series has been the main venue for
research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic
formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological
tools in computer science and beyond.


TOPICS:

We invite submissions in the general fields of algebras relevant to
computer science and applications of such algebras. Topics include but
are not limited to:

* Theory
   - algebras such as semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings,
     Kleene algebras, relation algebras and quantales
   - their connections with program logics and other logics
   - their use in the theories of automata, concurrency, formal languages,
     games, networks and programming languages
   - the development of algebraic, algorithmic, category-theoretic,
     coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories
   - their formalisation with theorem provers

* Applications
   - tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and
     verification
   - quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing
     systems and processes
   - algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis,
     social choice, optimisation and control
   - industrial applications


IMPORTANT DATES:

   Abstract Submission:  6 April 2018
   Paper Submission:    13 April 2018
   Author Notification: 29 June 2018
   Final Version:       27 July 2018
   RAMiCS 2018:         29 October - 2 November 2018


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:

Submission is via EasyChair at

   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics17

All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three referees. The
proceedings will be published in an LNCS volume by Springer, ready at
the conference. Submissions must not be published or under review for
publication elsewhere. Submissions must be in English using a PDF not
exceeding 16 pages in LNCS style. Submissions must provide sufficient
information to judge their merits. Additional material may be provided
in a clearly marked appendix or by a reference to a manuscript on a web
site. Experimental data, software or mathematical components for theorem
provers must be available in sufficient detail for referees. Deviation
from these requirements may lead to rejection.

One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at
the conference. Accepted papers must be produced with LaTeX. Formatting
instructions and LNCS style files are available at
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, we intend to publish a journal
special issue with revised and extended versions of a selection of the
best papers.
