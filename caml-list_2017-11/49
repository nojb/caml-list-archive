> The PhD subject focuses on the development of the CAPH High Level Synthes=
is System (http://caph.univ-bpclermont.fr), which has been developed and us=
ed within the group for almost one decade for implementing embedded vision =
applications of reconfigurable architectures such as FPGAs. Starting from a=
 high-level formulation as a data-flow graph, CAPH generates RT-level, synt=
hesis-ready VHDL code. In the current version, the generated RTL descriptio=
ns are typically fine grain, each actor being implemented as a FSM+datapath=
 micro-architecture. For some applications, especially in the embedded visi=
on field, it would be interesting to implement as sequential, imperative co=
de running on soft or hard-core processors (either on the FPGA itself or on=
 a on-chip micro-processor). This would allow the definition the actor beha=
vior using classical, sequential programming languages such as C or C++, re=
use of existing sequential code and use of the CAPH system in coarse grain =
reconfiguration (CGR) frameworks. The proposed work therefore aims at exten=
ding the CAPH language - which is entirely written in OCaml - with adequate=
 concepts and constructs on the one hand - building on platform-agnostic ca=
pabilities of the underlying dataflow model of computation -, and implement=
ing, in the most portable and efficient way as possible, these extensions i=
n the compilation and synthesis flow on the other hand. Validation will be =
carried out on carefully selected, realistic, embedded vision applications.=
