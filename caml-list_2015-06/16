Then, the triplet (__FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__) is unique in OCaml.

The problem I saw a long time ago while working with people who were not 
programmers (but still scientits)
is that they have more chance to fix an error in one of their input
file when given the function name than when not.

And since I created and maintain a logging library in OCaml, I was (and 
I am still) interested into making log messages as useful as possible to 
end users.
