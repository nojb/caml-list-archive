Subject: [Caml-list] CICM 2015 CfP (Call for Participation + Call for
 Posters)

                Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
                                 CICM 2015

                              13-17 July 2015
                            Washington DC, USA


The programme for this year's CICM in Washington can be found as
http://www.cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php?event=&menu=detailed-programme

The accepted papers as
http://www.cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php?event=&menu=talks

In addition we solicit for posters which will not be peer reviewed, but we
will just do a screen review for relevance to the conference. A poster
presentation will consist of a 5 minute teaser talk and the presentation of
the poster on Tuesday morning (together with the other presentations in the
Systems/Data/Projects track).

You can submit a brief abstract on a poster by 22 June 2015 via EasyChair:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2015
You will be informed about acceptance shortly after your submission.

Registration to the conference will open shortly.
