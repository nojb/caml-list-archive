Subject: [Caml-list] STAF 2015 - Call for Participation

STAF 2015: Software Technologies:  Applications and Foundations   
July 20th - 24th, 2015
L'Aquila, Italy 
http://www.disim.univaq.it/staf2015/ 

The umbrella conference for the 
* ECMFA'15 - 11th European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications
* ICGT'15 - 8th International Conference on Graph Transformation
* ICMT'15 - 8th International Conference on Model Transformation
* TAP'15 - 9th International Conference on Tests & Proofs
* TTC'15 - 8th Transformation Tool Contest 

and many related events.

*** First Call for Participation *** 

============================================================================ 
Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations (STAF) is a
federation of a number of the leading conferences on software
technologies. It was formed after the end of the successful TOOLS
federated event (http://tools.ethz.ch) in 2012, providing a loose
umbrella organisation, with steering committee, that aims to provide
continuity.

The STAF federated event runs annually; the conferences that participate
may vary from year to year, but all focus on practical and foundational
advances in software technology. The conferences address all aspects of
software technology, from object-oriented design, testing, mathematical
approaches to modelling and verification, transformation, model-driven
engineering, aspect- oriented techniques, and tools.

Venue 
===== 

STAF 2015 will be hosted by L'Aquila, the capital city of the Abruzzi
region in Italy. The city's construction was begun by Frederick II, Holy
Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, as a bulwark against the power of the
papacy. The name of Aquila means "Eagle" in Italian. Construction was
completed in 1254 under Frederick's son, Conrad IV of Germany. 

Laid out within medieval walls upon a hillside in the middle of a narrow
valley; tall snow-capped mountains of the Gran Sasso massif flank the
town. A maze of narrow streets, lined with Baroque and Renaissance
buildings and churches, open onto elegant piazzas. 

The surrounding area boasts Roman ruins (the important Roman city of
Amiternum), ancient monasteries, and numerous castles. The best-known of
these is Rocca Calascio (used in the 1980s as the location for the movie
Ladyhawke), which is the highest castle in Italy and one of the highest
in Europe. Also nearby are several ski resorts like Gran Sasso d'Italia,
the highest of the Apennines where in its valley the movie The Name of
the Rose was filmed in the end of the 1980s.

Earthquakes mark the history of L'Aquila. STAF 2015 is the first
remarkable scientific event in Computer Science after the earthquake
that occurred in 2009. It is a small, big step towards the grand
achievement of restoring some form of normality in this place and its
people.

The conferences will be held on Dipartimento di Scienze Umane of the
University of L'Aquila
