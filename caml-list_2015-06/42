WOODY BLEDSOE STUDENT TRAVEL AWARDS AT CADE-25
----------------------------------------------
The Woody Bledsoe Student Travel Award was created to honor the memory
of Woody Bledsoe, for his contributions to mathematics, artificial
intelligence, and automated theorem proving, and for his dedication to
students. The award is intended to enable selected students to attend
the International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE) or the
International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR),
whichever is scheduled for the year, by covering part of their
expenses.

The winners of the CADE-25 Woody Bledsoe Student Award will be
partially reimbursed (e.g., between Euro 200 and Euro 750) for their
conference registration, transportation, and accommodation expenses.
Preference will be given to students who will play an active role in
the conference (including satellite workshops, competitions, tutorials
and poster events) and do not have alternative funding. However, also
students in other situations are very much encouraged to apply.

A nomination consists of a recommendation letter of up to 300 words
from the student's advisor. Nominations for CADE-25 should be sent by
e-mail to the chairs and conference organizers at
cade25@inf.fu-berlin.de.

Nominations must arrive no later than 21 June 2015. The winners will
be notified by 28 June 2015.

The awards will be presented at CADE-25; in case a winner does not
attend, the chairs may transfer the award to another nominee or give
no award.
