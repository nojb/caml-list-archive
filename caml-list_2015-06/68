The twentieth International Conference on Engineering of Complex
Computer Systems (ICECCS 2015) will be held in the Gold Coast,
Australia, 9-12 December, 2015.

Complex computer systems are present in every aspect of human
activities, ranging from construction, communications, defense, finance,
health care, manufacturing and transportation. Complexity arises from
many factors, including the dynamic environments and scenarios these
systems operate in; demanding and sometimes conflicting requirements in
functionality, efficiency, scalability, security, dependability and
adaptability; as well as the large variation in development methodology,
programming languages and implementation details.

This twentieth edition of the ICECCS conference series aims to bring
together industrial, academic, and government experts, from a variety of
application domains and software disciplines, to discuss how the
disciplines' problems and solution techniques interact within the whole
system. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and
technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of interest
includes long-term research issues; near-term requirements and
challenges; established complex systems; emerging promising tools; and
retrospective and prospective reflections of research and development
into complex systems.

 
KEYNOTE SPEAKERS
---------------------------
* Colin Fidge Queensland University of Technology, Australia
* Mounir Mokhtari, CNRS & Institut Mines-Telecom, France
* Jun Sun, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore


SCOPE AND TOPICS
---------------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, unpublished
research results, case studies and tools. Papers are solicited in all
areas related to complex computer-based systems, including causes of
complexity and means of measuring, avoiding, controlling, or coping with
complexity. Topic areas include, but are not limited to:
 
* Requirement specification and analysis
* Verification and validation
* Security and privacy of complex systems
* Model-driven development
* Reverse engineering and refactoring
* Software architecture
* Big data management
* Ambient intelligence, pervasive computing
* Ubiquitous computing, context awareness, sensor networks
* Design by contract
* Agile methods
* Safety-critical & fault-tolerant architectures
* Adaptive, self-managing and multi-agent systems
* Real-time, hybrid and embedded systems
* Systems of systems
* Cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things (IoT)
* Tools and tool integration
* Past reflections and future outlooks
* Industrial case studies

 
SUBMISSION
---------------------------
Different types of contributions are sought, including novel research,
lessons learned, experience reports, and discussions of practical
problems faced by industry and user domains. The ultimate goal of the
conference is to build a rich and comprehensive conference program that
can fit the interests and needs of its attendees: practitioners,
researchers, managers, and students. A program goal is to organize
several sessions that include both academic and industrial papers on a
given topic and culminate panels to discuss relationships between
industrial and academic research.

FULL PAPERS

Full papers are divided into two categories:
* Technical Papers and
* Experience Reports.
The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by program
committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be
published in the conference proceedings. Technical papers should
describe original research. Experience reports should describe practical
projects carried out in industry, and reflect on the lessons learned
from them.
 

SHORT PAPERS

Short paper submissions should specify in their abstract whether they
describe ongoing or PhD research. Both types of short papers will be
reviewed by program committee members, and accepted short papers will be
published in the conference proceedings.

 
PAPER SUBMISSION

Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of
the 2-column IEEE Conference Publishing Services (CPS) Proceedings
Format. Papers should not exceed 10 pages for full papers and 4 pages
for short papers, including figures, references, and appendices. All
submissions should be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the
specified format and length may be rejected immediately, without review.

Detailed instructions on paper formatting and submission can be found on
the Submission page.

All submissions should be made through the Easychair Website:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iceccs20150.


SPECIAL ISSUE

A special issue for selected papers of ICECCS'15 is planned in the
journal "Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering"
(https://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/11334).
