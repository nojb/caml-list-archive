Hello,

Thanks to everyone for your answers, this has given me much food for
thought.

I like this approach because it amounts to saying "one always starts
a phrase with 'let' or 'type'" (and later in the year there can be
'open', 'module', 'include'). I sure can live without top-level
expressions.

On the other hand, I also like the idea of terminating phrases, simply
because explaining when it terminates is not trivial otherwise, as
a 'let' may not be the beginning of a phrase.

I am curious about this. My goal is to teach the language, and I find
that a REPL backed with a file works great to do this (using tuareg or
ocaml-top). What do you use to make sure students have a fast
compile/debug cycle?

Thanks again,

Alan
