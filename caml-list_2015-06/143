That's true, although it's probably a little easier to spot a missing ;;
than a non-missing trailing ;.

I expect that on balance you'll have better errors more often with using
;;. So it seems sensible to use it for teaching beginners. Once you're an
old hand like Mark Shinwell, you can make up your mind whether it's worth
keeping it up or not ;)

&gt; There is one downside of not using &quot;;;&quot;, namely that you som=
etimes get<br>
&gt; syntax errors much later than necessary. E.g. in<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; let x =3D<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0do_this();<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0do_that();<br>
&gt; let y =3D 6<br>
&gt; let z =3D<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0do_third_thing()<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; you get the syntax error at the position of the third &quot;let&quot; =
although it<br>
&gt; is the extra semicolon at the end of the first definition. This can be=
<br>
&gt; very confusing, and it is a very good reason to use &quot;;;&quot; out=
side the<br>
&gt; toplevel. IMHO it is better to be honest about this issue. Because &qu=
ot;let&quot;<br>
&gt; is an open-ended construction the &quot;;;&quot; can be useful as end =
marker, and<br>
&gt; the compiler emits better error messages with more precise locations.<=
br>
<br>
</span>The argument seems a bit weak.<br>
The example is (if I understand correctly): &quot;I have a trailing<br>
semicolon which the compiler doesn&#39;t report properly but instead tells<=
br>
me there is a syntax error in a completely unrelated place! If you<br>
place double semicolons in your code, that doesn&#39;t happen!&quot;.<br>
But it could also be understood as: &quot;I usually place double<br>
semicolons, but in this case I forgot. And the compiler doesn&#39;t report<=
br>
this properly but instead tells me there is a syntax error in a<br>
completely unrelated place!&quot;.<br>
<br>
You face the same problem either way, you still have to be &quot;fluent&quo=
t; to<br>
know where to look when you encounter this error.<br>
And I&#39;d guess a beginner is as likely to forget the &quot;;;&quot; as t=
o leave a<br>
trailing &quot;;&quot;.<br>
