Subject: [Caml-list] "Inconsistent assumptions" when moving files across
 subdirectories

I've noticed that it's pretty easy to confuse ocamlc/ocamlopt when moving a=
 module across subdirectories. Here's an example, the most minimized repro =
I could get; it uses ocamlbuild, but a similar problem happens if you use O=
CamlMakefile and I assume other build systems. https://gist.github.com/jwat=
zman/9979951afb5b87304c18 -- running that will consistently terminate with =
the dreaded

> Error: Files main.cmx and a/quux.cmx
>        make inconsistent assumptions over interface Quux

(The script flips the quux module back and forth twice, but that's only to =
exhibit the problem on both 4.01 and 4.02; you can get the same problem wit=
h only one move of quux.ml, but which way you need to move it depends on wh=
ich version of ocaml you're using.)

A clean build will of course resolve the problem, but that's quite annoying=
 to have to go broadcast to a large team, particularly when the build may t=
ake many minutes, and when this problem is specific to the OCaml parts of o=
ur system (a humongous C++ codebase never requires a clean rebuild). Renami=
ng a module across subdirectories doesn't seem like that uncommon of an ope=
ration.

The root problem seems to be that ocamlc/ocamlopt are picking up build arti=
facts by directory only, and can't be explicitly told which artifacts to pi=
ck up, and so they are picking up the "wrong" quux.cmi/cmx left over in a b=
uild directory, which ocamlbuild should be cleaning up. Is that right? Is t=
here any way to tell ocamlc/ocamlopt not to do things by directory, but to =
be more explicit, for the usages of build systems?

Not working around this limitation of ocamlc/ocamlopt seems like a bug in o=
camlbuild, no? I'm a bit surprised by it though, given that I've found the =
same problem in other build systems -- have other folks not run into this? =
How do other teams deal with this, trying to avoid clean builds?

Thanks!
Josh Watzman
