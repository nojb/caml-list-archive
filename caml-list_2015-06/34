There will be implications, the most obvious being that the `Field`
macro will stop being an l-value so you'll have to rewrite your uses
of caml_modify and caml_initialize:

  caml_modify(&Field(v, idx), w) => caml_modify_field(v, idx, w)
  caml_initialize(&Field(v, idx, w) => caml_initialize_field(v, idx, w)

See https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/120 for more details.

I'm sure there will be other changes needed to accomodate multicore.

But we are planning to keep the sequential runtime alongside the
parallel one, at least for some time, so if you're not in a hurry to
use multicore, you'll have plenty of time to update your bindings.
