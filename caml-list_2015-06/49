INVITED SPEAKERS
  Colin O'Halloran (D-RisQ & the University of Oxford)
  Don Sannella (Contemplate & the University of Edinburgh)

SPONSORS
  Formal Methods Europe (FME)
  The Scottish Informatics & Computer Science Alliance (SICSA)

BACKGROUND=20
  The aim of Automated Verification of Critical Systems (AVoCS) 2015=20
  is to contribute to the interaction and exchange of ideas among members=20
  of the international research community on tools and techniques for the=20
  verification of critical systems.=20

SCOPE
  The subject is to be interpreted broadly and inclusively. It covers=20
  all aspects of automated verification, including model checking,=20
  theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation,=20
  and refinement pertaining to various types of critical systems which=20
  need to meet stringent dependability requirements (safety-critical,=20
  business-critical, performance-critical, etc.). Contributions that=20
  describe different techniques, or industrial case studies are encouraged.=
=20

  The technical programme will consist of invited and contributed talks=20
  and also allow for short presentations of research ideas. The workshop=20
  will be relatively informal, with an emphasis on discussion where special=
=20
  discussion sessions will be organised around the research ideas presentat=
ions.=20
  Topics include (but are not limited to):
    - Model Checking
    - Automatic and Interactive Theorem Proving
    - SAT, SMT or Constraint Solving for Verification
    - Abstract Interpretation
    - Specification and Refinement
    - Requirements Capture and Analysis
    - Verification of Software and Hardware
    - Specification and Verification of Fault Tolerance and Resilience
    - Probabilistic and Real-Time Systems
    - Dependable Systems
    - Verified System Development
    - Industrial Applications

WORKSHOPS
  AI4FM 2015: 1 September 2015 -- www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/
  including invited talk by J Strother Moore (Univerity of Texas at Austin)

VENUE
  The event will be held in the International Centre for Mathematical Scien=
ces=20
  (ICMS) in the centre of the historic old town of Edinburgh - an UNESCO wo=
rld
  heritage site.=20

STUDENT GRANTS
  Thanks to sponsorships from FME and SICSA we can offer financial support =
for a=20
  limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form of a registr=
ation=20
  fee waiver (full or partial). As this is limited, we ask the students tha=
t=20
  would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a short applic=
ation.=20
  The details on how to apply will be available in due course from the AVoC=
S=20
  webpage.

SUBMISSION DETAILS
   Submissions of full papers to the workshop must not have been published=
=20
   or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions=
=20
   will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of originality, contributi=
on=20
   to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the=20
   workshop. Submissions are handled via Easychair:=20

       https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Davocs2015

   The papers must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages and should=
=20
   use the dedicated AVoCS 2015 EASST template available rom the the=20
   following link (for LaTeX and Word):

       http://journal.ub.tu-berlin.de/eceasst

   AVoCS also encourages the submissions of research ideas in order to stim=
ulate=20
   discussions at the workshop. Reports on ongoing work or surveys on work=
=20
   published elsewhere are welcome. The Programme Committee will select=20
   research ideas on the basis of submitted abstracts according to signific=
ance=20
   and general interest. Research ideas must be written in English and not =
exceed=20
   2 pages using the EASST template. The presentation of these ideas will b=
e organised=20
   around discussions, where the presenter should also prepare a set of que=
stion in=20
   which the audience will discuss.

PROCEEDINGS
  At the workshop, pre-proceedings will be available in the form of a Herio=
t-Watt=20
  University Technical Report; this report will also include the research i=
deas.
  After the workshop, the authors of accepted full papers will have about o=
ne=20
  month in order to revise their papers for publication in the workshop pos=
t-
  proceedings which will appear in the Electronic Communications of the EAS=
ST=20
  Open Access Journal. Research ideas will not be part of the proceedings i=
n the=20
  Open Access Journal.

SPECIAL SCP JOURNAL ISSUE
  Authors of a selection of the best papers presented at the workshop will =
be=20
  invited to submit extended versions of their work for publication in a=20
  special issue of Elsevier's journal Science of Computer Programming.
