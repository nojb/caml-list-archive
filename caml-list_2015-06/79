The 6th Workshop on Semantics for Smarter Cities
(S4SC 2015)
collocated with the 14th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2015)
Bethlehem, PA, USA

October 11-12, 2015

http://kat.ee.surrey.ac.uk/wssc/index.html


Important Dates (All deadlines are Hawaii time)

- full paper submission: July 1, 2015

- notification of acceptance: July 31, 2015

- submission of camera ready version: August 7, 2015

- Workshop date: October 11/12, 2015


Scope and Objectives

This workshop will explore the interfaces between the Web, the Web of Data,=
 and the City Smart environment. It will further explore how the Web, and t=
he intelligences built on top of, and around the Web, can make the notion o=
f the Smart Connected City possible and realizable.

The workshop aims to gather researchers, city departments, service provider=
s, application developers, entrepreneurs, and citizens to present and debat=
e Semantic Web technologies, Linked Data and data analytics and evaluations=
 for smart city applications as well as impact of user engagements and soci=
al networks. The workshop will also focus on related standardisation activi=
ties in W3C, IEEE and ETSI.

It continues on from the successful earlier workshops on the same theme at:

The 5th Workshop on Semantics for Smarter Cities (http://blog.soton.ac.uk/s=
4sc/)

SemCity13 (http://aida.ii.uam.es/wims13/semcity.php)

AAAI 14 (http://research.ihost.com/semanticcities14/)

AAAI 12 (http://research.ihost.com/semanticcities12/)

a relating to cities
Use cases, including, but not limited to, transportation (traffic predictio=
n, personal travel optimization, carpool and feet scheduling), public safet=
y (suspicious activity detection, disaster management), healthcare (disease=
 diagnosis and prognosis, pandemic management), water management (flood pre=
vision, quality monitoring, fault diagnosis), food (food traceability, carb=
on-footprint tracking), energy (smart grid, carbon footprint tracking, elec=
tricity consumption forecasting) and buildings (energy conservation, fault =
detections)

5. City as a Smart Utility
Internet of Things
Interaction Paradigms in the Smart City
Smart City operating systems
Semantic Complex Event Reasoning
City services discovery
Service Ranking, Provenance, and Semantic Web Discovery

Submission Types and Publication

For providing a forum for sharing novel ideas, S4SC'15 welcomes a broad spe=
ctrum of contributions, including:
Full research papers
Position papers
Case studies
Descriptions of experiments
Evaluations
How to submit

Authors of accepted works are expected to attend the conference to present =
their work. The maximum length of:
Short papers, up to 6 pages
Full Research papers, up to 16 pages
Position papers, up to 4 pages
Case Studies papers, up to 16 pages
Demo papers, and descriptions of experiments, including evaluation reports =
(up to 16 pages)

Submissions to the Demo track should describe what will be demonstrated (th=
is may include screenshots and sample script for the demo). Authors are enc=
ouraged to include a link to where the demo (live or recorded video) can be=
 found. Authors are advised to make clear in their submission:

What is the research background and application context of the demonstratio=
n?
What are the key technologies used, and how does the demonstrated system, a=
pplication or infrastructure relate to pre-existing work?
What will be the key concepts learnt by participants of the demonstration?

Submissions must be in PDF formatted in the style of the Springer Publicati=
ons format for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). For details of the=
 LNCS style, see Springer's Author Instructions.

Paper submissions to be made electronically through the EasyChair submissio=
n system at: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Ds4sc2015
