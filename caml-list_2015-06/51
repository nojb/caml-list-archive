*** Last Mile ***

The 9th International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling
and Using Context (CONTEXT 2015)

2-6 November 2015, Lordos Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/context2015

*** Deadline: June 15, 2015 ***


The CONTEXT conferences are the world's prime forum for presentation and
exchange of insights and=A0cutting-edge results from the wide range of
disciplines concerned with context.

The main theme of CONTEXT 2015 is "Back to the roots", focusing on the
importance of interdisciplinary cooperations and studies of the phenomenon.
Context, context modeling and context comprehension are central topics in
linguistics, philosophy, sociology, artificial intelligence, computer=A0sci=
ence,
art,=A0law, organizational sciences, cognitive science, psychology, etc. an=
d are
also essential for the effectiveness=A0of modern, complex and distributed
software systems.

CONTEXT 2015 invites high-quality contributions from researchers and
practitioners in foundational=A0studies, applications and evaluations of
modeling and use of context in all relevant fields. Areas of interest=A0inc=
lude,
but are not limited to, the role of context seen from different perspective=
s in:

=B7=A0Agent-based architectures
=B7=A0Ambient intelligence
=B7=A0Cognition and perception by humans and artifacts
=B7=A0Context-aware and situated systems
=B7=A0Context modeling tools
=B7=A0Communication and dialogue
=B7=A0Data analysis and visualization
=B7=A0Decision making
=B7=A0Discourse comprehension and representation
=B7=A0Engineering, e.g., in transport networks, industrial plants etc.
=B7=A0Experimental philosophy and=A0experimental pragmatics
=B7 (Formal) models of context
=B7=A0Human-computer interaction
=B7=A0Knowledge representation
=B7=A0Language acquisition and processing
=B7=A0Learning, knowledge management=A0and sharing
=B7=A0Logic and reasoning
=B7=A0Machine learning
=B7=A0Ontology/ies
=B7=A0Semantics and Pragmatics
=B7=A0Smart and interactive spaces
=B7=A0Understanding art, images, music and theatre

Proceedings

Accepted papers and poster abstracts will be published in a volume of the
Springer LNAI series.

Submission format

Submissions may be either full papers of up to 14 pages (in Springer LNCS

=B7=A0Enrico Rukzio, Universit=E4t Ulm, Germany
   Mobile Interaction with Pervasive User Interfaces

Workshops

CONTEXT 2015 workshops will provide a platform for presenting novel and
emerging ideas in the use and the modelling of context in a less formal
and possibly more focused way than the conference itself. Three workshops
are confirmed so far:

=B7 Smart University 3.0
=B7 CATI - Context Awareness & Tactile design for mobile Interaction
=B7 SHAPES 3.0 -- THE SHAPE OF THINGS

Important dates

Full papers and posters:
=B7=A0Submission deadline: June 15, 2015
