3rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STATISTICAL LANGUAGE AND SPEECH PROCESSING

SLSP 2015

Budapest, Hungary

November 24-26, 2015

Organised by:

Laboratory of Speech Acoustics
Department of Telecommunications and Telematics
Budapest University of Technology and Economics
http://alpha.tmit.bme.hu/speech/

Research Group on Mathematical Linguistics (GRLMC)
Rovira i Virgili University

AIMS:

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying
excellent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are
currently in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at
attracting contributions from both fields. Though there exist large,
well-known conferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these
areas, SLSP is a more focused meeting where synergies between subdomains and
people will hopefully happen. In SLSP 2015, significant room will be
reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career and particular
focus will be put on methodology.

VENUE:

SLSP 2015 will take place in Budapest, on the banks of the Danube and an
extensive UNESCO World Heritage site. The venue will be the Faculty of
Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the Budapest University of
Technology and Economics.

SCOPE:

The conference invites submissions discussing the employment of statistical
models (including machine learning) within language and speech processing.
Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not
limited to:

anaphora and coreference resolution
authorship identification, plagiarism and spam filtering
computer-aided translation
corpora and language resources
data mining and semantic web
information extraction
information retrieval
knowledge representation and ontologies
lexicons and dictionaries
machine translation
multimodal technologies
natural language understanding
neural representation of speech and language
opinion mining and sentiment analysis
parsing
part-of-speech tagging
question-answering systems
semantic role labelling
speaker identification and verification
speech and language generation
speech recognition
speech synthesis
speech transcription
spelling correction
spoken dialogue systems
term extraction
text categorisation
text summarisation
user modeling

STRUCTURE:

SLSP 2015 will consist of:

invited talks
peer-reviewed contributions

INVITED SPEAKERS:

Xavier Carreras (Xerox Research Centre Europe, Meylan, FR), Low-rank Matrix
Learning for Compositional Objects, Strings and Trees
