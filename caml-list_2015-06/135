If you would like to host this on lists.ocaml.org, then the process is
really easy.  Just drop a line to "infrastructure@lists.ocaml.org" with
the name of the list, a short (one paragraph) description, and the primary
email contact(s) for moderation purposes.  The moderation is only to reject
spam emails

Somewhere on GitHub in an organisation would work well. I notice that
one already exists for BER MetaOCaml here:

https://github.com/metaocaml

Thanks for doing this!  Having a more central place with some examples
would be most useful.
