camlyacc and camllex are command-line tools, so the most natural way
to use them is indeed from a DOS shell, or (better) a Makefile.

Still, you can invoke them from the Caml graphical user interface
using the sys__system_command function.  E.g.:

        cd "\\the\\right\\directory";;
        sys__system_command "camllex mylexer.mll";;
        compile "mylexer.ml";;
        load_object "mylexer.zo";;

Yet another alternative is to use streams instead of camllex and
camlyacc.
