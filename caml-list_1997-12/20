This is end-of-year clearance here at INRIA, so we've just released
version 1.07 of Objective Caml.

Compared with 1.06, this is a bug-fix release that provides no new
features, but fixes some serious bugs in the native thread library,
and a number of small glitches in the system and documentation.
See the end of this message for a more complete list.

Usually, this wouldn't deserve a release in itself, but we're about to
put Objective Caml on a CD-ROM distribution and we wanted to fix the
known problem with 1.06 before.

Objective Caml 1.07 is available from ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light,
in the following files:

        ocaml-1.07.tar.gz       Source distribution (Unix, PC, Mac)
        ocaml-1.07-1.i386.rpm   Binaries for Linux RedHat / Intel
        ocaml-1.07-win.zip      Binaries for Windows 95 and NT
        ocaml-1.07-refman.*     Documentation, in various formats
        ocaml-1.06-1.07.diffs.gz  Source diffs from 1.06
