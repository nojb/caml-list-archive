Yes, that's a mistake in the building of ocaml.  Basically, the
implementation of the "Marshal" module was removed.  The reason you
can still use "Marshal.to_string" is that it's a primitive, not
defined in the implementation of "Marshal", while "Marshal.from_string"
is ML code from the implementation of "Marshal".

The problem will be fixed shortly.  Thanks for the bug report, but
really your message doesn't belong to caml-list@inria.fr, you should
have mailed caml-light@inria.fr instead.
