Suspecting a problem with spaces in path names, I reinstalled the=20
distribution to C:\ocaml and tried setting OCAMLLIB to "C:\ocaml\lib"=20
and "/cygdrive/c/ocaml/lib" -- both verified with ocamlc -v, but=20
still no luck.  I also tried the -nostdlib option while using -I to=20
include the lib directory:

$ ocamlc -nostdlib -I /cygdrive/c/ocaml/lib ...

$ ocamlc -nostdlib -I C:\ocaml\lib ...

Neither worked.  I then tried a symbolic link to the lib directory:

$ ln -s /cygdrive/c/ocaml/lib lib
$ ocamlc -nostdlib -I lib ...

Nope.  What finally worked was copying the lib directory into the=20
Cygwin environment:

$ cp -r /cygdrive/c/ocaml/lib lib
$ ocamlc -nostdlib -I lib ...

I have no idea why this worked, but the symbolic link didn't.  I guess=20
that's windows for you.

Thanks for your help.
