for a long time i have been toying with the idea of writing a proper
network management systems (with layer 2 topology detection) in
ocaml. it seems an ideal language for this purpose. it  would also be
a "killer application" for ocaml, if successful. one of the things
that have prevented me from doing so was my dread at writing parser,
especially for things like ASN.1 ... if however usable and reasonably
licensed ocaml libraries for that sort thing already existed, i *may*
reconsider ... so my question for you is: do these libraries exist
in the public domain, would  your phd's parser be suitable for such
a project, or, if not, can the france telecom R&D suits be convinced
to donate a bit of code?
