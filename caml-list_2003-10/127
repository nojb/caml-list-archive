Hi list !

I'm please to announce the release of the version 2.1 of Xml-Light :
Xml Light is a small parser/printer for Xml documents, entirely written in
OCaml. It supports a subset of the Xml specification, which should be enough
for most of the usages, including DTD proving and PCDATA nodes. You can
download the distribution or watch the Ocamldoc HTML documentation on the
web page : http://tech.motion-twin.com/xmllight .

Version 2 have been updated several times since the first release and fixed
a lot of small bugs or incompabilites (thanks to every people that reported
them).
Version 2.1 is including all theses fixes and is also correcting some recent
case sensitiveness issues.

Nicolas Cannasse
