	Yeah, this is the kind of thing I was looking for.  I tried a variety 
of things I thought looked like this.

	When picking up a language, there always seems to be a bit of effort 
required to learn how to read the docs.  The docs for Map are pretty 
much empty, but it does link to the source, which gives me a good idea.

	I'm not sure how to express my data structure...  I'm parsing a log 
file that contains start and stop timestamps for various transaction 
types.  I want to count up the number and total time of each of these 
transactions and group them by timestamp rounded to the nearest five 
minutes.  So, it'd look something like this:

{ 0: <
	pb_counts = { "T1": 23, "T2": 43 }
	pb_times = { "T1": 291, "T2": 92 }
	>
   300: <
	pb_counts = { "T1": 29, "T2": 50 }
	pb_times = { "T1": 202, "T2": 87 }
	>
}

	When I spell it out that way, it looks a little less than optimal.  
However, this is more of a learning tool at this point.

	Thanks for your help.
