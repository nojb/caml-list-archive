Gentlemen!

There are two features, which might it be useful to support in the 
language w/out modifying it much. And they both are about greater
generality of the language.

First, it would be nice to have constructors as functions like below:

List. map Some [17]

Second, it would also be nice not to have "the concept of constructor
arity", and treat the code below as correct:

type t = A of int * int
let _ = 
  match A (17, 0) with
    A z -> match z with (x, y) -> ()

Does anybody know, whether this is possible? Or, if not, what are the
prohibiting reasons?
