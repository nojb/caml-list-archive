Workshop on Practical Aspects of High-level Parallel Programming (PAPP
2004)=20
http://f.loulergue.free.fr/PAPP2004

part of The International Conference on Computational Science=20
http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/iccs2004/

June 7-9, 2004, Krak=F3w, Poland=20

Aims and scope

Many applications of computing require performance levels=20
attainable only on parallel architectures. Such systems are=20
now readily available as their price/performance ratio=20
continues to improve. The rapid development of affordable=20
hardware for parallel computing makes the need to develop=20
high-quality parallel software increasingly urgent.=20

Sequential programming has long benefited from high-level=20
programming techniques and tools that have made today's=20
immense range of software economically viable. Two decades=20
of research into high-level parallel programming (algorithmic=20
skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages, such=20
as Haskell and ML, or parallel logic and constraint programming,=20
parallel execution of declarative programs such SQL queries,=20
etc.) has produced methods and tools that improve the=20
price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden=20
the range of target applications. Several emerging domains,=20
such as Grid Computing, are currently raising new issues.=20
GRIDs offer tremendous computing power. Nevertheless, this power=20
is far from being effectively exploited. In addition to technical=20
problems related to portability and access, Grid computing=20
needs new programming paradigms.=20

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level=20
parallel programming: design, implementation and optimization=20
of high-level programming languages and tools (performance=20
predictors working on high-level parallel/grid source code,=20
visualisations of abstract behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors,=20
high-level GRID resource managers, compilers, automatic generators,=20
etc.), applications in all fields of high-performance computing,=20
benchmarks and experiments. Research on high-level grid programming=20
is particularly relevant.=20

Topics

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English=20
on topics including:
- high-level programming models and tools for GRID computing=20
- high-level parallel language design, implementation and optimisation=20
- functional, logic, constraint programming for parallel,=20
  distributed and Grid systems=20
- algorithmic skeletons and high level parallel libraries=20
- generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic=20
  skeletons and high level parallel libraries=20
- applications in all fields of high-performance computing=20
  (using high-level tools)=20
- benchmarks, experiments using such languages and tools=20

Paper submission and publication

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English=20
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished=20
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through=20
a rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least=20
two referees. The accepted papers will be published in the=20
Springer-Verlag LNCS series, as part of the ICCS proceedings.=20

Papers (PDF file) should be sent to loulergue@univ-paris12.fr with=20
subject "[PAPP Workshop] Submission" no later than Monday 8 December
2003.=20
We invite you to submit a full paper of 6 to 10 pages (A4), describing
new=20
and original results. The submitted paper must be formatted according to

the rule of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submission implies

the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present=20
the paper. An early email with your intention to submit a paper would be

greatly appreciated (especially if you have doubts about the relevance=20
of your paper).=20

Important Dates

December 8, 2003 (FIRM DEADLINE) Full paper due=20
January 9, 2004 Notification=20
