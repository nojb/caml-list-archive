Back in 1997 or so, Francis Dupont wrote a layer of C to interface IPv6 
calls to Caml. IIRC, the OCaml API was mostly unchanged (compared to 
usual Unix network API), and hence a few of the network apps we had in 
those days (especially MMM and the V6 proxy) were then used 
(essentially as-is) in IPv6 interoperability tests on FreeBSD.
Maybe Francis still has some code in a drawer : 
Francis.Dupont@enst-bretagne.fr
Otherwise, http://www.google.com/search?q=mmm+ipv6&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8  
might get you enough pieces to put it back together...
