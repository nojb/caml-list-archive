Howdy All,

Here is an update on this situation. It looks like there is some sort of
bad interaction with the patches to 3.07 and cygwin.  I installed the
original 3.07 on this machine and it was able to load the file just
fine, while the 3.07+2 version seg faults.  In both of these cases, I
totally cleaned out everything and made a fresh build.  I also tried
3.07+2 under Linux and it did not generate a seg fault so it looks like
cygwin is a necessary component.

I don't know enough at this point to better characterize this bug but I
hope that someone who know what went into the last two patches may have
an idea.

Thanks,
-Eric
