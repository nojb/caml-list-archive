... and this is what Issac (and myself) suggested (by implication):

let int_of_string s =
  Big_int.int_of_big_int (Big_int.big_int_of_string s)

We addressed your specific problem. But I agree with you that it would be
nice to have the safe behavior in OCaml by default (at least for parsing,
where performance wouldn't be affected)
