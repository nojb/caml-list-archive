Right, because you have 'try' without 'with'. The syntax is

  try
    <desired operations>
  with
    <exception pattern> ->
      <exception handling code>
    | <exception pattern> -> (* 2nd & further patterns are optional *)
      <exception handling code>
    
You could make the above example work by adding a 'with' clause at the
end, e.g.

  with Failure ->
    print_endline "Exception handled.";
    []   (* exception handler must return same type as main operation *)

But that would actually be a little pointless in this case, since as far
as I can tell the only possible exception is the Failure raised by your
code. So without knowing your objectives in more detail, I would say the
most sensible approach would be to simply delete 'try' from this
function, and perhaps have a complete try-with block in some other
function that is calling this one.
