The reason is that not everybody is using Tcl/Tk 8.3, so that having
it in by default would be unsafe.
An idea would be to generate from different description files for each
version of Tk, but this would loose binary compatibility (and need
some work).
So currently, everybody is limited to Tcl/Tk 8.0 functionality.

If your need is punctual, you can define wrap the function by hand in caml:

   let hide w =
     Protocol.tkEval [| Widget.name w; TkToken"configure"; TkToken"-hidden" |]

With labltk, you should be more explicit with the widget type intended.

  let hide (w : text widget) =
     Protocol.tkEval [| Widget.name w; TkToken"configure"; TkToken"-hidden" |]

Of course your program becomes incompatible with versions older than 8.3.
