No, last time I looked at it, I came to the conclusion that in its current form
ensemble is completely unusable in a P2P environment, since the protocol
requires that you can trust the intergity of the clients connecting to the
network. It just stuffs the bytes received from the net into
Marshal.from_something (which explains part of its speed). You would have to
implement a typesafe marshalling layer that does integrity checks on the
received messages.
Another possible problem: frequent joins and leaves (as you might expect in a
successful P2P environment) might keep the nodes busy syncronizing views and
electing new leaders and leave no time for actual data exchange.

Yours, Florian.
