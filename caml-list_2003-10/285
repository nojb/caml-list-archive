Anyone want to do something with OCaml on Eclipse?

IBM has a million dollars in grants for teaching and research efforts done 
with their extensible open source IDE. (I currently use it for Java work - 
its very good, reminds me of Smalltalk dev environments.) It's designed to 
be extensible to support other languages (currently has a strong working 
C++ extension, and many other languages coming along).

Any OCaml proposals should probably include some work to allow Java and 
OCaml runtimes to inter-operate.

Proposals are due by November 7th.
