I want you to know that there is someone who loves you very
much.  That's important to know in the " dog eat dog world "
in which we live.  We spend our lives trying to earn love and
respect and somehow we never seem to " measure up ".  It's
wonderful to be loved without reservation, without having to
earn it.  We are loved , not because we are good, not because
we have lived up to expectations, and not because  we've
tried to live a good life, but we are loved just like we
are...faults and all.  God has put a high value on our lives
in that He gave His Son to die on a cross to pay the penalty
for all our sins.  He has a very high purpose for yor life!


After 42 years of struggling with the meaning of life and
what the purpose of my life should be, I met a man named
Jesus and He changed my life.  It has been wonderful to be
loved unconditionally and to finally realize the meaning 
of life itself.   I'm writing you to share this love and to 
let you know that you are a very special person in the sight
of God.  He only wants good for you and wants to help you in
all of your trials.


The Holy Bible tells us in the book of Romans, chapter 3
verse 23, " For all have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God".  Romans 6:23 reads " For the wages of sin is
death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus 
Christ our Lord".  Romans 10: 9-10 goes on to read, " Because
if you confess the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart
that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.
For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with
the mouth one confesses unto salvation".


If you haven't already experienced His love, you can by praying
this simple prayer and by believing in your heart that He has
answered it to the fullest.  " Father, I come to you as a
sinner.  I repent and ask you to forgive my sin and to come into
my heart and take control of my life.  Fill me with your Holy
Spirit and enable me to be the person that you want me to be.
Please use me to help others and help me to realize and fulfill
the purpose for my life.  Thank you Jesus for dying to pay the penalty
for my sin.  I accept your  sacrifice for my salvation.  Enable
me by the power of your Holy Spirit to live a life that will be
pleasing to you.   Amen ".  

If you prayed this prayer KNOW that you are now in the family of God
and accepted into His Kindgom. It's that simple. This is the beginning
point of a new relationship with Him.  I encourage you to get a hold of
a Bible and explore the person and characteristics of God that's
revealed there.  You can easily find one online simply by going to any
search engine and typing in "the bible online".

I would like to encourage you to forward this email to anyone you know.
Jesus said, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all
creation.
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not
believe
will be condemned." Mark 16:15-16

Pass it on.

                                God Bless You.
