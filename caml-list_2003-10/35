In response to the Camlp4 issues (with labeled arguments) that were
discovered in release 3.07 of OCaml: Michel Mauny has been working
hard on correcting the issues, and I just made available a patch
against the 3.07 sources:

      http://caml.inria.fr/distrib/ocaml-3.07/ocaml-3.07-patch1.diffs

It would be great if the users who where affected by the problem could
give it a try and let us (caml@inria.fr) know how it goes.
(Users who track the CVS repository can use it instead.)

If the issues are fixed, I'll update the binary distributions to
incorporate the patch.  Making binary distributions takes a
surprisingly long time, and is boring, so I'd rather not do that too
often...

Thanks for your help,

- Xavier Leroy
