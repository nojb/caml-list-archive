Howdy,

At this point I suspect that something was wrong with my version of
OCaml. I changed machines this morning and have reinstalled everything.
I don't believe that I have done anything different but now #load does
not cause a segfault.  I have not had time to test much more than that
to see if there are still some other problems present.  I'll let you
know if something else appears.

-Eric

P.S. The significant difference between the two setups is that the
problematic one was running Windows 2000 Pro and the new one is running
Windows XP.
