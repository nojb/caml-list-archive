Well, I tinker with my system a lot, so it's possible, but I have no
memory of adding or removing anything relating to DBM, nor can I imagine
why I would have. But I think the problem may be with the configure
script anyway--see below.

Ah, but it effectively has a *higher* priority in the configure script:

  for dir in /usr/include /usr/include/db1 /usr/include/gdbm; do
    if test -f $dir/ndbm.h; then
      ....
    fi
    if test -f $dir/gdbm-ndbm.h; then
      ....
    fi
  done

Since I have both GDBM and NDBM (I hadn't looked hard enough before:
Debian provides NDBM with the libc6 package), the above results in
attempting to use GDBM (as I'm sure you can tell). Perhaps that should
be

  for dir in /usr/include /usr/include/db1 /usr/include/gdbm; do
    if test -f $dir/ndbm.h; then
      ....
    elif test -f $dir/gdbm-ndbm.h; then
      ....
    fi
  done

?

And maybe it would be useful to add a -dbm-includes option to the
configure script, to help people work around this sort of situation. I
suspect I'm not the only person with more than one DBM library.
