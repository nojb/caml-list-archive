Hello,

I am currently working on OCaml bindings for the samba library and I =
have encountered the following problem:

The library (written in C) I need to include (smbclient) in my program =
uses a fonction nammed string_set and so has Ocaml. I don't need this =
function in
my code but it is used inside the library.

I have two files in my library: the C one compiles to smbclient.o and =
the OCaml one to smbclient.cmo.

I can compile the program without warning by doing :
ocamlc -cclib lsmbclient -custom smbclient.o smbclient.cmo

But during the link phase Ocamlc links string_set to his own function , =
resulting a segmentation fault in the program.

 Does anyone know how I can compile my program in order that every call =
at string_set in the smbclient library use the function string_set =
located in that library ?

Thanks,

Ga=E9tan
