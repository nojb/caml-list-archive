                 CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

                       ECOOP 2004

    18th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming

                    June 14-18, 2004

                 University of Oslo, Norway

             http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004/


ECOOP is the premier forum in Europe for bringing together
practitioners, researchers, and students to share their ideas and
experiences in a broad range of disciplines woven with the common
thread of object technology. It is a well integrated collage of
events, including outstanding invited speakers, carefully refereed
technical papers, real world experiences in the form of practitioner
reports, exciting panels, topic focused workshops, late-breaking
demonstrations, and an interactive posters session.


TECHNICAL PAPERS

The ECOOP 2004 conference invites high quality papers reporting
research results and/or experience related to object technology.
Research papers should describe work that advances the current
state of the art.  Experience papers should be of broad interest
and should describe insights gained from practical application of
object technology - of use to other researchers and practitioners.
The program committee will evaluate each contributed research and
experience paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity,
originality, and correctness.  Suggested topics related to the
object oriented paradigm include, but are not limited to:


        Analysis and design methods
        Concurrent, real-time, and parallel systems
        Database and object persistence
        Design patterns
        Distributed and mobile systems
        Frameworks and software architectures
        Language design and implementation
        Object testing and metrics
        Programming environments
        Reflection, aspects and adaptability
        Theoretical foundations, formal methods
        Versioning, compatibility, software evolution


The conference will in particular welcome novel contributions
based on new ideas or new areas for OO technology.


Submission Guidelines

Technical papers should be electronically submitted through
the ECOOP 2004 online submission system
(will be available via http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004).
Other submissions will not be accepted. For information about
formatting your paper please consult the Springer LNCS webpage

Papers must be written in English, and be not longer than
10,000 words or 25 pages in Springer LNCS format. Referees will
be allowed to ignore any material exceeding that
limit for their evaluation. Papers arriving late or clearly
longer than the limit will be rejected immediately by the
Program Chair.

Please notice that ECOOP, along with other scientific conferences,
accepts only original papers that have not been published and are
not under review for publication elsewhere. Any double submissions
will be rejected without review, and the other forum will be
informed of the situation.


Important Dates:

        Start of electronic submission:         Nov 1, 2003
        Deadline for submission:                Dec 1, 2003 (12pm GMT)
        Notification of acceptance:             Feb 9, 2004

TUTORIALS

ECOOP 2004 hosts a two-day tutorial program. Proposals for
high-quality tutorials in all areas of object-orientation from
academic research to industrial applications are solicited.
Tutorials are set up to last a half or full day, and should give
a deeper or more covering insight into a particular area of
object technology than a conventional lecture would do.
Tutorial levels may be introductory, intermediate, or advanced.
The main criteria for selecting tutorials will be the intrinsic
interest and timeliness of the topic.
Topics of broad interest will be preferred.

Proposals should be electronically submitted through the
ECOOP 2004 online submission system
(will be available via http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004).

Deadlines:

        Proposal submission:                    Dec 1, 2003
        Notification of acceptance:             Feb 1, 2004

WORKSHOPS

ECOOP 2004 will host a number of workshops addressing different
areas of object-oriented technology. Workshops serve as a forum
for exchanging late breaking ideas and theories in an evolutionary
stage. They typically focus on either in depth analysis or
broad-ranging approaches to areas related to object-oriented
technology.

Proposals should be electronically submitted through the
ECOOP 2004 online submission system
(will be available via http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004).


Deadlines:

        Proposal submission:                    Dec 1, 2003

DEMOS, POSTERS, EXHIBIT AND PRACTITIONERS REPORT

Live demonstrations of all kinds of object-oriented software
will be presented at the conference. Technical members of the
implementation teams are expected to give the demonstrations.
Proposals are solicited for both  commercial and in-house systems,
as well as academic and corporate research. Demonstration will be
selected on the basis of technical merit, novelty and relevance
to object-oriented technology. Product marketing and sales
presentations are inappropriate for this forum.

Posters provide authors with a unique opportunity make ongoing
work visible and to get feedback. Posters are especially useful
for presenting new ideas that have not yet been developed to
the point of a regular paper. PhD students in particular are
encouraged to submit a poster proposal describing their work.
Poster descriptions should be 2-3 pages in the same style as
paper submissions and should also have an additional cover page
(as a 'separate' first page in your document).

At ECOOP there has traditionally been an exhibition of products
and services related to object-orientation. The exhibition will
be set up next to the main conference area, where participants
have the opportunity to visit the stands, even during short breaks.

ECOOP also welcomes practitioners reports and plan to set up a
separate session of such reports from industry. Typically, a report
will describe a project using OO-technology emphasizing some
interesting experience. To many participants at ECOOP, these reports
give a valuable insight into practical applications of OO technology.

Proposals should be electronically submitted through the
ECOOP 2004 online submission system
(will be available via http://www.ifi.uio.no/ecoop2004).
