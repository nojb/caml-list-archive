One suggestion: "ocamlc -v" will print the path to the standard library
where ocamlc looks for pervasives.cmi and other interfaces, so you can
use this for troubleshooting.

The OCAMLLIB environment variable is always honored.  However, the
installer knows how to set it to the correct value under Win NT, 2K
and XP.  Under 98 and ME, the installer does nothing to set the
variable and this must be done manually, e.g. via autoexec.bat.

Hope this helps,
