Both ocamldep and ocamldoc accept the -pp argument. Sometimes, it would be
more convenient to specify the syntax extensions directly in the Caml
sources. I think that OCamlMakefile has some support for that.

Note that ocamlcp/ocamlprof don't support the -pp argument, however, and
to use the bytecode profiler, you'll indeed have to pretty print...
