Hi All

although I have not yet posted this on the Caml web-site, my group and I 
have written  several significant computer vision and robotics 
applications in Caml. You might be amused to know that last week, 
Caml-generated output made it on CNN Headline News and CNN Next, a show 
about emerging technology. The same segment might be aired on CNN 
International this weekend. The clips are on this page:

Look for the segment where 10 ants are tracked, which was done by 
Caml-code written by Zia Khan and myself. Next up for us is translating 
the bee dance, in Caml :-)

Best Regards
Frank Dellaert
