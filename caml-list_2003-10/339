IIRC, you can shorten it a bit when the framework is in a standard
location:
    ./configure -tkdefs "-I/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Headers
         -I/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Headers" -tk-no-x11
        -tklibs "-framework Tcl -framework Tk"

Not that this changes much :-)

However, my experience with the Aqua Tk is lots of strange behaviour,
so my suggestion would be to do yourself a favor, and install the X11
Tk, which works flawlessly. Not also that lablGL's Togl widget works
only with the X11 Tk  (as Togl does not support Aqua Tk to start with).

Interesting. I'll take a look at this, but your following comments
about strange behaviours with ocamlbrowser confirm that it's probably
not worth investing too much time in it.

By the way, isn't anybody working on a direct interface to Aqua, to be
able to write Aqua application ocaml?  This would be much nicer than a
half-baked Tk interface. Is GNUstep compatible enough to offer some
kind of portability?
