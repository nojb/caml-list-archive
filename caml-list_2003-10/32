We were working on bindings from OCaml to COIN a few months ago, this
gives you access to a fairly serious (and 'free') simplex optimizer as
well as drivers for commercial codes. We were considering GPLing it but
have dropped that ball for the moment. But let us know if you're
interested. 

Also we had something that resembles an algebraic modelling language
that makes it very easy to put an LP together, it all needs some work
for general use though...

Alternatively you might consider interfacing the GNU Linear Programming
Toolkit.

Subject: [Caml-list] linear programming library in OCaml


I've been looking for (an interface to) a linear programming librairy in
OCaml, 
and I didn't find. Does it exists ?
If not, I would be interested in helping a project to write an interface
for 
one of the numerous linear programming tools, but I'm a newbie in LP (so
I 
don't know anything about LCP for instance, as I saw in a thread on this
list). Thanks, Jean-Baptiste Rouquier
