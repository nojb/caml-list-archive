While it's nice to have stopgap solutions to these "problems", IMO the right
solution will be possible when we have some kind of overloading in the language.
Rather than having lots of squirrelly notations for hashtable access (and string
access, and BigArray access, and...) we should just be able to index like arrays
and be done with it. Lack of user defined overloading has always been a weak
point in the entire ML family of languages, IMO.

Hopefully, now that 3.07 is out, work on GCaml proceeds apace...
