Yes, that's it exactly. Since it's very hard to anticipate exactly where
header files will be located, maybe it would be better to do two loops,
first searching for ndbm.h in all the directories, then searching for
gdbm-ndbm.h only if ndbm.h was not found. The following code works for
me:

  for dir in /usr/include /usr/include/db1 /usr/include/gdbm; do
    if test -f $dir/ndbm.h; then
      dbm_include=$dir
      if sh ./hasgot dbm_open; then
        dbm_link=""
      elif sh ./hasgot -lndbm dbm_open; then
        dbm_link="-lndbm"
      elif sh ./hasgot -ldb1 dbm_open; then
        dbm_link="-ldb1"
      elif sh ./hasgot -lgdbm dbm_open; then
        dbm_link="-lgdbm"
      elif sh ./hasgot -lgdbm_compat -lgdbm dbm_open; then
        dbm_link="-lgdbm_compat -lgdbm" 
      fi
      break
    fi
  done
  if [ "$dbm_include" = "not found" ]; then
    for dir in /usr/include /usr/include/db1 /usr/include/gdbm; do
      if test -f $dir/gdbm-ndbm.h; then
        dbm_include=$dir
        use_gdbm_ndbm=yes
        if sh ./hasgot -lgdbm_compat -lgdbm dbm_open; then
          dbm_link="-lgdbm_compat -lgdbm"
        elif sh ./hasgot -lgdbm dbm_open; then
          dbm_link="-lgdbm"
        fi
        break   
      fi
    done
  fi
