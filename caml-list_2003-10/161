This is strange enough: apparently under ocaml 3.06 you were using
Berkeley DB rather than gdbm. This is coherent with the configure
script, which tries Berkeley DB (db1) before gdbm.
Now, for some reason Berkeley DB seems not to work on your system now
(you could try to configure ocaml 3.06 again to see that).
So I think the change is in your system not in ocaml itself.
Did you remove some library?

There seems to be another problem with gdbm-ndbm.h being ignored if
there is no gdbm_compat library, which might have to be fixed, but I'm
no gdbm exert. gdbm-ndbm.h was not checked on ocaml 3.06, but it has
lower priority than ndbm.h anyway.
