You may want to consider putting the data for a given transaction type
into its own type, and having that be the target of the hashtbl.

   type transaction_info = {
     mutable counts : int;
     mutable times : int;
   }

Then your results could just be a

   (int * (string, transaction_info) Hashtbl.t) list

BTW, this actually seems like a good problem for learning the language.
I seem to always choose things too difficult, and end up getting
frustrated.

BTW, I have found the .mli files for the libraries to be the best
documentation.
