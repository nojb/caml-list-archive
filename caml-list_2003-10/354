That was not my problem. My problem was to be able to read a list of integers from a file and be warned in case of overflow. And to be able to rely on int_of_string for that purpose. I got hit... of course now I know, but other innocent programmers may get hit in the future as well. (Not to speak of the not-so-innocent people who wrote this nice OCaml compiler ;-)
