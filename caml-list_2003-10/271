It is a little hard, since I can't tell what you're trying to represent.
Also, a hashtable might not be the best data structure.

What information are you trying to keep track of?  A hashtable maps
objects of one type to another.  If you wanted the pb_counts field to
map strings to int refs (so you can change the refs), you could use a

   pb_counts: (string, int ref) Hashtbl.t

without more information, it is hard to tell if that is what you really
want.

Ocaml also has arrays, maps, sets, and there are numerous libraries with
other structures as well.
