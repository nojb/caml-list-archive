                           Second workshop on 
           SEMANTICS, PROGRAM ANALYSIS, AND COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS 
                          FOR MEMORY MANAGEMENT 
                   http://www.diku.dk/topps/space2004/
                      Venice, Italy, 12 January 2004 


                      Sponsored by the ACM/SIGPLAN.
                      (subject to final approval).

Memory management is a difficult engineering task.  We desperately
need new tools and analyses that can identify memory management errors
in low-level C/C++ code, such as dereferencing a pointer to an object
that has been recycled or failing to reclaim an object.  We also need
new data structures and algorithms to avoid overheads such as
fragmentation and synchronization.  High-level languages such as Java
or ML insulate the programmer from many of these problems through
automatic memory management techniques (e.g., garbage collection).
But standard GC techniques are not always suitable for all domains.
For instance, programmers for embedded and real-time systems need
static guarantees about resource requirements that are difficult to
meet with standard collection algorithms.  New languages, logics,
analyses, and type systems are needed that let us reason about the
management of memory, time, and other critical resources.  The aim of
this workshop is to bring together researchers for a fruitful exchange
of ideas on semantics, program analysis and computing environments for
memory management.

SCOPE: Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 

  * alternative memory management strategies (.e.g, region- or reap-based)
  * memory management for constrained (embedded, real-time, etc.) systems 
  * analyses for optimization of memory management
  * analyses for faults in manual memory management
  * types, semantics, logics, and calculi for memory management
  * applications of statically controlled memory management 
  * empirical results for new or existing memory management strategies

TIME AND PLACE: The workshop takes place in Venice on 12 January 2004. 
It is co-located with POPL 2004, which takes place January 14-16, 2004.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission deadline: midnight EST, Thursday 20th November
Electronic PC meeting: Mon/Tues 1/2 December
Notification: Tues 2 December
Final copy: midnight, Friday 19 December
Conference: Mon, 12 January

FORMAT: The workshop will consist of:

  * 25-minute presentations by authors of selected, peer-reviewed papers
  * 10-minute short presentations (non-peer reviewed)
  * two 45-minute invited talks (to be determined)
  * a series of "5-minute madness" talks as time permits

The long papers will be selected by a program committee and only
"lightly" reviewed.  Our goal in selecting papers is to meet our time
requirements and present a balanced program.  We hope to include all
of the short presentations, but may be forced to select a subset
depending on the number of submissions.  Again, our goal is to have a
productive, interactive workshop.

At lunch-time, participants will be able to sign up for a "5-minute
madness" talk slot (as time permits).  These talks will be limited to
at most 2 viewgraphs and are meant to give a brief, perhaps
provocative, viewpoint on the research issues in memory management and
to spark conversation.  A moderator will limit time according to the
excitement generated by the presentation.

INFORMAL PROCEEDINGS:

We will distribute an informal proceedings at the workshop only.  We
do not consider the proceedings to be a formal (citable) publication so
that any works in progress presented here may be submitted later for
formal publication.

The informal proceedings for the workshop will consist of the accepted
papers, and titles and abstracts for the short presentations.

SUBMISSION DETAILS:

Submitted papers should be put in PDF or Postscript format and
attached to an email message sent to space2004@it.edu.
Papers should be sent by Thursday 20th November 2003 no later than 
midnight Easter Standard Time (4:00am, Friday 21st November UTC).  

Long Papers:

Authors should submit a 12 page extended abstract formatted using the
ACM LaTeX sig-alternate format
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html).  Accepted final
papers will be allowed to be longer (up to 20 pages).

Short Presentations:

Authors should submit a 2-3 page abstract formatted using the ACM LaTeX
sig-alternate format (http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html).
The title should start with "Short Presentation: ".

location, invited talks, participation, etc.

REGISTRATION: For information on registration, accommodation etc,
