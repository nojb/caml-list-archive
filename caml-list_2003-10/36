So i suppose this is the same as the one in CVS. I have had reports from
Maxence that this solves the cameleon build problem, but you may already
know that, and indeed it fixed also the problem showing up in planets.

So you will just do a new version of 3.07 ? What about bumbing the
version number to 3.07.1 or something such ?

Would this be the right oportunity to open a bugfix branch in the CVS ?
This would make it easier for ocaml distributors to track the important
fixes out of the CVS, and make sure the fixed versions of ocaml floating
around are in a somewhat consistent state, and that some important fix
may or may not be applied to some of them.

I understand that you are afraid that this will cause you more work,
because you have to test both version, but i think that this may not be
that problematic as you fear, since the number of fixes to this branch
will usually be not that numerous, and you can also rely on the
distributors to do some of the testing for you.

This would make live easier for all ocaml user, and is a feature that is
needed for ocaml to be more professionally perceived.
