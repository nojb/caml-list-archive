	That's exactly what I did, 'cept my time is a float.  :)

	Well, part of the problem is that my log files aren't necessarily 
sequential, so I have to be able to go back to any point in time and 
update the thing.  Other than that, that's about right (from what I can 
read of that syntax so far).

	It's still plenty foreign to me, but this is complex enough to help me 
out with a bunch of concepts in the language.  What amazes me is the 
lack of resources I've been able to find in ocaml so far (just 
googling).  It seems like caml's been around for a while, and it works 
quite well.

	I wrote these log processor things in python originally because I know 
it pretty well, but it doesn't run very fast.  In my early tests, ocaml 
and bigloo ran at roughly the same speed, and caml seems very foreign 
to me.  However, recently, I've had a few instability problems with 
bigloo under certain circumstances.  I rewrote that app in ocaml and it 
was many, many times faster and it worked more reliably.

	Yeah, but I still couldn't figure out how to make a Map, assuming 
that's what I really wanted in the first place.  A hash table that 
iterates in key sorted order would make my app faster and reduce 
complexity.  I want to see it actually work first, though.  :)
