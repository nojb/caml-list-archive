CALL FOR PAPERS

First International Workshop on "Applications of Language Engineering
Techniques
in Many-Core Compilers (ALLIANCE)", co-located with the 2016 "International
Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO)" in Barcelona (Spain).

http://www.cfaed.tu-dresden.de/workshop/alliance/

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission deadline: 21st of December 2015
Author notification: 25th of January 2016
Camera ready version: 12th of February 2016
Workshop date: 13th of March 2016

All dates are Anywhere on Earth.

SCOPE

Declarative and high-level approaches in software language engineering have
been
developed and successfully applied for decades. This includes research and
tools
related to grammarware (i.e., grammar-based software), automatic graph and
term-rewrite systems as well as model-based transformations and analyses.
These
techniques have proven to be valuable in particular for the development of
high-level
translators and language abstractions, typically in terms of domain specific
languages (DSLs). However, these kinds of research tools are not widely
used for
general purpose programming languages, let alone in the design of compiler
backends.
One reason  for this is that high-quality compiler implementations for
languages like
C, C++ or Java are provided by established hand-written compiler
infrastructures like
GCC, LLVM or ICC. And because languages and computer architectures have been
relatively stable, maintenance costs of these infrastructures was
reasonable.
However, the emerging many-core architectures require new language
abstractions for
parallel programming and corresponding backend support, which increases
maintenance
costs of hand-written compiler infrastructures.

Subject of the workshop therefore is the application of language engineering
techniques for the implementation of many-core compilers. Examples for such
applications are the development of DSLs acting as a source-code
preprocessor
injecting parallelization means by using grammarware; or transformation
rules
preparing intermediate representations for many-core execution by using
rewriting
techniques. This includes software application-specific many-core support
by means of
software language engineering techniques. The intention of the workshop is
to foster
communication and beneficial cooperation between language engineers,
compiler
developers and many-core programmers.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Transformation techniques and tools in compilers
- Applications of graph and term-rewrite systems in many-core compiler
backends
- Model-driven approaches to compiler development
- Component models for compilers
- Efficient high-level approaches for program analyses
- Case studies of language engineering for many cores
- Language-engineering based applications for many cores
- Approaches for parallelism extraction
- Positive and negative experience reports

SUBMISSION & PUBLICATION

Our intention is to foster communication between researchers and
practitioners in the
topics addressed by ALLIANCE. Hence, research papers, reports on ongoing
research,
experience reports and tool papers are the favorite types of submissions.

It is intended to publish the workshop proceedings as CEUR Workshop
Proceedings
(CEUR-WS.org), an open access journal (ISSN 1613-0073). Papers should
follow the
EPTCS style (http://style.eptcs.org/) and should not exceed a length of 8
pages.
Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently be
submitted
for publication elsewhere. Each paper will be reviewed thoroughly by
members of the
ALLIANCE program committee.

Submission is made via Easychair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dalliance-2016

CONTACT

The workshop is organized by Sven Karol (TU Dresden, Germany) and Christoff
B=C3=BCrger
(Lund University, Sweden). For any questions or concerns about the call for
papers,
please contact the workshop chairs at alliance2016@easychair.org.
