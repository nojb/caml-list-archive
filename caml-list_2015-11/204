Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Do you use a debugger with OCaml? If not, why not?

I started implementing a small debugger using PPX. Actually the tool
provide only "logs" but if I have more time,
I will write more features (like loop/recursion log/breakpoint, watch etc).

https://github.com/xvw/ppx_debugger

The code was writted fast, It'll open to improvement.

When I was doing ios work you could just set a break point in the ide by cl=
