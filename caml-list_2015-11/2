=3D=3D=3D Objectives and scope =3D=3D=3D

Applying formal methods may involve the usage of different formalisms and d=
ifferent analysis techniques to validate a system, either because individua=
l components are most amenable to one formalism or technique, because one i=
s interested in different properties of the system, or simply to cope with =
the sheer complexity of the system. The iFM conference series seeks to furt=
her research into hybrid approaches to formal modeling and analysis; i.e., =
the combination of (formal and semi-formal) methods for system development,=
 regarding both modeling and analysis.  The conference covers all aspects f=
rom language design through verification and analysis techniques to tools a=
nd their integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
  - Formal and semi-formal modelling notations
  - Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
  - Hybrid systems
  - Program verification
  - Program synthesis
  - Model checking
  - Static analysis
  - Runtime analysis, monitoring, performance evaluation
  - Decision procedures, SAT and SMT solving
  - Software engineering
  - Component-based systems (compositional, embedded, distributed, etc.)
  - Testing
  - Abstraction and refinement

=3D=3D=3D Submission guidelines =3D=3D=3D

iFM 2016 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or exp=
erience reports related to the overall theme of method integration.

We solicit papers in the following categories:

  - research papers (max. 15 pages including bibliography)
  - regular tool papers (max. 15 pages including bibliography)
  - short tool papers (max. 8 pages including bibliography)
  - case study papers (max. 15 pages including bibliography)

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for public=
ation elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. If nece=
ssary, a paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which wi=
ll be consulted at the discretion of the reviewers.

Submissions should be made using the iFM 2016 Easychair site: https://www.e=
asychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=3Difm2016
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; we =
suggest to use the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, available in =
llncs2e.zip and the typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip as a template fo=
r your contribution). The conference proceedings will be published in Sprin=
ger's Lecture Notes in ComputerScience series.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must=
 be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of=
 each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early date, to =
be indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.
