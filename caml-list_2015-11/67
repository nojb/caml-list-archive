Please, the problem with C++ for functional programming isn't that you 
have to specify the types of functions; it's that the syntax of types in 
C++ is completely inside-out and insane.  I've been programming in C 
since the 70's and I *still* find it confusing.  OCaml type notation, 
like Algol 68 type notation, is a breath of fresh air by comparison.

And of course, that C++ doesn't have first-class functions.  Or has that 
changed recently?

In any case, the problem with OCaml's apparent typelessness isn't that 
you don't have to write the types, it's that when you see someone  
else's code you can't read the types.
