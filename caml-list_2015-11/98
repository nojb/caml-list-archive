Glad to hear that.
Btw, which amqp-server have you tested against?

Async is not to blame here.

The answer should have been 'just close the channel / connection to make 
sure all queues are flushed', but it seems I forgot to implement it. I 
will try and implement it this weekend, along with per message and per 
queue flushing.

In the meantime, if you are using rabbitmq then you can enable confirms 
when creating the channel. Publishing will then return only when 
rabbitmq has acknowledged the message.

I don't know how to make is searchable, but ocamldoc generated 
documentation is available there:
