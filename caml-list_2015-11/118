Subject: [Caml-list] Call For Presentations: Compose 2016, New York, Feb 4-5

I'm forwarding this announcement on behalf of Gershom Bazerman. The Compose
conference had a great set of talks last year, and I recommend it to anyone
who can make it out to New York City in February.

--
Compose is a conference for typed functional programmers, focused
specifically on Haskell, OCaml, F#, and related technologies. It will
be held in New York on Thursday and Friday, Feb 4-5, 2016.
Registration will be open shortly.

http://www.composeconference.org/

To get a sense of Compose, you can check out the great talks from the
2015 conference: http://www.composeconference.org/2015/summary/

Below is our call for presentations. We recognize the deadline is
tight, so feel free to submit proposals and ideas on the less-polished
side.

http://www.composeconference.org/2016/cfp/

* * *

The audience for Compose is Haskell, OCaml, F#, or SML developers who
are looking to increase their skills or learn new technologies and
libraries. Presentations should be aimed at teaching or introducing
new ideas or tools. We are also interested in presentations aiming at
taking complex concepts, such as program derivation, and putting them
into productive use. However proposals on anything that you suspect
our audience may find interesting are welcome. The following are some
of the types of talks we would welcome:

Library/Tool Talks =E2=80=94 Exploring the uses of a powerful toolkit or
library, be it for parsing, testing, data access and analysis, or
anything else.

Production Systems =E2=80=94 Experience reports on deploying functional
techniques in real systems; insights revealed, mistakes made, lessons
learned.

Theory made Practical =E2=80=94 Just because it=E2=80=99s locked away in pa=
pers
doesn=E2=80=99t mean it=E2=80=99s hard! Accessible lectures on classic resu=
lts and why
they matter to us today. Such talks can include simply introducing the
principles of a field of research so as to help the audience read up
on it in the future; from abstract machines to program derivation to
branch-and-bound algorithms, the sky=E2=80=99s the limit.

We also welcome proposals for more formal tutorials. Tutorials should
be aimed at a smaller audience of beginner-to-novice understanding,
and ideally include hands-on exercises.

The due date for submissions is December 14, 2015. We will send out
notice of acceptance by December 24th. We prefer that submissions be
via the EasyChair website
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcompose2016). Please suggest
a title, and describe the topic you intend to speak on. Talks can be
either 30 or 45 minutes, please indicate how much time you would
prefer to take.

Additional information may be included on both your expertise and the
interesting elements of your topic, going on what might be included in
a public abstract. Furthermore, if your abstract doesn't feel
"final"=E2=80=94don't worry! We'll work with you to polish it up. If you wa=
nt
to discuss your proposal(s) before submitting, or to further nail down
what you intend to speak on, please feel free to contact us at
info@composeconference.org. We're happy to work with you, even if you
are a new or inexperienced speaker, to help your talk be great.

* * *

Diversity

We would like to put an emphasis on soliciting a diverse set of
speakers - anything you can do to distribute information about this
CFP and encourage submissions from under-represented groups would be
greatly appreciated. We welcome your contributions and encourage you
to apply!

Best,
Gershom
