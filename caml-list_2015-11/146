Nice to know.

It is just for not creating another xml type and simpler composition of ocaml libraries.

The functor solution used by cohttp (for allowing lwt or async) for example is a nice one, and 
flambda should eliminate most of the cost of it (on a side note, does @inline work for functor 
application?)

However in this case since the differences is about typing and not just the implementation, I'm not 
sure you can define a generic functor that could be applied with instance (NetHttp, tyxml, yours) 
that restricts differently the function applications.
