Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Do you use a debugger with OCaml? If not, why not?

I haven't used oqamldebug - perhaps it should be more widely publicized?
Perhaps linked to from the ocamldebug doc?

That said, println is my tool of choice, although I hear good things about
printf :)

I think that, because of lack of resources, we probably have to accept
that, as far as debuggers and IDEs are concerned, we are going to be stuck
where we are for the forseeable future (emacs+speedbar in my case).

Recently I have been programming in scala. It is an interesting language. I
wouldn't say it is better than OCaml, but the tooling and IDE support is
much better (and the libraries... wow!), and as a consequence the
programming experience is more enjoyable (for me personally, YMMV). Not
having to write a make file is already a big win.
