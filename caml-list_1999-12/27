I believe you've misunderstood the license.  If you write code in O'Caml,
the license doesn't impose anything on your software's license.  The
LGPL license on the runtime might force you to ensure that your program
is physically separate from the runtime so that the runtime can be replaced
by your customers if they so desire, but this says nothing about the
license under which your software is distributed.

If your software is a modification of O'Caml then indeed, the license might
impose restrictions, but it's only fair.

The FSF, RedHat, Cygnus and others are proofs that your "no one"
is incorrect.
