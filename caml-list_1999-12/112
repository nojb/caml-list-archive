I've just met Caml as a result of being introduced to GenWeb  
(http://pauillac.inria.fr/~ddr/GeneWeb/) which requires ocaml and camlp4 2.01  
or greater for compilation.  My current system in a NeXT computer  (NS3.3 on  
original motorola 68040 hardware), which seems to be a supported architecture  
for the bytecode compiler, but compiling has not been successful. The archives  
have a port of Caml Light for NeXTSTEP from 1991 but nothing more recent.  
Anyone have experience with Caml on NeXT that could giude me through this  
compilation?
