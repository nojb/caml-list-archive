To resolve this problem, instead of:

     try
       let x = exp in
       f x
     with Exception -> y

you can use the equivalent (but the call to "f" is tail):

      match (try Some exp with Exception -> None) with
        Some x -> f x
      | None -> y

I use that thousands of times in my code, when needed.
