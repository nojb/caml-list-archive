As a general comment on this thread, I'd like to add that questions of
syntax should take into account the advanced features of modern editors.
It is probably not necessary to force a syntax which explicitely groups
expressions belonging together as long as the parser can group them
without: colorizing and/or font changes done by the editors make things
even more readable.

Regards,
Markus Mottl
