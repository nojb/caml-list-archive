Since I do a great deal of bluk math processing, it would sure be nice if
many of the simpler transcendental functions could be inlined by OCAMLOPT.
I'm speaking primarily of round_to_int, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan,
atan2, log, exp, sqrt, etc.

I modified the 2.02 compiler to support these and found that the necessary
changes were really quite easy to make. But I don't look forward to making
these same mods every time a new compiler is released.

Of course I am working on Pentium class machines which have these functions
available in hardware. Other arhitectures might not be so kind in this
regard...
