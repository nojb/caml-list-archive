Yes, we have some work in progress in this direction.  The idea is
to attach to "finalized" blocks a record of C functions, supporting
not only finalization, but also equality test, hashing, marshalling
and unmarshalling.  This would be useful not only for large arrays,
but also for other datatypes in the Caml library such as big integers.
