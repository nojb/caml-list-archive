I understand that people will have different preferences, but supporting
two syntaxes has severe disadvantages. As an interim approach it is OK but 
it will be harder for beginners and may split the users development
efforts. I understand the arguments for both styles, so I haven't yet
decided what I'll do. Since I'm pretty tolerant of verbosity (Ada user:-) 
I'll probably try to exclusively use the modern mode.
