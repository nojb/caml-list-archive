	Of course: those with jobs working for Universities
of other institutions often forget where THEIR pay packets
come from. So they want to create a pool of software
exclusive to them. This is not freedom.

	This includes modifications to the library.

	Binaries produced by gcc can link dynamically to the
libraries, and so do not contain them.

	Yes, when the funding comes from some large organisation.
I'm a small organisation :-)

	When I have enough money coming in to be able to eat,
keep a roof over my head, and pay for computing facilities,
then perhaps I feel more confident giving away sources on the
basis that eventually enough people will want to pay me for support.

	In my eyes, the people that fund the research own the results:
the public usually. But that is not the same as GPL'd software, which
prohibits
people adding value hiding the added value.

	I agree that this is desirable. I would like to reach that
position. But until I do, for example, while seeking funding for
further research and development, I'd like the option of preventing
other, better funded, organisations simply stealing my efforts.
