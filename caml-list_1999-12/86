	WOW! i didn't expect this for ages!
Allow me to congratulate the team on this excellent and speedy work!
I'm impressed!! [2.02-3-4-99 in a few weeks!]

	Question: I see no mention of support for ocaml coded
finalisers. This is a feature that I heard might be supported,
and would be very useful to me, implementing python __del__ methods
in my ocaml based python interpreter, Viperi.
Can someone tell me the status of this issue? 
[Should I wait, or cobble up my own solution?]
