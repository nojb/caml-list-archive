What's append when we change the finalization parameters values ?
We alloc an object of type toto with 1,200 and another object toto with
9,146

It's the last number which is keep by GC (here 146) and erase previous
value (200)
The same with the pound (1 and 9) or they are adding -> 1+9 = 10 < 146 ?

Thanks,
