Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows, written in
OCaml. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories
to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
changes in each replica to the other.

The current release is available for download here:

    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison

There are still some rough edges, but the core functionality is
working pretty well for us now.  Hackers should find it reasonably
straightforward to deal with.  We'd appreciate input from the ML
community as we move toward a more public distribution.

Announcements of major releases will be posted on public lists very
occasionally.  To keep abreast of upgrades, use the URL above to add

Share and enjoy,
