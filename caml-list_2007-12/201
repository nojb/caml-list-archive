I would love something like this. I've used "ctypes", a similar library 
for Python, a few times, and it has really come in handy. Not something 
I want to use often (at least not directly), but for those times when 
use of an unsupported C library is necessary, it's so nice to have the 
ability to stay within the language rather than writing a bunch of 
wrapper code. I wonder if something like ctypes would translate well to 
a statically typed language like OCaml.
