I'm just battling with ocamlbrowser, trying to write a simple LablGTK2 app, 
and it occurs to me that it should be a Web 2.0 app that actively generates 
representations of OCaml APIs and augments them with hyperlinks.

This would have two main advantages:

1. You could go from one definition to a related definition simply by clicking 
on it (in ocamlbrowser you must navigate to the definition you're interested 
in each time).

2. You could go back to the definitions you just looked at by hitting 
the "back" button in the browser.

Perhaps an ocamljs guru could knock this up?! :-)
