Then Dr. Odersky and his listeners would be well served by a polite
correction. As Scala has been changing rapidly over the past year, he
surely understands that comments made on a 2 year old version of Scala
(Scala lacks lazy values, and structural typing, and existential types,
and...) don't reflect the current state of the language.

Other than that, I wouldn't let such comments deter me from investing
time in the language. If it does what I want (interoperate with the JVM
and Java) then what the users believe about OCaml is hardly relevant.
