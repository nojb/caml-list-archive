Yes, I suspect quite a few people would like these demos. I'll put them up on 
our site ASAP.

Essentially, OpenGL 2 lets you do per-pixel lighting from OCaml really easily 
and the results look absolutely fantastic: much better than OpenGL 1. You can 
also do much more sophisticated things (like the Mandelbrot shader I've got 
working) but its the basics that I really appreciate.

GLCaml makes this about as easy as it can be, although there are a couple of 
places where I'd like the types to be different. For example, I'd prefer 
strings instead of byte bigarrays for everything from shaders to variable 
names.

In summary, there's no reason for OCaml programmers to restrict themselves to 
OpenGL 1, at least not after Elliott fixes the minor bugs I found.
