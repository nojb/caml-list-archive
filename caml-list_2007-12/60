No, simply that it may count a same block several times, because it was
moved by the GC during a resizing of the hash table, between the first
time it was seen and the next time it is reached from another block.

So you may only overestimate the size of the data. It should not fail,
and should terminate, even on cyclic values.

Jon is reporting segfaults, though, so there must be a bug somewhere in
my code (which uses Obj for obvious reasons). I'll have a look at it if
Jon is able to send some faulty application.
