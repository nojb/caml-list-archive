OCaml native code compiler uses system thread which is heavy, so you
shouldn't expect a large number of them running in parallel. In my box,
300+ threads will usually run out of virtual memory.

n=16 works and n=17 doesn't, probably means the n=16 version finishes
earlier so you haven't got chance to create enough threads to eat up
your memory, while n=17 version last longer so that the limit is
reached. You may try to add some printf to the thread creation function
to monitor the upper bound.

I don't know any workaround, in the absence of VM threads being able to
compile to native code (I asked a question on the topic once in the
beginner's list). Using user-land cooperative threads is probably
considered as cheating here.
