Cygwin and MSYS are very different. Calling one another's fork is like saying 
that Linux and FreeBSD are both UNIX forks.

Cygwin is a make-believe unix environment on WIndows. It's a big hack.

MSYS is just a bunch of Unix tools ported to run *natively* on Windows.

Cygwin is a common requirement because it makes things simpler on the surface. 
When in fact, it makes everything much worse off.

Cheers, Kuba
