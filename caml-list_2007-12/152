Just to give my 2 cents also, i fully agree with the view above. If
ocamlbuild could integrate with ocamlfind (for library installation and
for library use) this would be a great step.

The only thing I disagree with the above message, is that ocamlfind
should not be integrated into ocaml (i also think integrating ocamlbuild
is not the best move -- but that a VERY personnal point of view). I
think ocamlbuild should allow to very easily integrate with ocamlfind
(i.e. build something that as a semantic near the one provided by
ocamlfind for -package et al, and only provide a plugin to integrate
with ocamlfind). 

OCamlfind is the best tool around for managing libraries in ocaml.
OCaml distributions, like debian or godi, already provide a support for
it. Most of the time missing META file are even provided by these
distributions. Allowing an easy use of it could be a very good point for
all (and the continuation of an implicit policy).

I know there is already a piece of ocamlbuild plugin to integrate
ocamlfind, the BEST way to continue this work is to allow to fully
integrate ocamlfind and ocamlbuild through this work.
