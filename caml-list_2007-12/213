In fact, people at ENST do me a favor for this room. Maybe i can ask
them to change the day, but i am not sure if it will work. 

FYI, i have already invited 2 people for doing a short talk (~30 min):
- Nicolas Pouillard about ocamlbuild
- Gerd Stolpmann about GODI (and maybe findlib)

I was thinking to do a short talk myself about OCaml in Debian (maybe i
can ask other debian developer... but i have not done it yet).

The idea, is to have a short presentation before talking about OCaml.

I will set up a wiki page on cocan.org (if i can do it) and do a real
announcement.

Sylvain Le Gall
