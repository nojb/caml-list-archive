Me.

I don't have given any news lately, because i was discussing with ENST to
book a room for us.

I just have the answer from ENST (Telecom Paris): we got a room
(Amphitheater Jade) for January, the 26th 2008. 

We could stay there from 10AM to 6PM. 

I am looking for some other little things and i will do an official
announcement on the list.

Regards,
Sylvain Le Gall
