Hi,

I'm thinking of getting OCaml integrated as a scripting
language into a C++ application.

I had a hard time finding how one would go about getting the
bytecode compiler and bytecode interpreter integrated
in a library-like fashion. Of course I could have the
compiler and runtime invoked from within the C++ application,
and have an IPC with a "server" thread within the application.
But this seems to add too much overhead (both at runtime, and
in general code messiness).

Ideally, I'd like Guile that digs OCaml ;)

Cheers, Kuba
