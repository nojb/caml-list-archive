Another  way  would be to treat {{...}} as some kind of quotation, and then by
only  using  OCaml  pretty printer (instead of the parsetree marshaller) where
these quotation are printed as is.

However  this  solution also have a cost, you will lose locations by not using
marshalled parsetrees, so I won't really recommend this direction.

Let me know if you need more assistance on the Camlp4 side...

You will need some.
