I vote for (2), with this modified planning:
* begin at 10AM on saturday
* meeting all day
* diner in paris 
* organize some guided tour in Paris on Sunday...

FYI, i think it will be hard to find some meeting room on sunday. So
letting people visit Paris on Sunday is the best option (because it is
possible to visit paris on sunday).
