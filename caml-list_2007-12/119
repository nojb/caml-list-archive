Speaking of SDFlow, I've slightly extended it with three functions
to_array, to_stream and of_array. I may extend it a bit further, but I
don't think so. Do you accept submissions ?

I've also made use of SDFlow in a Camlp4 extension for stream
comprehension, by the way. I'll try and publish this within a few days.

Cheers,
 David
