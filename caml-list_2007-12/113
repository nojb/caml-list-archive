Subject: Announce: Jsure 1.0 Javascript checker

Hello all,

Jsure is a "lint" for Javascript, which is also known as Ecmascript.

It checks syntax and a little bit of semantics (it's difficult to do 
anything more sophisticated with real-world Javascript short of 
interpreting it).

We have been quite happy with it at Exalead for a few months now and so 
we decided to release it under the LGPL.

It is used daily to check the code in the Baagz http://baagz.com/ project.

It uses Aurochs as its parser (http://aurochs.fr/).

You can get it at:
