It is right that it clashes with JFLA. But the first two days at JFLA
are devoted to lectures, so some people do not attend JFLA all 4 days
but only the last two. Since Sylvain already booked a room at ENST, may
be we could first ask people not able to attend the meeting because of
JFLA to react immediately, so that we know how many they are (including
yourself, of course).

We could do both :-) First a rather informal meeting on Jan 26, and
later a more formal conference with invited speakers.
