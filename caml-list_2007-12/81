8th International Workshop on Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and Programming

July 14, 2008, Castle of Hagenberg, Austria

Important Dates
---------------

Title & abstract:  April 21, 2008
Paper submission:  April 28, 2008
Notification:  	   May 26,   2008
Final version: 	   June 16,  2008

Background
----------

The workshop promotes and stimulates research and collaboration in the
area of strategies. It encourages the presentation of new directions,
developments, and results as well as surveys and tutorials on existing
knowledge in this area. WRS 2008 collocates with RTA 2008, the 19th
International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications. For
more information, consult the WRS 2008 website.

Topics
------

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

* foundations for the definition and semantic description of reduction strategies
* strategies in rewriting, lambda calculi, narrowing, constraint solving
* strategies in programming languages
* strategies and tactics in theorem and termination proving
* properties of strategies and corresponding computations
* interrelations, combinations and applications of computation under different
  evaluation strategies
* analysis and optimization techniques for reduction strategies
* rewrite systems, tools and implementations with flexible strategies
* strategies suitable to software engineering problems and applications
* tutorials and systems related to strategies

Submission
----------

There are two categories of submissions:

(A) Submissions to the formal proceedings
    These submissions must describe unpublished work. Accepted submissions
    of this category will be published both in the informal and in the
    formal proceedings. The formal proceedings will be published after the
    workshop by Elsevier as a volume of ENTCS.

(B) Submissions to the informal proceedings
    These submissions may also describe work that has been or will be
    submitted or published elsewhere or work in progress. Accepted
    submissions of this category will be published in the informal
    proceedings, which will be distributed during the workshop. 

The page limit for papers in both categories is 15 pages in ENTCS style.
We also explicitly solicit survey and tutorial submissions (of either
category) which may be longer. The necessary style files and instructions
can be found at http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html. The submission page for
WRS 2008 is
