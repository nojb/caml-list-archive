Jeremy Gibbons has written a very detailed report on the 2007  
Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop.  His report is  
available from the CUFP web page (http:// 
cufp.functionalprogramming.com) as well as from the CUFP google group  
page (http://groups.google.com/group/cufp).  Thank you, Jeremy!

Peter Thiemann and his students are just finishing up the post  
processing of the recordings of the talks, and we are in the process  
of getting those talks loaded onto the web.  I'll send a further  
announcement when the talks are available.

Kathleen
