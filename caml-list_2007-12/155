+1

I agree with the date.

The gathering place will depend on the number of people coming and the
time (1h - 1 week end?) 

I tend to think that it is better to meet longer when trying to
implement something (setup a build environment take at least 1 hour, so
the meeting should last a lot longer than this...).

If the meeting is informal (2-3 hours), we could meet in a bar in Paris
(i have several proposition concerning this). If we want something
longer, we should contact people that have access to some better place
(ENST, ENS, Paris VI... Exalead?)

Maybe doing this during a week end should be a good solution.

I will be there anyway ;-)
