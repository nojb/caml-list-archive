Because this really mixes things up. The Ocaml build environment becomes very 
different from Ocaml execution environment. To a point where if, say, Ocaml's 
build process would use Ocaml at a late point in the process, you'd need two 
Ocaml builds: one native, one cygwin-based. The native one wouldn't dig any 
cygwin paths for example, yet would be what you want to use if you were to 
distribute Ocaml with your commercial application, for example.

Basically, at this point Ocaml is very Windows-unfriendly because of this 
attitude. For a good example of how it shuld work/look, see Trolltech's Qt, 
whose build process works just fine on Windows without bringing in Cygwin or 
even MSYS. It runs using various VC versions, as well as Mingw.

Cheers, Kuba
