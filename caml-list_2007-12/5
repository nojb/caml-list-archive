Nice -- I'll try the "host powerpc-unknown-linux" option.

This is exactly what I would like to do.  There is a Python Extension for
the PS3 SPU's called "CorePy" that can be used to more-or-less directly
generate assembly instructions for the PPC, its associated AltiVec and the
SPUs.  In essence, CorePy makes a class for each particular processor on
your system and this class has processor-specific instructions as methods. 
The extensions take care of the details for loading the code, binding
between the Python interpreter and the assembler that was generated on the
fly etc.

This would actually push the system's abilities up by an order of magnitude
in some cases, but unfortunately the "Other OS" hypervisor on the PS3 bars
access to the GPU.  It's a shame, since the PS3 GPU is supposed to be one of
NVIDIA's hottest chips.
