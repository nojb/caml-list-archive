Hello,

I agree.  I think Ocamlfind and Godi are nice pieces of work, and it 
certainly would be better if we could integrate existing systems.

We all love Ocaml, but there seems to be an important problem with it.

Unlike most programming languages of similar magnitude, Ocaml doesn't 
have a developer conference where its users could meet face-to-face and 
discuss these kind of things...  (or did I miss something?)  If not, we 
should organize one.

Ocaml users span half a dozen continents but we could start with a small 
gathering in Paris.  I'd suggest late January.

We could then discuss distribution, building, packaging and other 
issues;  and publish guidelines for a "request for implementation" -- 
things we would like to see in an integrated compilation and package 
manager.

People would then implement different solutions and we could gather two 
months later to evaluate the proposals.

Does anyone have a proposal for a gathering place?
