                    CALL FOR PAPERS

            Journal of Symbolic Computation

                   Special Issue on

    Automated Deduction: Decidability, Complexity, Tractability

    http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~sofronie/addct-special-issue.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This special issue is devoted to the scope of the workshop ADDCT'07:
Automated Deduction: Decidability, Complexity, Tractability, which
took place in Bremen (Germany) on July 2007. Topics of interest include
(but are not restricted to):

- Decidability:
   - decision procedures based on logical calculi such as:
     resolution, rewriting, tableaux, sequent calculi, or natural deduction
   - decidability in combinations of logical theories
   - specialized decision procedures
- Complexity:
   - complexity analysis for fragments of first- (or higher) order logic
   - complexity analysis for combinations of logical theories
     (including parameterized complexity results)
- Tractability (in logic, automated reasoning, algebra, ...)

- Application domains for which complexity issues are essential
  (verification, security, databases, ontologies, ...)


Submission procedure
====================

Submission to this special issue is completely open.
We expect original articles (typically 15-30 pages; submission of
larger papers will be evaluated depending on editorial constraints)
that present high-quality contributions that  have not been previously
published in an  archival venue and that must not be simultaneously
submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submissions must comply with JSC's author guidelines. They must be
written in English and should be prepared in LaTeX using the
"Elsevier Article Class (elsart.cls)" with "JSC add-on style (yjsco.sty)"
and "Harvard style references (elsart-harv.bst)". The package "JSC LaTex"
(that contains all the necessary style files and a template) can be obtained
from  http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hong/jsc/JSC_LaTex_2007_Mar_12.zip

The introduction of the paper MUST explicitly address the following
questions in succinct and informal manner:
     - What is the problem?
     - Why is the problem important?
     - What has so far been done on the problem?
     - What is the contribution of the paper on the problem?
     - Is the contribution original?     Explain why.
     - Is the contribution non-trivial?  Explain why.

Submission to this special issue are hereby encouraged via the EasyChair
submission system (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=addctjsc2008)..

The deadline for submissions is April 6th, 2008.
