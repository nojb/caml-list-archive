What about Saturday the 19th or Saturday the 26th in January?  Something 
like 14:00-18:00 should be fine I guess.

I think we could simply gather in a café -- I was not thinking of a 
"coding party" but more of a "what should we do to integrate building 
and packaging?"-like discussion.

We just need a quiet place with a bit of space.
