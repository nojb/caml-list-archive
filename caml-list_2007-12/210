Hi,

The 26th of january is the first day of JFLA, (a french conference on=20
functional programming, where many ocaml hackers go).
http://jfla.inria.fr/2008/index.html
So I guess this is not a good date for the ocaml meeting ... or many of us=
=20
won't be able to attend the meeting.

Why not take the time to organize the event? And invite a few speakers and=
=20
give them a few months to prepare their talks?

Regards,
Vincent Balat
