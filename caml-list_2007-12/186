Correct.  You can rest assured that some of us will attend.  I'd be
very happy to if the dates work out: it's always a pleasure for me to
meet OCaml users and contributors in person.  I'm also thinking how we
could help with organizing such an event, including through financial
support.  It's too bad INRIA doesn't have facilities in downtown Paris
to host the event.

Indeed.  There's plenty of initiatives that this community can take,
and we're more than willing to support them if we can.
