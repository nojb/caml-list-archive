While I'm not guaranteeing that I could come, I checked for Eurostar
prices to Paris from London and they range around the GBP 150 - 180
region, including one night in a hotel (Saturday).  Can probably do it
a little cheaper if I look around further.

I think for people coming from outside Paris, realistic options would
be:

(1) Try to do it all in one long day: leave wherever you live early on
a Saturday or Sunday morning, meeting in the afternoon of that same
day, leave on a late train.  This is the cheapest option because no
hotel stay needed, but probably gives us not very much time together.

(2) Do a weekend: leave on Saturday and arrive in Paris.  Short
meeting and/or social on Saturday evening.  Main meeting on Sunday,
leave Sunday late afternoon or evening.

Either way I don't think it will be very productive to have a meeting
in a cafe.  We'd need to book some sort of a conference room or ask a
caml-friendly company in Paris if we can take a room for the day.

Rich.
