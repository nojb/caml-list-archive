I see no reason why this would cause problems, as long as the data
pointer points to C data of the right shape and dimensions.  (Of
course, you could update the dimensions of the bigarray as
appropriate, if needed.)  I don't think I would document this, as I
wouldn't quite know how to word it in the docs, but you have my
encouragements to try and report problems if any.
