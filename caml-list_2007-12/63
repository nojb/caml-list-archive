X-Spam: no; 0.00; bindings:01 ocaml:01 bindings:01 swig:01 camlidl:01 ocaml:01 camlidl:01 findlib:01 corresponds:01 sourceforge:01 data:02 binding:02 library:03 library:03 somewhat:05 

I would like to announce the availability of some reasonably complete
OCaml bindings for the PLplot data plotting library [1].

These are separate from previously announced PLplot bindings [2] -
those used SWIG to generate the interface, while this set of bindings
uses camlidl.  These bindings are also somewhat more complete.

The code can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-plplot/

Requirements:
- OCaml (tested with 3.10.0, should work on older versions?)
- PLplot version 5.7.x or 5.8.x
- camlidl
- findlib

The license is the same as PLplot (LGPLv2+).

This code has been developed on a 32bit CentOS 5 system, using godi
for the OCaml installation.  I would be happy to hear about any
successes or failures on other systems.

There is currently only one example included, which corresponds to
example 11 on the PLplot website.  The PLplot documentation is a good
reference as this binding is very close to the C library.  There are
some OCaml specific items though, so feel free to ask if you have
questions or problems.

Enjoy!
