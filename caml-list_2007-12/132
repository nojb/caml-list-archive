Yes, so far I know it.

So, is it just a kind of pre-compilation?
The core-OCaml compiler will be the same?

Is the TryFinally-code slight enough, so that
it's behaving like handwritten OCaml? Did you look
at the TryFinally in detail?

I have not looked at the OCaml-compiler in detail,
but from what you wrote I would assume, there
are at least two parts.

Oh, well.... that's new to me.

I had not needed camlp4 so far. And I don't know if it makes sense to
look at it now, because there will be (or already is?) a replacement
(from 3.10 on?).

I hope the camlp4-tutorial will be updated to the camlp4-replacement.
Possibly later I might use it. Then it would be good to have
introductional material.

Ciao,
