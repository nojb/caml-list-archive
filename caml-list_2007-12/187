Oh, thank you for the notification. Here's my reply, again:

This also has the potential to simplify build files. This would be a  
Good Thing(tm). On the other hand it could cause troubles if one would  
want to use different extensions for different build configurations  
(the conditional compilation extension might make this desirable).  
This could probably be resolved by making the specified extension the  
default one and allowing one to override it on the command line.

A tool which emits something like an annotated AST containing  
information like unique ids for names, their AST types etc. would be  
very useful. It could be used for syntax highlighting as well as more  
intricate tasks like refactoring tools. This might prove to be very  
useful for IDE builders. I also made good experiences letting emacs  
query an interactive toplevel for completions etc (for a custom  
language). Steal.. erm getting inspiration from the lisp community
