algebra in the sciences, engineering, medicine, pure and 
applied mathematics, education and computer science.

The meeting will be run in the standard format where 
individuals are invited to organize a special session.  
Individuals can propose a special session by contacting
the conference chairs. More details on how to propose a 
session can be obtained from

    * http://math.unm.edu/aca.html 

All paper submissions must be directed 
to an organizer of an appropriate special session.
Deadline for proposing sessions is June 1, 2008. However,

submissions, don't hesitate to propose the session much
earlier, session can be fixed at any time.
