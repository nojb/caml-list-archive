Well, it was announced some time ago on the list by John Whitington,
from http://www.coherentgraphics.co.uk/. In recent announce, he also
wrote:

Copied from FOP web page:
Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter driven by
XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent formatter. It
is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and
renders the resulting pages to a specified output. Output formats
currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP, XML (area tree
representation), Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser extent, RTF and
TXT. The primary output target is PDF.

That's the way my little software works. It generates an .fo file and
transforms it by calling fop through Sys.command. A little heavy for
one simple page...

I also could have produced one PostScript version before a pstopdf call.
But direct .pdf production is something I want to learn ;-)

Thanks Oliver.

I will certainly have to parse AFM files in order to find font metrics
and use them in order to compute the dimensions I need, then...
