Any tips on how (and perhaps how not) to teach functors?  I'm using a
Haskell equivalent of functors (namely constructor classes) in an AI
class (!) and they seem to be mysterious.  It didn't seem to work to
explain the Java/C# code that I would like to write (but can't, because
these languages have no interface _on_ generics (as opposed to generic
interfaces)).

I use them to provide multiple interpretations of the same abstract
construction (each interpretation is a module and each abstract
construction is a functor from interpretation modules to result
modules).  Here is a description of a simple example:

One can show you aren't immediately killed by tidal forces once crossing
over the event horizon of Black Hole. Mathematically, your space coordinates
become time-like and vice versa. This causes a shift in your light
cone and your world line can never intersect with someone on the outside.
