Of course it is -- that is precisely why inheritance is the wrong
formalism for my problem!  What I need is a "reverse inheritance"
formalism, where a fully defined data structure sits at the root,
and whose descendants are PRUNED versions of the parent.

If sound (and I let the theoreticians decide on that), such a
formalism would be an interesting solution to the type of problem
that originated this thread.

Cheers,
Dario
