Well, I'm developing my application in Linux, but after it's done, it will
be used mostly on Mac OS.  So far, on regular basis, I test everything on my
Mac to make sure it's working.

I guess I'll have to find another way then.   One idea I have is to poll the
size of the file every certain amount of time, and if it's
different---there's my event.   Same applies to "date/time last modified".

Is there something I can use successfully on both Linux and Mac about that?

Just to mention that the file is a text file, and it doesn't change very
often.  I mean, it's not constantly changing, so I'm not concerned with
performance and resource issues.

Oh, here's another idea---every certain amount of time, I just compare my
last saved version of the file to the current one---if different, there's my
event.   What do you think?
