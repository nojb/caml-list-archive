Hi,

I've been looking for information on OCaml compiler internals during this w=
eek.
Gordon's reply is a nice starting point, but is there any
documentation on the compiler internals?
I don't need to have a very detailed description (but it would be
really interesting to study!), it would be sufficient to have access
to the compiler front end i.e. lexing, parsing, name resolution
(environment) and typing.

A simple hint on how to use the above mentioned phases in a black box
way would be nice.

Thanks in advance,
Massimiliano Brocchini

P.S. I'm collaborating to the development of a snippet manager to
facilitate libraries distribution, code reuse and to reduce binaries
size by linking only the minimum amount of code your application
depends on rather than the whole file (e.g. if in a toy program you
use only List.map your application needs to be linked with map's code
and it's dependencies not the whole List module).

We already have a working prototype that uses ocamldoc, but we need to
access the parser to build a proper tool.
