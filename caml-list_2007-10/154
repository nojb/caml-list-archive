well it is possible to use sdl for this. There are functions for reading 
any truetype font file you have into a sdlvideo image. It actually 
directly renders any string to an image. Then you have to convert it to 
an opengl texture. It is not so difficult. Of course, since you are 
actually using gtkgl this may sound a bit circumvoluted, and there is 
probably a simpler way to do it. (?)
