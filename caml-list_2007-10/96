There is a such a system, I can't remember its name. The proofs and
types etc do travel with the code, but the 'language' is designed with
holes to fill in interactively, and the compiler fills them out
partially then prompts for the balance. After supply, more holes
are filled in by the same process.

So for export, you get a complete linear representation of 
the conventional kind but you use a GUI to develop it.
Perhaps someone can provide a link (it's quite well known
very advanced category theory based system).
