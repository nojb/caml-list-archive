Not unsound, incomplete !
you mixup first and second incompleteness theorem. Let's clarify ?

- first if a type system does not contain arithmetic nothing can be said
(this implies ML), but in this case, the meaning of complete needs to be =
clarified.
Indeed, there are complete type system ...

- The 1st incompleteness theorem states that no theory containing
arithmetic is complete. This means that there will always be correct prog=
rams
that your type system can not accept. However, I thing a real program tha=
t
is not provably correct in lets say ZF, does not exists and should be rej=
ected.
you do not accept a program whose correctness is a conjecture (do you ?)

- The second incompleteness theorem, states that a system that proves its=
 own
consistency is in fact inconsistent. For type system (strong enough to ex=
press
arithmetic, like ML with dependant type, PVS, the future PML, ..). This m=
eans
that the proof that the system is consistent (the proof that "0 =3D 1 can=
 not be proved")
can not be done inside the system. However, the proof that your implement=
ation
does implement the formal system correctly can be done inside the system,=
 and
this is quite enough for me.

- The soundness theorem for ML can be stated as a program of type "int" w=
ill
  - diverge
  - raise an exception
  - or produce an int
I think everybody except LISP programmers ;-) want a sound type system li=
ke this.
OK replace everybody by I if you prefer ... For PML, we are more precise =
: exception
and the fact the a program may diverge must be written in the type.

- ML type system is sometimes too incomplete, this is why the Obj library=
 is here.
However, the use of Obj is mainly here because ML lacks dependant types. =
In fact,
the main use of Obj is to simulate a map table associating to a key k a t=
ype t(k) and
a value v:t(k).

- All this says that a type-system only accepting proved programs is poss=
ible and
a good idea (it already exists). The question for researcher is how to pr=
oduce a
type system where the cost of proving is acceptable compared to the cost =
of debugging,
and this stars to be the case for some specific application, but we are f=
ar from
having to remove the word "bug" from our vocabulary ;-)
