Separating it from the compiler would keep from interfering with the
compiler's activities, but it would add some difficulties:

Parsing ocaml - I guess I could steal the parser out of the current
source code, and use the internal parse tree, but it'd be a lot more
difficult than what I've done so far.

Namespaces - Ocaml has a ton of namespaces.  At the moment, the patch
doesn't find mistyped module names, but it does distinguish the
following: type parameters, type constructors, classes, row variables,
values, constructors, labels and instance variables.

Visibilty/scope - A simple script would have to add much complication to
keep track of where each identifier is visible - Maybe easy, maybe not.

Parsing the output of the ocaml compiler - ocamlc lacks i18n to make
this extra difficult, but the error messages don't follow any spec, and
could change at any time.


On the plus side, if the simpler hack were built into an IDE, it could
embed a list of corrections into a right-click menu, like a spell
checker.  It could do this outside the current cycle of edit -> compile
-> edit

I don't have interest in doing this - my ideas of a super-ocaml-IDE seem
too big for me to program ATM.
