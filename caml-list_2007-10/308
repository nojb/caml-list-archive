That is correct. It is specifically designed NOT to do so.
The last thing you want in 99% of codec use is to abort due 
to an error.

Try switching codecs on Firefox.. do you really want to abort
if you have bad input or the wrong codec?

UTF-8 is primarily used for Unicode which is human readable text.
Errors and faults in the text aren't important most of the time.

It has nothing to do with a 'trusted' source. It has to do with
the fact that the human text is an approximation in the first
place.
