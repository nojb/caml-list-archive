I don't understand this.  I thought the whole idea of oo programming was
that you could use a subclass in place of a superclass...

I also thought that the strict typing of Ocaml was there to avoid runtime
errors, but if so, why does it complain in this situation, when no runtime
error can possibly happen?

It seems to me that the idea of oo programming is broken for no good
reason...
