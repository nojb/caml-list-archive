We are certainly interested in publishing books on functional programming. 
However, we could not turn a profit if the final cost was significantly lower 
than that of OCaml for Scientists.

Wiley are publishing F# for Scientists and they made it clear from the outset 
that they are interested in OCaml books. They even proposed that I write a 
second edition of OCaml for Scientists and publish it through them.
