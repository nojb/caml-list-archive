We have benchmarked against MiniSAT - at little.
Naturally MiniSAT is faster.  For problems that combine SAT reasoning 
with theory reasoning then the extra SAT performance doesn't all get 
translated into extra combined theory solving performance - hence our 
overall performance is not too shabby.

Our SAT solver is very much MiniSAT like, but with some extra features 
and a more open API to better facilitate it's use in a collaborative 
solving tool.  The code is very cleanly written (IMHO), commented, and 
heavy with assertions. It may serve as a good starting place for someone 
wishing to learn about how MiniSAT like algorithms work.

Our SAT performance - on a few selected benchmarks we have tried - is 
about 1/2 - 1/3 of MiniSAT.  If you start playing with the garbage 
collection tuning, which we have yet to experiment much with, you seem 
to be able to get better than 1/3.
