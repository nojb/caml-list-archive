Of course it is -- that is precisely why inheritance is the wrong
formalism for my problem!  What I need is a "reverse inheritance"
formalism, where a fully defined data structure sits at the root,
and whose descendants are PRUNED versions of the parent.

Mind showing me, formally, why you need "reverse inheritance"?<br>
<br>
Conceptually, you just need to fix your choice of names.&nbsp; Let me cite
the second paragraph of the e-mail you're responding to (which you
neglected in your response): <br>
<br>
&gt;&nbsp; If you s/blurb/header/g or s/blurb/summary/g, then a Full story
arguably is-a blurb with a body tacked on.
<br>
<br>
If you think that a full story as a story with a summary/header, and
also a body, then you're conceptually into inheritance.<br>
<br>
>From a formal standpoint, you're saying that all full stories can be
treated as headers/summaries/"blurbs", but not all
headers/summary/"blurbs" can be treated as full stories.&nbsp; This is
equivalent to saying that full stories are a subtype of
header/summaries/"blurbs".<br>
<br>
You are right smack dab onto the problem space that inheritance is
designed to solve.<br>
