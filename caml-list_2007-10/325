Yes it does, on XP32 ** Ocaml also builds fine as 64 bit on XP64,
however some C libraries contain 'long is 64 bit' bugs (which I 
have reported but which haven't been acknowledged for months,
which is fairly poor behaviour IMHO). Nums library is affected by 
such bugs.

** actually I have built with VS2005 full edition, but the
compiler is the same in the Express edition.
