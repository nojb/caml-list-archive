Hi,

I wasn't familiar with the "projections" terminology, but that is
precisely what I meant, and what I've referred to as "marble carving"!
(The wheel keeps getting reinvented...)

Incidentally, are projections implemented by any language out there?
(I realise that to a certain extent, SQL views are also projections.
But what about other examples?)

Cheers,
Dario
