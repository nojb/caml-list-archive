That's solely a question of the semantics of their fixpoint operator.
Ocaml certainly supports "let rec xs = 1::xs". And just for perspecive,
the following is the canonical definition of the (infinite) list of
Fibonacci numbers in Haskell:

  fibs = 1:1:zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

It is disallowed in OCaml because it has a cyclic type, not because it is
a cyclic value. Try with "ocaml -rectypes".
