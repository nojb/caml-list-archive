On the contrary, I find it amazing that there is no slick editor written in 
OCaml to let people write simple OCaml programs with an integrated top-level, 
build system, graphics libraries and packages for the main distros. I think 
that would be enormously beneficial for all newbies and could easily be 
available for Linux and Mac OS X as well as using the latest ocamlbuild, 
camlp4 3.10, LablGTK2 and so on.

In fact, I would say that OCaml is ideally suited to this task because it 
falls in the metaprogramming category!
