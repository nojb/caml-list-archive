Precedences also can be created by sophisticated
organization of the grammar rules.

So, if your grammar rules may have a contradictory
meaning, then your parser works not as expected.

In general I would use the precedence-declarations only,
when you run into parser conflicts, if you don't use them.
When developing a grammr, I would recommend, first to start
with the grammar rules, and add precedence-/associatitivity-
declarations, at the end, if really necessary.


What is the rest of your mly-file?

A complete example would be helpful.


Ciao,
