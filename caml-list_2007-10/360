I'll write OCaml Journal articles covering GUI programming using LablGTK. 
There is already one very nice example in there (Sudoku solver) but there's 
plenty of scope for more complicated applications with more widgets, 
threading and so forth.

I certainly get that feeling but I'm not a Tk man myself.

Actually, I was reading a blog entry recently where someone from O'Reilly 
explicitly stated that they are interested in publishing more books on OCaml. 
You could easily strip out any deprecated stuff from their current 
(unpublished) book and publish it. I would certainly buy a copy...

With the current uptake of OCaml in industry (and the productization of F#), I 
think there will be ample market for OCaml teaching material, including 
books.
