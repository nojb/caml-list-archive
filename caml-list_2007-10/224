Hi all

I am using OCaml threads for an application that I am building.  
However, I don't require concurrency (which OCaml threads do not  
provide anyway). I'm using it only because it makes it far easier to  
express my algorithm.

I was wondering if there is a more lightweight thread library out  
there which works at the native code level and does not use system- 
level threads? I'd like to avoid the performance overhead of  
pthreads, if possible. The OCaml threads library does provide a vm- 
level thread, but it works only for bytecode :(

Thanks
Raj
