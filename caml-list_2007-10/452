Hi.

This time I've done my research, but still I cannot find a good answer.
Basically, I need to make a little ocaml process, which runs in the
background and monitors a specific file for changes.   When a change occurs,
I want it to back-up a copy of the version of the file at that moment.
So, what I need is to set some signal or event, which will happen every time
that file is changed.

Can you guys help me do it?

Thank you in advance!

Orlin

PS. If in any way I'm misusing this list (writing too much, or out of
topic), please tell me, because I just don't know it.  The least I want is
to spam the list with improper questions.
