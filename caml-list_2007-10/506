Right. I followed David Woodhouse's attempts from a distance.  While
PPC64/MacOSX (supported in OCaml 3.10) is a small change from PPC32/MacOSX,
there are significant differences between PPC64/Linux and PPC32/Linux
-- or for that matter PPC64/Linux and all other PPC platforms.

My initial reaction was to conclude that PPC64 isn't worth the porting
effort: Apple killed the PowerPC architecture on the desktop, and
while PowerPC is still strong in the embedded world, it's in 32-bit
mode.  Then someone told me that the Playstation 3 is a PPC64/Linux
platform...  I'm still not quite sure whether having OCaml on
PPC64/Linux is worth the effort, even if we had the corresponding hardware.
