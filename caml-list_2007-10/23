DPLL = The Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland backtracking algorithm for 
deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae.  Modern SAT 
solvers (mini-SAT, chaff, etc) use cunning variants of DPLL - as does DPT.

DPLL(T) is an algorithm that combines a DPLL solver with a solver for 
some theory to yield a combined solver.  In the case of DPT, we have 
included a EUF solver.  EUF is the theory of equality of uninterpreted 
functions.    You can pose DPT problems propositional problems with the 
atoms are propositional variables or equations between variables and 
(uninterpreted) function applications.

DPT is completely implemented in OCaml - even the DPLL solver, and yet 
we get good (read seemingly competitive) from the tool.

All the best
