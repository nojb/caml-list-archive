As well as the others mentioned, there is also Gamin which is a GNOME
API designed for this.  Originally there was a thing called FAM which
SGI invented, however it required a system-wide daemon.  Gamin is
FAM-compatible at the API level and uses the appropriate kernel calls
for the current operating system.

  http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/
  http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin/differences.html

Although if current operating system != Linux, then YMMV.  Apparently
there are backends for Mac OS X, BSD & Solaris.

Gamin has an OCaml binding:

  http://svn.metaprl.org/viewvc/mojave/omake/src/clib/omake_notify.c?view=log&pathrev=1326

(well, really it's a FAM binding, but the APIs are supposed to be
compatible).

None of this works over NFS unfortunately.
