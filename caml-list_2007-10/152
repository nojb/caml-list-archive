Our Smoke Vector Graphics library is a high-performance renderer of arbitrary 
2D vector graphics with high-resolution real-time zooming and panning of 
vector scenes. In particular, it contains facilities for rendering the 
computer modern fonts. See the third demo in the distribution for an example:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/smoke_vector_graphics/

You can fill and stroke the font glyphs, of course. We also have mathematical 
typesetting code if you need it (and have a budget!).
