The thing you describe should be handled at OS level (at least this is
kind of notification are bound to OS). This means, you don't have high
level functions that are multi-OS.

If you use linux 2.6, take a look at ocaml-inotify, which helps you to
wait for specific event on some file descriptors (also work for
directories):

http://tab.snarc.org/projects/ocaml_inotify/

If you use older linux version, solaris, macos or windows, i have no
answer (but i am sure this kind of things already exists).
