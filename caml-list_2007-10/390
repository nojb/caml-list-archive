Nope. Absolutely not :p . I wouldn't have a clue of what it should 
formally look like, since again I can't find any example of mathematical 
reasoning using that, I have no intuition at all. But it's not 
impossible that there is a good way to make/read such a feature, that's 
just what I am stating.
