I ran into the same problem this week.

ml.exe is the executable name of the Microsoft assembler.  The error is 
confusing due to the coincidence that the assember's name is the same as 
the OCaml file extension.    It has nothing to do with trying to execute 
the test.ml file.

ocamlc was working because it doesn't need any of the Microsoft tools to 
build executable programs.

The INSTALL.win32 file is  a big help.   Once I installed the components 
it indicated, I'm able to use ocamlopt.   It was challenging though to 
get the windows executable and lib paths set correctly so that ocamlopt 
would use the tools it was designed for.  (I had several versions of 
many programs that were for other unrelated purposes.)  As best as I can 
tell, I also had to rebuild OCaml because I was using MSVC 6 and getting 
link errors.   I think this was due to ocamlopt trying to combine the 
released version of 3.10.0 with the run time libraries that I have which 
mixed versions of the MSVC libraries.

I installed OCaml on Windows XP (the MSVC version, since I assume that's 
faster than
