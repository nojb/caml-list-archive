Thank you all for the suggestions.  Yes, the Smoke Vector Graphics library
looks like is extremely professional and good job.   Still, I need somethin=
g
easy and small, and I thought more about the "image to texture" suggestion,
and I think I found something, which will definitely work good for my
purposes.  I decide to give it a try by going through latex, which will
produce a dvi file, then use "convert" to make it into a suitable format fo=
r
importing into an OpenGL texture.

What do you think?
