By my question i wasn't suggesting that everybody should do
internationalization by hand.

definitely we also need some UTFstring type library (which can use rope,
string, whatever internally), with all common type of operations
(appending, finding, ...), but it's a just a specific sub case and also
a different type not compatible with strings (in OCaml terminology).
