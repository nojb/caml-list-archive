Dear Caml-ers,

Commercial software written in OCaml being somewhat rare, I hope you'll
forgive this advertisement.

I've released some command line tools for manipulating PDF files, based
on the open-source library CamlPDF, which I announced here some time  
ago.

Demo and Manual at http://www.coherentpdf.com/

A new version of CamlPDF will be released soon, reflecting the updated
facilities used  by the commercial tools.
