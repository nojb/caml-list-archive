They could use FTP and a remote shell to access your Linux box from their 
Windows box.

I would suggest the ordinary syntax simply because it is vastly more common.

I'd also suggest giving them some working programs at the beginning of the 
course (e.g. the ray tracer and the GUI sudoku solver) and telling them that 
they'll be able to understand them by the end of the course. I found this 
kind of motivation sorely lacking on many of my courses (e.g. Greens 
functions).
