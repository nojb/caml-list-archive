Orlin,

If you wish to be cross-platform, you'll likely need to devise an =20
abstract interface to smooth over the variances between platforms. =20
You've plenty of Linux pointers already.

On Windows, use FindFirstChangeNotification[1].

On Mac OS X and BSD, use kqueue[2]. kqueue was introduced in Tiger, =20
and is one of the supporting technologies for Spotlight. To support =20
Panther and earlier, you'll need to weak link[3] with kqueue. If =20
kqueue is unavailable or not supported on the filesystem in question, =20=

you can fall back to polling modification times.

Polling modification times is simple and highly portable; many Java =20
programs (for instance, Eclipse) support file monitoring using this =20
technique. It may be worth considering using it exclusively, at least =20=

to get up and running.
