While that would indeed involve a little bit of less typing, it's also
conceptually wrong, because a Full story is not a derivation of a Blurb
with an extra field.

Ideally, I should be able to declare a "platonic" Story that includes
all fields that describe a story.  A Full story is just the real-world
clone of the platonic ideal, while a Blurb is a Story with the constraint
that there is no "body" field declared (and so on).

Cheers,
Dario
