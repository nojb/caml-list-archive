Unless you've got a compelling reason to use the Microsoft toolchain, I've
always found that building OCaml from source using Cygwin/MinGW is
painless... below is my complete build procedure which gives OCaml 3.09.3
with ocamlopt support (with due credit to
http://ibgs.christoph-bauer.net/~fridolin/omm/protokol.txt). My installation
prevents Cygwin from being integrated with the Windows shell because I use
the Win32 ports of the UNIX tools rather than Cygwin's.
