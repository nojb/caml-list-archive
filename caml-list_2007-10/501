Type b doesn't exactly make much sens to me.
While I could easilly define a value of type b (fun x:int _ -> x ) I
really don't see the point. I'm gessing you'r trying to pass a chain
of alternative functions (In which case this seems to be the  wrong
way).
Could you give an exemple (without using Obj.magic) were you'd
actually need such a type.
