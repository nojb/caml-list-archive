Oh, I didn't heard of CamlPDF before.
If I found the correct page, then it is a pre-release.
But there is no date on the page, so I don't know if it's up to date.

fop?

Postscript has a pathbbox-operator, which gives you back
the bounding box of the current path; PDF seems not to have
such an operator. At least I could not find an aequivalent thing
in the last minutes, where I browsed through the PDF-Reference Manual.

So, possibly one has to calculate the size by itself?!
(So, if CamlPDF does not provide it, I see no solution to that problem
right now.)

Ciao,
