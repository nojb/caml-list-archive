This is something that I am interested in as well. With this change plus 
a couple of other small changes you would be able to make a project that 
compiles on its own in ocamlbuild, or as a subdirectory of another 
project. It would be very useful when working on separate, but 
dependent, projects.

Another useful addition would be to pass the include flags when 
compiling c stubs. Right now, you need to write a plugin even if you 
only want to include the other project directories.

I don't know if its intended, but the code is pretty clearly doing 
exactly what you describe:

ocamlbuild/main.ml:105
(String.length name > 0 && name.[0] <> '_' && not (List.mem name 
!Options.exclude_dirs))
