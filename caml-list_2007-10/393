It feels like the problem is the keyword "inherit". It suggest
C++/Java subtyping, while we just want code reuse. If having stories
inheriting from one another eventually result in less code, I would
consider that cleaner, no matter what "inherit" is supposed to mean.

Sometimes, a tool can be good at something it has not be designed for.
I think this might be the case, here.
