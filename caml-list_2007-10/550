I'm afraid I don't understand this position at all. With a few dozen,=20
mostly obvious, annotations to the header files, I have covered 99% of the=
=20
library's functionality, automatically generating several thousand lines=20
of low-level boilerplate code. Leaving aside the possibility of known bugs=
=20
in Camlidl that might never get fixed... why would I want to code this all=
=20
by hand?
