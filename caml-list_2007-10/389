Well, I think the problem here is that the mental model is reversed with 
respect to the functional model.  Mentally, blurbs are kinds of stories -- 
they are distinguished by their lack of a body.  Using the standard 
inheritance lingo, however, stories are a kind of blurb -- distinguished by 
the inclusion of a body.  Really, it seems like we've got a six of one/half-
dozen of the other situation...
