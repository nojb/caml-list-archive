The last time I had a try, I only needed to download and
compile the following from source to get my Ocaml+gtk2
application to work natively under OS X (and by natively I just mean
without X11, although I have hopes to use gtk2's themability to
make keybindings and perhaps appearance closer to Aqua):

atk-1.19.6.tar.bz2
cairo-1.4.10.tar.gz
glib-2.14.0.tar.bz2
gtk+-2.10.14.tar.bz2
pango-1.17.3.tar.bz2

Note that these were all official tarballs, nothing complicated like 
switching
from Fink to Darwinports or getting CVS versions.

If you already have Fink for the basic stuff like libtiff, pkg-config, and 
so on,
it takes just two hours to compile and install everything. Or you can just 
wait
until these versions make their way into Fink. They will, eventually.
