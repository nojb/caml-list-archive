Oh, I absolutely agree there.  And there are a couple of important snippets 
of the manual that seem to apply:

"Note that the relation between object, class and type in Objective Caml is 
very different from that in main stream object-oriented languages like Java 
or C++, so that you should not assume that similar keywords mean the same 
thing." and "Inheritance is a syntactic relation between classes..."
