                               Call for papers

                    Static Analysis Symposium - SAS 2008
                     16-18 July 2008, Valencia, Spain
                      (co-located with LOPSTR 2008)

                      url   http://www.dsic.upv.es/~sas2008
                    email   sas2008@dsic.upv.es

Static Analysis is increasingly recognized as a fundamental tool for high 
performance implementations and verification of programming languages and 
systems. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served as the primary 
venue for presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances 
in the area.

The technical programme for SAS 2008 will consist of invited lectures and
presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcome on all aspects 
of static analysis, including, but not limited to:

    abstract domains
    abstract interpretation
    abstract testing
    compiler optimizations
    control flow analysis
    data flow analysis
    model checking
    program specialization
    security analysis
    theoretical analysis frameworks
    type based analysis
    verification systems

Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, 
constraint, functional, imperative, logic, and object-oriented programming. 
Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new 
perspective, and application papers, that describe experience with 
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe original 
work, be written and presented in English, and must not substantially 
overlap with papers that have been published, or that are simultaneously 
submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.

Submitted papers should be at most 15 pages formatted in LNCS style 
(excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices not intended for 
publication). PC members are not required to read the appendices, and thus 
papers should be intelligible without them. The conference proceedings 
is planned to be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science series.
