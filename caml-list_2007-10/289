Assuming the vast majority of Unix users will be using either Gnome or KDE, 
that is a non-native look for Unix. In fact, "Classic" looks like RISC OS to 
me, and "Revitalized" looks like old Windows.

I must confess I don't understand the idea of tweaking pixellated widget 
toolkits when everyone else just moved on to hardware-accelerated vector 
graphics with integrated 3D. Especially when the fastest renderer available 
is written in OCaml, free and cross platform... :-)
