Does anyone know of the status of OCaml on ppc64 on Linux?

It's a secondary Fedora platform and therefore I'd like to support it.
Someone at Red Hat did some work on trying to port it, but it was
still quite broken AIUI:

  http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/dwmw2/ocaml-ppc64.git

Is there anything we can do to help it along (eg. hardware purchase or
also we can give out limited accounts on a PPC64 machine)?

Rich.
