Dear Ocaml Community,
After teaching myself Labltk and learning enough about its internals to 
update it to use Tk 8.4's new widgets, I'm wondering if there's much of 
a market for a proper Labltk book? Nothing too serious, maybe something 
self-published that would cost in the range of $10 to $20 and provide 
some missing documentation and tutorials. Lots of screenshots of course, 
and maybe a simple game or two.

I'd release it for free, but hey, I'm a poor student.

Any thoughts?

Sincerely,
Jeff
