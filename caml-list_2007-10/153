I recall some people here were interested in the prospect of writing computer 
games in OCaml. I just discovered something interesting by stumbling upon 
this site:

  http://www.gameproducer.net/category/sales-statistics/

Windows users are quite fussy about their games. Linux users buy few games 
(and I had a lot of trouble getting OCaml/OpenGL apps to run across distros). 
However, Mac OS X users apparently buy any games available for their platform 
and they actually bought more copies of some of these Indie (low development 
cost) games than Windows users did! Also, it might be easier to create 
binaries that work reliably across Macs.

So any budding games programmers out there (Brandon, you still here?) might 
consider lashing up some games in OCaml for Mac OS X. I've yet to invest in a 
Mac but I'll certainly rewrite TwoPlay for the Mac when I get the chance. ;-)
