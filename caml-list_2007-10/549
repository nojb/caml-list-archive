Absolutely agreed.

While I think there is room for someone to _really_ tackle the issue
of building interfaces to C automatically (using something like CIL
and a bucket-load of meta-information about how the C library deals
with memory), until that day comes it's just much better to write the
bindings by hand.

I've used the native interface APIs for several languages including
Java, Perl and Python, but OCaml's is by far the easiest.  Well, maybe
apart from C++ :-)
