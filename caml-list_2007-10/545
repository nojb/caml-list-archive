I am considering putting a pair of students on writing a simple GUI for
OCaml based on Chris King's functional reactive GUI, itself based on
Gtk. However, it seems unlikely to me that, at their level, they can
carry on that task in just one term -- and that's all the time they'll
have to learn OCaml and complete their projects.

Cheers,
 David
