I strongly disagree with your remark, it is not a save "a few watts here
and there". This kind of modification can make your program 100% faster
than a "poll every seconds". Moreover, knowing how to program
in a "reactive" way is something that most people tend to ignore but
which is really a good thing to learn (and most of the time it changes
the architecture of your program).

OFf course, for the sake of "quick and dirty" programming, you can just
ignore everything and go directly to the easy solution... The only
problem is that the "quick and dirty" initial programming that should
have been rewritten, never get rewritten and you end up with  something
really not efficient "in production".
