Unfortunately, on top of what one sees with HOFs, functors have a bit more 
baggage associated with learning how to use them effectively.  For one 
thing, the language is just different enough from the rest of OCaml to be a 
nuicance. And all of the extra bits needed to get the types to play nicely 
can really be hard to get a hold of (making types work as expected/desired 
seems to account for ~90% of the functor related questions to the mailing 
lists), and there's very little written up about it available for people to 
look at; section 2.4 of the manual only goes so far.
