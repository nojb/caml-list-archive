Hi,

Well, that's only a problem if you insist in thinking in terms
of inheritance.  Remember that the semantics of marble-carving
are NOT "all that works on full_story should also work on blurb_story",
but the other way around.

Also, imagine you were to add the "get_body" method to the root
"story" class.  The type system in Marble-Caml is smart enough
to tell you that since the blurb_story carved out the "body" field,
then it must also carve out methods that use it.  Aren't imaginary
languages wonderfull?... :-)

(In addition, note that in any real world situation, it wouldn't
make any sense for the user to want to invoke get_body on a blurb
object -- after all, by definition blurbs have no body).

Cheers,
Dario
