Cool!

Haven't looked at the patch yet but this seems like a neat feature
(might be a little too much of a gadget but,hey I love gadgets).

I am curious. Why is this dedicated to Jane Street? Since I am
probably the worst at typing out here (and even though they bought me
a shiny shiny keyboard) I will take this patch as a personnal
intention ;-).
