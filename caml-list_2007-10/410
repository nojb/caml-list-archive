Hi,

Nope, nothing like that.  Read carefully what I wrote: I simply said
that any method that works on a blurb should also work on a full story.
I didn't say anything about reversing the IS-A relation (and yes, I know
that OCaml's inheritance has different semantics, but I am talking here
about OOP in general).

In fact, a blurb is a kind of story.  Just one that has been restricted
such that some of story's fields/methods cannot be used on blurb.  Now
the OOP purists will jump and say that this violates inheritance.  Which
is precisely my point and why I don't call it inheritance!

That is true for most problems.  However, I just described one particular
class of problem where it is more natural (and correct if you will) to
derive by deconstruction rather than by construction.

Cheers,
Dario
