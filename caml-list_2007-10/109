I see two solutions: Either you explicitly coerce the type of r' to r
so to match its (explicit) signature:
let q (r1: r') (r2: r') = f (r1 :> r) (r2 :> r) 

or you remove the type constraints from f and you let ocaml do the
rest.

let f r1  r2 = (r1#get_x = r2#get_x)
let q (r1: r') (r2: r') = f r1 r2

why do you want to specify the type of f ? The minimal information
needed is that it's an object with a method get_x and this can be
inferred by the type checker. Then all objects with a method get_x will
work even if not explicitly a subclass (iirc). Usually I don't specify
type constraints if not absolutely necessary and I use a signature to
wrap the module in the end.
