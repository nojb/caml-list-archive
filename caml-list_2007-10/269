The problem as I understand things is that C++ doesn't play nice with 
any language that is not C++ or explicitly designed to work with C++ 
(cue Skaller).  This is especially true if you use the fancy features of 
C++ like templates and operator overloading, which Qt does.  Which makes 
it much easier to use in C++, but much harder to bind to any other language.

Note that this is true of all languages- it'd be a trick to write an 
Ocaml to Swing binding as well.

Hi,

Still on the subject of toolkits, is there a reason why there aren't any
OCaml bindings for Qt?  I mean, is it simply because no one ever bothered
to implement one, or are there license incompatibility issues?

I have used both Qt and Gtk before, and in my opinion, not only does
Qt's elegance give it an edge over Gtk, it also feels like it would be
a better match to OCaml.
