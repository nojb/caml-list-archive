You used to be able to get the OCaml compiler to segfault by using -rectypes 
inconsistently while compiling. I believe that -rectypes can be useful. For 
example, the OCaml implementations of the ray tracer benchmark use it to good 
effect to implement the scene tree without an extra level of indirection. I 
have never bothered turning it on for any significant projects or during 
development though, so I can't say with any certainty whether or not it has a 
practical impact on error messages.
