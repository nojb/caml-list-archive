I reckon that native bindings might therefore prove nearly impossible!
Two alternate routes have occurred to me though.  The first involves
the Ocaml-Java project and Qt-Jambi bindings (basically Qt on the JVM):

http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/
http://trolltech.com/products/qt/jambi

The second route involves the OCamIL project (OCaml on .NET) and
the Qyoto/Kimono bindings (Qt/KDE bindings for .NET):

http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~montela/ocamil/index.html
http://cougarpc.net/qyoto/

We've seen recent annoucements concerning the Ocaml-Java project,
so I reckon this route might already be feasible or will be so in
the near future.  As for route #2, I don't know the current status
of OCamIL, so it's hard to say.

Has anyone given any of these routes a try?  Perhaps the developers
of Ocaml-Java or OCamIL would like to share their thoughts?

Cheers,
Dario
