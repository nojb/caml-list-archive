I think there would be far more interest in an introductory book on OCaml 
published as cheaply as possible through someone like O'Reilly, that includes 
a chapter on GUI programming. Or a IDE that makes it as easy as possible to 
get started with OCaml that might be written using Tk.

Just my 2p...
