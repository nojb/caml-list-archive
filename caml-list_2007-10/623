Just my $A0.92, I've used these kinds of tools before,
and they're great for the first 2 days learning a language,
and useless after that -- typing is so much faster.

For that reason a GUI based version of this is probably a
waste of time. 

However a web-browser based version is another story altogether
because it only needs to be deployed once on a single server,
and then everyone can use it.

Ruby has a tutorial with a 'try it and see' approach .. 
that's my total experience with Ruby, 1 hour playing
with the web tutorial, but I think it worked well
to introduce me to that language.
