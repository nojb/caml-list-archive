                       CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

                             ICFP 2008
 13th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                       September 22-24, 2008
                Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
          http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/index.html

The 13th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
(ICFP 2008) will be held in Victoria, Canada from 22nd to 24th September
2008. ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about
the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of
functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops to be affiliated with ICFP 2008 and
sponsored by SIGPLAN. These workshops should be more informal and focused
than ICFP itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the
workshop attendees, and be fairly low cost. The preference is for one-day
workshops, but other schedules can also be considered. The workshops
themselves will be held between September 18th and September 27th, as
hotel capacity allows.

Submission details

 Deadline for submission:     21th November 2007

that is suitable for publication in SIGPLAN Notices.
