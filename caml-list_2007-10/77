Sorry, I see now that I was not clear enough :

Complete (at least in french) has many meanings, the one you said and
the fact that something true in every model is provable (which make a
lot of meaning depending to the models you are considering).
The two meanings are unrelated, because arithmetics is complete as is
any first order theory (this is G=F6del Completeness theorem for predicat=
e
logic), but incomplete because there are formula A such that neither A
nor not A are provable. This is quite confusing.

But in both case complete means "there are enough rules/axioms in the
system to do what I want". You are just making the "what I want"
more or less strong.

For type systems, if you replace proving by inhabited, they are usually
incomplete, but then, you can look for completeness relative to some
model (like realizability) ... and the answer is yes in some cases. This
is generally a good idea to search for a set of models large enough for
your type system to be complete ... because sometime you realize that
you forgot some usefull typing rules in your type system.

Ok, this was implicit.

This is Tarski's result .... (actually Tarski proved that truth can not
even be defined by a formula of arithmetic, which imply that provability
and truth do not coincide because provable formula are definable).
