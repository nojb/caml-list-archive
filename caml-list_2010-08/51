tells us the first few Carmichael numbers are [561; 1105; 1729; 2465; 2821;=
 6601; 8911; 10585; 15841; 29341]. Conceivably there's a typographical mist=
ake in that list, but I've seen the segment of it < 10k also reported elsew=
here.

You've missed a small detail in the definition here. n is Carmichael
iff a^(n-1) =3D 1 (mod n) for all a with gcd(a,n) =3D 1; in other words,
you are only allowed to consider a's which are coprime to your
supposed Carmichael number.

And indeed,

# let rec gcd a b =3D if b =3D 0 then a else gcd b (a mod b);;
val gcd : int -> int -> int =3D <fun>
# List.map (fun (a,b) -> gcd a b) [561,3; 1105,5; 2465,5; 10585,5];;
- : int list =3D [3; 5; 5; 5]
