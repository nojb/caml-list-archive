I'm not sure 3.5 implementations over 25 years is a "lot" of interest =
but
maybe if you add HLVM... ;-)

I already did something like this called HLVM:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/ocaml/hlvm/

Feel free to ask me anything about HLVM's design. We have a dedicated
mailing list:

  https://lists.forge.ocamlcore.org/pipermail/hlvm-list/

HLVM might be interesting for teaching purposes because it is tiny =
(2kLOC)
and comprehensible whilst providing advanced features like JIT =
compilation
(for a native-code REPL!) and a multicore-capable garbage collector (in =
only
100LOC!). HLVM should also be suitable for production environments.

I had actually forgotten about the mincaml project but mincaml's =
front-end
with HLVM's back-end sounds like a match made in heaven...

Cheers,
Jon.
