I have an OCaml application that does a lot of string manipulations, genera=
ting a
lot of garbage.  After running awhile, it seems not to make any progress.  =
The exact
point where it hangs varies.  The strings aren't very large, but there a lo=
t of them.

By increasing the size of the minor heap, the application runs much longer.
And if I turn on Gc.verbose, I see output from the garbage collector just b=
efore
the app hangs.  I mean, there's a print diagnostic in my code on one line, =
I see
the Gc output, and the print diagnostic on the next line of my code never a=
ppears.

The problem occurs whether I compile to byte-code or native (Linux x64) cod=
e.

At first, I thought  the hanging problem was due to network code blocking. =
 But I rewrote
that to be multithreaded -- no difference.  I changed some other code to us=
e Buffers
instead of strings, and by generating less garbage, the code went farther.

Are there known issues with the OCaml gc?  I'm using OCaml 3.11 on Fedora 1=
2.
