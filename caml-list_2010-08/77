Subject: More re GC hanging

I haven't yet come up with a solution to the GC hanging problem I
mentioned the other day.

But here's something that looks funny.  I changed the default minor
heap size, the major
heap increment, the allocation policy.  I also threw in a
`Gc.major_slice 0' in the code.
After turning on the Gc verbose option, I see:

 New heap increment size: 1000k bytes
 New allocation policy: 1
 New minor heap size: 500k bytes
 <>Starting new major GC cycle
 allocated_words = 9404
 extra_heap_resources = 49000u
 amount of work to do = 249956u
 ordered work = 0 words
 computed work = 44081 words
 Marking 44081 words
 Subphase = 10

 Starting new major GC cycle
 Marking 9223372036854775807 words
 Subphase = 10
 Sweeping 9223372036854775807 words

Those are some big mark and sweep numbers at the end!

I'm using the x64 version of Fedora 12.  Maybe the 64-bit garbage
collector has some integer
overflow problems?

I wasn't seeing those huge numbers in other experiments where the Gc
hangs, so maybe that's
not the underlying problem.
