                  The 2010 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML
                   http://www.cs.rit.edu/~mtf/ml2010
                   Baltimore, Maryland, United States
                       Sunday, September 26, 2010
                       co-located with ICFP 2010

                         Call for Participation

ML is a family of programming languages that includes dialects known
as Standard ML, Objective Caml, and F#. The development of these
languages has inspired a large amount of computer science research,
both practical and theoretical. This workshop aims to provide a forum
to encourage discussion and research on ML and related technology
(higher-order, typed, or strict languages).

The format of the 2010 Workshop on ML will be different than that of
recent years, returning to a more informal model: a workshop with
presentations selected from submitted abstracts but without published
proceedings. We hope that this format will encourage the presentation
of more exciting (if unpolished) research and deliver a more lively
workshop atmosphere.
