Is your application a well behaved purely Ocaml code, or do you have
Obj.magic or external functions written in C? Perhaps you are violating
some GC invariant.

You might still occasionally (i.e. every 1000 steps or requests, or
every few seconds) call Gc.compact.

I understand you don't customize that kind of [stupid company policy]
mail footer, but it is really inappropriate on a public & archived
mailing list. The usual advice is to use a public email account (e.g. on
gmail) to avoid that kind of nonsense. Nothing on a publicly archived
list can be confidential!
