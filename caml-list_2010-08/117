Dear all,

Sorry for spoiling the list, but hypios is seeking for OCaml
developers to join its technical division in Paris for a 60 days
mission. It consists in developing an open innovation platform for a
famous international firm, from the 15th of september to the 15th of
november.

Familiarity with the ocsigen framework would be a plus, but ocaml
developers learn quickly don't they ;) ?

Permanent positions are also available.

We'll take at our charge all the expenses and we provide a nice
package; if you are interested please get in touch with me by mail at
william@hypios.com or by phone at +33 6 31 27 18 55.
