OCaml's runtime library also has a debug version which performs =
additional integrity checks on the heap during garbage collection and =
other operations. This can help catch problems much closer to their =
source than the production version of the library.  I build it by:

$ cd ocaml-3.11.2/
$ ./configure <usual args>
$ cd asmrun
$ make libasmrund.a
$ cp libasmrund.a /opt/local/lib/ocaml/

Then I swap the installed libasmrun.a with libasmrund.a when a debug =
version is needed, and replace the original when done.  Regularly =
calling Gc.compact() helps triggers the additional checks more often.

I'm not sure if there is a way of using the debug version more easily =
--- libasmrunp.a (the profiling version) is installed by default, but =
libasmrund.a is not.
