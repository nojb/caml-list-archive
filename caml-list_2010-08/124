David and Basile, you are absolutely right about the redirection
issue. It also pretty obvious actually. I guess I need to pay more
attention.

Back to the original problem, I thought I had somehow gotten rid of it
but it still happens on someone else's computer. Calling 'Gc.compact'
regularly seems to work around the problem but calling 'Array.make'
might actually have the same effect: it might not fix the problem,
only prevent it from being triggered. I'll try to reproduce it this
week.

Also, I found out that I had a pretty ugly error in my C bindings but
it looks like it had no bad impact.
Basically, I had 'external ml_f : *string* -> string array' but the C
side read 'value ml_f()': the C function took *no* argument while
ocaml was passing one (I wasn't actually using the argument). Has
anything been developped against that? Anything to warn about errors
in bindings?

Finally, I don't think it has to do with the bug on 64bit systems with
ASLR, at least not directly: I'm using ocaml 3.11.2 and tried with
ASLR disabled. But I need to make a reproducer: the very high word
count did not always show up (although the out-of-memory error always
did).
