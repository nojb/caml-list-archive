Yes, they can be marshaled. As usual with marshaling, you don't get any 
type safety.

That said, first-class modules cannot really be used to simulate 
anonymous records since they rely on nominal typing: even if S and S' 
refer to identical signatures, the types (module S) and (module S') are 
not equal.
