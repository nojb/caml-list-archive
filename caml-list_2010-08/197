Fourth International Workshop on
High-level Parallel Programming and Applications (HLPP 2010)=A0
Baltimore, Maryland, September 25, 2010=A0
Affiliated to ICFP 2010=A0

Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN


Aims and Scope

As processor and system manufacturers adjust their roadmaps towards =20
increasing levels of both inter and intra-chip parallelism, so the =20
urgency of reorienting the mainstream software industry towards these =20
architectures grows.

At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies =20
are dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message =20
passing, or equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.

Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and =20
have a key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous =20
parallelism.

This workshop provides a forum for discussion and research about such =20
high-level approaches to parallel programming.
