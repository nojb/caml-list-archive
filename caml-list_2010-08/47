It guess it would, however it seems to me that such a task would be far too
ambitious.
Speaking for myself, I could relatively quickly write a VM for caml, but
writing the ocaml runtime design documents is something that would take me
way too much time. Most of ML users don't have access to the original caml
designers so we have no way to understand their design choices fully.
Having said that, the two tasks are non exclusive so we can definitely start
a project with all these goals in mind.

Don't you think it would be a more profitable work to document the
existing runtime instead ?
