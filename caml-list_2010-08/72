IWIL has been unusually sucessful in bringing together many talented 
developers, and thus in sharing information about successful implementation 
techniques for automated reasoning systems and similar programs.  We are 
looking for contributions describing implementation techniques for and 
implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem provers for various 
logics, logic programming systems, and related technologies. 

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a position 
statement (2 pages), a short paper (up to 5 pages), or a full paper (up to 
15 pages), in EasyChair format. Submission is via EasyChair ...
