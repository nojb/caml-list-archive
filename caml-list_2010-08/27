CUFP is a venue for people who use functional programming for practical
applications, and this year's program (in my very biased opinion) is
particularly good.  CUFP is two days this year, a full day of tutorials
(including a tutorial on Camlp4 and Template Haskell which should be of
particular interest here), and a day of shorter experience reports and
technical talks.

CUFP is co-located with ICFP, and you can register through ICFP's
registration page, which is now up.

Without further ado:

_________________________________________________________

Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic
research for over 35 years, and have seen an ever larger practical
impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial firms to
biomedical research labs. At the same time, a vigorous community of
practically-minding functional programmers has come into existence.

CUFP is designed to serve this community. The annual CUFP workshop is
a place where people can see how others are using functional
programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and
collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas about
the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn
practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work.

CUFP 2010 will feature three hour Functional Programming tutorials
given by language experts on the first day and Experience and
Technical Talks on day two. Attendees may attend either or both days.

See you there!
