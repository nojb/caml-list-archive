     RV 2010 : 1st International Conference on Runtime Verification
                   November 1-4, 2010, St. Julians, Malta

                          http://www.rv2010.org

         ** Early registration deadline: September 30, 2010 **

The 2010 Runtime Verication conference is a forum for researchers and industrial
practitioners for presenting theories and tools for monitoring and analyzing
system (software and hardware) executions, as well as forum for presenting
applications of such tools to practical problems. The field of runtime verification
is often referred to under different other names, including dynamic analysis, runtime
analysis, and runtime monitoring, to mention a few. Runtime verification
can be applied during the development of a system for the purpose of program
understanding, debugging, and testing, or it can be applied as part of a running
system, for example for security or safety monitoring, and can furthermore
be part of a fault protection framework.

RV 2010 is conducted over 4 days. The first day offers 6 tutorials in parallel 
sessions. The remaining three days offer 6 invited talks, and presentation of 
27 regular papers, short papers and tool demonstrations.

VENUE:

The conference takes place in St. Julians on Malta, and is hosted by the 
University of Malta. Malta lies at almost the exact geographical heart of the 
Mediterranean Sea. With Sicily some 95 kms to the North, Tripoli 350 kms to 
the South and Tunis 320 kms to the West, Malta is virtually at the crossroads 
between continents. Malta's pre-history dates back to 5000 B.C. The official 
languages of Malta are Maltese and English, so getting by with English is 
not a problem. Italian is also widely spoken. 

The accommodation and conference venue is the 5 star Le Meridien Hotel, 
located on the ground of a 19th century Villa in St Julians, overlooking Balluta Bay. 

The climate is typically Mediterranean. The average temperature in November is 
20C (70F) during the day and around 14C (60F) at night.
