CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

Third Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
25 September 2010,  Baltimore, Maryland, USA
A satellite workshop of ICFP 2010

PRESENTATION
The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable
power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is the
paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical insights
manifest in programs and in programming language design:
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow, to
name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006.
Selected papers were published as a special issue of the Journal of
Functional Programming (volume 19, issue 3-4).
The second MSFP workshop was held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP
2008.
