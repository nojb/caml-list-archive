Hi all,

I've completed the syntax extension I asked the list about a few days ago. It
probably still needs a few tweaks, but it works. While coding, a few
questions/remarks came to mind:

Is it possible to only load the filters from Camlp4? Using such a feature one
could load dumped AST (just like ocamlc/ocamlopt does) (instead of getting a
"Illegal character \132"), filter it and dump it again.

Is there a (nice) way to input/output multiple files? I managed reading from a
second file while transforming one but the code is (really) ugly.

The above two "features" would allow more complex build process than the basic
one file unix-filter.

Are the defaults lexers/parsers/filters exported? if true then Where? else Why?


Also:
Links on the page http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Relevant_Source_Files
are dead.
For those who ever need it camlunity as the ocamldoc online:
