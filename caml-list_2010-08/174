I am working on OASIS and OASIS-DB. The latter aims to translate _oasis
file into simple web pages (including markdown translation).

Have a look at:
http://oasis.ocamlcore.org/dev/browse?ver=0.2.0~alpha1&pkg=oasis

This web page has been translated from:
http://darcs.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=oasis;a=headblob;f=/_oasis

(this package is pretty complex, so there is a lot a library/exec/tests
but what is translated is basically Synopsis + Description).

If you add an _oasis file to your project and upload it to
oasis.ocamlcore.org it will generate this kind of pages.

Maxence, does it fit your requirement?

(the project is still at an early stage, but the upload is working)

Every project on forge.ocamlcore.org can upload a simple webpage and it
will be displayed on http://PROJECT.forge.ocamlcore.org. Just add html
files to /home/groups/PROJECT/htdocs on ssh.ocamlcore.org, same ssh key
as git/darcs/svn login. You can use rsync, scp or unison.

Feel free to contact me if you need further utilities for your project.
