In the DASDIP project (Design and Analysis of Secure Distributed
Protocols) there is a vacancy for a 2.5 year post-doc position at
the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam

DASDIP is a joint research project between the Theoretical
Computer Science group in Amsterdam (www.cs.vu.nl/~tcs) and
the Digital Security group in Nijmegen (www.ru.nl/ds/).

The project involves research at the crossroads of security,
formal methods, and distributed computations and procotols.

Taking the established theory of traditional distributed protocols
(such as consensus, leader election, or atomic commit) as starting
point, the project aims to study secure distributed protocols,
taking into account the possibility of malicious behaviour and the
realisation of security goals. More information on the project can
be found at

  http://www.cs.vu.nl/~wanf/dasdip.pdf

To apply, send a CV, letter of motivation, and names of at least
two references to Wan Fokkink (wanf@cs.vu.nl). Deadline for
application is September 21, 2010.
