Since ocaml doesn't do concurrent multithreading you can still block the
app with one thread blocking. If you have a blocking function you need
to enter/leave_blocking_section() around it. The Unix.read/write stubs
do that already but if you have your own stubs they might need that too.

What does strace say?
