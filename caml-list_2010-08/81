To check that it did work as expected (which I doubt) do
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
it should give 0

Are you sure that you don't have badly coded C routines that you call
from your Ocaml code (don't forget correct use of CAMLparam & CAMLlocal,
read again carefully
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual032.html and perhaps
other material about precise garbage collectors). 

Are you sure you don't have a memory leak in your Ocaml code? This could
happen when a reference value refers to a "big" value you don't need
anymore.

Cheers.
