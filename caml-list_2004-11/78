open has no effect on linking, all it does is allow
you to use unqualified names.

If you are not using code in a plugin, it won't be linked
from a library .. and it also won't be a problem, because
you're not using it .. that's the point of a library
after all.

Just place the cmx in the link command line to forcibly
link it, to see the side effects of initialisation.
