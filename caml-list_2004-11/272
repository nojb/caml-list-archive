Hello, Dr. Pierce.  Yes, I've tried this.  Reactive programming is a 
hobby of mine.  I haven't tried building a functional GUI toolkit, 
since I'm mostly interested in network application services.  But you 
might try checking out the Iom module in my OCaml Network Application 
Environment project on SourceForge.

	<http://sf.net/projects/ocnae/>

Basically, I ported Chapter 30 of Magnus Carlsson's and Thomas 
Hallgren's joint Ph.D. thesis to OCaml, then generalized it and rewrote 
it to take advantage of OCaml's mutable data structures inside the 
scheduler.

	<http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hallgren/Thesis>

Be advised: the most current release of Cf_gadget has a serious stack 
leak in the scheduler, causing some trivial reactors explode on the 
stack.  A fix-- involving yet another complete rewrite of the 
scheduler-- is already in CVS, and a new release will be coming soon.
