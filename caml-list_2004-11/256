I am looking at the 3.08 source and something about the code for stat
doesn't seem right.

The st_dev member of type Unix.stats is declared as int.  But according
to the Single Unix spec, the corresponding member of the C struct has
a defined type, dev_t; and in fact recent Linux kernels define dev_t
to a 64 bit type, even on 32 bit architectures.  So it looks like
the Ocaml function will lose the high order bits.

I came across this as I was trying to write a Unix interface for another
(unnamed) functional language :)
