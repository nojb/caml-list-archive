About Udine:
1 hour  from Venice (Venezia), Udine stands in the centre of Friuli Venezia Giulia
region in a favourable geographic position and is an important junction with
Austria and Slovenia. The city is a fascinating mixture of old and modern styles,
with the simple elegance of its buildings many of which are works of famous
artists, the suggestive 'rogge' similar to Venetian canals. It is one of the most
interesting and rich centres of the region with its artistic treasures and cultural
events. 'City of Tiepolo', so it is called as some of the best works of the
greatest Italian painter of XVII century are kept here. The local university is a
highly qualified one and is strongly 'Europe' oriented. Last but not least are the
age-long gastronomic tradition and the valued Doc wines from the surrounding hilly
countryside. In the town centre our organization manages directly the running of
the elegant and prestigious


About Venice:
Venice (Venetia) is one of the most glorious towns on the earth. It was a town that
created
a big sea Empire dominating all the mediterranean sea against the greek - byzantine
empire
in the beginning and the turkish - ottoman empire at the end. 
Venetia is a miracle of the human kind and human civilization from many points of
view. It is best known as the city built on water. It is famous for its canals and
gondolas used as transportation around the city. Famous also for the Saint Marcos
Charch and Square, for its museums, old aristocratic houses, the architecture, the
luxurity and the variety of which reflects the world power of this great naval
democracy.]
