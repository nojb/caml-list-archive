Hello "les Cémaliens",
I'm quite new in oCaml world, I partially learnt it in my school (EPITA 
/ Paris) and I'm going to finish this next year. I'm not really ease in 
english so my question will be short : do you think Caml coul be a nice 
langage for sound manipulation implementation, as Synthetizers, effects 
plugins ? I doesn't ask for answer in term of performance which should 
be I guess quite good :p, but more in term of software design and 
language facility.


Thank you for paying me attention.
Elthariel.
