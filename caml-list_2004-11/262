st_ino as an in is a more damning problem.  Linux, with XFS can easily have
inode numbers that exceed a 32-bit integer (especially a 31-bit integer).

Practically, on Linux, st_dev is still only using 16-bits on Linux, but
people are still trying to increase that.

Unix.LargeFile almost fixes everything, except for the st_dev, st_rdev, and
st_ino fields still being too small.  Increase those, and I would stop
having to put my own bindings to lstat in my programs :-)
