I am writing a code with almost the same functionality and
I was also bugged by the same problem and posed the same
question in the functional mailing list.

Julien Signoles was kind enough to answer:

I've got a similar algebra package as yours, but my design is quite
pragmatic: I have only programmed those parts I really needed.
I send my version in a separate mail.

It would be fun to cooperate, if you would like to.

(What I currently think about is the GCD computation over multivariate 
polynomial fields (it is needed for the functions field), and it
is hard to get it efficient. After I solved it, I will want to programm
Groebner base manipluation.)

Best regards, Christian
