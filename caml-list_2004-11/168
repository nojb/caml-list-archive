I see that I was wrong, I misunderstood malc's post. I can't bear when I 
see people which are actually "ignored" in the sense that they post 
interesting work and they don't get any reply, but this is not the case 
- obviously nobody is required to integrate any possible patch in the 
mainstream compiler (even if, to speak about this precise case, dynamic 
loading of C code is a very interesting feature).
