                           CONFERENCE GOALS

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent,
distributed, mobile, reconfigurable and heterogenous components. New
models, architectures, languages, verification techniques are
necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of
today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a
successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly
separate behavior from communication, therefore increasing modularity,
simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.

Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference
provides a well-established forum for the growing community of
researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and
implementation techniques for coordination.

                          PREVIOUS EDITIONS

The previous editions of COORDINATION took place in Cesena (Italy),
Berlin (Germany), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Limassol (Cyprus), York
(UK), and Pisa (Italy). More details are available at
http://music.dsi.unifi.it/coordination.

                          TOPICS OF INTEREST

They include but are not limited to:

* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component
  composition, concurrency, mobility, dynamic aspects of coordination,
  emergent behavior.
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of software architectures:
  patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional
  properties.
* Coordination, architectural, and interface definition languages:
  implementation, interoperability, heterogeneity.
* Multiagent systems and coordination: models, languages, infrastructures.  
* Dynamic software architectures: mobile code and agents, configuration,
  reconfiguration, self-organization.  
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: Web services,
  peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous
  computing. 
* Programming languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the
  development of coordinated applications
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures:
  programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and
  coordination models, case studies.
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination

                             PROCEEDINGS

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer, in
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Proceedings of
the previous editions of this conference are also available in the
LNCS series: volumes 1061, 1282, 1594, 1906, 2315, and 2949.

A selection of the best papers will published in a special issue of the
journal Science of Computer Programming.

                                   
                       SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Authors are invited to submit full papers electronically in PostScript
or PDF using a two-phase online submission process. Registration of
the paper information and abstract (max. 250 words) must be completed
before December 15, 2004. Submission of the full paper is due no later
than December 21, 2004. Submission will be handled through a conference
management system: instructions will be published at
http://www.coordination2005.org.

Submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS guidelines (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html) and must not exceed 15
pages in length. Papers that are not in the requested format or
significantly exceed the mandated length may be rejected without going
through the review phase. 

Submissions should explicitly state their contribution and their
relevance to the theme of the conference. Other criteria for selection
will be originality, significance, correctness, and clarity.

Simultaneous or similar submissions to other conferences or journals
are not allowed. 

                         CONFERENCE LOCATION

The conference will be hosted by the Institute of Informatics at the
University of Namur, Belgium.  

Capital of the Walloon Region, Namur is a beautiful city of 80.000
inhabitants. Its position at the confluent of two rivers gave it
military and economic appeal, exploited by the Roman Empire and by
many others since then. Much evidence of Namur's past can be visited
nowadays, including the citadel, one of the greatest in Europe. 

Close to Brussels (60 km) and at the intersection of European railways
and highways, Namur can be easily reached by road, train, and plane.
