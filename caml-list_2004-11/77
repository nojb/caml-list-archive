PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS


General:

The Calculemus Interest Group (http://www.calculemus.net/) is
dedicated to advancing the integration of symbolic computation and
formal deduction in mathematical software systems and computer-aided
verification tools.  Calculemus has previously sponsored a series of
11 symposia starting in 1996 whose aim is to bring together
researchers interested in this objective.  (Calculemus was also part
of IJCAR 2004.)  This series is the major forum for the presentation
of research in combining the capabilities of computer algebra systems
and computer deduction systems.

Calculemus 2005, the 12th symposium in the series, will be held July
18-19, 2005 at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom
in conjunction with Formal Methods 2005.  A principal theme of
Calculemus 2005 will be interactions with formal methods, including
problems in formal methods which require a mixture of computing and
proving, and applications of formal methods to the construction of
integrated systems.


Scope:

Calculemus 2005 welcomes research papers on all aspects of integrating
symbolic computation and formal deduction including:

   o Combining computer algebra and computer deduction systems.
   o Adding deductive capabilities to computer algebra systems.
   o Adding computational capabilities to computer deduction systems.
   o Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.
   o Design and implementation issues in integrated systems.
   o Formal method problems requiring mixed computing and proving.
   o Applications of formal methods to the construction of integrated 
     systems.
   o Case studies and applications.


Submissions:

Authors are invited to submit papers in the following two categories:

   o Research papers up to 15 pages describing original theoretical or
     applied research that has not been published elsewhere.

   o System descriptions up to 5 pages describing new systems,
     significant upgrades of existing systems, or experiments using
     systems.

The papers should be prepared following the LNCS guidelines and should
be submitted electronically.  Further information and submission
instructions will be posted at the Calculemus 2005 web page

  http://imps.mcmaster.ca/calculemus-2005/.


Important dates:

E-submission of title and abstract:       February 18, 2005
E-submission deadline:                       March 11, 2005
Notification of acceptance:                  April 15, 2005
