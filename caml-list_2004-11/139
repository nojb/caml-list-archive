Hi Brian,

Thanks for your reply.

OK - thanks.

Yeah, seems that way.  I think I'll explicitly associate an integer with
each string, along the lines of what you suggest.

Thanks for the tips - good advice.  Happily, it already works, and a factor
of two in performance actually does matter in my application.

Best,

Wheeler
