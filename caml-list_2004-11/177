Excuse me, but, next time, check your facts before posting. Dyanmically
linked modules in shared patch can be unloaded, not being Damien Doligez
i wouldn't go as far as to claim that the unloading process always works
correctly w.r.t GC, but the functionality is certainly there.

Plus, this is just a speculation though, if there are problems with the
way it is done now, i do not feel they are insurmountable.
