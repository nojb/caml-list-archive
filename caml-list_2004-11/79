It depends exactly on what information basis linking is done
For example, ocamldep works at syntax level and will report a dependency if
an open is done. Ocamlopt could (should ?) enforce such dependency when an
"open" directive is found, since ocamlc and ocamlopt-win32 are working
correctly with it.
