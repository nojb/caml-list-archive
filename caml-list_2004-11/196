Indeed.

If you are reasonably familiar with languages as complex as C++ and
Java, then Ocaml is definitely not too difficult but will require 
you to develope some new ways of thinking about programming problems.

Before starting with Ocaml, I had not programmed in a functional
language since some scheme (Lisp dialect) programming in University
around 1990.

I didn't have a book. All I had was the web documentation and a
problem I needed to solve. I ended up writing about 100 small 
test programs (100 lines or less) to test different concepts
and techniques.

Ocaml is a good choice.
