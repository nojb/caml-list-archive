Hi,

I asked this to the beginner's list but the answer was elliptic.
I re-ask it here.

OcamlWin.exe is consistently crashning.  I don't know if it
is because of SP2 of WinXP, but I would be surprised, as the rest
is holding well.  Also, I do not have the choice of Win.

In general, OcamlWin is working, butI crash it from I/O, when reading the keyboard :
print_string "What's your name ? ";
   flush stdout;
   let answer = input_line stdin in
   print_string ("Hello " ^ answer);
   print_string ", nice to meet you!\n";


Also, apart of an Emacs mode, is it possible to redirect the
interpreter's output to my small editor with with I do my own handy
auto-completion.  I do it with other languages,
but never found the way to do it with Ocaml.

As a matter of fact, even .Ocamlinit in the same directory of
OcamlWin.exe is not able to change the working directory with
directives.

Thanks for any help.
