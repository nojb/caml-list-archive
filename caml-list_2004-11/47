I have just uploaded a revised tarball for  Felix 1.0.18.
Felix is open source with BSD style FFAU licence.
http://felix.sf.net/downlooad/flx_1.0.18_src.tgz

This version now incorporates the Scheme interpreter
ocs-1.0 in the compiler. Ocs was 
written by Ville-Pertti Keinonen <will@exomi.com>
and the original source can be obtained from
URL http://will.iki.fi/software/ocs/

A scheme reference can be found at 
http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/

The interpreter is available standalone tool
(called 'ocs_main' at the moment, but the name will 
probably change)

It can also be used with the Felix preprocessor. 

#scheme (display "//generated by scheme\n")
#scheme (load "somefile.sch")

The environment is currently shared across
directives and include files so variables set
in one place can be used in subsequent places.

The #scheme directive is replaced by whatever it
writes to standard output, and is then
tokenised as if it were Felix code.

In future releases I may add system variables
and utilities to the environment, and perhaps
extend the interpreter so it can access some of
the compiler state. I will be examining whether
it is feasible to invert the control relation
of the front end so it's a scheme program
embedding Ocaml (rather than the other way arond).
This may help to make user control and extensions
easier to script.
