I read this, but I don't see how this differs from the behavior of 
vanilla Ocaml. I commonly use shared-object libraries in my code, and 
the Ocaml compiler can generate DLLs out of libraries for use within C 
code. The problem addressed by ASMDynlink dynlinking Ocaml compiled code 
within a running native code application. What has Vitaly's patch to do 
with this?

I also don't understand your sarcasm.
