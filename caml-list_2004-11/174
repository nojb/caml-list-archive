I think the whole reason for the little language Lua is to provide a language
for config files, so Lua-ML (used in some C-- compiler I think) is a similar
library.

Once you accept the need for doing some computation in the config file, it
seems that you want a small extension language interpreter for this task.
Scheme also works. I'm currently trying to decide between Scheme and Lua for
this task.
