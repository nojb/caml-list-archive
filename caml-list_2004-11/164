Maybe i wasn't clear enough. While working on the patch i (obviously)
asked questions (and was given quite comprehensive answers) from Xavier
Leroy for instance. I also learned his position on the subject. I think
there were maybe 5 people who contacted me personally, 2 of them had some
feature request, one actually reported bugs (thank you Vitaly)

There was/is one/two groups of people really interested in functionality
provided by the patch, one of them offered help, when it became clear i
can not provide enough resources to bring the patch uptodate w.r.t 3.0.8

But in general, most of the people fall into 'wouldn't it be cool to have
native dynamic loading/linking' category. And - yeah it probably would
have...

I wasn't ignored by Inria, i expressed my opinion, asked theirs, got it.
What's a little bit disappointing that nobody (after all those years)
presented any alternative.
