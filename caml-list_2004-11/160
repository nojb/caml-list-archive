Keyword here is "for use within C code", this patch is "for use within
OCaml code", also adressing name mangling, shared GC and runtime. 
Additionally it Natdynlink module is introduced (Natdynlnk mimics the
behaviour of Dynlink, but works with natively compiled OCaml shared
object). A little bit of research on the page would have (like, for
instance, getting the examples provided or reading README) would have
given you just as much information.

Sarcasm spurs from the fact that first version of this patch was
introduced in 2001 and developed till 2003. I had hoped that this will
result in some reaction, if not from Inria developers then from OCaml
users, alas this was not the case. Nothing w.r.t. native shared object
and/or dynamic linking of native code has changed since then. I myself
asked and waited for something akin to this for a bit, then decided to
went ahead and did it on my own, big mistake, all signs are there that
people do not need this functionality bad enough to do anything.
So be it.
