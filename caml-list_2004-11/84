Hello,

I am also trying to install mod_caml.  (and wiki next . . .)  Starting
with the 2.0.52 debian apache2.  I know about this patch:

http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/showattachment.cgi?attach_id=3D10734

But my debian package is applying a similar (same?) patch during
installation. =20

When loaded, I get a segfault on any page load, static or dynamic.  The
backtrace is below.  Ideas?  Things which I have noticed:

- The debian pcre rename patch left a few symbols pcre_ without
ap_pcre_.

- Googling mod_caml_get_dir_config gives a chat room discussion of
somebody having the same issue with apache 1.3.

Thanks,


Jeff Henrikson
