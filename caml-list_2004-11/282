Hi,

The context creation functions are already parametrized by the version 
of the protocol to use (SSL v2, v3, v2/3, TLS v1) in the CVS plus a few 
bug corrections. You might want to check it out. There are a few more 
things that I'd like to integrate and I'll make a new release then.
Thanks for the fedback.

Regards,

Samuel.
