It's not up-to-date (fuse is going towards its 2.1 release, while the 
existing mlfuse is for fuse 0.9), and it was not designed with 
multithreading in mind. If the latter was not true, I would not have 
rewritten it, however by now I must record a failure, since I did this 
all to get multithreading working and had no success :/ I am going to 
try to spot the problem this weekend - it's related to a previous 
recent post of mine on this list.

Apart from this, a question to the list: to implement the read and write 
operations I am constrained to string copying. Is there a way to share 
a string with C in ocaml or should I roll my own "cstring" type and use 
that, copying from/to strings using memcpy when necessary?

Bye

Vincenzo
