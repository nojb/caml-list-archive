I'll tell you this, there is no clean way to get stdin with OCamlWin
at the moment. I should probably look into rewriting the entire
internals that handle reading to and from the pipe. The actual system
that would work the best is statically linking the top level INTO the
application, keeping me from having to pipe in from a command window,
which is why it 'consistantly crashes' when reading from stdin.

I'll run it in debug mode, see if I can hotfix your crash, however, if
it is dealing with reading stdin, I wouldn't get your hopes up for the
moment.
