Install a 64-bit OS on the machine.  Mac OSX is still a 32-bit OS.  You can
enable -mcpu=G5 to make use of the 64-bit registers and such, the pointers
are still 32-bits, which means that ocaml words will still be 32 bits.

I don't know what Apple's plans are as far as 64-bit support in the OS.

PPC linux runs native 64-bit on the G5, but it isn't all that stable, yet.
