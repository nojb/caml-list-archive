Hi all, I am trying to write a complete, up-to-date, efficient and 
correctly multithreaded binding to the fuse api for ocaml. Fuse is a 
linux kernel module allowing filesystems to be implemented in user 
space, see

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/fuse

By now, OCamlFuse is complete and up-to-date, but multithreading has 
troubles. Anyway, I declare the single-threaded version to be in 
alpha-testing (i.e. internal, developers testing). Since I consider the 
developers of any free-software projects to be everybody willing to 
join, I announce it here, in the hope that someone will want to have a 
look at my efforts and to test it, write some example filesystem in 
ocaml, comment on the interface and possible improvements in 
implementation, or even better to help with multithreading, which 
"should" work but crashes under heavy load for mysterious reasons. 

Help or advices for packaging are also wanted, since I don't know too 
much about GODI or ocamlfindlib and have not so much free time to work 
on this project. I will answer to any question on the ocamlfuse-devel 
mailing list, please read the README to know fundamental issues.

The source lives in the cvs; you can find everything needed, including 
the mailing list, on the sourceforge project page:

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/ocamlfuse

I did everything in a hurry, and on a by-need basis, I am not an expert 
user of the ocaml C interface, so if you have suggestions, don't 
hesitate to tell me :)

Vincenzo Ciancia
