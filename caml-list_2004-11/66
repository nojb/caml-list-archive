Dear potential speaker:

On behalf of the organizing committee, I would like to extend a cordial invitation for you to attend one or both of the upcoming IPSI BgD multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary conferences.

They take place on two consecutive weekends, in two nearby locations (only about 200km away from each other, in the hills of France and on the coast of Spain).

The first one will be in Carcassonne, France (near Toulouse):

IPSI-2005 FRANCE (Carcassonne is a UNESCO World Heritage City)
Hotel de la Cite (arrival: 23 April 05 / departure: 26 April 05)
Deadlines: 20 December 04 (abstract) & 20 January 05 (full paper)

The second one will be in Costa Brava, Spain (near Barcelona):

IPSI-2005 SPAIN (S'Agaro is the Pearl of Costa Brava)
Hostal de la Gavina (arrival: 28 April 05 / departure: 1 May 05)
Deadlines: 27 December 04 (abstract) / 27 January 05 (full paper)

All IPSI BgD conferences are non-profit. They bring together the elite of the world of science; so far, we have had seven Nobel Laureates speaking at the opening ceremonies. The conferences always take place in some of the most attractive places of the world. All those who come to IPSI conferences once, always love to come back (because of the unique professional quality and the extremely creative atmosphere); lists of past participants are on the web, as well as details of future conferences.

These conferences are in line with the newest recommendations of the US National Science Foundation and of the EU research sponsoring agencies, to stress multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary research (M.I.T. research). The speakers and activities at the conferences truly support this type of scientific interaction.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Internet
* Computer Science and Engineering
* Mobile Communications/Computing for Science and Business
* Management and Business Administration
* Education
* e-Medicine
* e-Oriented Bio Engineering/Science and Molecular Engineering/Science
* Environmental Protection
* e-Economy
* e-Law
* Technology Based Art and Art to Inspire Technology Developments
* Internet Psychology

If you would like more information on either conference, please reply to this e-mail message.

If you plan to submit an abstract and paper, please let us know immediately for planning purposes.

Sincerely Yours,

Prof. V. Milutinovic, Chairman
IPSI BgD Conferences
