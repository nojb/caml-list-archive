  Hi. I have a problem with the threads library. Basically I am unable to
access the library.

  The libraries are installed in the default location
(/usr/local/lib/ocaml) (I installed version 3.08.1, on linux
2.6.4-54.5-smp on i686, running SuSE)

  I have the problem when I run the normal toplevel and a customized
toplevel.

  On the normal toplevel, I first try to do

  #load "/usr/local/lib/ocaml/threads/threads.cma";;

which complains about Unix being undefined, so I do

  #load "/usr/local/lib/ocaml/unix.cma";;

but then if I try

  Thread.create;;

it tells me it the value is unbound.

  If I try

open Thread

it tells me "Unbound module Thread".

  If I try the VM threads by doing:

#load "/usr/local/lib/ocaml/vmthreads/threads.cma";;

it complains about a conflict of interface with the normal Threads, and
then it ends the toplevel with

# Fatal error: exception Sys_blocked_io

  I get the same error even if I load the VM threads without loading the
other Thread module.

  I get exactly the same results if I make a customized toplevel as in:

ocamlmktop -thread -custom -o threadtop unix.cma threads.cma -cclib -lunix
-cclib -lthreads



  What am I doing wrong?


  Thanks
