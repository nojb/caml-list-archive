Thanks, I already knew of it, and it is my first choice among Schemes.

It ain't what you know that hurts you, its what you know that ain't so!

You are wrong about Lua-ML. Please visit the C-- web site, read the
papers, buy the T-shirt, etc.  I'm pretty tempted to go with Lua, because
the people who'll be writing the config files for my program aren't
programmers and Lua may have more palatable syntax.
