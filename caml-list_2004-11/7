I'm pleased to announce that the first release of
Ochra, v0.1, is now available. The release and
information is available at:

http://www.guldheden.com/~sandin/ochra

Ochra is a syntax extension for OCaml, extending the
language with explicit support for programming using
an Object-Oriented Reference Attributed Grammar (RAG)
formalism. The primary intended use is for compiler
construction. It introduces a new kind of classes,
called productions, which support a number of extra
features for specifying AG node children and
attributes. Ochra is modeled on JastAdd, a compiler
construction tool which extends Java. Ochra is however
a less intrusive addition than JastAdd, which along
with RAG support also introduces Aspect Orientation in
Java. Ochra instead relies on the more powerful
modularization mechanisms of OCaml (multiple
inheritance, structural subtyping, parametrized types
and modules, ...), compared to Java, to provide the
same level of modularity.

JastAdd has been used to construct, among other
things, a Java compiler and is used in compiler
classes at Lund Institute of Technology.

Comments are ofcourse appreciated:)

Ochra is released under the LGPL license with the same
exceptions as for the OCaml libraries.
