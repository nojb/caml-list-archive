I didn't have any particular reason for choosing that value. If you think
that STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT makes more sense under windows, then I'm all for
that (esp. since you knew it existed and thus more than I).

Mostly I didn't want it to be near 'user' returnable values like 0,1,2,...
and also not near syscall return values -1,... 0x80 seemed to be a good
middle ground. ;) Another suggestion might be to use the signal number
itself for the return code.

At least for me the return code is irrelevant; I just need to be able to
kill my child processes when the ocaml program quits abnormally.

I'd like to point out that this patch can only work for child processes
created from the ocaml program. So, I think it's unlikely that there is
a user involved to interpret the CTRL-C, or even be concerned that the
process vanished.

PS. Did you try the patch? Does it work?
