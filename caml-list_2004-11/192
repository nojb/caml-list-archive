Thats the copy and paste from my dev version, and yeah, that doesn't
even look like it is working properly.

And when I break it out line by line it goes ape. If you give me a
night I can think it over as to how to handle when somebody asks for
stdin, but really its near impossible to tell that the console is
waiting for input...basically piping the toplevel is the wrong
approach. But I have yet to succeed in embedding the toplevel :-/
