Hello,

> In order to compile native code you need ml.exe (MS asm linker) which I am
> not sure is included in the above packages. Please check the report from

I have, in fact, seen that.  And, ml.exe is part of the processor pack
listed in Alain's report.  The way to extract it is:

(1) Download vcpp5.exe
(2) vcpp5.exe is only a cab file.  You can extract the contents with
any decent program (I used WinRAR).  From the resulting folder, it is
easy to pick out 'ml.exe' and 'ml.err'.

So, all that is stopping me now is this problem with creating the
stdlib.lib library.  Does anyone know of a command I can manually run
from within the 'stdlib' folder to create the library?

Thanks for the quick reply,

Sachin.
