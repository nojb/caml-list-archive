I am currently playing with OCaml 3.09+dev6 (2004-11-06) from CVS. I 
really like the new "unused variable" warnings (already found couple of 
minor bugs in our project while going over these warnings). However 
there is one issue that I am not sure how to solve - all the 
camlp4-processed files, the "EXTEND" directives end up causing a large 
number of "unused variable loc" warnings. I could, of course, just turn 
off the "Z" warning for the camlp4-preprocessed files, but this would, 
obviously, shut up the meaningful warnings as well.

So I am wondering - are there any plans for addressing this for the 3.09 
release? Thank you!
