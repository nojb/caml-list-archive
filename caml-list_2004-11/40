Daniel de Rauglaudre wrote a Camlp4 extension that lets you export (and
import) non-circular data to XML (it reads type definitions and uses this
to insert the ad hoc export/import functions).
This is called IoXML. Maybe it has not been updated for the 3.08
version of Camlp4.
It should be not too difficult to adapt it for printing data with an
OCaml-compliant syntax.
