Hi,

on the unix module documentation, there is a table with functions that
are not supported on the windows platform. It seems that this table is
a bit outdated.

- set_nonblock and clear_nonblock seems to be implemented
- lstat is implemented (same as Unix.stat)
- link is implemented (creates hard links according to sources...
still can't compare to unix link i guess)
- rewinddir is implemented, manual description says "not implemented;
re-open the directory instead" (and that is what it does: it re-opens
the directory)
- lockf is implemented for Windows NT platforms

Maybe this could be corrected on the manuals?

Tiago
