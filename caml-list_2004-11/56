Aside from clever uses of various bits of the top level, you can also
use camlp4 to automatically generate print functions for types.  I think
there is an example in the camlp4 manual.

What we really need is generics.  I thought there was a post in the
mailing list some time ago saying that generics was going to be
appear in O'Caml at some point, but I haven't seen anything for a long
time.  Does anyone know if it is still planned?
