Ah! I asked the same question just a bit ago!

A "language extension" to Ocaml (Make sure you have 3.07.11 or
greater) is to directly assign 32 bit integers without using
Int32.of_string. Just add an "l" to the end of the constant. (Lower
case "L" if your font is strange and it looks like a 1 | I) It's like
so:

# let blah =3D 0x8FFFFFFFl;;
val blah : int32 =3D -1879048193l
#

-Corey=20
