We are willing to allow other companies to use our code in their 
products, so long as they are willing to release such products to the 
community for mutual benefit. Essentially, anyone interested in using 
our technology has two alternatives:
1) invest time and programming resources to improve our technology (and 
release it under the GPL or not release it at all)
2) invest money into a consulting contract with us to help them develop 
their products, whereby we would improve the core technology and 
continue to release it under the GPL.

Overall, we've been in business for 20 months now, so we are no longer a 
newborn company. Our experience is significant, I think. We've been 
living by making GPLed software. Any code we release is covered by the 
GPL. We are still climbing the Himalayas of technology, so I can't say 
we are making cartloads of money, but we are making cartloads of 
technology while maintaining a non-negative cash-flow. We consider our 
results extremely pleasing. And, let this be noted, all our code is 
either written in Ocaml or in any one of a number of DSLs whose compiler 
we have written in Ocaml.
