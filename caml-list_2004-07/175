After making a few minor changes, my program started raising the=20
Out_of_memory exception.  The strange thing is it fires a split=20
second after the program starts.  It happens so fast, 'top' doesn't=20
even have a chance to register it on its radar.

I narrowed it down to a 'Hashtbl.find' application.  Just prior to the=20
statement I did a 'Gc.print_stat stdout':

minor_words: 1044856
promoted_words: 360738
major_words: 371008
minor_collections: 31
major_collections: 6
heap_words: 368640
heap_chunks: 6
top_heap_words: 368640
live_words: 352563
live_blocks: 83968
free_words: 15973
free_blocks: 513
largest_free: 9539
fragments: 104
compactions: 0
Fatal error: exception Out_of_memory

Do these numbers look OK?  I have 249MB of total swap memory, with=20
currently 216 MB free.  Any ideas?

The results are the same for both 3.07+2 and 3.08.0.

I'll try to produce a simplified test case.  Unfortunately it's in a=20
rather convoluted spot in the application.

Thanks for any help.
