on the subject of interfacing OCaml with C/C++, it is not clear
to me whether and how OCaml objects of sum types can be passed
to a C/C++ function.  For example, suppose I have the declaration

type expr =
     Variable of int
   | Coefficient of int
   | UPlus of expr
   | UMinus of expr
   | Sum of (expr * expr)
   | Difference of (expr * expr)
   | Product of (expr * expr)

What is the best way to pass an expr object to C/C++?
How can C/C++ code visit such a structure?
Many thanks for your time and patience,

     Claudio
