Hey all, i'm trying to write a very simple program using input_line to grab
input from stdin ... but it is going horribly wrong! try putting the 
following
in a toplevel:

<<cut>>
open Printf;;

let main () =
try
printf "start";
while true do
  printf "just before"; flush stdout;
  let line = input_line stdin in
  printf "print the line %s" line
done
with End_of_file ->
printf "should exit";;

main () ;;
<<cut>>

on my machine, it works fine, but never reaches the "should exit" line-
it seems like the End_of_file exception is never thrown - this is the same
even if i use read_line () instead of input_line.... what am i doing wrong?

thanks!

nick
