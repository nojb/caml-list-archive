I cannot and would not like to prohibit your uses of Obj.magic. Go on
if you dare. I just pointed out that this particular use of Obj.magic
created a value that is considered by the Caml system as an ``<unknown
constructor>'': a value that breaks the compiler invariant so deeply
that it cannot print it. This is a bad property that could eventually
bit your program and crash it.

That's still something to do...
