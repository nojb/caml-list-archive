Precedence: bulk

In general, the associativity and precedence of an operator (unless
you go out to camlp4 or something) is based on the operator's first
character.  For example +/ would act like +, */ would act like *, and
so on.  For this reason, you'll often see O'Caml operators defined as
"basic operator followed by some strange symbol."  In your add_num
case, +/ and friends would probably mesh well.  Then you also get the
expected interaction when mixing +/ and */.
