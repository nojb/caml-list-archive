You are saying that even though Bigarray declares its array element
access functions as EXTERN, and implements them in C code, that ocamlopt
ignores this and does something else?  Using some completely different
source code, perhaps?  (And where is that code?)

Would ocamlopt generally perform such tricks for C functions declared
EXTERN?  How?
