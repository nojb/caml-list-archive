"The threads library is implemented by time-sharing on a single
processor. It will not take advantage of multi-processor machines.
Using this library will therefore never make programs run faster.
However, many programs are easier to write when structured as several
communicating processes."

However, the documentation states that the native threads library is
implemented using the system's native threading. (POSIX threads, in my
case)

Is the quote above still consistent with the native threads implementation?
