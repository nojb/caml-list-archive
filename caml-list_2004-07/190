I almost consider ExtLib to be part of "standard OCaml", along with
PCRE.  It's easier just to have both installed whenever I set up a new
machine with OCaml, than to have to worry about writing the extra code
to simulate functionality already in ExtLib.

(I also have my own mini-library which is installed everywhere by
default, but I'm trying to push most of that code into ExtLib :-)
