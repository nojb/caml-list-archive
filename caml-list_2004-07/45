Dear Caml-list & CDuce-list,

I'm pleased to announce the long-awaited CDuce 0.2.0 release.

CDuce is a strongly typed functional language, with first-class and
overloaded functions, adapted to the manipulation of XML documents.
CDuce is fast, type-safe, and conforms to basic XML standards.

More information about CDuce:

  http://www.cduce.org/

Source distribution:

  http://www.cduce.org/download.html

A GODI package is available (under the name apps-cduce). This is the
recommended way to build CDuce from sources. Packages and ports for
other systems (Redhat, Debian, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, WinXP) will come
later.


W.r.t. CDuce 0.1.1, the release adds separate compilation, a
preliminary implementation of an XML query language, and several other
improvements. The release also includes a new type-safe OCaml-CDuce
interface, which is described at:

  http://www.cduce.org/manual_interfacewithocaml.html

This interface allows:
1- to use existing OCaml libraries within CDuce, and
2- to project an OCaml signature (.cmi) to a CDuce unit in order to use
   it in a mixed OCaml-CDuce project.

It makes CDuce of special interest to OCaml users.


Interested people are invited to join the CDuce users mailing list:

  http://www.cduce.org/mailing.html


Enjoy, and let us know about your experience !


  Alain Frisch, on behalf of the CDuce team (http://www.cduce.org/team.html)
