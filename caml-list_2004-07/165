Let's keep this concrete.  Show me OCaml companies making GPL money in
whatever application domain, or any-other-language companies making
making GPL money in embedded controllers.  Where's the business model
here?  Show me the money.  If GPL is working anywhere in the embedded
market, why does it work?  Why does it fail?  How has it impacted the
growth of a language community?

I can see that you didn't accept my Preface, and I surmise you feel
strongly about licensing issues.  I'm not going to back down about
discussing them in Alex's specific case, however.  This is about what
will grow OCaml in the embedded marketplace, and what won't.

Instead of arguing with you, Benjamin, I'd rather ask Alex:

- why have you opted against a more traditional proprietary license, for
$XXXXXX, that gives full closed source proprietary control to the
licensee?

- why have you opted against a MIT style license?

I'm interested in understanding your choices, not berating them.
