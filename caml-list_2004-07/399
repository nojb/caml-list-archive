I apologize if this is not the right list to send this too, but I'm 
nearing my feeble wits' end and I'm starting here...

I have a project that is currently using c++ that I would like to convert to
Ocaml (parts of it are already in Ocaml and I'd like to simplify my
codebase). However, I am using the Spirit library from Boost to do parsing
in c++ and I cannot figure out Camlp4 to convert it.  If there is anyone who
knows both Spirit and Camlp4 who can help me I was appreciate it a lot.

Maybe I am an idiot, but I've been through the tutorial and it didn't help
me very much. I've been looking for example code for simple parsers and I've
found many, many calculators but little else. I've even tried to go back to 
ocamlyacc/ocamllex but the yacc/lex syntax bothers me.

I can even give you an example of what I'm trying to parse and then use the
resulting data structure (I could do regex, but these are from largish data
files and the robostness provided by a parser is what I need).

a23fassssadfj4532|10,2;13,3;20;20|10|20|30|B
aassafjeifdfj4532|11,21;13,33|1|2|3|T
... and so on for about a million lines or so

the unasked question here is "Is this the right way to go?" I mean, is
Camlp4 the tool I should be using?  I think it is, because the top down,
recursive descent parsing is what Spirit does, but maybe I've just confused
things.  

Any help is appreciated.  Thank you all.
