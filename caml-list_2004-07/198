That is reasonable for an Ocaml developer (which I am),
but not as clearly reasonable for a *client* of my
code who is probably not. I feel the need to supply
a system consisting of the smallest number of
separately installable components for obvious
reasons: every dependence on a third party component
makes my package fragile. For example, I'd like it
to install on Win32 native.. I don't have control
of third party packages so how do i respond when
a client has a problem?

Note the problem *isn't* the quality of the third
party code! Its sure to be better than mine :)
I have a client that installs my package on 5 different
platforms (his product is a multi-platform game, it runs
on OSX, Linux[both PC and XBox], OS9, Cygwin and Mingw 
at present).

This problem may be substantially corrected by GODI
because it provides a *unified* installation system.
