I don't think Camlp4 is the right tool.  It's mainly an Ocaml 
preprocessor, you want Ocaml code that parses the line.

Ocamllex/Ocamlyacc are great for a lot of things- but I think I agree, 
they're also the wrong tools for the job.

I think what you want is a split function- a function that takes a string 
and splits it up at certan characters.  It'd have a type something like:
val split: char -> string -> string list

You'd then read an entire line, split it apart on '|'.  You could then 
split various substrings on ';' to get the integers, etc.

Hope this helps.
