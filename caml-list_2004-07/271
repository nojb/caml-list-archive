The first (and currently only) such license is a GPL-style
"contaminating" license, so it's not what we want for Caml.
The press release mentions other licenses in the work with different
flavours, so we'll see when they are ready.

Moreover, we need these licenses to be recognized as open-source by
Debian and other authorities before even considering to use them.
Some of the initial reactions to the press release suggest that this
might not be obvious.
