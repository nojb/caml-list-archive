With ImageMagick we can nearly go as far than with Gimp
(except the fact that IM have no GUI).
Check this to see all the image manipulations IM provides :
http://www.imagemagick.org/www/perl.html

Perhaps I am wrong, but
Camlimages does not seem to provide so much possibilities,
it seems to be closer to GD than to ImageMagick.
And ImageMagick is closer to Gimp, than to GD :)

As I am graphist and not informatician, i will perhaps not have the skills to 
make the implementation of the image manipulation program of my dreams
but I will try though ;-)

So that's why I prefer to get the more powerful library I can ...


Cheers
