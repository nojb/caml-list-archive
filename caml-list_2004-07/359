I'm pretty aware, from many years of experience, what the performance
characteristics of C/C++ arrays are vs. function call access to
comparable data, over millions of iterations.  Unless ocamlopt has a way
of avoiding EXTERN Bigarray declarations, we are talking about C code.

In other words, yes function calls are expensive in C compared to the
cost of just accessing an array element.

Not on any CPU I've worked on.  Generally speaking, you must save state
when you make function calls, and that is never a 1-2 clock cycle
operation.  If you have ways to inline stuff, great, but generally
speaking you can't do that with EXTERN C library stubs.  I don't know if
OCaml has great compiler technology that other languages don't have.
"It's not inlineable" is the drill in the C/C++ universe.

Praise Be to the caml-list Bayesian filter! It blesseth
my postings, it is evil crap!  evil crap!  Bigarray!
Unboxed!  Overhead!  Wondering!  chant chant chant...
