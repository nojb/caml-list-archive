Right, but that one is difficult to fix.

What happens is that Camlp4 and OCaml use different parsing
technologies, Camlp4 has to do a lot of (sometimes dirty) work to be
able to parse all OCaml programs. The result is that slightly more
programs are accepted by camlp4o than by ocaml, which is better than
the other way around ;-)

I'm afraid that nothing useful can be done here.
