Well, if you are using OCaml on WIndows, you probably need Cygwin (at least
as an alternative testing environment), so you can use Cygwin version
of (X)Emacs,
which are much better integrated with the environment (I prefer GNU
Emacs, though I'd
agree that there isn't such a big difference, especially if you are
not using multi-language
features)
