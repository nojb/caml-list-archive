To all OCaml users who track the CVS or are willing to beta-test:

We are progressing towards a release of OCaml 3.08, and at the same
time experimenting with a two-branch development model, one branch for
short-term bug fixes and the other for longer-term developments.

If this model turns out to work well, we hope it will make it easier
for users to benefit from bug fixes between major releases, and speed
up the release process.

Users who track the CVS sources from camlcvs.inria.fr are encouraged
to switch to the current release branch, which is labeled "release308".
This is the branch where we currently do bug fixes before release 3.08
and where we'll do post-release bug fixes if needed.  It is currently
more up-to date than the main branch, which is the development branch,
and will remain so for a couple of months at least.  To switch your
CVS checked-out sources to the release branch, just do

          cvs update -r release308

Users who are willing to beta-test the upcoming 3.08 release should
also get the sources from the "release308" branch of the CVS:

 cvs -d ":pserver:anoncvs@camlcvs.inria.fr:/caml" checkout -r release308 ocaml

Now is a very good time to test and report bugs.

Thanks for your cooperation,

- Xavier Leroy
