Great... again, how is a GPL license workable for others with a
commercial interest in the technology?  I am saying that license is not
workable.

I think I'd say "proven in this instance" rather than "mature."
Maturity has connotations of widespread usage and ready availablility of
software and programmers.  In OCaml-land, that's certainly work
remaining to be done.  I'm encouraged that I've been able to start a ML
SIG in Seattle, and one guy actually gets paid to use OCaml at his job,
but most don't.
