That's the debugger view of the problem :)

The Caml compiler's view is simpler: you broke the type system, you
get wrong results!

I have no time to try and find a way to get a bus error with that one
but I would not be glad to use software based on such a ugly hack that
is not proved harmless in any case.

``the application is a server which should run permanently'' ? Wao!
May I suggest no to use Obj.magic too often for this kind of
application ? Especially when you ``don't think that this hack will
be too dangerous'': this hack could kill your server not too permanently!
