                        Nara, Japan


The 16th Int. Conf. on Rewriting Techniques and Applications (RTA'05) 
will collocate with the 7th International Conference on Typed Lambda
Calculi and Applications (TLCA'05) as part of the Federated Conference 
on Rewriting, Deduction and Programming (RDP'05).


IMPORTANT DATES:
 Nov    12, 2004: Deadline for electronic submission of title and abstract
 Nov    19, 2004: Deadline for electronic submission of papers
 Jan    14, 2005: Notification of acceptance of papers
 Feb     4, 2005: Deadline for final versions of accepted papers
 Apr 19-21, 2005: Conference


RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects 
of rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

* APPLICATIONS:
  case studies; rule-based (functional and logic) programming; 
  symbolic and algebraic computation; theorem proving;
  system synthesis and verification; proof checking.
* FOUNDATIONS:
  matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;
  strategies; constraint solving; explicit substitutions; tree automata.
* FRAMEWORKS:
  string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
  higher-order rewriting; proof nets; constrained
  rewriting/deduction; categorical and infinitary rewriting.
* IMPLEMENTATION:
  compilation techniques; parallel execution; rewriting tools.
* SEMANTICS:
  equational logic; rewriting logic.


INVITED TALKS will be given at RTA'05 by:
  * Amy Felty                 (Ottawa)
  * Yoshihito Toyama          (Sendai)
  * Philip Wadler             (Edinburgh)


BEST PAPER AWARDS:
An award of 100,000 Yen will be given to the best paper or papers as decided
by the PC.

RTA'05 SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submission categories include regular research
papers and system descriptions. Also problem sets and
submissions describing interesting applications of rewriting
techniques will be very welcome. The page limit is 15 pages 
(10 pages for system descriptions).

As usual, accepted papers will appear in the Springer-Verlag
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. More information about
paper submission is available at the RTA'05 web page.

LOCATION, TRAVEL, ACCOMODATION, AND REGISTRATION
The conference takes place in Nara park, which is one of the most important
cultural sights of Japan with some of the oldest and most impressive temples 
and shrines. Airfares from Europe or the US to Japan are not expensive in
