For elegance, I've been using the built-in polymorphic comparisons 
(particularly equality) to compare ASTs. I just added some metadata to my AST 
type and now it needs its own comparison function (or polymorphic compare 
bails at run-time with Invalid_argument "equal: functional value").

Is there an easy way, or does anyone have a tool, which will let me track down 
all applications of polymorphic functions to my AST type so that I can alter 
them to use my customised versions?

Cheers,
Jon.
