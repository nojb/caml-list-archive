Your best bet is to contact Patrick at pmeredit at uiuc.edu to find
out his status; if he doesn't respond, then forward your question to
Chris Lattner at sabre at nondot.org.

The CAML front-end to the LLVM compiler is just that, a front-end.
I wouldn't foresee any migration of code from llvm into the OCaml
core distribution.

Even if the front-end has progressed, I imagine the lack of a garbage
collector might be annoying....

I'm not at all involved with the LLVM compiler, so all my comments may
be wrong. :)
