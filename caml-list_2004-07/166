You don't deal with OCaml business, marketing, and strategic growth
issues on this list?  Where would you deal with them then?

Granted, other languages often have different lists to deal with these
sorts of practical business concerns.  But OCaml hasn't evolved to that
point.

Do you think nobody on this list should discuss how to popularize OCaml,
in any particular application domain?
