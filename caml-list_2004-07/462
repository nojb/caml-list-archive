everyone=97

I've been slow to follow through on my threats to release an update to=20=

the Pagoda Core Foundation, and I apologize for that.  My day job=20
interrupted=97=A0in the immortal words of Sascha in the classic film=20
_Casablanca_, "Yvonne, I love you, but he pays me."

Once again, I tuned the existing API somewhat.  Mostly in places where=20=

I hope few people are likely to tread.  I fixed a few bugs, and I made=20=

some performance tweaks to some obscure corners of the library, e.g.=20
[Cf_gadget].  I also added some new modules (see below).

I upgraded to Ocaml 3.08 recently, and the library works fine with that=20=

version.  It should still compile with 3.07+2, but I can't promise that=20=

the next release won't use the cool new classless object feature in=20
3.08 (omg! that is totally wizard! thanks, inria!)

As before, the new distribution is available at either of the following=20=

URL's:

         <http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/pagoda/cf-0.3.tar.bz2>
         <http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/pagoda/cf-0.3.tar.gz>

And the online documentation (generated by ocamldoc) can be found here:

         <http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/pagoda/doc/cf/>  (new =
location!)

There is still no programmer's guide.  If I learn that people are using=20=

this library, then maybe I'll write one.  (All serious development=20
offers from commercial publishers will be seriously considered.)

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Pagoda Core Foundation (cf) library =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Highlighted features include:

- Functional streams and stream processors (extended).
- Functional bootstrapped skew-binomial heap.
- Functional red-black binary tree (associative array).
- Functional sets and maps based on red-black binary tree.
- Functional real-time catenable deque.
- Functional LL(x) parsing using state-exception monad.
- Functional lazy deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
- Functional lexical analyzer (using lazy DFA and monadic parser).
- Functional substring list manipulation (message buffer chains).
- Gregorian calendar date manipulation.
- Standard time manipulation.
- System time in Temps Atomique Internationale (TAI).
- Unicode transcoding.
- Extended socket interface (supports IPv6 and UDP w/multicast).
- Universal resource identifier (URI) manipulation.
- I/O event multiplexing (with Unix.select).

Note: see the ISSUES file for a list of open problems in this release.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Required Components =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This library requires the following external components:

- Objective Caml (v3.07+2 or newer)
- Findlib (tested with v0.8.1 and v1.0.4)

Principle development was on Mac OS X 10.3.  The final version of this
library also compiled successfully and passed all self-tests without=20
warnings
on Suse Linux 9.0 for x86-32.  Other platforms with POSIX-like=20
environments
should require only a minimal porting effort.

One major open issue: the extended socket interface is broken under=20
WIN32.
(The author invites help porting the library to other environments.)

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Version 0.3 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Highlights of the changes:

+ Rewrite the scheduler in [Cf_gadget] so that it sucks less wind.  The=20=

kernel
   is now built entirely out of mutable structures, and we got rid of=20
the 'pin'
   type because we don't represent wires internally as integer keys in a=20=

map.
+ Added [Cf_journal], a foundation for extensible diagnostic event=20
journaling
   inspired by Log4j from the Apache Foundation.  (Look for a full suite=20=

of
   extensions to be sold separately.)
+ Removed the [?xf] optional exception function from the=20
[Cf_lexer.create]
   function.  Use a derived cursor class with an [error] method that can=20=

be
   overridden for this=A0purpose.
+ Added [Cf_scan_parser], which scans an input sequence using the=20
[Scanf] module
   in the standard library.
+ Minor convenience functions added to [Cf_parser].
+ Other bug fixes.  (See CHANGES file.)
