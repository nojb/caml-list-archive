let zprintf fmt = Printf.kprintf (fun _ -> ()) fmt
should be ok.

But I think that the format string should not even be parsed. I've got
no solution (except the one below) to this!

The above hack was written with the same requirements, and provide the
possibility to change log levels (or log flags actually).

Actually, I more and more hate printf, both in C and in Ocaml. I
really believe it is a nightmare.

A possible suggestion might be to 
  add a StopPrintf exception to Printf
and
  add a tryprintf function to Printf, which takes a prologue function
as an argument. If the prologue raises an exception, no formatting
occur;  otherwise, tryprintf works like kprintf
