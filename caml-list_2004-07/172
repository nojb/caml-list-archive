Ok, if that is the generally accepted criteria, I will attempt to
rephrase.  I wasn't exactly terse before, and that probably gets in the
way.  Here are the questions:

- What would make OCaml more popular in the commercial embedded market?
- How does *any* language gain popularity in the commercial embedded
market?
- is community contribution terribly relevant to this market?
- under what licensing schemes did community contributions actually
occur?
- did the company feel it strengthened their product?
- did the company make money and retain control over their product?
- did community interest grow or stagnate due to choices made?

I do not know any way to answer these questions without referencing
things other than OCaml.  If you want to learn from history, you have to
look at other people's efforts, and those are not OCaml efforts.
