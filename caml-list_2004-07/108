That is true/false.  These are *not* synonymous sets of registers.  MMX
registers are incompatible with the x87 FPU as you describe, because
they're aliases/repurposings of the x87 FPU registers.  The *XMM*
registers, associated with SSE/SSE2, are entirely separate registers.
You can most certainly use the x87 FPU simultaneously with those, no
special instruction state dances required.

Well, you could pass the first 6 integer arguments via the normal
registers, the first 8 floating point arguments via the x87 FPU, and the
next 8 integer or float arguments via the XMM registers.  The values
wouldn't always be interoperable, you'd have to go through memory in
various cases, but it's better than nothing getting passed in registers
at all.  In any event I think this is more useful for FPU than integer
code.

Yes I mentioned the P4 requirement.  So what?  P4s have been around for
quite some time now.  It of course would be a conditional compilation
flag, but I see no reason why one should fear a paucity of SSE2 support
nowadays.  My late model 866 MHz P-III is 4 year old technology now.  A
functional workhorse, but obsolescent.

Those of you with particularly old computers are cheap-ass bastards who
should afford buying a new one every 6 years or so.  :-)  I do believe
in buying "behind the power curve," but come on, by the time anybody
actually implements what I'm talking about the P-IIIs will be mostly
gone.
