Precedence: bulk

For the first time in 5 years, recompiling my NML system to adopt a new
release of OCaml is generating immediate Bus Errors and aborting when I try
to start the freshly built NML system. OCaml runs just fine.

So this tells me that something in the OCaml-C interface has changed. There
is a fair amount of this used by NML to interface to everything in the
outside universe for collecting data from external devices.

Any hints about where to begin looking would be appreciated. Perhaps
callback-registration, or finalization blocks? Or perhaps something in the
threading machine is incompatible with Cocoa startup code?

I haven't yet tried this process on Windows boxes. The first look was on Mac
OS X. Cocoa is only used to the extent that I allocate some memory
reclamation buffers for use in connecting to external AquaTerm servers using
the Cocoa distributed variables interface, but no direct graphical
operations are performed. I am doing this just before starting up the OCaml
image, so there is another possible point of departure.
