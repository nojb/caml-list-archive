Hi:

I wrote a Wiki in OCaml.  It took me two days, and was done solely
because I needed a Wiki for an OCaml project, and it would be nice to
have a Wiki actually written in OCaml.  In other words, complete wheel
reinvention :-)

You can download source (GPL) here:

You can play with the Wiki here:

Enjoy ...

Rich.

the notion that everything has to be sacrificed for speed. In computer
