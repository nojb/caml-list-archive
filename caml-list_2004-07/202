I wish I could ! :-)
But I don't think my skills permits me to implement all the concepts I am 
dreaming about... I aim to design it though !
Even if too ambitious for me. If I said "simple" it was because of this,
and also because if Gimp was compared to Emacs,
I am dreaming of a vim like image manipulation program ;-)

In particular I am dreaming on a 100% asccii image format close to .MSL which 
could be explained in simple words as an equivalent of the .pov format
for 2D graphics works.
Here is an exemple (which really works with php-conjure) :
http://grincheux.codelutin.org/~monnier/php/conjure/incantation.html
But php-conjure is only an interpreter, there is a need for a GUI as you guess

Thanks very much :)

OK,
if I would choose camlImage, would you be ready to implement
all the filters and layer combination modes needed for graphics works ?




Cheers
