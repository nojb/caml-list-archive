   Hello there,

   I was looking for documentation about the OCaml implementation, or
some discussion about the internals, especially the compiler and
runtime. I searched the list archives and got no results (maybe I
didn't do it right). So, there appears to be none.

   I understand there are some licensing issues with derived versions
of the compiler, is that true ? Is this related to the lack of
documentation and the Cathedral-style development of OCaml ? I'm
planning on reading the sources just for educational purposes, but if
there were some documentation that'd be a plus.
