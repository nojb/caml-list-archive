That sounds like theory.  Show me an embedded device actually programmed
in OCaml.  C interfaces are important when speaking to low level
hardware, and OCaml doesn't have a particularly good one.  I'm aware of
some other research work in the ML language family regarding "typed
assembly language," such as the TILT compiler.
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/jgm/tilt.html  OCaml doesn't
strike me as being oriented towards low-level hardware problems though.
