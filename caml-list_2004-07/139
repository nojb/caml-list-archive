We are about to ship our first embedded ocaml application: an automatic 
glass cutting table. The PLC is 2Ghz Celeron with 256MB RAM, Linux 2.4 
and Ocaml 3.07+2. It's just magnificent!

We are working on a logical control framework based on Ocaml. We will 
release under the GPL when the API will have stabilized.
