    Once again, you are not talking about the same thing as I am. In the 
suggested new system, aligned C pointers would look like (0-tagged) Caml 
integers and thus the GC would not even consider collecting them, which 
is good. However, the check whether a (1-tagged) pointer was allocated 
by Caml would remain necessary, because C pointers can have their LSB 
set, even if it is seldom so. Therefore I wonder whether this would be 
useful at all. It was not my intention to say this three times, so I'm 
stopping there so as not to pollute the list.

    Olivier.
