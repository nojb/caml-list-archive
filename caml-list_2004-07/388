gdb should work with C code linked with Ocaml, you should be able to 
set a breakpoint
in a C function, and run the caml code which calls the function. I have 
also had good luck
with valgrind if you're on x86.

Not many. If your OS does not support dynamic linking, and/or you don't 
build
your glue module as a dynamic library then you will need to make a new 
custom
toplevel environment. ocamlmktop -custom .... Other than that, and the 
fact that
C code is not type safe it is completely transparent.
