This is great news!

Indeed, I think that shorter release cycles will greatly improve the
whole development process.

Done.  So far everything seems to work smoothly.

Let me add that I'm always impressed of the quality of the CVS-versions
so users should be encouraged to try it and thus help INRIA with testing.

My machine automatically checks out changes on an almost daily basis and
recompiles all libraries I need.  It happens extremely seldom (maybe
2-3 times a year) that something doesn't work with the CVS-version
that does with the stable version (usually it's the other way round),
and the team at INRIA is very responsive to bug reports.

Thanks for your efforts, and keep up the great work!

Best regards,
Markus
