It would be helpful if, when announcing a software release, people would 
include, towards the beginning of the announcement, a sentence or two 
describing the software being released.  Many announcements on this list 
seem to assume that everyone is familiar with every package in the 
Humps, or that readers will be prepared to download the announced 
software just to find out what it is.  Something like this would be nice:

"Version 3.7 of the Jasmine package has been released today.  Jasmine 
is a library for making tea in Caml."
