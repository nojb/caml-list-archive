I am trying to use the camltk GUI that comes compiled with the binary
distribution
of ocaml (1.06) for Windows; but i am not able to do it.
Tcl-tk for Windows is installed (from win76p2.exe) and I open the program
ocamltktop which is in the ocamltk41 folder. "Tk.openTk" is recognized as a
value of type unit -> Widget.widget, but when I try to apply it to (), the
system crashes ("Abnormal program termination") after saying:

cl_SeekFile: unexpected file type

Could anyone there help me?

Thank you.
