Bonjour - Hello,

L'executable "ocamldebug" (version 1.07) ne marche pas s'il est
"stripé" (? :-) )

I have just found out that "ocamldebug" itself must not be stripped in
order to work (at least under i686 - Linux 2.0.30 and Alpha - Digital
Unix 4.0d). I didn't find this anywhere in the documentation.
Does "ocamldebug" really need its own debug information or is this a bug?
It will probably need it in any case... ;-)

Do the other programs need their debug information? Until now I have
not encountered any problems, but who knows...

                   Amicalement - Best regards,
                            Markus Mottl
