This is because bitrelation and bitset do not have an explicit
interface (.mli file).  So, their interfaces actually depend on 
their source file (.ml file), but "make" has a hard time understanding
this; the dependency on the .cmo above is what I've found to be
most understandable to "make".

My feeling is that it would complicate the Makefiles for a fairly
small benefit.  If you don't like the occasional calls to ocamlc, you
could write .mli files for all your modules (it's good style anyway).

If you can find one, please send it and I'll look at the problem.
