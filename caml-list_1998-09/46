perhaps it would be nice to post the result of this little survey on the ocaml web site, or at least a link on the wbe page to some web page you would make out of it.

alternatively, they could be a little registering thing at the ocaml website, who each one could register stating on which hardware he use ocaml, for what purpose and other such things.
