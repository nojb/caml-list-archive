Hi everyone,

In looking at the code of socket.c for windows, I noticed the following
code:

  /* Set sockets to synchronous mode  */
  optionValue = SO_SYNCHRONOUS_NONALERT;
  setsockopt(INVALID_SOCKET, SOL_SOCKET, SO_OPENTYPE,
             (char *)&optionValue, sizeof(optionValue));

Is there a reason it is there? One negative aspect of this is that when
one tries to set a socket to a non blocking mode and then connect to it,
then NT returns a WSAEINVALID error code, meaning that the operation is
not allowed on that socket.

Thanks,

Roy
