One thing to look at is the work done by the CAR group at HP Labs.  They
have a collabaration with two university research groups, one at UIUC and
another at NYU.  For more information, see:

   http:www.trimaran.org/

The upcoming Merced is a big break from current ILP microarchitectures, and
even from older VLIW designs.  Xavier Leroy is correct in asserting that
compilers have to be almost completely rethought to take advantage of ILP
designs with lots of parallelism.
