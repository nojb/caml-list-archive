A few months ago I made a small program which I call "ocamlman".  It is
a graphical browsing system of the Ocaml manual.  Ocaml man retrieves
from the TEXT version of the ocaml manual all the types, functions,
functors.  Its menu contains a contents index and module indices.  The
look and
feel is like the on-line manual of Gambit originally developed on the
Macintosh platform.  I can contribute the code to this list if people
are interested.  A small hurdle is that you need OlablTk 1.07 to make it
work.
