Excellent!  I am also an OCaml promoter at my workplace (contractor for
the U.S. Government in Washington, D.C.).

Great idea!!  I'd love to see such a product...however, wouldn't this
take lots of research into building a CGI / HTML front-end (or something
similiar) then implementing the OCaml back-end?  Could this turn into an
open-source project?  I'd say "yes" for both questions.  Any other
thoughts?

I've never heard of anything like this being out there -- but, then
again, I'm fairly new to the OCaml world.
