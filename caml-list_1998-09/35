Hello,

I have a small cosmetic wish regarding ocaml (actually its
makefile). I would like that the standard distribution build a fat
interactive interpreter (ie the ocaml executable) containing all (or
as much as possible) of the otherlibs contained in the distributions.

In other words, some people complain that the ocaml command does not
accept Unix.stat for instance. Yes, I know do know that every ocaml
user does not run Unix.

And I do know the answer: adding something like 

ocamlfat: ocaml 
	ocamlmktop -o ocamlfat unix.cma nums.cma str.cma graphics.cma \
-cclib -lunix -cclib -lnums -cclib -lstr -cclib -lgraphics -cclib \
-L/usr/X11/lib -cclib -X11 -custom


in the Makefile

This is just a suggestion. Perhaps adding the threads library would be 
also good, but it might have its annoyance too!
