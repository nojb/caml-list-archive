Think instead of a programmatically controlled toplevel.  I've had
thoughts of a ML environment which is something like the LispM and
Smalltalk environments.  I think a toplevel which has hooks for
connecting command input and output to arbitrary routines rather
than simply a chunk of CURSES code would be quite tasty.  An expect
program or telnet has to differentiate between input and output
on the basis of string context, and that's easy to confuse.  I use
XEmacs/ILisp with CMUCL a fair bit, and sometimes despite being a
great shell, it gets lost.

Thoughts?
