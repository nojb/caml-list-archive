  There is a patch, called mli2html, which generates .HTML files from
.ml and .mli files. The HTML file produced contains the same
information as generated with the -i option, plus some comments which
can be added by the syntax (*[name] comments for name *). HTML links
are also produced between each usage of a type and its definition..

  This patch is quite simple, and should be improved a lot to be
really useful. It is available for Ocaml-2.00 at:
