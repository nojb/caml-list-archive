Good question. For GODI it means that the automatic library search is
broken. You can set the library path in most cases manually, though. (So
far I overlook it, this is only a problem for the libs
in /usr/lib/<arch>/<pkg> but not for the ones in /usr/lib/<arch> because
the latter can be linked without -L switches.)

The question is how to generically work around this. GODI could provide
a variable $USR_LIB_ARCH for the architecture-specific path prefix
corresponding to /usr/lib/<arch>, which is set if "dpkg-architecture
-qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH" returns something. All the conf packages would
need to be updated. In the future we will have many errors because not
all package developers will test on multiarch-enabled systems.

Don't know what else needs to be done.
