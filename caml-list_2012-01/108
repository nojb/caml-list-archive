Hi Hezekiah

I gave it a shot after a new install of debian wheezy, and it went really
smoothly. The install was not exactly fresh, as I had installed ocaml
packages first (old reflex), but anyway I found two deps that blocked the
installation : one on libev-dev (for lwt/utop I suppose) and libpcre3-dev
(for oasis?). As it's only two, maybe it'd be worth to add them on the
README.md.

ocamlbrew, combined with odb for installing libraries is obviously a nice
combo (at least for unix users) and seems less complex than GODI. However I
believe both tools adopt rather different strategies regarding maintenance.
GODI is good at updating packages to new versions, but up till now I am not
sure ocamlbrew/odb can do the same. It seems that with the latter, you'd
preferably start a new install from scratch rather than trying to find
what's to be updated and effectively update it. Did I miss something?

Anyway, thanks for this work, which was useful to me.
Philippe.
