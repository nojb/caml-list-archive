Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Custom let bindings

Hi folks,

I've put a raw, not pretty dump of the discussion at 
<http://pauillac.inria.fr/~protzenk/let-bang.html>. We didn't reach any 
consensus there, and we've covered the subject extensively. I'm just 
publishing it if anyone's interested.

Please refrain from adding any extra messages to this thread, unless 
you have arguments that make one proposal *clearly, objectively better 
than the others*. There's been enough back-and-forth already, so any 
arguments such as "/me likes" or "just pick any one of them" will be 
happily dismissed.

Thanks,

jonathan
