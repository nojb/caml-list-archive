My advice would be to rely on pkg-config (a kind of ocamlfind for C
libraries), or similar scripts (pcre-config, etc.) provided by the
libraries. Otherwise, there is no good, portable (I mean, not
Debian-specific) way to guess where a library is, and the packager will
give an explicit path in his call to the configure script in
debian/rules. By the way, this is what we did for ocaml [1].
