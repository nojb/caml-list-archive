Hi,

First of all, I really like this project :)

Then, a few comments:

I believe 63-character lines are a little bit short. I'd prefer 80 (or
at least 73).
Or at least it should be resizable...

Buffer "select-all" is not available... I don't know if it is easy to
add, but if it's not, maybe it's easy to add an export feature (for
all the buffer contents to appear in a new window which can then be
saved in a txt file).

Cheers,
