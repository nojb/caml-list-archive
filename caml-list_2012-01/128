I'm glad ocamlbrew worked well for you.  libev is for Lwt.  PCRE is
for the OCaml PCRE bindings, which are required by oasis.

Thank you for the README suggestion - done and pushed.

This is mostly correct.  ocamlbrew in its current state does not have
any support for in-place OCaml upgrades, and there is a chance that it
never will.  My intent with the tool is to make it easy to build
multiple, parallel versions of OCaml and switch between them.  GODI
can offer the same thing, but as you said with some extra complexity.

GODI does a good job of supporting broad updates, such as moving from
OCaml version X to OCaml version X + 1, bringing all installed
packages with it.  While ocamlbrew does not support updates in that
broad a fashion, odb does have some support for upgrading packages to
newer versions.

I'm glad you found ocamlbrew useful.
