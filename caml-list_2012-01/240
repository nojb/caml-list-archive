Hello,

Sometimes I had problems with syntax highlighting in OCaml.
The end of comments was not always displayed correctly colored.
This was the case, when long and nested comments were used.
Then the non-comment section sometimes was displayed as
if it were a comment.

Someone also knows that problem?

Maybe that is another issue that you might be able and interested
to fix...?!


Ciao,
   Oliver
