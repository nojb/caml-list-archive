In GODI there is a library searcher for libs that do not support
pkg-config et al. It just tries a list of typical paths used by various
OS. The method works well if the library is not dependent on other
libraries, and is quite portable. Of course, you cannot be sure to find
the right library if several versions are installed (which is quite
common on non-open-source OS where the developer has to do it on its
own), but otherwise it is good enough for setting a default if the user
does not have special wishes.

So, e.g. for X11, there is no pkg-config, and GODI falls back to
searching. Btw, we don't rely here on what the Ocaml configure script
finds out, but have our own searcher, simply because this makes it
easier to respect users' wishes.
