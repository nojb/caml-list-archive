Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Proposal for extensible open datatypes

I would be interested to hear what propeties of Ocaml you had to give
up to get this interesting extension working? For example, what
happens with checking for exhaustivness of match? Caml performs
various optimizations in pattern matching, why are those still ok now
that new alternatives may appear later?

With kind regards,

Andrej
