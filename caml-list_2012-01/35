I would say that Jane Street is in a unique position to make a
difference here.  Having by far the largest OCaml team in the world,
nobody else is as likely to benefit from and to achieve the goal of
improving the library packaging situation.  Just being able to attract
more people to OCaml and hence potential employees would seem well
worth the cost of specifically dedicating resources and pushing this
project through.  It is not very likely that individuals or small
companies will be able or willing to support this project in the long
term, and the OCaml team/INRIA understandably has other priorities (=
research).

Regards,
Markus
