Subject: [Caml-list] Core (and associated libraries) on bitbucket!


--f46d04462f8872ba8e04b5e47dd8
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

For those who are interested in getting a look at a development version of
the next release of the Core suite of OCaml libraries, Core is now hosted
on bitbucket.

   http://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core/wiki/Home

We're still working on making installation smoother and easier, as well as
solving portability problems.  But please take a look.  There's also a
discussion list:

   http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ocaml-core

This represents a new and more open development model for us, and we hope
that as a result we'll be able to better interact with and accept patches
from the community, and that Core will become a base that many people can
use for building OCaml applications.
