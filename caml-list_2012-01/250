Yes, but this happens before the query is executed. Once the execution
starts, the plan is not changed anymore.

Well, this is the NoSQL world (=not-only SQL). In short:

 - You accept that you store data in non-normal form. In SQL
   the preferred model is to store one information only once,
   and to do all joins at query time. In NoSQL it is usual to
   repeat information to avoid joins, even if this means that
   updates become more complicated.
 - On the technology side, you use alternate data stores like
   distributed key/value stores or column-based stores. At
   least at query time.
 - For preparing data, one of the new technologies is map/reduce.
   Basically it's a massively scalable form of sorting data.

Of course, this is all not as universal as the good old SQL world.
Especially it is a non-match for OLTP. But if you can separate data
preparation from data querying, it's an option that opens the door to
almost infinite scalability. It's what the web-2.0 companies use.

I did not say that I dislike SQL. It's still the most important DB
technology, and often it is the only choice we have. And you are right, it
is about set operations. Nevertheless, the syntax has strange aspects
(e.g. no reserved words, or that you cannot nest SELECTs arbitrarily, e.g.
(SELECT ... UNION SELECT ...) INTERSECT SELECT ...). The best thing is
that it is standardized.

The F# syntax is interesting (I frequently thought about integrating SQL
as DSL into Ocaml best, and did not find any good solution).

Yeah, an attempt to raise the bar.
