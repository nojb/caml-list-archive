I wrote a memoire about "why language succeed", and my conclusion was
people prefers simple concept at first, even if complex problem become
intricately  more complex with simpler langage than more powerful like
ML/Haskell/Smalltalk/whatever.
People are lazy, they don't want to think, they want to write lines of code.
Plus, IMHO, imperative permit people to construct algorithms step by step,
rather FP which oblige to have a precise idea of your algorithm.
IT Industry wants programmers as factory worker (especially in France),
they don't want educated people with mathematical background (95% of my
former business associate don't know what "Turing complete" is).
IT industry is not interested by productivity improvment at all, it would
reduce their margin... Jacquard-loom syndrome..
So unhappily, ML/Haskell/Smalltalk/Prolog/Whatever will remain an elite
language.

You can turn around about many topics (syntax, education, etc...), theses
languages will gain what ? 1 or 3% ?
