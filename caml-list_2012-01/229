What ??? I thought SQL servers shipped on-the-fly optimizing compilers
that would evaluate the query and use some heuristics (like table size
and density) to decide in which order to execute the loops + learning
on sequences of queries + on-the-fly reindexing.

Mmm... I thought relational databases were a universal object, in the
mathematical sense meaning any other object maps into them. What do
they use if not relational databases ?

You don't seem to like SQL much, which is surprising as it is kind of
isomorphic to comprehension of sets (of tuples). That's why F# added
first class SQL support with comprehension-like syntax
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh225374(v=vs.110).aspx

The idea being probably that on top of a certified whole-program
optimizing compiler, pattern matching optimizer, multi-core capable
garbage collector and generalized lexing/parsing library, functional
language implementers will also have to write an optimizing SQL /
comprehension engine.
