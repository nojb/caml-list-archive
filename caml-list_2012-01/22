The problem here is that it would cause:

- ambiguity with structure equivalence operator
- ambiguity in the parser, e.g. the toplevel let bindings are separated
  by "let", the local lets by pair "let" and "in"
- replacement of == would not be good as it is reserved for physical
  equality
- ignoring "rec" - no good too - please see the other thread, it
  contradicts how the aliasing of values is now used e.g. for extending 
  modules via. include
