Simply ensuring the mallocs are aligned to pages (ie using
posix_memalign) should be sufficient to allow madvise to be used.  As
you say it may be better to use mmap for other reasons.

Yes.

Check this file: /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
If it says:

[always] advise never

then any contiguous anonymous (ie. malloc) virtual memory mapping
which is 2MB or larger and aligned to 2MB is a candidate for being
turned into THPs.  It's thus very easy to use and most processes get
it for free.

Certain kernel operations cause huge pages to be split.  Things like
creating a futex in a page.  So you have to be a bit careful.  This
talk by my colleague explains THP (in the context of KVM, but applies
to any process):
