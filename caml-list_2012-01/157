The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial 
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of
the most renowned researchers in automated reasoning, computational logic, 
programming languages and their applications come to present cutting-edge 
results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to exchange ideas in a  
scientifically emerging part of the world. The 18th edition will be held in 
Merida, Venezuela.
