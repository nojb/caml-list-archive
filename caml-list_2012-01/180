We use monads quite a bit, and the lack of a monadic syntax has been a
long-running issue for us at Jane Street.  I'd love to see some kind of
monadic syntax land.  I've seen the proposal, and it seems highly
plausible.  Also, having a special operator (let!) has been proposed as
part of this I believe, and that seems like a good idea too.

Hi,<br>
<br>
I noticed that Alain Frisch tried to add custom let bindings (see r11894<br>
and r11906) but it was reverted later on (see r11960) because no<br>
consensus was reached (among OCaml Core team, I guess). AFAIR, I don&#39;t<=

remember seeing this on the caml-list. I&#39;d personally vote for its<br>
inclusion as I can see some uses for it. As any syntaxic sugar, it is<br>
something we can live without but it could make things easier to read or<br>
to express.<br>
<br>
FTR, the proposal is to add the following:<br>
<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0=93let.e0 p =3D e1 in e2=94 will be expanded to =93e0 e1 (f=
un p -&gt; e2)=94.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m not sure which part of the proposal was not agreed on (the syntaxic=
 details &quot;let.e0&quot; or the whole proposal). Any input from the core=
 team would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
What do others think about it?<br>
