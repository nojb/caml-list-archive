Subject: [Caml-list] Compiling the ocaml distribution under multiarched Debian/Ubuntu


--20cf307f3a0a4ca3e704b6679b3e
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear camlers,

Debian and Ubuntu have not so recently switched to multiarch binaries
(including libs, see http://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Implementation). This
is an important change for ocaml C bindings since the libraries are now to
be found in /usr/lib/<arch description> instead of /usr/lib. I was just
bitten by this, when realizing that the ocaml configure script couldn't
find libX11.so and wouldn't install graphics. A similar problem was handled
by the people in charge of debian ocaml packages (
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=619344). Now my question
is the following: will this evolution be a problem for GODI/odb packages
(and more generally source distribution), and what is the advised fix for
it?

Cheers,
  Philippe.
