I can confirm this.

Probably a related problem is that if you go to an end of some
long-enough function (you can try 300-lines-long function); if you leave
vim; reenter vim (or switch to another buffer and switch back), you will
be viewing again end of the long function but syntax-highlighting will
be "out of sync". As if syntax-highlighter did not go backward enough to
be able to interprete meaning of the tokens that you are viewing.
