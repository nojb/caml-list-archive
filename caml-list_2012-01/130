yes, reStructuredText is pythonic it seems, but has math LaTeX markup in
it's feature list. The whole implementaion I use for generating my html
pages is sphinx, the doco geneator of python, it has MathJax, rendering
math in javascript. I love the idea of finally get rid of .png for
equations. So I kind of dismissed markdown in my mind.
