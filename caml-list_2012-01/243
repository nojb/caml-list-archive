ctrl-l is the way to refresh the display usually. Also settings like
synmaxcol affect length of highlighting. Its limited for speed reasons.

The best way to contribute changes is
a) try to contact the maintainer
b) if he doesn't reply - send patches to vim mailinglist

else) upload your changes to www.vim.org as script. ~/.vim/* files
are read before $VIMRUNTIME files.

Using a plugin manager such as vim-addon-manager, vundle, pathogen it
should be easy to keep up to date with additional repositories.
