Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Re: References and polymorphism

I would just like to remind the participants of this discussion that
the value restriction historically originated as a _simplifaction_ of
fancier and more capable forms of parametric polymorphism. The older,
more capable kinds of ML polymorphism grew increasingly more complex,
until Andrew Wright actually looked at what sort of programs people
wrote and noticed that for the most part the fancy stuff was not
needed. Thus it was decided that the ML polymorphism be _simplified_.
This was a good decision, as it made types easier to understand and
easier to implement, at a miniscule cost.

That is, we know that value restriction can be "improved", but by
trying to do so you are just repeating the mistakes that were alerady
made in the 90's.

With kind regards,

Andrej
