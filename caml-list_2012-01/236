One extra comment occurred to me:

We're doing development under Xcode 4.0.2 right now, but the
generated binaries work fine under iOS 5.0.  So any new
difficulties in Xcode 4.2 are almost certainly caused by changes
in Xcode's cross compilation toolchain.  Historically there have
been a few of these in each new release of Xcode.
