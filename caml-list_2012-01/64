Subject: [Caml-list] [Announce] Camomile 0.8.4

Dear list,

I am pleased to announce the new release of Camomile, a Unicode
library for OCaml.  This release is a bug fix release.  The changes
from the previous version are
1) search_forward function of URe returns None, instead of raising
Not_found, if it does not find a match.  This is the documented
behavior.
2) Parsing of regular expressions are changed, so that say </?a>
mathces <a>.  (Previously, it matches either a> or </a>)
3) The bugs of USet.compare, UMap.domain and UMap.map_to_set are
fixed.  (incorporated from Batteries.)

Another big change is that, now we move the project to Github.  You
can download the new version from
https://github.com/downloads/yoriyuki/Camomile/camomile-0.8.4.tar.bz2

You can find the general information at the Wiki
https://github.com/yoriyuki/Camomile/wiki

Enjoy!
