Thats not offending, the result is fine for me. :-)

I preferred the pattern-match version, because I like
things to be displayed in tables. ;-)

My version (option type and folding on lists) you did not implemented, but
maybe it would have been my work to do that.
But I liked the pattern macthing way.

That it also is the fastest way, is a fine result. :-)

I hope you used more than one call of the function and
used average / stddev on your values to get reliable results...

I don't know your Bench-module.
Where is it from?

Ciao,
