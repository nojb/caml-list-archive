We encourage all researchers presenting papers of the highest research
quality at CiE 2012 to submit their full papers to the CiE journal
COMPUTABILITY where they will be handled as regular submissions.

CiE 2012 will have a special relationship to the scientific legacy of 
Alan Turing, reflected in the broad theme: How the World Computes, with 
all its different layers of meaning. Contributions which are directly 
related to the visionary and seminal work of Turing will be 
particularly welcome.

CiE 2012 is one of a series of special events, running throughout the Alan
Turing Year, celebrating Turing's unique impact on mathematics, computing,
computer science, informatics, morphogenesis, artificial intelligence,
philosophy and computational aspects of physics, biology, linguistics,
connectionist models, economics and the wider scientific world.
