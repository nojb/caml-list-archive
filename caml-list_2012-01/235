Yes, I will make it work with the latest Xcode and iOS.  Right now we're
in the last few weeks of releasing a new app, and I haven't wanted to disturb
our development process.

The native code generator of OCaml is based on the native assembler, so
generally you just have to make the assembler and the linker happy by
adapting the command lines from an ObjC project.

If you try any experiments, let me know what you find out.  Otherwise
I'll look into it as soon as I can.

Thanks for your interest and best regards,

Jeffrey
