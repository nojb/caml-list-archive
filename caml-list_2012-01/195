Subject: [Caml-list] pattern matching on integer intervals


--20cf307f309255a55704b70dc364
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi,

I am trying to do pattern matching on unicode characters, represented by
integers. I would like to do something like that

 let f c =
 match c with
   0xff .. 0xfff -> foo

I know we can pattern match over char intervals but It doesn't be to be the
case for char intervals. Some I have two questions:
 Is there a better way of doing what I am doing and why is it possible to
pattern match over char intervals and not int intervals?
