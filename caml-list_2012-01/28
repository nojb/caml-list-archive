Am I the only one to be very, very, very, tired of this question ?

There's an obvious thing missing in the list of what has been tried.
Well-done and maintained libraries you can use for about any
programming task you have at hand -- but I highly doubt this will make
"ML mainstream" either, I'm just defending my own interest.

IIRC you used to be a library designer, please stop fiddle with the
syntax of the language. Library design is also language design. Pick a
missing OCaml library you'd have interest in implementing (e.g. a good
interface to imap protocol but you may not be interested in that) and
fill in the void with a great, modular and tasteful implementation.

Best,

Daniel

P.S. If you think syntax is the main answer to the question above
maybe you should have a chat with users of "mainstream" programming
languages. In my experience, you'll soon see that their tastes and
philosophical view points on programming are rather different than
yours (which may be due to ignorance, lack of education and marketing
influence but that's rather presumptuous for me to say).
