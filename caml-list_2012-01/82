Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] OCamlSpotter 1.4.0 for OCaml 3.12.1

An OCaml source browsing tool, OCamlSpotter 1.4.0 is out.

With OCamlSpotter, you can easily jump to identifier uses to the
corresponding definitions, resolving module inclusion and functor
applications. For further info, please check
http://jun.furuse.info/hacks/ocamlspotter .

1.4.0 supports:
- Spotting the definitions of idents (Finding definition of idents)
- Spotting the uses of idents (Opposite of def spotting)
- Showing data types of expressions/patterns with their id numbers,
and the query of their definitions.
- Type driven expansion of expressions and patterns

It requires compiler modification. The modified compiler source and
OCamlSpotter is found at:

  https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/mutated_ocaml/get/v3.12.1-ocamlspot-1.4.0.tar.gz

The diff against the original 3.12.1 can be easily obtained from the
bitbucket repo by

hg diff -r ocaml-3.12.1-11110 -r v3.12.1-ocamlspot-1.4.0 .

Happy hacking.
