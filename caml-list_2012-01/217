The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) in the Foundations of Computing
Science provides an intensive course of lectures on the Mathematical
Foundations of Computing. It has run annually since 1999, and is
hosted by the Universites of Birmingham, Leicester, and Nottingham in
rotation. The lectures are aimed at PhD students, typically in their
first or second year of study. However, the school is open to anyone
who is interested in learning more about the mathematical foundations
of computing, and all such participants are warmly welcomed. We also
very much welcome students from abroad. 

The following courses will be offered:

Advanced Courses:

    * Constructive Mathematics and Type Theory
      Thierry Coquand (University of Gothenburg)
    * Categories and Functors
      Uday Reddy (University of Birmingham)
    * Computing with Infinite Objects
      Martin Escardo (University of Birmingham)
    * Logical Relations
      Andrzej Murawski (University of Leicester)
    * Provability, fixed points and clock ticks
      Tadeusz Litak (University of Leicester)
    * Kleene Algebras
      Georg Struth (University of Sheffield)
