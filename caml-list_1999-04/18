I am the one who added "fast colour look up code" in graph library.
Instead of the older version which communicates between X server 
for each colour query (and it is very inefficient), I intended to
compute its "colour index" in the client side. But this colour index
computation method is highly architecture dependent of X servers 
(bit order, colour model, bit depth, etc), and not well documented. 
We checked this modification work correctly for XFree86 servers with
16 bits depth and some DEC Alpha servers, but the code does not
support the all possibilities of architectures, I am afraid.

To do quick repair, use the patch following. This just disables
the new modification. Each color query creates communication between X
server and it REALLY slows the full color graphics programs, but at
least, it works correctly.
