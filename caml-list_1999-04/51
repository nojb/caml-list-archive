I was expecting this scenario to come up at some point in the
discussion.  In the (presently unlikely) event that INRIA would pull
the plug out of the Caml project, we would of course do everything
possible so that the sources are released under a very liberal licence
so that others can continue the development if they wish.

You're right that this kind of code release hasn't been done often in
the past, especially by corporations, but it is becoming much more
commonplace now (see e.g. the MLJ project at Persimmon, or the
cancelled Java JIT project at Netscape).  It is also very much in the
spirit of public research.

Agreed.  Some participants in this discussion have made interesting
contributions in this direction, and I thank them.

I'm not sure I follow you here.  Are you suggesting some form of code
split?  How would this solve the issue?

Best regards,
