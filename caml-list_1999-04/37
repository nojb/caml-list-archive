I've heard this question asked too by other "open source" advocates, and 
I'd also be interested in the answer. As Markus notes, it would be a 
real pity if confusion over the licensing issue precludes greater use of
this outstanding tool.

On a related note, the article http://caml.inria.fr/ercim.html discusses 
the creation of a "Caml Consortium". Is this still happening?
