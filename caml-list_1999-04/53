That's enough to satisfy me, though to be fair I was not bothered by the 
current license.

Yes. This would solve the issue (and create many nastier new ones) by
letting those who have problems with the INRIA licensing use the
GPL/BSD/whatever version. Also, it would shoot down the criticism of OCaml 
that it is a language defined by its current implementation. That said, I 
think its a bad idea, as it takes too much time from the OCaml team and 
community to have multiple variants at this stage of the language
development. Once the language design is "done", it may not be such a bad
idea, but from what I gather OCaml is still a research project and not a 
frozen standard.

PS: I suggest that when the design is done, the new language be named
    ML-2000, for the obvious humor value ;-)
