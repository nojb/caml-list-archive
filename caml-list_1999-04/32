Hello,

it would be great if "ocamlyacc" reported more errors on badly specified
grammars. Some difficult to spot mistakes could then be resolved more
easily.

E.g.:

  main : SOME_TOKEN foo {}
  foo : main {}

It is impossible to derive any sentence from this grammar - still, there
is no error/warning. But also parts of a grammar can be underivable. This
can be very difficult to see in large grammars.

I have tried this example with "bison" and it can report such errors. This
is not the case with "yacc", but since ocamlyacc is based on "yacc"-code,
this is understandable...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
