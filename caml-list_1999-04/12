I was excited to hear that the 2.02 graphics library
had better support for 24 bit displays, but I can't
get it to work properly.  Ideally, I'd like something like

set_color (rgb x y z)

to just work right, no matter how many times I call it. 
The support in 2.02 looks like it only works for images
(?), and even that doesn't seem to work properly on my
machine; ocaml seems to think I have an eight bit
display.  I've looked at the graphics code a bit, but
I'm no X genius.
