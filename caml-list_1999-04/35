Hello,

at the moment there is a thread on "comp.lang.functional" discussing
legal aspects of the OCAML-distribution policy.

Some people believe it is too restrictive and they thus rule it out for
their purposes. But I think this is mainly due to misunderstandings of
the licence and/or that the licence is not always explicit enough.

Could someone of the OCAML-team who is in charge of this please clarify
some points in the thread? It would be a real pity if people ran away /
didn't look at OCAML due to some unclear licencing issues.

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
