I find the most useful definition is not "free software", but "Open Source
software".  This has a broader definition than just GNU.  If you look at
http://www.opensource.org/osd.html, you'll see both the accepted definition
of "Open Source", and links to several example licenses.  This is the
definition used by Linux distributors, which gives some practical incentive
to adopt an Open Source licence.

It is, of course, up to you whether you want to make O'Caml "Open Source",
in this sense.

(My apologies if you already know this).
