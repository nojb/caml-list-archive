Subject: splay trees 0.4 released
X-Mailer: VM 6.37 under Emacs 20.2.1
Sender: weis

It is may pleasure to announce a new release (0.4) of splay trees in
http://www.multimania.com/moninjf/Ocaml/

You can you use it as a mutable association table like hashtbl with a
richer interface, related to the order of keys (especially sub, filter,
map, from, floor, ceil, prev, next). The price to pay is less good
performances than hashtbl (1.5 to 1.9 times slower on my bench marks).

BTW the use of splay trees in otags is now simpler and Otags has been
updated (release 0.8).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES:

The interface of splay now follows the same conventions (order of
arguments) as for other mutable data structures like arrays and hash
tables. 

Introduction of splaytbl with the same functional behavior as hashtbl
several items can be associated to a single key); splayInterv.ml no
longer useful

fold replaced by fold_right
elements replaced by to_list
Added fold_left, to_stream, filter, map, copy,
      sub, from, floor, ceil, prev, next.
