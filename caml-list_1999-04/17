This is almost certainly a bug in the distribution you have: the
"threads"-version of the standard library has been linked without the new
"buffer"-module.

I have already sent in a bug report for this and Xavier Leroy was so
kind to place an updated version on the distributions site.  Just load
down the new distribution (at least the RPM should be ok)...

Best regards,
