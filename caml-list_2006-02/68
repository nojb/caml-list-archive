Thank you very much. I would like to make sure that the "distribution"--one or 
more ocaml tarballs, a bunch of tarballs by various authors, plus some patches 
and scripts from myself--is not considered a "derived work" under the terms of 
the QPL. I would not like this to be the case, as the QPL authorizes the 
original authors to use the "derived works" in non free ways: this is the 
non-freeness in the QPL.

All this sounds very much nonsensical to us programmers, but it might make a 
considerable difference to managers and lawyers.
