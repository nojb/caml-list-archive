Hi,

When I fire up Tuareg mode under native Windows emacs and run an
inferior-caml, I get what I expect (Caml running in an emacs buffer).  When
I do so with Cygwin's Emacs, I get an empty buffer and a process "
ocamlrun.exe" dressed in new window trim, which seems completely detached
from the inferior-caml buffer (meaning C-c C-e does NOT send commands to
this new process).

I asked Albert Cohen, Tuareg-mode's creator, but he didn't know much about
Windows, and suggested I ask here.

What magic Elisp incantation will shackle invocations of "ocaml" in a
buffer, when using Cygwin emacs?  I also tried "sh -c ocaml" to no avail...

Jeremy
