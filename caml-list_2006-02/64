Sven's reply is perfectly correct: by distributing the Caml source
code unmodified, plus modifications as separate patches, you are 100%
in compliance with the letter (and the spirit) of the QPL.

(Moreover, the QPL + LGPL + exceptions combo we use for OCaml is free
software -- even the Debian legal team agrees with that :-)

So, please go ahead with your distributions plans, this is exactly how
we intend the Caml source to be used.
