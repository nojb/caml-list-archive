Yes.

As you called one of your internal states "y", not "x"
I would expect the behaviour that your implementation
shows.

But I changes then in class b the "y" to "x" and it showed
the same behaviour.

Well, this is what I didn't expected...

and the error messages, on which I now looked in more detail,
well, are strange... (also in your case...)

?!

Ciao,
