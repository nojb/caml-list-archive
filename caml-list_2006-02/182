The usual thing to do would be to publish whatever code, examples, and
documentation you have created on a Web site, and then post a quick
summary and a link to those materials here.

Note that this site and link should be [semi-] permanent, since unless
you can persuade one of the [informal] OCaml community sites to
provide a home for your materials, *you* will be hosting them. :)
