I do use the native O'Caml and Cygwin Emacs.  I do this because MinGW Caml
seems to be using "ar" instructions that are meant for the Cygwin version o=
f
"ar" (meaning they have an ampersand preceding the DOS path of the temporar=
y
file, which MinGW's "ar" doesn't understand).

It looks to me as if MinGW Caml is actually built with Cygwin, using "gcc
-mno-cygwin".  Maybe I'm mistaken?  So, I use MinGW Caml with Cygwin.

Apparently, there is an issue in the ptys.  I would say that's an apt
description.  I'll have to try the "ocamlmktop -custom".

I really don't want to use a Cygwin version of Caml.  I don't like it when
projects (Cygwin, Berkeley DB) tell me that I have to license my source cod=
e
a certain way when I link to their libraries.  I aknowledge and respect
their wishes, but I'm also free not to use those projects (and therefore,
not to contribute my bugfixes and experience to their product).  I'm happy
to use the shell and the tools, but I want my binaries to be unmistakenly
mine.
