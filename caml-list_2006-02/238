I'm glad to hear that others are facing this problem as well. Those of 
you who are: how are you dealing with it? Are you simply requiring your 
users to use a particular version of the compiler? Or switching on 
Sys.ocaml_version?

For the record, I don't think this is true. My copy of map.mli, as part 
of OCaml 3.08.3, says:

     val fold: (key -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b -> 'b
     (** [fold f m a] computes [(f kN dN ... (f k1 d1 a)...)],
        where [k1 ... kN] are the keys of all bindings in [m]
        (in increasing order), and [d1 ... dN] are the associated data. *)

specifying the same ordering as the current version. Also the original 
bug ticket <http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=3607> about the 
issue asserts that it should behave according to the documentation.

Since the behavior was NOT unspecified, it was reasonable to assume 
that the documentation suffered from a simple typo, and to expect the 
behavior not to change. I believe the documentation should have been 
fixed rather than the behavior.
