Hello!

I also had to to this task. So I wrote my own library, like py2caml (named
py2caml) - just
to write python extentions on ocaml (without C code).
Unlike pycaml, it can handle multi-threaded apps, safe for user errors in
python or caml code etc.

If you interested I can upload the library to sourceforge, and/or answer
your questions.
