FWIW I have solved this problem with a small syntactic change.  You
now use $varname when you don't want NULLs and $?varname when you
do.[1] A modified example program is attached.

You can also download the full program from here:

[1] It is still possible to insert a NULL into a NOT NULL field, as
was the case before, but I can't see any way to solve that without
rewriting Postgres.
