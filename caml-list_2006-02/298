I'm pretty sure that a lot more useful code has been written in 
brainf*ck than in CDuce, so you're probably right.

Have the hours you spent been long enough to look at the resources to 
learn the language (manual, tutorial, demos, other people's code)? They 
might not be perfect, but they certainly were ok for some people. Also,
I would have recommended to subscribe to the CDuce mailing list, since 
questions asked there usually get a quick answer. Anyway, it would be 
helpful if you could post some feedback, be it negative, as long as it 
contains concrete information.


Cheers,

  Alain
