Hi folks,

I have an ocaml program which builds OK as byte-code, but building it as
native code gives me an error that two of my libs disagree over a
standard ocaml library:

    Files /home/s0567141/lib/ocamlnet/netstring.cmxa
    and /usr/lib/ocaml/stdlib.cmxa
    make inconsistent assumptions over implementation Filename

The usual protocol of rebuilding the libraries from scratch didn't help.
I thought it might be that ocamlnet had been built  I don't seem to have
some other thing called Filename hanging about. How can I diagnose this?
Is there a tool that lets me inspect these .cmxa files to see what
assumptions they do make? Any ideas how I might have built the netstring
library with strange assumptions on Filename?

Thanks in advance,
Ezra
