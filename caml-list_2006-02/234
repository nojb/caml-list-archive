I must agree  with you since we also  got a similar bug in  one of our
apps due to this Map.fold _implementation_ change.

However, we must also admit  that we were using an unspecified feature
of the  standard library. If  I remember correctly,  the documentation
was saying that  the traversal order was left  _unspecified_.  The new
version   of  Map.fold   simply  has   a  stronger,   but  consistent,
specification.  From this point of view, the Ocaml team thus cannot be
blamed.

You (and I) were using  the _implementation_ as a specification, which
is bad :-)
