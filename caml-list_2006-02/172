Hmm, indeed.  Though don't forget, Matthieu, that Cygwin is still at
version 3.08.1...

Jeremy, if recompiling works for you, please let me know, and I'll release
a rebuit version of ocaml for Cygwin.  You can download the ocaml source
package using Cygwin setup and run the packaging script to build (use the
"--help" option for a list of possible steps).
