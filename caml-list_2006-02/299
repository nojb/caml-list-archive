yes, I read the tutorial and parts of the manual and tried the examples. I 
only tried it the whole day since I found the features very impressive.

I'm sure cduce works, it's just I could not get my task done in the time I

construction of the patterns. As the xml processing was only a minimal part I 
wrote the parser myself.
