    Bonjour,

I remember having laugh very loud when some one told me that Knuth was
looking for volunteers to port his CISC assembly examples of "The Art of
computer programming" to a more modern language. And when I went to his
homepage to see what modern language he had chosen I discovered it was
... RISC assembly.
