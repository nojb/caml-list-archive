Ok, so that confirms it.

Huh?  Neither does Cygwin's ar, AFAIK.  Something may be screwed up with
the MinGW build.

"gcc -mno-cygwin" is a MinGW cross-compiler.  It does not produce Cygwin
binaries, it does not use Cygwin headers.  It's the same as the MinGW
compiler, except for the little detail of understanding Cygwin paths to
source and library files.  There is no difference between the binaries
produced by Cygwin's "gcc -mno-cygwin" and MinGW's gcc.

That aside, I'm confused.  Didn't you just say that you use a native
O'Caml build because the MinGW one is broken?

Can you first try to run your version of ocaml in Cygwin's rxvt and let me
know if you observe the same problematic behavior?

AFAIK, Cygwin does not impose any restrictions on the O'Caml bytecode
beyond what the O'Caml license has (unless you use native code, in which
case you do link with Cygwin).  Otherwise, Cygwin simply provides the
toolset, and the O'Caml code is yours.  And even in that case, you simply
cannot distribute the *Cygwin* versions of your binaries without
open-sourcing them (since they'd need the Cygwin DLLs to work).  And even
that can be worked around, AFAIK, by using the Red Hat buyout license.

If there's sufficient interest in helping me add a "-mno-cygwin"-like
option to Cygwin's ocaml (so that it produces MinGW binaries using "gcc
-mno-cygwin"), that would be another alternative for you.

Indeed.

Well, I'm sorry to say that it is unlikely that Cygwin emacs will ever
work seamlessly with native Windows binaries (e.g., those that spawn a
console unless they detect one -- like ocaml -- since the whole point of
inferior mode in emacs, as I understand it, is to work without a console).
By mixing and matching various tools not designed to work together, you
are bound to run into incompatibilities -- this is one of them.

Since this isn't a problem with the Cygwin version of O'Caml (and, FWIW,
you're likely to have the same problem with most Windows console
applications), I'd suggest either requesting this as a Cygwin emacs
feature (on the main Cygwin list) or using a non-Cygwin version of emacs.
At the very least, you'll find a lot more expertise on the main Cygwin
list on how to make Cygwin emacs work with Windows native programs than
you'll find here.

If you plan to post there, what I said earlier about the problem reporting
guidelines still applies.
