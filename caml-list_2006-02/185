I wasn't disputing that MinGW's ocamlopt produces these instructions, I
was saying they are not meant for Cygwin's ar (as Cygwin's "ocamlopt -a
-verbose" will show).

Well, obviously the Cygwin gcc will need to use Cygwin functionality under
the covers -- it's a *cross*-compiler, after all, with host=cygwin.  But
the MinGW binaries produced with the -mno-cygwin flag should be the same.

Then there's a problem with Cygwin emacs.

Again, something that should be reported to the Cygwin list so that it can
be fixed.  FWIW, that may actually be related to Cygwin's signal handling
code, which got a major work-over recently.  See if a developer snapshot
of Cygwin fixes your rxvt problem...  I suspect this is getting off-topic
for this list.

The binaries do.  The bytecode doesn't (what the interpreter uses doesn't
count).

Fair enough.

Well, I'm not working on the MinGW version, but I do maintain the Cygwin
O'Caml version.  If you are willing to build from source and find all the
places where invocations of "gcc" by ocaml tools need to be replaced by
"gcc -mno-cygwin", that would be very helpful.

Again, I don't use emacs and won't be able to help you here.

Glad I could help.
