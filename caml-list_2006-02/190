I am attempting to install ocaml on a new OS X intel laptop, and a few 
hours of poking has gotten me the bytecode tools, but not the native 
compiler.  Is there any existing work on getting the native compiler 
working under the new Intel macs - or, failing that, would anyone like 
an ssh login to a machine to try their hand at getting it working?  
Since it is basically a BSD system with an intel chip I'm hoping that 
its more a matter of some autoconfigure foo than anything else.

-David
