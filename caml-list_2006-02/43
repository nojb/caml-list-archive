Yes, you have. O'Caml does not parallelize computations, it does just
one thing after the other (here in an unspecified order).

If your computations do not mutate any global value (i.e. are really
side-effect free), you can spawn two threads and let the operating
system schedule how the CPU is shared by the computations. However: I
said REALLY side-effect free, and that has to be valid not only for your
own code but also for all functions you call (e.g. consider functions
with hidden caches that pretend they are pure but actually aren't).

Otherwise I do not see any practical solution for your problem.=20
