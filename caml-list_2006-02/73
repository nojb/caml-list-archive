I haven't checked the systhreads implementation (as I don't use it),
but if it's anything similar to the vmthreads implementation, it is
not very high performance.

For example: to reschedule a thread, vmthreads a) uses select (not
sure if this is a problem), and b) does a linear search for a runnable
thread (I can't remember if it stops early, I'd have to have another
check).

The point is, in this case, you'd need to rewrite it to use thread
queues for the various states to get something closer to an O(1)
scheduler.
