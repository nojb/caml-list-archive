Hi. I am the shameful author of ocaml-tmk. I can say that for me, the
project is dead: I almost do not write Caml these times, and I have more
pressing things to do.

I say "shameful" because at least one person proposed to carry on the
project, and I procrastinated my reply. Which makes I must make apologies
for replying so late, which makes me procrastinate more. So today I force
myself to answer. I am really sorry for people who counted on me.

I am willing to give the project to anyone who wants it, provided he tells
me exactly what I have to do on the Savannah website to change the
ownership, including a possible licence change to include
I-do-not-remember-what Caml-specific exception to the LGPL..

As for your immediate needs: the ncurses binding in the current state of TMK
was working and fairly complete last time I checked. As far as I remember,
the only missing parts are the scanf-like functions and the mouse parts.
What is not complete at all is the widget system on top of that, but if you
only need low-level ncurses functions, you may be lucky.

On the other hand, the code dates back to just before the coming of
dynalically-loaded primitives. The build system is probably broken with
regard to that aspect.

I hope this will be useful, and I re-iterate my apologies to the people who
wrote to me.

Regards,
