Scope and Topics

The IFL  workshops form a  tradition that  has lasted for nearly two decade=
s.=20
The aim of these workshops is to bring  together researchers actively engag=
ed=20
in  the  implementation  and  application  of  functional and  function-bas=
ed=20
programming languages. They provide an open forum for researchers who wish =
to=20
present  and  discuss new ideas and concepts, work  in  progress, prelimina=
ry=20
results, etc. related primarily but not exclusively to the implementation a=
nd=20
application of functional languages.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* language concepts
* concurrent/parallel programming
* type checking
* concurrent/parallel program execution
* compilation techniques
* heap management
* generic programming techniques
* runtime profiling
* (abstract) interpretation
* performance measurements
* automatic program generation
* debugging and tracing
* (abstract) machine architectures
* verification
* formal aspects
* tools and programming techniques
* array processing
* demos of well working, useable tools and  applications
       in functional languages

    Papers on applications demonstrating  the  suitability of novel ideas i=
n any=20
of the above areas and contributions on  related  theoretical work are also=
=20
welcomed. The change of the workshop name adding the term "application",=20
introduced in 2004, is to reflect the broader scope IFL has gained over rec=
ent=20
years.

    Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in =
the=20
draft
proceedings and to give  presentations at  the workshop. All contributions =
must=20
be
written in English, conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS series format.

    Attendees at IFL'06  will  have  an opportunity  to  submit a revised=
=20
version of their  paper  for  post-workshop  reviewing.  Selected papers wi=
ll=20
be  published by Springer Verlag in the well-known Lecture Notes in Compute=
r=20
Science  (LNCS) Series, as  has  been a long-standing  tradition  for  the =
 IFL=20
Workshops.
