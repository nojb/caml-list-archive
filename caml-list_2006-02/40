I started with the wrong things in mind, sorry!

I have picked the original work (the picture I put on the web
was from somwhere else, not the original) from HvF and found
the following description:

  
   A is an operator/function that works like a trivial machine
   B is an operator/function that works like a trivial machine
   c is the internal state!


So it should be possible to have only c as a state variable and all
other stuff will be derived from the input x and the internal
state c via the functions/operators A and B.


Sorry for the wrong start, it was too long ago when I looked
into the original work! :(

So, now the direction is different.


But nevertheless thanks for all your efforts on helping with
implementing it in OCaml. :)

Regards,
   Oliver
