Note that I said 'high-performance'.

Point #1: select() and anything based on it (I believe Equeue still is 
though I haven't looked at it for quite a while) is woefully inadequate 
for high performance I/O except in very specific circumstances.

Point #2: It is not customary for UI applications to require 
particularly high-performance I/O, thus rendering the non-composability 
issue moot.

I'm _not_ recommending libevent for general use, just if you want high 
performance with an easily switchable backend implementation.

Cheers,
