Subject: [Caml-list] CICM 2020, July 26-31: First Call for Papers & Call for
 Workshop and Tutorial Proposals

[Please accept our apologies if you receive multiple copies of this email]

				 Joint Call for				    
       (i)  Papers (formal papers - informal papers - doctoral programme)
       (ii) Workshop and Tutorial Proposals

	      13th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
 				 - CICM 2020 -
				July 26-31, 2020
				Bertinoro, Italy
		      http://www.cicm-conference.org/2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (i) Call for Papers (formal papers - informal papers - doctoral programme)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital and  computational solutions  are becoming the  prevalent means  for the
generation,  communication, processing,  storage  and  curation of  mathematical
information.

CICM  brings  together  the  many   separate  communities  that  have  developed
theoretical  and  practical  solutions  for mathematical  applications  such  as
computation, deduction, knowledge management, and  user interfaces.  It offers a
venue for  discussing problems and  solutions in each  of these areas  and their
integration.

CICM 2020 Invited Speakers: 
    Kevin Buzzard (Imperial College London)
    Christian Szegedy (Google AI)

CICM 2020 Programme committee:
    see https://www.cicm-conference.org/2020/cicm.php?event=&menu=pc

CICM 2020  invites submissions  in all topics  relating to  intelligent computer
mathematics, in particular but not limited to

* theorem proving and computer algebra
* mathematical knowledge management
* digital mathematical libraries

CICM appreciates  the varying nature of  the relevant research in  this area and
invites submissions of different forms:

1) Formal  submissions will be reviewed  rigorously and accepted papers  will be
published in a volume of Springer LNAI:

   * regular papers (up to 15 pages including references) present
     novel research results
   * project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography)
     summarize existing results
   * system and dataset descriptions (up to 5 pages including
     references) present digital artifacts
   * system entry (1 page according to the given LaTeX template)
     provides metadata and a quick overview of a new tool or a new
     release of an existent tool

2) Informal submissions  will be reviewed with a positive  bias and selected for
   presentation based on their relevance for the community.

   * informal papers may present work-in-progress, project
     announcements, position statements, etc.
   * posters and system demos will be presented in parallel in special
     sessions

3) The  doctoral programme provides PhD  students with a forum  to present early
   results and receive constructive feedback and mentoring.

*** Important Dates ***

Formal submissions

- Abstract deadline: March 01 
- Full paper deadline: March 08 
- Reviews sent to authors: April 17 
- Rebuttals due: April 21 
- Notification of acceptance: April 24 
- Camera-ready copies due: May 03 
- Conference: July 26-31 
 
Informal submissions and doctoral programme

  Two separate submission rounds are offered so that some authors can make early
  travel plans while other authors submit spontaneously.

  - First round submission deadline:  April 15
  - Notification of acceptance:       May    1
  - Second round submission deadline: June  15
  - Notification of acceptance:       July   1

All submissions should be made via easychair at
   https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm13

As in previous years, we plan to publish the CICM 2020 proceedings with Springer
LNCS.

 (ii) Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital and  computational solutions  are becoming the  prevalent means  for the
generation,  communication, processing,  storage  and  curation of  mathematical
information.

CICM  brings  together  the  many   separate  communities  that  have  developed
theoretical  and  practical  solutions  for mathematical  applications  such  as
computation, deduction, knowledge management, and  user interfaces.  It offers a
venue for  discussing problems and  solutions in each  of these areas  and their
integration.

CICM has been  held annually as a joint meeting  since 2008, co-locating related
conferences and workshops  to advance work in these  subjects. Previous meetings
have been held in Birmingham (UK  2008), Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France
2010), Bertinoro  (Italy 2011), Bremen  (Germany 2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra
(Portugal 2014),  Washington DC (USA  2015), Bialystok (Poland  2016), Edinburgh
(UK 2018) and Prague (Czech Republic 2019).

Workshop Proposals
==================

CICM  encourages  submissions  of  any  kind  of  topically  suitable  workshop,
including  those focusing  on  formal results,  open  discussions, or  practical
systems. Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:

  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice
  Compact Computer Algebra
  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics
  Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians 
  Intelligent Proof Search
  Mathematical user Interfaces
  Mathematics Information Retrieval
  OpenMath
  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation
  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems
  Proof Engineering
  SCIEnce
  The Notion of Proof
  User Interfaces for Theorem Provers
  Workshop on Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians

Proposals  for  workshops  to  be  held   at  CICM  2020  are  solicited.   Both
well-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.

Please provide the following information:
 
    + Workshop title
    + Names and affiliations of organizers
    + Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics
    + Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days)
    + If the workshop has met previously, the recent conference affiliations
    + Preferred date (if any)

Tutorial Proposals
==================

Tutorial topics  should have  a direct relevance  to any topic  in the  scope of
CICM. Tutorials  may be focus on  theoretical methods or practical  systems.  We
especially welcome tutorials with a hands-on component.

Please provide the following information:

    + Tutorial title
    + Names and affiliations of organizers
    + Brief description of tutorial’s goals and/or topics
    + Tutorial duration (half or up to two days)
    + Relationship to previous tutorials (if any)
    + Preferred date (if any)

CICM will take care of copying and distributing informal printed proceedings for
workshops/tutorials  (if  the  organizers  wish that)  as  well  as  permanently
archiving open access online proceedings with CEUR-WS.org.

Important Dates
===============

Proposals should be submitted by February 01, 2020.

All  proposals  should  be  submitted via 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm13

More details on the conference are available from
