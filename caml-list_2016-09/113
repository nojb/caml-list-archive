 Conference on integrated Formal Methods, Torino)

13th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2017)

PRELIMINARY CALL FOR PAPERS


Important dates

    Abstract submission: Tuesday March 28
    Paper submission: Tuesday April 4
    Notification: Friday May 26
    Camera-ready copy: Tuesday June 11
    Conference: September 20-22

Deadlines expire at 23:59 anywhere on earth on the dates displayed above.


Objectives and Scope

Applying formal methods may involve the usage of different formalisms and d=
ifferent analysis techniques to validate a system, either because individua=
l components are most amenable to one formalism or technique, because one i=
s interested in different properties of the system, or simply to cope with =
the sheer complexity of the system. The iFM conference series seeks to furt=
her research into hybrid approaches to formal modeling and analysis; i.e., =
the combination of (formal and semi-formal) methods for system development,=
 regarding both modeling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects fr=
om language design through verification and analysis techniques to tools an=
d their integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

- Formal and semi-formal modelling notations
- Combining formal methods
- Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
- Program verification, model checking, and static analysis
- Runtime analysis, monitoring, and testing
- Program synthesis
- Analysis and synthesis of hybrid, embedded, probabilistic, distributed, o=
r concurrent systems
- Model learning
- Theorem proving, decision procedures, SAT and SMT solving=20


Submission Guidelines

iFM 2017 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or exp=
erience reports related to the overall theme of method integration.

We solicit papers in the following categories:

- Research papers describe original scientific research results, validated =
by experimental results where applicable. Submissions will be judged on the=
 basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. L=
imit: 15 pages.
- Case study papers report on applications of formal methods, preferably in=
 a real world setting. A case study paper need not introduce novel techniqu=
es or tools, but it must include a rigorous empirical evaluation and potent=
ially be of interest to practitioners. Limit: 15 pages.
- Regular tool papers present a new tool or novel extensions to an existing=
 tool. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundatio=
ns, while focusing on the tool's design and implementation concerns, as wel=
l as empirical evaluation of its practical capabilities. Papers that presen=
t extensions to existing tools should clearly focus on the improvements or =
extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool. Autho=
rs are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferab=
ly on the web. Limit: 15 pages.
- Tool demonstration papers focus on the usage aspects of tools. Foundation=
s and empirical evaluation are not required, but the paper should explain w=
hy the tool is relevant for the community, and, in particular, for practiti=
oners. As with regular tool papers, authors are strongly encouraged to make=
 their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Limit: 8 pages.

Page limits include bibliography and any appendices. All submissions must b=
e original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Each =
paper will undergo a thorough review process.

Submissions should be made using the iFM 2017 Easychair site: https://easyc=
hair.org/conferences/?conf=3Difm2017 (NOT YET OPENED). Submissions must be =
in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files; we suggest to use the L=
aTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class file, available in llncs2e.zip and the =
typeinst.dem available in typeinst.zip as a template for your contribution)=
. The conference proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes =
in Computer Science series.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must=
 be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of=
 each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registrat=
ion date, to be indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.


Workshops

iFM 2017 will be accompanied by a series of workshops. Further information =
is available from the conference website http://ifm2017.di.unito.it/


Conference Location

iFM 2017 is organized by the University of Turin and will take place in Tur=
in, Italy
