Subject: [Caml-list] TABLEAUX, FroCoS, ITP - Call for Workshops and
 Tutorials

(with apologies for multiple postings)

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS

Three of the main conferences on automated reasoning -- TABLEAUX, FroCoS, and 
ITP - will be held in Brasilia, Brazil, between 25 and 29 September 2017. 
Following the long tradition of those events, we invite researchers and 
practitioners to submit proposals for co-located workshops and in-depth 
tutorials on topics relating to automated theorem proving and its applications. 
Workshops/tutorials can target the automated reasoning community in general, 
focus on a particular theorem proving system, or highlight more specific 
issues or recent developments.

Co-located events will take place between 23 and 24/25 September and will be 
held on the same premises as the main conference. Conference facilities are 
offered free of charge to the organisers. Workshop/tutorial-only attendees 
will enjoy a significantly reduced registration fee.

Detailed organisational matters such as paper submission and review process, 
or publication of proceedings, are up to the organisers of individual 
workshops. All accepted workshops/tutorials will be expected to have their 
program ready by 18 August 2017.

Proposals for workshops/tutorials should contain at least the following pieces 
of information:

    - name and contact details of the main organiser(s)
    - (if applicable:) names of additional organisers
    - title and organisational style of event (tutorial, public workshop, 
      project workshop, etc.)
    - preferred length of workshop (between half day and two days)
    - estimated number of attendees
    - short (up to one page) description of topic
    - (if applicable:) pointers to previous editions of the workshop, or to 
      similar events

Proposals are invited to be submitted by email to nalon@unb.br, no later than 
9 December 2016. Selected events will be notified by 23 December 2016. The 
workshop/tutorial selection committee consists of the TABLEAUX, FroCoS, and 
ITP program chairs and the conference organisers.
