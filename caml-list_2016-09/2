Workshops

The ICLP 2016 program will include several workshops.  They  are  perhaps  the
best  places  for  the  presentation of preliminary work, underdeveloped novel
ideas, and new open problems to a wide and interested audience with opportuni-
ties for intensive discussions and project collaboration.

Autumn School on Computational Logic

Students and researchers are invited to participate in the Autumn School with
the following tutorials:

   * Roman Bartak: Constraint Logic Programming
   * Veronica Dahl: Language processing through logic grammars and constraints
   * Torsten Schaub: Answer Set Programming: foundations and applications
   * C.R.Ramakrishnan: Verification and probabilistic logic programming

Information on scholarships can be found on the homepage:
http://iclp16school.webs.upv.es/

Doctoral Consortium

The Twelfth Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming  provides  research
students  with  the  opportunity  to present and discuss their research direc-
tions, and to obtain feedback from  both  peers  and  experts  in  the  field.
Accepted  participants  will  receive  partial financial support to attend the
event and the main conference. The best paper from the DC will  be  given  the
opportunity to present in a session of the main ICLP conference.

Conference Venue

The  venue  will  be  the  Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel in Flushing, New York
City.  New York City is an international  tourist  destination,  receiving  56
million  tourists in 2014 alone. Several sources have ranked New York the most
photographed city in the world. Times square, known as the  city's  heart,  is
the  brightly  illuminated hub of the Broadway theatre district. The Statue of
Liberty greets new arrivals to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early
20th century, and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States. Flush-
ing is associated by many with the  National  Tennis  Centre,  since  Flushing
Meadows  has  been  the home of the US Open Grand Slam tennis tournament every
year since 1978.

New York is the most populous city in the United States and one  of  the  most
populous  urban  agglomerations  in  the world. Situated in one of the world's
largest natural harbours, New York City consists of  five  boroughs,  each  of
which is a separate county of New York State. The conference hotel is situated
in the Queens borough, just a two-minute walk from  the  Flushing-Main  Street
rail station.  Direct train lines take you directly from there to Times Square
in just over 45 minutes, which is fast for New York City. The Museum of Modern
Art  can  be  reached in under 40 mins, Grand Central Terminal in 40 mins, the
Empire State Building under 50 mins, and The High Line Park in 50 minutes.

The hotel is also close to LaGuardia Airports and JFK.  LaGuardia  is  just  3
miles  away  and  the  hotel  offers a complementary shuttle service.  John F.
Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is 10 miles away and can be reached within
30  minutes  by  taxi.  The hotel is situated in a vibrant Asian district that
offers a variety of Eastern cuisine, as well as many stores and shops.

Sponsor

The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming (ALP),
LogicBlox Inc., Semantic Systems, and UT Dallas.

Financial Assistance

The Association for Logic Programming has funds to assist  financially  disad-
vantaged  participants  and, especially, students to enable them to attend the
conference.  Inquiries should be made to the general chairs.
