Thanks for the pointer.

I've only seen demos and never used this feature a lot. You probably 
right that such a feature should be correctly tuned.

I've used Why3 IDE on a regular basis. This IDE is far from what I am 
looking for because one needs to do explicit actions to launch the 
provers. And Why3 IDE is focused on VCs, not the original source code 
(event if the code is displayed). Ideally, one would edit a WhyML file 
in an editor and the proved VC would be displayed automatically, like in 
Dafny. In fact the purpose of an editor I'm looking for would be to hide 
as much as possible the machinery to generate VC, launch provers, etc., 
from the user (and the same for test, doc generation, etc.). After all, 
when we call a compiler, we don't really care if the compiler, assembler 
or linker are needed and the files exchanged between them.

Best regards,
david
