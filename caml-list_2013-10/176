Subject: [Caml-list] Call for participation:  APLAS and CPP 2013

=================================================================
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

APLAS: 11th Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
CPP: 3rd International Conference on Certified Programs and Proofs

9-13 December 2013 (APLAS 9-11 December; CPP 11-13 December)
Melbourne, Australia

=================================================================

==========
Background
==========

APLAS aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas
in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia, but is
an international forum that serves the worldwide programming language
community.

APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software
(AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers
from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were successfully held
in Kyoto ('12), Kenting ('11), Shanghai ('10), Seoul ('09), Bangalore
('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), Taipei ('04) and
Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops. Proceedings will be
published in Springer's LNCS series.

CPP is an international forum on theoretical and practical topics in
all areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education,
that consider certification as an essential paradigm for their
work. Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some
sort, preferably with production of independently checkable
certificates.

The first two CPP conferences were held in Kenting, Taiwan, and Kyoto,
Japan, in December 2011 and 2012, respectively. As with the first
meetings, the proceedings will be published in Springer-Verlag’s
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


===================
Conference Location
===================

APLAS and CPP will be held at the Rydges on Swanston hotel in Melbourne,
Australia, adjacent to the University of Melbourne.

Melbourne is widely considered to be Australia's financial and arts
capital, and was recently selected by The Economist Intelligence Unit as
the World's Most Livable City. Read more about Melbourne at:

The conference hotel offers a reduced room rate for conference
attendees; rooms may be booked at:

A limited number of student rooms are available at the university at a much
reduced rate. Please email Mark Gordon <mgordon@trinity.unimelb.edu.au>
for rates and booking instructions.
