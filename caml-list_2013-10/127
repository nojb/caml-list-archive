Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Packing/Unpacking modules

Hi,

I started an abstraction over stream modules in my small library LILiS 
https://github.com/drup/LILiS but I only used already implemented stream 
modules.
It should be fairly easy to plug everything and it may be interesting to 
you, as an example use of streams.
In LILiS, the most important operation is concatmap and, by extension, 
concat. You also need a clone operation. I know it's not stream's best 
spot, but it happen that streams are often very good concatenable lists.

I ran a very small benchmark some time ago with the various stream 
implementations in batteries.
Afaik, Stream from the stdlib is similar to BatEnum while being worse in 
every aspects so it's not here. Also, it doesn't really handle cloning. 
Since I use concatenation extensively, regular lists take forever to 
run, so it's not included.

von koch simple, n = 11, 20 runs, time by run
BatSeq: 1.34s
BatEnum: 5.18s
BatLazyList : 9.55s

I'm quite curious how your streams perform, I may try later but I'm not 
sure I could implement concat quite as well as you would. I'm not very 
good at weird magic manipulation.

P.S. The benchmark module is not available anymore.
