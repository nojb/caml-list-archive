CALL FOR PAPERS
=============================================================
3rd ACM SIGPLAN Program Protection and Reverse Engineering Workshop 
(PPREW 2014)

Collocated with Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages 
(POPL 2014)

The US Grant, San Diego, CA
January 25, 2014

Website: http://www.pprew.org 
=============================================================

Important Dates:
***********************
Paper Submission:  October 25, 2013
Author Notification: November 15, 2013
Camera Ready: December 15, 2013

Workshop Aims:
***********************
Program protection and reverse engineering are dualisms of good and evil.
Beneficial uses of reverse engineering abound: malicious software needs to
be analyzed and understood in order to prevent their spread and to assess
their functional footprint; owners of intellectual property (IP) at times
need to recover lost or unmaintained designs. Conversely, malicious reverse
engineering allows illegal copying and subversion and designers can employ
obfuscation and tamper-proofing on IP to target various attack vectors. In
this sense, protecting IP and protecting malware from detection and analysis
is a double-edged sword: depending on the context, the same techniques are
either beneficial or harmful. Likewise, tools that deobfuscate malware in
good contexts become analysis methods that support reverse engineering for
illegal activity.

PPREW invites papers on practical and theoretical approaches for program
protection and reverse  engineering used in beneficial contexts, focusing on
analysis/deobfuscation of malicious code and methods/tools that hinder
reverse engineering. Ongoing work with preliminary results, theoretical
approaches, tool-based methods, and empirical studies on various methods are
all appropriate. Studies on either hardware/circuit based methods or
software/assembly based mechanisms are within scope of the workshop. We
expect the workshop to provide exchange of ideas and support for cooperative
relationships among researchers in industry and academia.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:
- Obfuscation / Deobfuscation
- Tamper-proofing / Hardware-based protection
- Theoretical proofs for exploitation or protection
- Software watermarking / Digital fingerprinting
- Reverse engineering tools and techniques
- Side channel analysis and vulnerability mitigation
- Program / circuit slicing
- Information hiding and discovery
- Theoretical analysis frameworks:
  o Abstract Interpretation
  o Term Rewriting Systems
  o Machine Learning
  o Large Scale Boolean Matching
- Component / Functional Identification
- Program understanding
- Source code (static/dynamic) analysis techniques

Publication:
***********************
Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

Submission Guidelines:
***********************
Original, unpublished manuscripts of up to 12-pages including figures and
references must follow the ACM proceedings format. SIGPLAN conference paper
templates are available for LaTeX and Word at
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author (use the 9 pt template). Submissions
must be in PDF.  See workshop website (http://www.pprew.org) for more
details.

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Re-publication Policy and the
ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences,
workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.
Submissions that do not meet these guidelines may not be considered.
