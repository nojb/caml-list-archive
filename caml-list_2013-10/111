                         DICE 2014
Fifth Workshop on Developments in Implicit Computational Complexity
====================================================================
                http://dice14.tcs.ifi.lmu.de

                       Grenoble, France
                       April 5-6, 2014
               (a satellite event of ETAPS 2014)


Important Dates
----------------

* Abstract Submission: January  5, 2014
* Notification:        January 20, 2014
* Final version:      February 10, 2014


Scope
------

The area of Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC) has grown from
several proposals for using logic and formal methods to provide
languages for complexity-bounded computation (e.g. PTIME, LOGSPACE
computation). Its aim is to study computational complexity without
reference to external measuring conditions or particular machine
models, but only in terms of language restrictions or
logical/computational principles implying complexity properties.

This workshop focuses on ICC methods related to programs (rather than
descriptive methods). In this approach one relates complexity classes
to restrictions on programming paradigms (functional programs, lambda
calculi, rewriting systems), such as ramified recurrence, weak
polymorphic types, linear logic and linear types, and interpretative
measures. The two main objectives of this area are:

  * to find natural implicit characterizations of various
    complexity classes of functions, thereby illuminating their
    nature and importance;
  * to design methods suitable for static verification of
    program complexity.

Therefore ICC connects both to the study of complexity classes and to
static program analysis.  The workshop is open to contributions
on various aspects of ICC including (but not exclusively):

  * types for controlling complexity
  * logical systems for implicit computational complexity
  * linear logic
  * semantics of complexity-bounded computation
  * rewriting and termination orderings
  * interpretation-based methods for implicit complexity
  * programming languages for complexity-bounded computation
  * theoretical foundations of program complexity analysis
  * application of implicit complexity to security


Submission
-----------

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract of up to 5 pages.
Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop. Submissions will
be judged on originality, relevance, interest and clarity. Preference
will be given to abstracts describing work (including work in
progress) that has not been published elsewhere before the workshop.
Any previous publication or submission of submitted work should be
clearly indicated in the submission.  The workshop will not have
formal proceedings and is not intended to preclude later publication
at another venue.

Abstracts should be written in English and can be submitted in PDF
form to the DICE 2014 EasyChair page:
  https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=dice2014

Submissions of abstracts by PC members are allowed and encouraged.
