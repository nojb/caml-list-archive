I think the most advanced project regarding IDE integration nowadays is
Merlin ( https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin ), which gives direct feedback
on syntax and typing errors. It doesn't have any knowledge of unit tests or
coverage checking, but it would probably be the right tool to start with to
integrate such a feature.

Note that there has been a bit of back-and-forth on the instant feedback
feature. Previous iterations were deemed a bit too visually invasive, and
some people don't like to risk being interrupted by their IDE while they
think about their code. I think it's always better to have the feature
available, but there is clearly some tuning to have, and potential for
overdoing it.

The other project that jumps to mind is the Why3 IDE (
http://why3.lri.fr/). It seems they're not hype enough to have video
stuff available, but from
what I remember the GUI does a pretty good job of giving feedback on how
external provers run, and pieces of code that were previously verified and
aren't anymore.

Somebody has recently shown me the NCrunch (<a href=3D"http://www.ncrunch.n=

plug-in running under Microsoft Visual Studio and I was quite<br>

In the same spirit, I have seen the Dafny development environment for<br>

the program being edited are generated and run in the background, with<br>
coloured icons displaying the result. Once again, no need for the user<br>
to click on icons or do any specific action.<br>
<br>
So my question: are there similar OCaml editors available or being<br>
worked on that would allow running tasks in the background and<br>
displaying result in the editor without user intervention?<br>
<br>
There is apparently a lot of development in the OCaml development<br>

similar.<br>
<br>
By &quot;OCaml editor&quot;, I am voluntarily ambiguous: I am interested in=

editor to program in OCaml and editor programmed in OCaml (or<br>
interfaced with OCaml) and which could be used for other languages.<br>
