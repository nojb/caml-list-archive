Isn't this covered (as a warning not an error) by warnings 5 & 10, both 
of which are default?

Although the manual does say, rather ominously...

"Note that warnings 5 and 10 are not always triggered, depending on the 
internals of the type checker."

Does that caveat also apply to -strict-sequence? If not, why not, and 
could its implementation be back-ported to fix up warnings 5 and/or 10?

feast:~ john$ ocaml -strict-sequence
         OCaml version 4.01.0

# let f x = x + 1;;
val f : int -> int = <fun>
# f 1; 0;;
Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of 
type unit

feast:~ john$ ocaml
         OCaml version 4.01.0

# let f x = x + 1;;
val f : int -> int = <fun>
# f 1; 0;;
Warning 10: this expression should have type unit.
- : int = 0

The warning text for warning 10 could be changed to:

"Warning 10: this expression should have type unit. If this is intended, 
consider using the 'ignore' function."

Cheers,
