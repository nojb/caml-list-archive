Subject: [Caml-list] LPAR-19 - Calls for Short Papers and Workshop Papers

         ============================================================
                   The 19th International Conference on
         Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning
 
                 CALL FOR SHORT PAPERS and WORKSHOP PAPERS
         ============================================================

               Stellenbosch, South Africa, 14-19 December 2013
                            www.LPAR-19.info

The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of 
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning,
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 19th LPAR
will be held in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SHORT PAPERS

In keeping with the tradition of LPAR, researchers and practitioners are 
invited to submit short papers reporting on interesting work in progress or
providing system descriptions. They need not be original. Extended or revised
versions of the short papers may be submitted concurrently with or after LPAR 
to another conference or a journal. Short papers are limited in length to 8 
pages in the EasyChair format.

Accepted papers will be published electronically as a volume in the EPiC 
series, see http://www.easychair.org/publications/?page=38379010. Authors of 
accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them will be 
present at the conference. Papers that do not adhere to this policy will not 
be published.

The LaTeX, Microsoft Word and LibreOffice templates for the EPiC series may 
be downloaded from http://www.easychair.org/publications/?page=1594225690.
Short papers must be submitted through the EasyChair system using the web page
    https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar19

Paper submission deadline:  October 14th, 2013
