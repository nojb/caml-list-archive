First Call for Papers

- F-IDE 2014 -

First International Workshop on Formal Integrated Development Environment=
=20
(Satellite event of ETAPS)
April 6th, 2014, Grenoble, France
http://www.ensta-paristech.fr/~etaps/


WORKSHOP AIM
High levels of safety, security and also privacy standards require the use =
of formal methods to specify and  develop  compliant  software (sub)systems=
.  Any standard comes with an assessment process, which requires a complete=
 documentation of the application  in order to ease the justification of de=
sign choices and the review of code and proofs.

Ideally, an F-IDE dedicated to such developments  should comply with severa=
l requirements. The first one is to associate a logical theory with a progr=
amming language, in a way that facilitates the tightly coupled  handling  o=
f specification properties and program constructs.  The second one is to  o=
ffer a  language/environment simple enough to be usable by most developers,=
 even if they are not fully acquainted with higher-order logics or set theo=
ry,  in particular by making development of proofs  as easy as possible. Th=
e third one is to offer automated management of application documentation. =
 It may also  be expected that developments done with such an F-IDE are reu=
sable and modular.  Moreover, tools for testing and static analysis may be =
embedded in this F-IDE,  to help address most steps of the assessment proce=
ss.


TOPICS

We encourage submissions presenting and discussing research efforts as well=
 as experience returns on design, development, usage of tools aiming at mak=
ing formal methods "easier" for non-specialists.=20

In this context, the topics include (but are not limited to):

- F-IDE building : design and integration of languages, compilation
- How to make high-level logical and programming concepts palatable to indu=
strial developers
- Integration of Object-Oriented  and modularity features
- Integration of static analysers
- Integration of automatic proof tools,  theorem provers and testing tools
- Documentation tools
- Impact of tools on certification
- Experience reports of developing  F-IDE
- Experience reports of  using F-IDE
- Experience reports of  formal methods-based assessments of industrial app=
lications


We encourage not only mature research results, submissions presenting=20
innovative ideas and early results are also of interest.


SUBMISSIONS

Papers  (6-14 pages in length), following EPCTS format are expected.  They =
can be:

*    Research papers providing new concepts and results
*    Position papers and research perspectives
*    Experience reports
*    Tool presentations

Submissions will be done via Easychair: https://www.easychair.org/conferenc=
es/?conf=3Dfide2014

PROCEEDINGS

Final versions of accepted papers will be published in a volume of the Elec=
tronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).
