I would have thought that all of those would be the same things that make
it not good for program transformation.  At least not if you want to look
at the transformed code.  It could be OK for something like weaving
aspects, where you just want to execute the code, and want to advise the
parts that are not broken by the simplifications.

I have the impression that Frama-C does similar reorganizations.
