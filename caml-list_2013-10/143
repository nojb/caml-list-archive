**************************************************
      The Sixth NASA Formal Methods Symposium

         http://www.NASAFormalMethods.org/

               29 April - 1 May 2014
   NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA
**************************************************


Theme of the Symposium:
-----------------------
The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission- and=20
safety-critical systems require advanced techniques that address their=20
specification, verification, validation, and certification requirements.

The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is a forum for theoreticians and=20
practitioners from academia, industry, and government, with the goals of=20
identifying challenges and providing solutions to achieving assurance in=20
mission- and safety-critical systems. Within NASA such systems include=20
autonomous robots, separation assurance algorithms for aircraft, Next=20
Generation Air Transportation (NextGen), and autonomous rendezvous and=20
docking for spacecraft. Moreover, emerging paradigms such as=20
property-based design, code generation, and safety cases are bringing=20
with them new challenges and opportunities. The focus of the symposium=20
will be on formal techniques, their theory, current capabilities, and=20
limitations, as well as their application to aerospace, robotics, and=20
other safety-critical systems in all design life-cycle stages. We=20
encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches marrying formal=20
verification techniques with advances in safety-critical system=20
development, such as requirements generation, analysis of aerospace=20
operational concepts, and formal methods integrated in early design=20
stages carrying throughout system development.


Topics of Interest:
-------------------
     * Model checking
     * Theorem proving
     * Static analysis
     * Model-based development
     * Runtime monitoring
     * Formal approaches to fault tolerance
     * Applications of formal methods to aerospace systems
     * Formal analysis of cyber-physical systems, including hybrid and=20
embedded systems
     * Formal methods in systems engineering, modeling, requirements,=20
and specifications
     * Requirements generation, specification debugging, formal=20
validation of specifications
     * Use of formal methods in safety cases
     * Use of formal methods in human-machine interaction analysis
     * Formal methods for parallel hardware implementations
     * Use of formal methods in automated software engineering and testing
     * Correct-by-design, design for verification, and property-based=20
design techniques
     * Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods; e.g.=20
abstraction and symbolic methods, compositional techniques, parallel and=20
distributed techniques
     * Application of formal methods to emerging technologies


Important Dates:
----------------
Abstract Submission: 14 Nov 2013
Paper Submission:    21 Nov 2013
Paper Notifications: 14 Jan 2014
Camera-ready Papers: 11 Feb 2014
Symposium: 29 April - 1 May 2014


Location & Cost:
----------------
The symposium will take place at the Gilruth Center, NASA Johnson Space=20
Center, Houston, Texas, USA, 29 April to 1 May 2013.

There will be no registration fee for participants. All interested=20
individuals, including non-US citizens, are welcome to attend, to listen=20
to the talks, and to participate in discussions; however, all attendees=20
must register.


Submission Details:
-------------------
There are two categories of submissions:

    1. Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete=20
results (15 pages)
    2. Short papers describing tools, experience reports, or=20
descriptions of work in progress with preliminary results (6 pages)

All papers should be in English and describe original work that has not=20
been published or submitted elsewhere. All submissions will be fully=20
reviewed by members of the Programme Committee. Papers will appear in a=20
volume of Springer's Lecture Notes on Computer Science (LNCS), and must=20
use LNCS style formatting. Papers should be submitted in PDF format.


Keynote Speakers:
-----------------
* Larry Paulson, University of Cambridge, UK
* Moshe Y. Vardi, Rice University, USA
* Special Guest Talk: "NASA Future Challenges in Formal Methods"
by Bill McAllister, Chief, Safety and Mission Assurance, International=20
Space Station Safety Panels, Avionics and Software Branch


Panel Feature: "Future Directions of Specifications for Formal Methods"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Specifications are required for all applications of formal methods yet=20
extracting specifications for real-life safety critical systems often=20
proves to be a huge bottleneck or even an insurmountable hurdle to the=20
application of formal methods in practice. This is the state for=20
safety-critical systems today and as these systems grow more complex,=20
more pervasive, and more powerful in the future, there is not a clear=20
path even for maintaining the bleak status quo. Therefore, we propose=20
highlighting this issue in the home of an important critical system, the=20
Mission Control Center of NASA's most famous critical systems, and=20
asking our panelists where we can go from here.
