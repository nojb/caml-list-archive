Call for Papers: Formal Methods 2014 (FM 2014), Singapore, May 14-16, 2014

CALL FOR PAPERS:
Formal Methods 2014 (FM 2014)
19th International Symposium on Formal Methods
Singapore, May 14-16, 2014
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/FM2014/

FM 2014 is the nineteenth in a series of symposia organized by
Formal Methods Europe, an independent association whose aim is
to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for
software development. The symposia have been notably successful
in bringing together innovators and practitioners in precise
mathematical methods for software and systems development,
industrial users, as well as researchers. Submissions are
welcomed in the form of original papers on research and
industrial experience, proposals for workshops and tutorials,
entries for the exhibition of software tools and projects, and
reports on ongoing doctoral work.

SCOPE AND TOPICS

It will have the goal of highlighting the development and
application of formal methods in connection with a variety of
disciplines such as medicine, biology, human cognitive modeling,
human automation interactions and aeronautics, among others. FM
2014 particularly welcomes papers on techniques, tools and
experiences in interdisciplinary frameworks, as well as on
experience with practical applications of formal methods in
industrial and research settings, experimental validation of
tools and methods as well as construction and evolution of
formal methods tools. The broad topics of interest for FM 2014
include but are not limited to:

Interdisciplinary formal methods: techniques, tools and
experiences demonstrating formal methods in interdisciplinary
frameworks.

Formal methods in practice: industrial applications of formal
methods, experience with introducing formal methods in industry,
tool usage reports, experiments with challenge problems. Authors
are encouraged to explain how the use of formal methods has
overcome problems, lead to improvements in design or provided
new insights.

Tools for formal methods: advances in automated verification and
model-checking, integration of tools, environments for formal
methods, experimental validation of tools. Authors are
encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new tool or
environment advances the state of the art.

Role of formal methods in software and systems engineering:
development processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for
formal methods, method integration. Authors are encouraged to
demonstrate that process innovations lead to qualitative or
quantitative improvements.

Theoretical foundations: all aspects of theory related to
specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic
analysis. Authors are encouraged to explain how their results
contribute to the solution of practical problems.

PAPER SUBMISSION

Papers will be evaluated by at least three members of the Program
Committee. They should be in Springer LNCS format and describe,
in English, original work that has not been published or submitted
elsewhere. Papers should be submitted through the FM 2014
EasyChair web site.

We solicit two categories of papers:

Regular papers should not exceeding 15 pages (including
appendices), describing fully developed work. Authors of papers
reporting experimental work are strongly encouraged to make their
experimental results available for use by reviewers. Similarly,
case study papers should describe significant case studies and
the complete development should be made available for use by
reviewers.

Tools papers of a maximum of 4 pages should describe an
operational tool and its contributions; 2 additional pages of
appendices are allowed that will not be included in the
proceedings. Tool papers should explain enhancements made
compared to previously published work. A tool paper need not
present the theory behind the tool but can focus more on its
features, and how it is used, with screen shots and examples.
Authors of tools papers should make their tool available for
use by reviewers.

Industry track papers (with a different deadline) should not
exceeding 15 pages (including appendices), describing industrial
applications of formal methods, experience with introducing
formal methods in industry, tool usage reports, experiments with
challenge problems. Authors are encouraged to explain how the
use of formal methods has overcome problems, lead to improvements
in design or provided new insights.

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract due: November 7, 2013
Full papers due: November 14, 2013
Acceptance / Rejection Notification: February 1, 2014
Industry Track Submission: January 16, 2014
Industry Track Notification: February 16, 2014
Camera-ready: February 25, 2014
Main Conference Date: May 14-16, 2014
Tutorial / Workshops Date: May 12-13, 2014

CALL FOR TUTORIALS, WORKSHOPS and DOC SYMPOSIUM

The organizing committee of FM 2014 thus invites proposals for
half- or full-day tutorials in the broad area of formal methods.
Proposals from industry practitioners or academics are very
welcome; proposals for tutorials on applications of formal
methods to challenging problems are particularly welcome. All
tutorials should focus on providing participants with the
opportunity to learn new techniques, new application domains,
and insightful uses of formal methods. Details on the call for
tutorials can be found at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/FM2014/cft.html

We are also inviting people to submit proposals for workshops.
The purpose of the workshops is to provide an informal setting
for workshop participants to discuss technical issues, exchange
research ideas, and to discuss and/or demonstrate applications.
These workshops may be driven by fundamental academic interests
or by needs from specific application domains. We encourage a
diversity of workshops relating to different varieties of formal
models. Details on the call for workshops can be found at
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/FM2014/cfp4w.html

A Doctoral Symposium will be held on 12-13th May in conjunction
with the FME Symposium FM2014. This aims to provide a helpful
environment in which selected doctoral students can present and
discuss their ongoing work, meet other students working on
similar topics and receive helpful advice and feedback from a
panel of researchers and academics. Details on the call for
doctoral symposium can be found at
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/FM2014/cfd.html
