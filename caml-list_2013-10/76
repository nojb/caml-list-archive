The User's Manual discusses items that are part of the "official" OCaml
distribution from Inria. OCamldoc has long served the community and
continues to be widely used. On the other hand, the community has recently
initiated quite a few projects to improve many things, a documentation tool
being one of them. Over time, you're probably right that some topics in the
User's Manual should defer to other resources like ocaml.org (which is
itself being enhanced in many ways).
