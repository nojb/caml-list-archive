You also have OcaIDE available as an Eclipse plugin 
(http://www.algo-prog.info/ocaide/).

            In the same spirit, I have seen the Dafny development

            still on<br>
            Visual Studio, where this time Verification Conditions and
            proofs of<br>
            the program being edited are generated and run in the
            background, with<br>
            coloured icons displaying the result. Once again, no need
            for the user<br>
            to click on icons or do any specific action.<br>
            <br>
            So my question: are there similar OCaml editors available or
            being<br>
            worked on that would allow running tasks in the background
            and<br>
            displaying result in the editor without user intervention?<br>
            <br>
            There is apparently a lot of development in the OCaml
            development<br>
            environment these days so somebody might already work on
            something<br>
            similar.<br>
            <br>
            By "OCaml editor", I am voluntarily ambiguous: I am
            interested in both<br>
            editor to program in OCaml and editor programmed in OCaml
            (or<br>
            interfaced with OCaml) and which could be used for other
            languages.<br>
