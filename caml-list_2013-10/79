Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Procord 0.1.0: Delegate tasks to other processes

I am happy to announce the first release of Procord, a portable library
to delegate tasks to other processes.

Obtain it with opam:

  opam install procord

Or, download the tarball:

  https://github.com/cryptosense/procord/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz

View a minimal, commented example:

  https://github.com/cryptosense/procord/blob/master/examples/minimal.ml

You can browse the API at:

  http://cryptosense.github.io/procord/api/index.html

Procord can spawn local worker processes or communicate using sockets to
a remote worker server. Workers will receive an input, execute a
function on this input, and send back the result. Meanwhile, the main
program can continue to run while waiting for the results.

Not relying on threads, Procord is robust - a segmentation fault in the
worker will not kill the main program. Not relying on fork, Procord is
portable - it has been tested on Linux and Windows.

Procord provides an easy way to have the same executable act as a worker
- local or remote - or as the main program. The actual behavior can be
specified on the command-line. The default is to run as the main
program, which delegates tasks by running itself.

I will present Procord at the OUPS meeting of this evening.
