Fair enough, so let make this happen! Are you willing to be a tester or
helping me on the topic. I have seen that there are some tools to handle
_oasis file in obuild, but given there extreme simpicity, I think this
was just a try and probably not working:
https://github.com/vincenthz/obuild/blob/master/tools/assimilate_oasis.ml

Let's grow this into something that work really with _oasis file and
have the possibility to choose a different backend for OASIS.

I have contacted obuild author to see how we can cooperate on the topic
and I would like to do something to have at least another build engine
possible.

Cheers
Sylvain
