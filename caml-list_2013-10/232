                         http://cs.nyu.edu/ijcar2014/

               as part of FLoC 2014 - Federated Logic Conference
                        http://www.floc-conference.org/

                              Call for Papers
                              ---------------

IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics
in automated reasoning. The IJCAR technical program will consist
of presentations of high-quality original research papers,
system descriptions, and invited talks.

IJCAR 2014 is a merger of leading events in automated reasoning:

  CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction),
  FroCoS (Workshop on Frontiers of Combining Systems) and
  TABLEAUX (Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods)

IJCAR 2014 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated
reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications.
Original research papers and descriptions of working automated deduction
systems are solicited.

IJCAR topics include the following ones:

- Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical,
  equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal,
  temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory, etc.

- Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution,
  model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting,
  induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures,
  model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive
  theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for
  deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem provers,
  etc.

- Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods,
  program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative
  programming, deductive databases, knowledge representation, etc.

The proceedings of IJCAR 2014 will be published by Springer-Verlag in
the LNAI/LNCS series.
