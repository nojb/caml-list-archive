*** First Call for Papers ***

17th International Conference on Business Information Systems
BIS 2014
Grecian Bay Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus
May 21-23, 2014

http://bis.kie.ue.poznan.pl/17th_bis/

Deadline for submissions: December 20, 2013

(Proceedings will be published in Springer's LNBIP series)


THEME OF THE CONFERENCE

Big Data: problems solved and remaining challenges

The amount of data available for analysis, especially economy-related data,
is increasing rapidly. According to MGI and McKinsey's Business Technology
Group, Big Data is becoming a key basis of competition, important factor of
productivity growth, innovation, consumer surplus as well as organizational
effectiveness. Currently, Big Data is one of the hottest trends in the areas
like recommendation engines, network monitoring, sentiment analysis, fraud
detection, risk modeling, marketing campaign analysis, and social graph
analysis. However, there is a need to remodel technologies, applications,
infrastructure, and business processes in order to take full advantage of t=
he
possibilities offered by Big Data.

It is our pleasure to invite you to submit your work to BIS 2014 conference.
The BIS conference is a well-respected event joining international research=
ers
to discuss the wide range of the development, implementation, application
and improvement of business applications and systems. It is addressed to the
scientific community, people involved in the development of business
computer applications, consultants helping to properly implement computer
technology and applications in the industry.
