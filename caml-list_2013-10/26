I agree with Gabriel, something close to what merlin does for type
errors would probably be the best thing. If tests were launched every
time you hit "save", run in the background, and display a warning (the
same way merlin already does for compilation warnings), it would be a
tight feedback loop indeed.

There are some facilities for writing unit tests directly in source
code, at least in Batteries. That would keep everything in the same
editor page.

My 2 cents
