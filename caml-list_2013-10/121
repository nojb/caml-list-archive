I have used CIL in another project in the past. My experience is that it 
is a great front-end for program transformation. It is less adapted to 
static analysis though, as it does a lot of syntactic transformations, 
causing part of the structure of the code to be lost. For instance, it 
transforms loops into a while(1) form, with break statements. This design 
choice does not help static analyzers, and may require recalculating 
information that was lost in the early phases.

Best Regards,

Xavier.
