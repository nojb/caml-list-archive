Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] Procord 0.1.0: Delegate tasks to other
 processes

Indeed. In fact I made a feature request about this:

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=6146

So, just waiting for OCaml 4.02 will solve the issue.

If waiting is not an option I can of course add this in Procord. I
should at least provide a way to get the PID / Process Handle so that
one can call TerminateProcess using his own binding.

While we are discussing the differences between Windows and Linux, there
is actually another one: the Windows server does not fork and, thus,
only accepts one task at a time. This could be solved by having the
server execute himself to run the tasks. But before actually
implementing this I prefer to wait and see whether there is a real need
(Windows servers are less common).

Cheers,
