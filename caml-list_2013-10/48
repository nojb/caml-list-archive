=> yes, this is the official way (no shared memory, no fine grain
locking, etc). Note this was the way followed by Python too for
the same reasons (to make the intepreter multi-threaded was considered
as too hard for the expected best result, i.e., ~4 time maximum speed up).
You can say OCaml can be compiled to native code but this is far to help
for the garbage collector...

=> I can't see where a LLVM backend really helps for multi-core/multi-
processor parallelism... IMHO the best / most reasonable thing you can
do to handle multi-core/multi-processor parallelism is a set of
communicating independent OCaml instances (one per process). The model
is well understood and scales.

PS: my PhD thesis was about Caml and parallelism so the subject is
really not new...
