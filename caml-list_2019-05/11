TFPIE 2019 Call for papers
http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hage0101/tfpie2019/index.html
(June 11th, University of British Columbia, Vancouver Canada, co-located with TFP 2019)

TFPIE 2019 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the classroom, tools used
in and/or developed for the classroom and any creative use of functional programming (FP)
to aid education in or outside Computer Science. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

   FP and beginning CS students
   FP and Computational Thinking
   FP and Artificial Intelligence
   FP in Robotics
   FP and Music
   Advanced FP for undergraduates
   FP in graduate education
   Engaging students in research using FP
   FP in Programming Languages
   FP in the high school curriculum
   FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
   FP and Philosophy
   The pedagogy of teaching FP
   FP and e-learning: MOOCs, automated assessment etc.
   Best Lectures - more details below

In addition to papers, we are requesting best lecture presentations. What's your
best lecture topic in an FP related course? Do you have a fun way to present FP
concepts to novices or perhaps an especially interesting presentation of a
difficult topic? In either case, please consider sharing it. Best lecture topics
will be selected for presentation based on a short abstract describing the
lecture and its interest to TFPIE attendees. The length of the presentation
should be comparable to that of a paper. On top of the lecture itself,
the presentation can also provide commentary on the lecture.

Submissions
Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or a
draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of accepted
presentations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the
workshop's website. Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the
following link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2019

After the workshop, presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version of)
their article for review. The PC will select the best articles that will be
published in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).
Articles rejected for presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally
reviewed by the PC.

Dates
Submission deadline:          May    14th 2019, Anywhere on Earth.
Notification:                 May    20th
Workshop:                     June   11th
Submission for formal review: August 18th 2019, Anywhere on Earth
Notification of full article: October 6th
Camera ready:                 November 1st
