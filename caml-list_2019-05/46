Submission link https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcifma2019
Submission deadline: Thursday 13 June 2019
Notification: Friday 4 July 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------

Cognition encompasses many aspects of intellectual functions and
processes such as
attention, knowledge, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem solving,
decision making,
comprehension and production of language. Although it originated from
the field of
psychology, it goes beyond the individual human mind and behaviour, and inv=
olves
and affects the interaction with the environment in which humans act.
The increasing complexity of the environment with which humans
interact is no longer
restricted to their natural living environment and the other humans
populating it,
but includes a large technological support consisting of physical and
computational
systems, virtual worlds and robots. This fact has expanded the scope of stu=
dying
cognition to a large number of disciplines well beyond psychology.
Cognitive processes are analysed from different perspectives within differe=
nt
contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, anesthesia,
neuroscience, psychiatry,
psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, biology,
systemics,
logic, and computer science. These and other different approaches to
the analysis
of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of cognitive science, a
progressively autonomous academic discipline.

The objectives of this new international workshop are:

1. to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry =
and
   research institutions who are interested in the foundations and
applications of
   cognition from the perspective of their areas of expertise and aim at a
   synergistic effort in integrating approaches from different areas;
2. to nurture cooperation among researchers from different areas and establ=
ish
   concrete collaborations;
3. to present formal methods to cognitive scientists as a general modelling=
 and
   analysis approach, whose effectiveness goes well beyond its application =
to
   computer science and software engineering.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------=

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------

Authors are invited to submit, via Easychair, research contributions
or experience
reports. The submission link is:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcifma2019

All papers should be written in English and prepared using the specific LNCS
templates available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

There are six categories of submissions

RESEARCH PAPERS to present original research and the analysis,
interpretation and
validation of the research findings.

POSITION PAPERS to present innovative, arguable ideas, opinions or framewor=
ks
which are likely to foster discussion at the workshop.

INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT PAPERS to describe a new interdisciplinary resear=
ch
project, or the status of an ongoing project or the outcomes of a recently
completed project.

CASES STUDY PAPERS to report on case studies, preferably in a
real-world setting.

TOOL PAPERS to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel
extensions to an
existing tool.

TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS to demonstrate the tool workflow(s) and
human interaction
aspects, and evaluate the overall role of the tool and impact to
cognitive science.

Contributions will be in the form of

* FULL PAPERS between 12 and 15 pages for submission (and between 12
and 16 pages
  for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* SHORT PAPERS between 6 and 8 pages for submission (and between 6 and 9 pa=
ges
  for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* PRESENTATIONS extended abstract up to 4 pages, which will be included in =
the
  pre-proceeding but not published in the post-proceedings.

"Short papers" and "Presentations" can discuss new ideas which are at an ea=
rly
stage of development and which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated.

The program committee may reject papers that are outside these lengths on t=
he
grounds of length alone.

Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality and
relevance. Notification and reviews will be communicated via email.
Accepted papers
(both "Full papers" and "Short papers") will be included in the
workshop programme and
will appear in the workshop pre-proceedings as well as in the LNCS
post-proceedings.
Pre-proceedings will be available online before the Workshop.

Cognition encompasses many aspects of intellectual functions and processes =
such as
attention, knowledge, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem solving, decisio=
n making,
comprehension and production of language. Although it originated from the f=
ield of
psychology, it goes beyond the individual human mind and behaviour, and inv=
olves
and affects the interaction with the environment in which humans act.
The increasing complexity of the environment with which humans interact is =
no longer
restricted to their natural living environment and the other humans populat=
ing it,
but includes a large technological support consisting of physical and compu=
tational
systems, virtual worlds and robots. This fact has expanded the scope of stu=
dying
cognition to a large number of disciplines well beyond psychology.
Cognitive processes are analysed from different perspectives within differe=
nt
contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, anesthesia, neuroscience, p=
sychiatry,
psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, biology, syst=
emics,
logic, and computer science. These and other different approaches to the an=
alysis
of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of cognitive science, a
progressively autonomous academic discipline.

The objectives of this new international workshop are:

1. to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry =
and
   research institutions who are interested in the foundations and applicat=
ions of
   cognition from the perspective of their areas of expertise and aim at a
   synergistic effort in integrating approaches from different areas;
2. to nurture cooperation among researchers from different areas and establ=
ish
   concrete collaborations;
3. to present formal methods to cognitive scientists as a general modelling=
 and
   analysis approach, whose effectiveness goes well beyond its application =
to
   computer science and software engineering.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------

Authors are invited to submit, via Easychair, research contributions or exp=
erience
reports. The submission link is: <a href=3D"https://easychair.org/conferenc=
es/?conf=3Dcifma2019" target=3D"_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?=
conf=3Dcifma2019</a>

All papers should be written in English and prepared using the specific LNCS
templates available at <a href=3D"http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.=
html" target=3D"_blank">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.

There are six categories of submissions

RESEARCH PAPERS to present original research and the analysis, interpretati=
on and
validation of the research findings.

POSITION PAPERS to present innovative, arguable ideas, opinions or framewor=
ks
which are likely to foster discussion at the workshop.

INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT PAPERS to describe a new interdisciplinary resear=
ch
project, or the status of an ongoing project or the outcomes of a recently
completed project.

CASES STUDY PAPERS to report on case studies, preferably in a real-world se=
tting.

TOOL PAPERS to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel extensions=
 to an
existing tool.

TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS to demonstrate the tool workflow(s) and human int=
eraction
aspects, and evaluate the overall role of the tool and impact to cognitive =
science.

Contributions will be in the form of

* FULL PAPERS between 12 and 15 pages for submission (and between 12 and 16=
 pages
  for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* SHORT PAPERS between 6 and 8 pages for submission (and between 6 and 9 pa=
ges
  for post-proceedings camera-ready).
* PRESENTATIONS extended abstract up to 4 pages, which will be included in =
the
  pre-proceeding but not published in the post-proceedings.

&quot;Short papers&quot; and &quot;Presentations&quot; can discuss new idea=
s which are at an early
stage of development and which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated.

The program committee may reject papers that are outside these lengths on t=
he
grounds of length alone.

Submitted papers will be refereed for quality, correctness, originality and
relevance. Notification and reviews will be communicated via email. Accepte=
d papers
(both &quot;Full papers&quot; and &quot;Short papers&quot;) will be include=
d in the workshop programme and
will appear in the workshop pre-proceedings as well as in the LNCS post-pro=
ceedings.
Pre-proceedings will be available online before the Workshop.
