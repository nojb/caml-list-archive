ICFP'19 -- FIRST CALL FOR STUDENT VOLUNTEERS
============================================

ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the
latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of
functional programming. The conference covers the entire spectrum of work,
from practice to theory, including its peripheries. In order to smoothly
run the conference, associated workshops, and tutorials, we need student
volunteers to help out on the practical aspect of the organization. All the
events associated with ICFP'19 will take place from Sun 18 - Fr 23 August
2019 in Berlin, Germany.

The student volunteer program is a chance for students from around the
world to participate in the conferences whilst assisting us in preparing
and running the events. In return, volunteers are granted free registration
to the conferences, tutorials, workshops, and panel, and a ticket for the
banquet.

As an ICFP 2019 Student Volunteer, you will interact closely with
researchers, academics and practitioners from various disciplines and meet
other students from around the world.

Job assignments for student volunteers include but are not restricted to:
assisting with technical sessions, workshops, tutorials and panels,
checking badges at doors, operating the information desk, providing
information about the conference to attendees, helping with traffic flow,
assisting with accessibility accommodations, and general assistance to keep
the conferences running smoothly.

Please note that Student Volunteers are responsible for their own travel
and accommodation arrangements. However, Student Volunteers are compensated
for the following things.

* A complimentary conference registration, offering access to all open
sessions (i.e., parallel paper presentations, demonstrations, and
workshops) and conference proceedings.
* Free lunches and refreshments during breaks.
* Student volunteer garments.
* Free admission to all social events.

Furthermore, Student Volunteers can apply for extra funding from SIGPLAN
PAC funding when eligible.
