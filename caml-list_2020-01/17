KR Doctoral Consortium Call for Applications
September 12-18, 2020
Rhodes, Greece
https://kr2020.inf.unibz.it/

The 17th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning (KR 2020) invites PhD students to apply for
the Doctoral Consortium program.

1) AIMS AND SCOPE

The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a student mentoring program bringing
together PhD students and senior researchers from the area of KR. The
aims of the consortium are:

* to provide a forum for students to present their current research, and
receive feedback from other students and senior researchers;
* to promote contacts among PhD students working in similar areas;
* to support students with information and advice on academic, research,
and industrial careers.

The DC is intended for PhD students who have a specific research
proposal and some preliminary results, but who have sufficient time
prior to completing their dissertation to benefit from the consortium
experience. Preference will be given to students satisfying these
criteria, but well-motivated applications from students who are at
earlier or later stages of their doctoral studies will still be
considered.

For accepted students there will be a row of dedicated events, including
DC invited talks on research practice, a lightning talk session, a
poster session, and a mentoring lunch. Each student will be given ample
time to present their work and therefore be able to fully benefit from
direct feedback from the assigned senior researcher mentor and the wider
KR conference audience.

2) APPLICATION SUBMISSION

Applications must be submitted by email. Each application must contain
the following elements combined into a single PDF document.:

(1) Thesis summary. A description of the problem being addressed, your
motivation for addressing the problem, proposed plan of research, the
progress to date (what you have already achieved and what remains to be
done), and related work. It must be four pages maximum in AAAI style
(http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php).
(2) Curriculum Vitae. A description of your background and relevant
experience (research, education, employment), of two pages maximum.
(3) Letter of recommendation. A letter from your thesis advisor that
states that he/she supports your participation in the DC.
(4) Indication of whether a sponsored studentship is requested, and if
so, whether the student volunteers to help with local organization
during KR, DL, and NMR.
(5) Optionally, a suggestion of up to 5 potential mentors with similar
research interests, who could give good advice on technical aspects
related to the work, and/or career opportunities.

The selection process will consider the quality of the submitted
proposal and the stage of the student's PhD project.

Doctoral students who submit to the DC are permitted to have previously
published on their research, and are encouraged to submit papers to KR
2020 and associated conferences and workshops.

3) IMPORTANT DATES

Application deadline: May 6, 2020
Acceptance notification: May 27, 2020
Doctoral Consortium: September 12 - 18, 2020 (TBC)
