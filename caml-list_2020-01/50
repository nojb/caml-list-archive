Subject: [Caml-list] (dune/opam) Proper way of vendoring a library inside an
 application?


Dear fellow OCaml users,

I am trying to figure out how to "vendor" (embark) a private
copy of a library inside a project. (Concretely, I would like
to vendor Fix inside Menhir.) I want this fact to remain
invisible, that is, installing Menhir should not result
in installing or upgrading the user's public copy of Fix.

I have copied the source tree for Fix inside the source tree
for Menhir, and added a (vendored_dirs fix) stanza in Menhir's
toplevel "dune" file.

Compilation works fine, but installation does not seem to work
the way I wish:

* "dune install" installs Menhir *and Fix*, though I would like
   it to install Menhir only.

* Attempting to pin Menhir using "opam pin" fails because opam
   cannot find Fix (inded, Fix is not globally installed).

I have tried removing (public_name fix) from fix/src/dune, but
then the compilation of Menhir fails (Fix cannot be found).

I am confused... what's the proper way of embarking a private
library inside an application without installing it globally?

Thanks!
