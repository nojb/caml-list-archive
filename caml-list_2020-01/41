Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] New release of Menhir (20200123)


Dear OCaml & Menhir users,

It is my pleasure to announce a new release of Menhir, the LR(1) parser
generator.

   opam update
   opam install menhir
   opam install coq-menhirlib # if you wish to use menhir --coq

There are no new features, only a significant change in the manner in which
Menhir is built:

* Menhir is now built and installed by dune. This should make life 
easier for
   Menhir's developers: in particular, `make test` and `make speed` can 
be run
   straight away and do not requiring installing Menhir first. This 
should also
   make compilation much faster on multi-core machines. (Contributed by 
Nicolás
   Ojeda Bär, to whom many thanks are due.)

* There used to be a distinction between two slightly different ways of
   installing Menhir, namely with and without `ocamlfind`. This distinction
   disappears. The command line switch `--suggest-ocamlfind` is deprecated
   and causes Menhir to print `false`.

We hope that these changes do not break any of the code that relies on 
Menhir
today. Please report any problems that you might encounter. Happy hacking!

Best regards,
