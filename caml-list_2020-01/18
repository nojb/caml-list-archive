CALL FOR PAPERS 

KR 2020 -- RECENT PUBLISHED RESEARCH TRACK 

A special track of the 17th Conference on Principles of Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning (KR2020) 

September 12-18th, 2020
Rhodes, Greece 

------------------
Important Dates
------------------
Submission deadline: 15 June 2020
Notification: 13 July 2020
Conference dates: 12--18 September 2020
------------------ 

Web site:
https://kr2020.inf.unibz.it/page/recent_published_research_track 

(For the KR 2020 web site see https://kr2020.inf.unibz.it/ and for the
KR 2020 CFP see https://kr2020.inf.unibz.it/page/call_for_papers.) 

We invite submissions of abstracts of papers previously published in
journals and conference proceedings for the Recent Published Research
Track. The track is designed to provide a forum to discuss recent
research on topics related to KR that may not be immediately familiar or
easily accessible to the KR community. The track seeks papers that fall
into one or both of the following two categories: 

1) Papers that
-- connect KR to other areas of AI and to other areas of computer
science such as database theory, game theory, social choice, logic and
philosophy;
-- connect KR to areas that make use of KR, such as multi-agent systems,
planning, natural language understanding; or
-- go beyond the commonly-understood boundaries of KR. 

2) Papers that are strongly related to KR and
-- have been published in journals but have not been presented at
workshops or conferences;
-- have been presented at workshops or conferences that are not
typically attended by the KR community; or
-- have been accepted at general high-profile AI conferences such as
IJCAI, ECAI, or AAAI, where the time allotted has not allowed for full
discussion of all key aspects of the paper. 

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES: 

Authors should supply the following materials: 

-- A cover page (single page) listing the title, the authors, a full
reference to the original paper, and a public or privately accessible
url from which the paper can be downloaded. 

-- A one-page (preferred) and no more than two-page extended abstract of
the paper following the format for regular paper KR 2020 submissions.
The abstract should present the main contributions of the paper, discuss
the relevance of the paper to KR, and explain the significance of the
results. 

A single pdf file with the materials should be submitted to the KR
submission site at EasyChair: 

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kr2020. 

The authors should mark the submission as Recent Published Research. 

Submissions must meet the following criteria: 

a. Candidate papers must have been published in a journal or a
conference proceedings in 2018 or later.
b. Papers that are in press may be submitted as long as the final
camera-ready version is available.
c. Extensions of papers that have been previously presented at a KR
conference are not eligible for this track. 

Extended abstracts of the accepted papers will be linked from the
conference web site. 

Authors of accepted papers will present their work, focussing on its
significance and relevance to KR. Significant time will be allocated for
discussion of the interdisciplinary aspects of the work and its
potential impact on the future research opportunities for KR. 

For any questions regarding suitability of a submission or of any other
aspect of the track, please email the special track program co-chairs:
