I have already nearly forgotten about this problem: I use the "ile"-tool
(input line editor - some age old piece of software) as "wrapper" around
the OCaml-toplevel, which gives me all these nice features back. Works with
just about any terminal program!

For those of you who don't have it yet, I have put a link to the
source-tarball into Gerd Stolpmann's link database (name: ILE):

  http://www.npc.de/ocaml/linkdb

After compilation, just start it with "ile ocaml" (even better: assign an
alias!)

Especially useful for teaching/demonstration purposes...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
