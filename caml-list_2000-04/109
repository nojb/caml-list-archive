	Code bloat can be expensive, however so can boxed values.

	Sure it does. But you are not thinking rationally. 
You're thinking emotionally. So try this: in doing your job,
you find a 10% productivity improvement. Not much eh?
Try _over_ an extra months holiday! Are you kidding 10% isn't
significant?

	It is for those who commission and pay for the code to determine
what their strategic goals are. We have code written in _assembler_.

	My employer isn't the user of the software but the puveryor of it.

	At present, the cost of C++ errors is much lower. That is because
the company employs a lot of expert C++ programmers. And only one,
nonexpert, ocaml programmer.
