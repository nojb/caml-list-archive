It is always nice to make a release on one's birthday.
So this is my real pleasure to annouce

                LablGTK version 1.00
                LablGL version 0.94
                OCaml-Classes for 3.00

They are all available from both Kurims and INRIA
        http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pub/lang/olabl/ocaml.html
        ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/bazar-ocaml/

Look for lablgtk-1.00.tar.gz, lablgl-0.94.tar.gz, and
ocaml-classes-3.00.tar.gz.

* LablGTK 1.00

This is an object-oriented interface for the GTK+ toolkit and GDK.
It makes heavy use of optional arguments and variants to make
programming easier.
All standard GTK widgets but one are supported, almost fully.
Many examples are included, thanks to Hubert Fauque, Koji Kagawa, Jun
Furuse and Ken Wakita.
In particular there is an embryo of RAD, and a frontend for Unison.

Along with many bug fixes and additions (the beta is removed from the
version name), and a few cosmetic changes, this new version also
includes Win32 support, for those who like/need it.

* LablGL 0.94

This is a type safe interface to OpenGL and Mesa.
It can be used in combination with both LablTk and LablGTK.
No major changes in this release, whose main goal is to adapt to 3.00
label syntax.

No explicit Win32 support, but this should be straightforward for
anyone who needs it.

* Ocaml classes 3.00

This is a set of 9 modules, containing wrapper classes for the
standard library modules Buffer, Genlex, Hashtbl, Map, Queue, Stack
and Stream.
