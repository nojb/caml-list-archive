Hello,

Like other libraries, CamlImages library is updated for O'Caml 3.00
with a few additional features.

CamlImages is an image processing library, which provides 

	* basic functions for image processing and loading/saving 
	  various image file formats (hence providing a translation 
	  facility from format to format), 
        * an interface with the Caml graphics library allows to 
	  display images in the Graphics module screen and to mix them 
	  with Caml drawings, 
        * a freetype interface, integrated into the library: 
	  you can draw texts into images using any truetype fonts. 

        and some examples, including an image viewer using lablgtk library.

---

Changes
	* some bug fixes (maybe adding some more)
	* automatic deletion of swap files by the use of Gc.finalise
	* the class interface is revised
	* examples are rewritten for lablgtk-1.00

You can find the library at

	ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/bazar-ocaml/camlimages-1.01.tgz

and the information is available at its web-page:

	http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlimages/

Enjoy!
