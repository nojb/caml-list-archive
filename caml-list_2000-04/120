	So give them signatures! More precisely: it may be necessary
to _compile_ directories to get *.cmi files for them. This makes
sense, it is analogous to compiling a text file.

	I am making a simple suggestion: allow a directory
to work 'as if' it were a text file containing the contents
of the directory as nested module declarations.

	You are right then, that the compilation model would
require actually compiling the interface and module 'of'
the directory. The main difference is how the programmer
'edits' this module: it is by placing files in the directory
rather than with a 'text editor'.
