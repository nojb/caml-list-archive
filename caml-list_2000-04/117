I agree with that, as long as you are root on your computer, to install the
new "fat" runtime each time you add a new library.

In my view, this is a quite different issue. (And I don't see immediatly
how to do that type safely)

At this time, I am not at ease with the compiler/run-time code enough to
make so wide changes. But the structure of my patch allows that almost
without changes: I simply builtins primitives into the symbols database,
and as the symbol is already initialized, it does not load this fake
library.

I will try, but I have others parallel projects (I have written a binding
for the curses library, and I must then build on top of that a high-level
widget system).
