:-)

I take this "(by the book)" as friendly hint to improve documentation of
the sources - sometime...

At the moment I am not convinced that it is of much use to incorporate
Okasaki's purely functional datastructures into the standard distribution
"as is". Most of the modules lack crucial functionality - the primary
intention was to only demonstrate the most basic operations. It would
surely be nice to extend them, but what concerns me, I am currently under
too heavy workload (exam time) to start this... any volunteers?

Best regards,
