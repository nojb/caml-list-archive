 But stupid "industry" don't like TeX. :(
They wants HTML or somthing like that. Is there any HTML output
formatter for ocamlweb? Industry knows nothing about literate
programming, as well as about many other progressive technologies.

P.S. Maybe, all that we need, is a RAD tool for ocaml? It can
look like a better module finder ("module name" -> "file name" is not
a good idea. Paths in Java is much better), and a lot of reusable
modules for common tasks (database, GUI)...
