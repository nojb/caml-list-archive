I'd like to personally thank the ocaml team. I truly appreciate your
work. It brings me happiness and is catalytic in my bringing
happiness to others.

And to Xavier, don't take Max's whinging to heart. It seems to be
imbedded in his character. His posts infuriate me too, but it wiser to
shrug the sholders, move on and keep out of the mud. Perception and
cultural management of project mailinglists is extremely important in
developing a project community. This is something that haskell.org
have really done right. Haskell mailinglists have a general warm,
friendly tone that is highly conductive to discourse and
community. The moderation of caml-list tends to detract from this
sense of community and the complaining tone of Max's posts do
not help. However the correct anti-dote is to rebalance by injection of
unflappable warmth in the face of every adversity, because like it or
not, FP programmers are human beings and associate tone with substance
and attractive characters with attractive ideas. Btw, the ICFP99 write up
had perfect tone. Nicely done.

Cheers,
Julian.
