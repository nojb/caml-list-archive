	There is one major exception: interfaces.
There is often duplication, particularly with types.
I'd almost rather see _inline_ interface specifications.
(such as marking some symbols 'private', meaning not to put them
in the generated interface).

	I don't like this. It means a successful build requires the client
to know what to write on the command line.

	I found the interface unusable. The reason was simple:
the windows never went to the correct size. It is non-trivial
to get this right.  For example, I hate scrolling: the window should
adjust to avoid scroll bars within some sensible bounds.
