The problem is that the pseudo modules D1 and D1.D2 do not have
signatures (or better: they do not have a fixed signature)
because you can always put another module into the directory.

Would you allow then something like

module M = D1 ?

What is the signature of M? - M can occur in another signature,
making things complicated.
