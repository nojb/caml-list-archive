Oh, my - if I could already think as fast ahead...

This looks indeed not bad and wouldn't even clutter the language! Programs
with elaborate record fields would surely benefit - no more read
access functions required (saves work both in the implementation and
the interface!)...

I am now waiting for Xavier to use his feared backhand to play back the
ball with another overlooked problem... ;-)
