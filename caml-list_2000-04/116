There are some other problems:
*    RADs usually support just one language, maybe two.  But when a
project consists of combinations of sh, Python, Maple or Mathematica,
ocaml, C/C++ and some Tcl/Tk code, Makefiles are the way to go.
*    RADs are not programmable.  Makefiles can be generated.

I agree.  Using lablbrowser was quite pleasant, and there are no
annoying frills to get in the way.
