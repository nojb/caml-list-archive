Indeed, somebody had this idea in the LablGTK project.
There is a small glade interface that was running at that time.
This was even released in the first alpha version of lablgtk:
ftp://ftp.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pub/lang/olabl/lablgtk-a01.tar.gz

We just dropped it because what we want is something better integrated
with ocaml: the RAD himself, or at least parts of it, should be
written in ocaml, and for such a goal having to interface the whole of
glade seemed more painful than rewriting it from scratch.

The radtest included in lablgtk-1.00 has an interface very similar to
glade, the only real difference being that you drag and drop to the
tree structure of your window rather than directly on the window
itself. This allows more subtle editing.  What it really lacks is
widgets: only 12 of them are currently available, and with only few of
their options.
