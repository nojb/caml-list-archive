Subject: Industrial use of Caml 

Dear sir,

[...]

I would just like to let you and your team know that we use
the CAML dialect (v2.4) in the development of some of our
production software here at WebCriteria. We are an Internet
startup of about 30 people (6 programmers) and provide a
service for the automatic reviewing of the User Experience
on Websites. 

We use CAML to program the core modeling and analysis module
within our data center. CAML has proven to be a very effective
and efficient programming language for the construction of
this part of the product. We have constructed a Model Human 
Browser based on the GOMS modeling system in combination with
graph theoretic analysis.

My use of CAML was inspired by Andrew Tolmach, a professor at
PSU and OGI in Portland, Oregon, USA.

Please express my deepest appreciation to your team for the  
development of a language that can support an industrial
application. We benefitted from it's ability to quickly and
concisely express a solution to a difficult problem. Although
we base most of our command and control software in Java, ML
is still the choice for modeling and graph theory. 

Best regards, Chris

I also express my personal ``deepest appreciation to the Caml team''
for our great language that can support hairy academic programming as
well as industrial developments.
