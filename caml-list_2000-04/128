	Thanks!
 
	A comment on the documentation for the integer types.
What does '32 bit integer' mean? What is the meaning of
'bitwise or'? It is _necessary_ to say something like

	'implements an integer with 32 bit twos complement
representation' for either of these statements to be meaningful,
that is, to establish a mapping between an array of 32 bits,
and an integral value.
