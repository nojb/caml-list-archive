Having recently read Chris Okasaki's book by the same name, and noticed
that there is 3rd party ocaml code for the book, I'd like to request
that a version of this code be distributed with the standard library
(or at least the standard distribution), as:

        1) The library is well documented (by the book)
        2) The routines are fast and of varying flexibility
        3) The complixity and other behavior is well analysed
        4) Chris's book contains haskell and sml97 code. A
           similar library in ocaml makes it much easier to
           move to and from ocaml.

Cheers,
Julian.
