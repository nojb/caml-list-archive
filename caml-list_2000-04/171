When ocaml-2.99 came out I tried to pick up idioms with polymorphic
variants from the lablgtk sources and I was very confused by this
ambiguity.

As you said, the lowercase polymorphic variants appeared to be used
more like types and the uppercase polymorphic variants appeared to be
usd more like sum types.  However, the lowercase polymorphic variants
were not mentioned anywhere ...

I'm not complaining about lack of documentation, but I want to point
out that such ambiguities make it hard for novices (it's my fault,
that I hadn't studied olabl before, of course) to pick up proper
idioms in a programming language.

Cheers,
