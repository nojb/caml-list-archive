	I do not think this is a waste of time.
I think it is important for people who are in industry to tell
the ocaml team what they think. This is no religous war: the readers
of this list all like ocaml :-)

	Furthermore, because it supports object orientation and
imperative style -- as well as throwing in ( .. he ducks quickly .. )
functional stuff, one cannot throw the 'functional language are XXXX'
argument at ocaml. It ISN'T a functional language.
