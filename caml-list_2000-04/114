I use ile on Solaris and that fixes that. There is an OCaml line editor
"ledit" which has this functionality too, but seeing as there is now 
version skew between CamlP4 and OCaml that may not work for you, as it 
uses the Righteous syntax.

BTW, I'd also like OCaml to be faster in general than C++ (and Fortran and 
hand coded assembler :-) but I don't buy the claim that 10% is significant 
for most applications. In general, OCaml is far faster than C++: to write 
and debug. Thats the reason I use a high level language. Debugging C++ is
no fun, especially those crazy error messages that heavy template usage 
seems to bring.
