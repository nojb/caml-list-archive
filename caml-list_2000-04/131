Very nice indeed, but...

The binary RPM package for RedHat 6.1 seems to be incomplete, the whole
lib tree is missing - both compiler and interpreter complain about not
finding pervasives.cmi. The RedHat 6.0 package is not accessible at all
from the website. (I've not checked the other packages.)

I'm really looking forward to trying out the fixed version,
