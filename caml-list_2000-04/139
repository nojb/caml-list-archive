It would be really great if there were a translation to English (and other
languages)! May I suggest that we express our interest to O'Reilly so that
they see that there is a large number of people who would like to purchase
such translations? The (relative) lack of books is surely one of the
reasons that OCaml is not (yet) so widespread.

The e-mail address of the French branch seems to be:  france@oreilly.com

I am not sure, but maybe this address is better:

  nuts@oreilly.com     - for general questions and information

I'll try the latter one (the "nuts" in it appeals to me ;-)...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
