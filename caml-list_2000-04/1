I agree with John Skaller on this. Two libraries seems like a better
compromise than two modes. There is also some precedent here in that 
the standard libraries were never "OO-ized" after an object system was 
added to Caml. 

There just doesn't seem to be a good solution to this problem, i.e., one
which will leave everyone happy. This is the human engineering part of
programming language design, and since it appears a lot of Caml programmers 
find labels too heavy for their programming style I think we should go
with the rule "When in doubt, leave it out". Out of the standard library
that is. I'm not happy with this, as I prefer the labeled style, but it 
appears that the community is already somewhat split. 

Of course, some people may complain (as Jacques suggested) about the
labels in certain libraries infecting their code if modern/labeled mode
became the only mode but I think that's a minor problem that can be solved 
by those people by writing wrappers.

Yes, it's certainly not a solution that makes you slap your head and go 
"Why didn't I think of that?" but it seems to be an improvement.
