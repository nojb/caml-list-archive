Hello Caml'lers,

After more than one year, the O'Caml link database contains now
over 40 links to libraries, applications, Mom's little helpers
and other contributions of O'Caml users. While the baby grows,
the expectations get bigger as well, and so I am happy that I
can announce a new, completely revised version of the database.

The entries contain now much more attributes than before. Most
interesting, the entries can be assigned to one or several groups
of related software (e.g. "Network libraries", "String processing",
and so on). A new listing page shows the entries sorted by group.

Furthermore, it is now allowed to report software written
by other people. These entries are distinguishable from original
entries maintained by the authors themselves; i.e. the original
entries are listed together with a clef sign showing everybody
that the composer him/herself entered the record.

Last but not least, the user interface had a face lifting. There
are nice graphical elements, and the storyboard has been revised,
too. Of course, there is still a version for text browsers.

You find the new database at the same location as the old:

	http://www.npc.de/ocaml/linkdb/

Nobody is perfect. There may be still "funny behaviours" and other
things to improve. Please contact me in such cases.

A lot of fun,

	Gerd
