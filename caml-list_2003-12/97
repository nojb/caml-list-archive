Good news:
The server in question is the main CVS/Bugzilla server for the Cornell 
University CS department (http://bugzilla.metaprl.org/ is just a 
shortcut that redirects to http://cvs.cs.cornell.edu:12000/bugzilla/) 
that I've set up a few years ago. It is currently administered by 3 
people (me, a Cornell grad student and a Cornell CS department computing 
facilities staff member) with at least 2 more having root access, but 
not participating in day-to-day maintenance. As far as I understand, the 
department is pretty much committed to maintaining the server as long as 
it is needed by people at Cornell.

Bad news:
So far I do _not_ know whether Cornell would be willing to commit to 
maintaining the OCaml side of Bugzilla, but if there is serious interest 
from the OCaml team in doing this transition, I will do my best to find 
out (I would imagine it would require finding a faculty member at 
Cornell willing to "sponsor" the project; hopefully this would not be 
too hard).
