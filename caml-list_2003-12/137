I got hooked on Caml just by re-writing a lot of the utilities we had at
work written in perl/shell in Caml. It won't teach you the higher-order
functional aspects of caml but it will give you and instant gratification=

in terms of results.

I learnt a lot about the std libraries by doing this - and it felt quite
good to get something that was so much faster than the original in 1/2 as=

many lines typically.

Then moved to writing slightly larger pieces, (well I'm at a investment
house) so wrote this com+ component with nicholas cannase's stuff on wind=
ows
for excel. (much nicer than VB!)

That's it so far. I guess I've not really learnt proper functional progra=
mming
but I'm moer productive at work and I know a bit of Caml.

Have fun though.

>Hi all. I've just subscribed to the list (most redundant sentence
ever) so I'm dropping the first question. Are there any tutorials or
books available for download (english or spanish) besides Michael
Mauny's "Functional Programing using Caml Light"
>and the OCaml 3.07
Reference Manual itself?

Besides that, what was your first project using Caml? I'd like to
start mine, so maybe you can give advice about the kind of project
most suitable for learning.

What I've seen about Caml has wet my a
>ettite and I'm sure I'll be
starving soon :) It promises being the elegant and powerful language I
was looking for. I've been using C/C++, Delphi, Lua, Java, Ruby, PHP,
etc. last years and I was starting with Python lately, but I got in
touch with 
>aml and I think we're going to keep together for a while
:)

Cheers, and please excuse my english.
