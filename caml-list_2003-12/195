Is there a deep reason why the compiler is fussed by unmatched quotes
appearing in comments, ie: (* " *) ?

I have a problem where tuareg-mode is getting confused by a quote
character, in fact in this line:

 let chars = ['\\';'/';':';'*';'\'';'"'] in

and I can fix tuareg-mode by adding (* " *) at the end of the line,
but then the compiler barfs. So the only way to work around the
tuareg-mode bug would seem to be to actually alter the code itself,
which is not what I want to do.

It seems better all round if the compiler treated comments as
comments, ie. ignoring them.

Rich.
