Hello Tyler Eaves,

Nice to know about you!

Error reporting is a big issue not just in OCaml but in any functional
language. A great deal of research is currently going on to better the
error reporting. As for a site where you can learn OCaml, to the best of
my knowledge, the online manual for OCaml version 3.07 at the site of
INRIA (the institute where OCaml has been developed) might be a good
starting point for you. The link is :

http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/

Other than this, I think it will take some time and practice to get used
to the syntactical issues like ";;" for ";".

Best of Luck in learning OCaml!

Regards,
Jayanta Kumar Nath.
