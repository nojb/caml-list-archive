Hello, David.

DB> The revised syntax to ocaml attempts to provide an cleaner, more

  Quite interesting, and maybe it is true, but I have more simple theory.
  First time I knew about revised syntax only when started to write
camlp4-extensions, and at that time I've used caml about one year.  No
any note, nor even small remark about revised syntax was seen before
reading camlp4 documentation.  Larry said right about impatience, lazyness
and hubris:  most of us are too lazy to re-learn syntax of programming
language after using it enough time.
