Bugzilla is an horror to use, please don't.

In particular it's mail interface is totally unsuitable. It doesn't
allow you to post follow ups per mail, nor does the mails posted to you
by bugzilla seem very usefull to me (having loads of uninformative
header stuff for a line or two of content which will in fact be hidden
one or two screens down, and i browse with a full screen mutt client
with 50 or so lines).

Friendly,
