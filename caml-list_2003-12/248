I hadn't fully thought about it, but you're right that I should use it 
at compile and link time, tool.

_PACKAGES sounds good. I'll add it on a per-makefile and per-target 
basis.

No, and you're making me think I should just tackle the install stuff, 
too and get it over with. I do want to make things work without 
ocamlfind, too, though.

Yes, so many times I want to abandon the autotools for their messiness, 
but they always turn out to be _so_ convenient. I have yet to see a 
make replacement that is as flexible.
