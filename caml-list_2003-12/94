I have added a number of improvements to the pa_macro package that was 
added to camlp4 distribution recently.

The improvements include:
- Allow multiple definitions inside a single top-level IFDEF.
- Support INCLUDE directive that allows including "header" files with 
macro definitions.
- Support "local" (not just top-level) macro definitions.
- Support a "NOTHING" macro that allows for optional expressions and 
function arguments.
- Descend (instead of skipping) into "try..with..", "do" and function 
expressions when substituting for macro arguments.
- Allow omiting "ELSE" branches in expressions.
- Use a more descriptive "ENDIF" instead of "END" at the end of 
"IFDEF"/"IFNDEF"
- Other minor improvements.

The new pa_macro package can be downloaded/browsed at 
http://cvs.metaprl.org:12000/cvsweb/metaprl/util/pa_macro.ml?only_with_tag%3Docaml_3_07 

You can also see the patches responsible for individual new features at 
the above location.

P.S. I have filed PR #1901, PR #1902, PR #1904, PR #1905, PR #1907 and 
PR #1908 asking for these changes to be accepted into the mainstream 
distribution.
