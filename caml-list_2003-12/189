It is not safe.  The finalization function is called right in the
middle of the GC, and executing some ML code at that point, even in
another thread, is going to result in a disaster.

I guess you should defer the blocking operations by pushing them into
a queue, and perform them after the GC is done (or in another thread).

Note that the contents of the finalized block itself is destroyed as
soon as your finalization function returns, so you should make a copy
of the data you need.
