Gack. Yet another misleading analogy with human languages? I think Wirth was
right when he said we shouldn't call them programming languages.

Stefano is correct, but doesn't go far enough. The reason many of us who like
Revised better don't use it is that we don't work in a vacuum, but we work with
other programmers, and use an existing code base. It's hard enough to get
programmers to learn OCaml, with such a small user community and (comparatively)
such a small amount of teaching material.

Also, it's not clear what's going to happen to Revised now that ddr left.

If I believed that, I'd be using Perl and C++ more than I do. Nope, I think
"hysterical raisins" and human laziness/inertia/risk-avoidance explains a lot.
