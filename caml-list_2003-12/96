Well, as the author of referenced link, I'm all for this :)  Must
be the Caltech background (I'm an alum).

However, some questions that I think may be relavent this being
used as a core Ocaml development tool.

How many people would manage this system?
Would it be just you?
What happens if you get tired of managing the bugzilla system?

For this to be considered, I think there'd have to be a way of
showing the longevity of the bugzilla repository.  No point of
putting effort into a bug repository to see it disappear later.

Which leads me to this thought:

It may be good to have a team of people that could manage this box.

There are a number of people setting up different resources on
the Internet for Ocaml (me for Mailman for ocaml-pxp and ocaml-i18n,
Gerd for Godi).  Most of the time its a single developer.  If
something happens to that person (loss of interest, lack of time,
etc), then the resource becomes stagnant, is hard to move to a new
site.

It would be good if there were some "community" ocaml boxes on the
internet that a team of people would administer for the good of the
community.  These boxes could hold mailing lists, bugzilla, be a
COAN (ala CPAN) repository, etc.

Management of the box could be done initially by people with
demonstrated experience, and then a voting method where good
work gets additional access to the repository.  This is similar to
the method where by new developers to open source projects get
commit access as their patches demonstrate good work and forward
the project.

The only thing we would need is some contributed hardware and
bandwidth, which sounds perfect for an educational institution :)

Best,
Blair
