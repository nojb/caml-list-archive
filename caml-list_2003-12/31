The release candidate for SWIG-1.3.20 is out!

SWIG is the "Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator" (www.swig.org),
a C++ header processor with support for classes, templates, namespaces, and
other C++ features.  The output is some C code and an ocaml module that
provides access to the C++ entities described by SWIG's input.

Objective CAML support has been greatly improved in this release.

Noted changes:

 - SWIG itself has improved C++ reading support in a number of areas.
 - Better support for scoped enums and classes in ocaml output.
 - Improved type checking and casting.
 - Support for NULL pointers as any type of pointer, and int constant zero as a
   NULL pointer.
 - Many additions to the camlp4 module, swigp4 --
   - Added 'as' and 'to' type conversion operators.
   - Added a convenient syntax for enum label literals.
   - Bool constants now work in C-style argument lists.
   - Uppercase method names now work without quoting.
   - Examples now all use preprocessing.
 - Design by contract support (SWIG as a whole gained this feature).
 - sizeof method on structs and unions.
 - module Swig allows you to link multiple swig outputs easier, and use them
   together.

 without, I thought, proper consideration."
