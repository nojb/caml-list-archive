Yeah, most assuredly.

First 6 lost lines, on what i am used to, there is a line about : 

  Please do not reply to this email: if you want to comment on the bug, go
  to the URL shown below and enter your comments there.

which kind of defeats the purpose of a mail interface.

Also, this is hardly readable. try to look at many such mails, and you
will notice that it is very difficult to read the actual content of the
comment, without concentration and effort, it doesn't attract the eye in
the middle of all the junk in the report, and this is actually the
important stuff, not the rest of it, so it should come first, with
actual spacing around the message for easier reading.

Have a look at the debian BTS, and then tell me that again. Here is a
bug opening mail from the debian BTS :

*** message start ***
Package: liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev
Version: 2.2.0-1

$ lablgtk2
Cannot load required shared library:
/usr/lib/ocaml/3.07/stublibs/dlllablgl.so: undefined symbol:
glMultTransposeMatrixd.
$

I'm using Debian unstable updated today from a mirror.
*** message end ***

and the reply-to is conveniently set to :

  Reply-To: ZHAO Wei <zhaoway@public1.ptt.js.cn>, 218823@bugs.debian.org

where 218823 is the bug number. A reply looks like :

Sure.

What version of the opengl libraries do you use ?

And you can easily access all of the data by going to :

http://bugs.debian.org/128679

And then, naturally, there is the email control possibility documented
at :

http://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control

> e can easily see the entire message in mutt, with a measly 40-row terminal.

Sure sure, but the point remain. The comment is hardly noticeable, and
you cannot reply to such a message.

Friendly,
