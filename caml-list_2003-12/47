Me too!

A similar issue is discussed on the ocaml-i18n list[0]. Basically I
requested that we make all ML files UTF-8 (assuming the locale is
UTF-8[1]). This way too you might be able to define functions with
Russian (or Chinese, or Japanese, or whatever names). The issue was
raised about how to tell the difference between a "lowercase" function
name and an "uppercase" variant name in Japanese :-)

[1] Or have a compiler flag, but there are reasons why having -u8
flags isn't a good idea.
