      2nd international Workshop on Higher-Order Rewriting 
        http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/HOR04/


IMPORTANT DATES:
  Mar 17 2004 : deadline electronic submission of paper
  Apr  9 2004 : notification of acceptance of papers
  Apr 23 2004 : deadline for final version of accepted papers

The aim of HOR is to provide an informal and friendly setting 
to discuss recent work and work in progress concerning 
higher-order rewriting. 

INVITED TALKS:
  Mark-Oliver Stehr   Hamburg (confirmed)
  (another person, to be confirmed)

TOPICS of interest include (but are not limited to):
  APPLICATIONS: proof checking, theorem proving, generic programming, 
  declarative programming, program transformation. 
  FOUNDATIONS: pattern matching, unification, strategies, narrowing, 
  termination, syntactic properties, type theory. 
  FRAMEWORKS: term rewriting, conditional rewriting, graph rewriting, 
  net rewriting, comparisons of different frameworks. 
  IMPLEMENTATION: explicit substitution, rewriting tools, 
  compilation techniques. 
  SEMANTICS: semantics of higher-order rewriting, 
  higher-order abstract syntax

PROGRAM/ORGANIZING COMMITTEE:
  Delia Kesner         Paris      kesner@pps.jussieu.fr
  Femke van Raamsdonk  Amsterdam  femke@cs.vu.nl 
  Joe Wells            Edinburgh  jbw@macs.hw.ac.uk

HOR'04 SUBMISSIONS:
  Abstracts between 2 and 5 pages. As HOR is meant 
  to be a platform to discuss ongoing research we 
  are also interested in abstract describing work
  in progress, or problems in higher-order rewriting.

PUBLICATION:
  The proceedings of HOR 2004 will be published as a technical 
  report of the Computer Science Department of RWTH Aachen. 

LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS:
  Juergen Giesl 
  RWTH Aachen, Germany 
  giesl@informatik.rwth-aachen.de
