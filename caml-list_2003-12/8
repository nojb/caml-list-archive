I'm having a problem with ocamldep being too "gentle".  I have a file
units.ml that is generated with extract_crc.  The problem is that
ocamldep gets run at the beginning of the make, when units.ml doesn't
yet exist.  ocamldep doesn't output the dependency on units.cmo and
units.cmx because it can't find the source file.

I know that ocamldep doesn't have any way of knowing which directory the
dependency is to be located in, so I'm really just looking for
suggestions.

Dave
