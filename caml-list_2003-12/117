There's a fix for this bug at http://www.fungible.com/stream_fixed.ml
and http://www.fungible.com/stream_fixed.mli.

It's bug 1284 in the OCAML bug-tracking system.

According to the benchmark given in the comments at the end of
http://www.fungible.com/stream_fixed.ml, my version is essentially the
same speed as the original.

Unlike the original version, it does not do type-unsafe efficiency
hacks.

The bug database at http://caml.inria.fr/bin/caml-bugs documents that
bug 1284 has been ignored without comment as of 9 Dec 2003.  My code
is a clean solution to a problem that has been reported repeatedly, so
I find that frustrating.  This looks to me like a clear signal that I
shouldn't bother sending them any other bugfixes.
