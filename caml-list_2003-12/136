Hi all. I've just subscribed to the list (most redundant sentence
ever) so I'm dropping the first question. Are there any tutorials or
books available for download (english or spanish) besides Michael
Mauny's "Functional Programing using Caml Light" and the OCaml 3.07
Reference Manual itself?

Besides that, what was your first project using Caml? I'd like to
start mine, so maybe you can give advice about the kind of project
most suitable for learning.

What I've seen about Caml has wet my apettite and I'm sure I'll be
starving soon :) It promises being the elegant and powerful language I
was looking for. I've been using C/C++, Delphi, Lua, Java, Ruby, PHP,
etc. last years and I was starting with Python lately, but I got in
touch with Caml and I think we're going to keep together for a while
:)

Cheers, and please excuse my english.
