 So far I have stayed away from the camlp4 revised
syntax, its just not as appealing to me. I tend to
think of the standard ocaml syntax as somewhat clean
and the p4 modifications as somewhat kludgey. Thats
just my opinion however.

 I havn't seen any compelling reason to switch. As
long as the core ocaml language isn't going to migrate
to it I don't see the point.
