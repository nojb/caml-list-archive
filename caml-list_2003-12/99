	I have a need to convert a ``string stream'' to a ``char stream.''  
It's a little unclear to me how I'd accomplish this.  This is the best 
I've been able to come up with so far, but I have to imagine there's a 
prettier solution:

let stream_convert source =
     let chunk = ref (Stream.of_string (Stream.next source)) in
     Stream.from (fun x ->
         try
             Stream.empty !chunk;
             try
                 Stream.empty source;
                 None
             with Stream.Failure ->
                 chunk := (Stream.of_string (Stream.next source));
                 Some (Stream.next !chunk)
         with Stream.Failure ->
             Some (Stream.next !chunk)
     )
;;

	Any suggestions?
