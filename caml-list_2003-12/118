Subject: [Caml-list] Long constant strings?

I want to create a long, constant string- by long I mean 64K characters 
(it's basically an 8-bit lookup table).  Needless to say, I don't a 64K 
long line (256K actually, as every character is of the \xxx, where x is 
digits).  So currently I'm building the string up as the concatentation of 
4K 16-character strings (each 16-character string fits nicely on a line).  
But looking at the assembly code output of this, I notice that it's 
concatenating the strings at run time.

Am I missing some nice way of doing this?  If not, is there any chance 
that a future rev of the compiler will recognize this idiom and 
concatenate the strings at compile time?
