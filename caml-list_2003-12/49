Nice idea. However, I think there are some problems. First, how do you
guarantee that the servers for the build instructions are all available?
Currently, there is only one critical dependency, namely on
ocaml-programming.de, but there could be mirrors. All other files (i.e.
the source tarballs) are already available on several file servers.
IMHO, collecting the build instructions at a central place is better
than a distributed system.

Another problem is that I want to have at least minimal control of
quality. That means that I want to ensure that a package does not do
something harmful, and that some minimum formal properties are ensured,
e.g. that the version number is increased when a new version of the
package is released. This is more work for me, but I think it is
important enough to be done.

It is already possible to get an account on my development server, such
that the maintainer can update the files himself (using the subversion
CMS).
