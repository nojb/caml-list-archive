This must be customizable during the bugzilla install or something, because I
get a lot of bugzilla mail and that's not been my experience at all.  A typical
bugzilla message starts with the url of the bug in question, then immediately
displays the comments that have been added to the bug.

Here is a recent (and very typical) bug mailing I got from bugzilla, identical
down to exact spacing:

*** message start ************************************************************
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11359





------- Additional Comments From john@milsson.nu  2003-12-06 01:10 PST -------
Is it not possible to use ncurses to stack dialogs? Just keep them there and
continue merging.



------- You are receiving this mail because: -------
You are on the CC list for the bug, or are watching someone who is.
*** message end **************************************************************

IMHO, it doesn't get any more concise than that, apart from maybe
cleaning out a few extraneous newlines.

I can easily see the entire message in mutt, with a measly 40-row terminal.

Cheers,
