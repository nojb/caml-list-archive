Of course, Gerd will be able to provide a better answer himself, but here
is what I learnt.

You're responsible for the whole build directory except the work/
subdirectory (cf "The build directory in detail" in README.devel). AFAIK,
all the information in README.devel are relevant to make a GODI package (I
cannot see anything about the developement of GODI itself in this file).

I suggest to start from an existing package of the "same shape". For
instance, if you want to package a library which is a binding to a C
library which may need to be installed, you can start from the pcre
packages (conf-pcre, base-pcre, godi-pcre). If the library is pure OCaml,
you can start from godi-pxp. If the library needs the OCaml sources,
start from godi-wlex.

You'll need to do "bmake makesums" in you fresh build directory to
generate checksums for the files to be downloaded.

You can test your new package with godi_console by adding a line to the
file available.current, before sending the .tgz file to Gerd.
