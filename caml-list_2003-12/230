It isn't generated with type unsigned int.  The read32u macro
in the attached file yields an int, not an unsigned int, because
(unsigned char) promotes to (signed int).  If I change "long" to
"long long" in the attached file and compile with gcc on x86 the
program prints "Bug".

This is your macro definition:

#define read32u() \
  (src += 4, \
   (src[-4] << 24) + (src[-3] << 16) + (src[-2] << 8) + src[-1])

Try adding a cast:

#define read32u() \
  (src += 4, \
   (unsigned int)((src[-4] << 24) + (src[-3] << 16) + (src[-2] << 8) + src[-1]))
