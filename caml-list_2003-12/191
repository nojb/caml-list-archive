Subject: [Caml-list] [3.06] Is there a difference in weak array implementation between
 the bytecode and native code?

I am looking for help tracking a Weak-related bug.

For couple of years already our group is having trouble tracking some 
very elusive bug. Once in a while (quite rarely) in some big Weak 
array-based code something goes wrong (we get a wrong value). Sometimes 
the bug is completely random - an identical run does not reproduce it. 
Sometime it is reproducible in a specific case, but whenever something 
changes (e.g. any sort of debugging code is added), it goes away. It 
seems that the bug only occurs in bytecode, but never occurs in native 
code. So far we've been seeing it only under 3.06 (there are some other 
issues preventing us from switching to 3.07).

I do not know whether this is a bug in our code, in OCaml code, or our 
code is making some assumptions about the OCaml runtime that are 
reasonable, but not true...

Anyway, I am wondering - is there some difference between the bytecode 
and native code in how the Weak module behaves (in 3.06)? Anything that 
could shed some light on why it is the case that we only see this weird 
bug under bytecode?

TIA!
