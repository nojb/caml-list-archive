Hi all,
I'm trying to write a simple parser (below) but I've problems parsing tag-like
keywords. Probably this is a problem related with the lexer. does anybody know
a solution that doesn't imply heavy modifications to the (Genlex) lexer ?

p

code:

#load "camlp4o.cma";;

(* this doesn't work and it's what I want *)
open Genlex;;
let s = "<foo>";;
let flexer = make_lexer [s];;
let s' = flexer (Stream.of_string s);;
let parse_input_line = parser
        [< 'Kwd "<foo>" >] -> Printf.printf "bingo !"
;;
parse_input_line s';;

(* this works, but I want < > !! *)
let s = "foo";;
let flexer = make_lexer [s];;
let s' = flexer (Stream.of_string s);;
let parse_input_line = parser
        [< 'Kwd "foo" >] -> Printf.printf "bingo ?"
;;
parse_input_line s';;
