	Actually, for me, it's that I've been spending time learning the base 
ocaml stuff and I get this strange feeling that camlp4 is an 
unnecessary extra chunk of language I'd need to learn.  From what I've 
been reading, it seems like I should probably get over that.  It's 
certainly not because I favor inconsistencies.

	Like with most things, I'll probably eventually start playing with it 
and wonder why I was so stupid to deny myself this great enhancement.
