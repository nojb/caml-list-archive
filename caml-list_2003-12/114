Workshop on
Practical Aspects of High-level Parallel Programming (PAPP 2004)=20
part of=20
The International Conference on Computational Science=20

June 7-9, 2004, Krak=F3w, Poland =20

AIMS AND SCOPE

Many applications of computing require performance levels attainable
only on parallel architectures. Such systems are now readily available
as their price/performance ratio continues to improve. The rapid
development of affordable hardware for parallel computing makes the need
to develop high-quality parallel software increasingly urgent.=20

Sequential programming has long benefited from high-level programming
techniques and tools that have made today's immense range of software
economically viable. Two decades of research into high-level parallel
programming (algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional
languages, such as Haskell and ML, or parallel logic and constraint
programming, parallel execution of declarative programs such SQL
queries, etc.) has produced methods and tools that improve the
price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of
target applications. Several emerging domains, such as Grid Computing,
are currently raising new issues. GRIDs offer tremendous computing
power. Nevertheless, this power is far from being effectively exploited.
In addition to technical problems related to portability and access,
Grid computing needs new programming paradigms.=20

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level
programming languages and tools (performance predictors working on
high-level parallel/grid source code, visualisations of abstract
behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors, high-level GRID resource
managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.), applications in all
fields of high-performance computing, benchmarks and experiments.
Research on high-level grid programming is particularly relevant.=20

TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

high-level programming models and tools for GRID computing=20
high-level parallel language design, implementation and optimisation=20
functional, logic, constraint programming for parallel, distributed and
Grid systems=20
algorithmic skeletons and high level parallel libraries=20
generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic skeletons
and high level parallel libraries=20
applications in all fields of high-performance computing (using
high-level tools)=20
benchmarks, experiments using such languages and tools=20

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two
referees. The accepted papers will be published in the Springer-Verlag
LNCS series, as part of the ICCS proceedings.=20

Papers (PDF file) should be sent to loulergue@univ-paris12.fr with
subject "[PAPP Workshop] Submission" no later than Monday 22 December
2003. We invite you to submit a full paper of 6 to 10 pages (A4),
describing new and original results. The submitted paper must be
formatted according to the rule of Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS). Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the
authors to register and present the paper. An early email with your
intention to submit a paper would be greatly appreciated (especially if
you have doubts about the relevance of your paper).=20

JOURNAL PUBLICATION

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop and extended and
revised versions will be published in a special issue of the
international journal Parallel and Distributed Computing Practices, Nova
Science Publishers (provided revisions suggested by the referees are
made).=20
