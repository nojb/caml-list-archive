The fatal part is that you can't reply to the emails it sends to you to
make a follow up, which makes it as little suitable as the current
system as far as mail interface is concerned.

That said, i just state my opinion on this, and state my dislike of the
web-based bugzilla BTS, dislike that many share.

The reality is that it is upto the ocaml team to decide on this issue,
and i doubt that they seriously consider changing the current system
that seems to work well for them right now.
