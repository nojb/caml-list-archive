So it seems :-)

My french knowledge is close to nil, but with the advances of
babelfish and creative reading, I think I was able to catch most of
that.

Well, like Xavier Leroy said at the end of the mail - *he* probably
isn't doing it. That doesn't mean there wouldn't be someone else crazy
enough to try :-)

And atleast I'm not dropping the investigation just yet. But expect no
commitment ofcourse, I might grow disinterested in the matter any
moment and just leave it. Or I might just settle for a workaround of
manually freeing the blocks after ensuring there are no external
references.
