Subject: Question about Objective Caml string constant syntax
Sender: weis

[I apologize for the lack of a French version of this message.]

I've noticed that both the Objective Caml toplevel and the compiler
accept the syntax

"part one\
part two"

for a constant string, but this is not documented in the "Lexical
Conventions" section.  Is this an undocumented extension, or did I
miss someplace else in the manual?
