Hello,

I am trying to build Caml on Solaris 9 for i386.

Here is my configure command line, which finishes fine:

./configure -prefix /home/dcj -x11include /usr/local/X11R6/include 
-x11lib /usr/local/X11R6/lib

I then "gmake world", which dies when trying to build graph.
It seems like it is not picking up the new location of the X11 
libraries, although they are specified

gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/dcj/src/ocaml-3.08.3/otherlibs/threads'
gmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/dcj/src/ocaml-3.08.3/otherlibs/graph'
gmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xlib.h', needed
by `open.o'.  Stop.
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/dcj/src/ocaml-3.08.3/otherlibs/graph'
gmake: *** [otherlibraries] Error 2

Any ideas about how to fix this?

Actually, I don't really want to do anything with X11 anyway...I just 
want to compile "unison" with command line only support.

Thanks!

Don
