   I'm having trouble dealing with breakpoints in OCamldebug. The

I can reproduce all the things you describe. I guess you hit some
location translation problem. You should file a bug report (the
ocaml maintains sometimes miss an email on the list).

The "info events Bignum" yields

    Module : Bignum
       Address  Character      Kind      Repr.
         14332         31  pseudo/fun     (repr)
         14480         50      before      14332
         14456         64      before      14332
         14408         95      before      14332
         14428        138   after/ret           
         15204        152  pseudo/fun      15224
         15224        168      before     (repr)
         14724        185  pseudo/fun     (repr)
         15192        208      before      14724

Could someone please explain what the kind and repl columns mean?
(The strings "kind" and "repl" do not occur in the debugger
manual.) 

As the numbers match one could think that the events at #50, #64,
and #95 are aliases for #31. Looking at the source, one could
imagine #50 and #64 being the same (function exit), however,
#95 should be very different from #31.

   What's truly baffling to me, though, is this: if I try to set an event
   at offset 185 (break @ Bignum #185) a breakpoint is created at offset
   168, the event before the one I requested. However, when I try to set
   a breakpoint at offset 208, I get a breakpoint set at offset 185!!!

This is indeed very strange.

   Then I started trying to set breakpoints at each event one after the
   other. That's when I began to see odd behavior.
   
BTW, why don't you use the single stepping feature, if you want
to break at every event?

Bye,

Hendrik
