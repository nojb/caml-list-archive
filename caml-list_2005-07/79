               Two Open Positions in the Trust4All Project
			               CWI, Amsterdam
						   The Netherlands


Position Description
====================

The Coordination and Component Based Software group in SEN3 at CWI
has two open positions for:

        (1) a postdoc for a period of two years, and 
        (2) a researcher for two years. 

Both positions are within the European (ITEA) research project Trust4All.
Industrial and academic partners in Trust4All collaborate in order to
realize a software technology that enables the component-based development
of trustworthy systems. In particular, the project investigates the
relation between dependability and security properties. The project builds
on the result of earlier ITEA projects Robocop and Space4U.The industrial
partners include Nokia & VTT (Finland), Fagor, Ikerland and Visual Tools
(Spain), Philips, Océ (Netherlands). Participating research institutes
include: Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Telematica Institute, CWI,
Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (Netherlands) and CSEM
(Switzerland). There will be regular project meetings that rotate among
the participating countries. More details & updates about the project
can be found at http://www.win.tue.nl/trust4all/

The activities under Trust4All involve both system oriented and
theoretical work, supervised by Prof. Dr. F. Arbab (www.cwi.nl/~farhad)
and Dr. F.S. de Boer (www.cwi.nl/~frb).  On the theoretical side, we
develop a compositional model of trust and the formal basis to allow
reasoning based on that model. On the systems side, we develop tools
to support validation, testing, and reasoning about trustworthiness of
component based systems.

The candidate for the postdoc position is expected to have a PhD in
computer science, with a strong background in Component-based software
engineering, software architectures, as well as maturity in formal
methods and their practical applications.  Project management skills,
teamwork and leadership, as well as the ability to work effectively with
academic colleagues and PhD students, are all important qualifications
for this position.

The candidate for the researcher position should have at least a master
degree in computer science, affinity and experience with component-based
software engineering, system development, and distributed systems
programming.  With proven performance and available funding, the
researcher may be offered 2 more years to complete a Ph.D.

The Theme SEN3 (http://www.cwi.nl/sen3) at CWI is a dynamic group of
internationally recognized researchers who work on Coordination Models
and Languages and Component-Based Software Composition.  The activity
in SEN3 is a productive, healthy mix of theoretical, foundational,  and
experimental work in Computer Science, ranging in a spectrum covering
mathematical foundations of models of computation, formal methods and
semantics, implementation of advanced research software systems, as well
as their real-life applications.

General information
===================

CWI is an internationally renowned research institute in mathematics
and computer science, located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The focus
is on fundamental research problems, derived from societal needs.
Research is carried out in 15 research themes.  More information about
these themes can be found on the website www.cwi.nl where you can also
take a look at our Annual Report. A substantial part of this research
is carried out in the framework of national or international programs.
CWI maintains excellent relations with industry and the academic world,
at home as well as abroad.  After their research careers at CWI,
an increasing number of young staff members find employment in these
sectors, for example in spin-off companies that are based on research
results from CWI.  Of course, library and computing facilities are
first-rate. CWI's non-scientific services to its personnel include
career planning, training & courses, assistance in finding housing,
and tailor-made solutions to problems that may occasionally arise.

Terms of employment
===================

The salary is in accordance with the "CAO-onderzoekinstellingen" and is
commensurate with experience.  For instance, the postdoc base salary for
a fresh PhD with no additional experience in scale 10 is around 2800
Euros/month, and for an experienced PhD in scale 12 it is around 4500
Euros/month. The current starting salary for a first year PhD student
is around 1800 Euros/month with an incremental raise for each subsequent
year.  Besides the salary, CWI offers very attractive and flexible terms
of employment, like a collective health insurance, pension-fund, etc.

Application
