I've gotten no responce to my concerns about setting breakpoints in OCaml 
code; does this mean that other people have also seen this behavior? Is it 
the case that the debugger can't set a breakpoint at some arbitrary event, 
or am I just doing it wrong? I really want to believe that there's a 
reasonable way to do this, because without one the whole breakpoint 
feature is rather useless.

Has anyone else observed ocamldebug misplacing requested breakpoints? If 
not, can someone try setting breakpoints in my code (included in a 
previous email) to see if there's something in there that's causing the 
problem? If not, I'm running Ocamldebug 3.08.3, which I'm pretty sure is 
the most up-to-date copy. Is there something wrong with my copy of 
ocamldebug?

Please help me try to see what I'm doing wrong, or at least let me know 
whether or not you've observed this problem in your code or mine. Any 
input on this matter would be greatly appreciated!
