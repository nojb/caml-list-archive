We have to be cautious here. For about three years I was involved in
evaluating technology for a large organization. Like most organizations,
about 1/3 of the development was your standard GUI entry/SQL querries.
Like most shops we wanted to pick something modern that was good for
apps as well as had a great GUI/SQL interface. Java worked well for us.
If someone came to me with and showed me a language that made 2/3 of
my developers more productive, I would be quite happy. But here is the
killer -- I have to ask about the other 1/3. We were trying to get away
from supporting multiple languages. Its a nightmare from a support
perspective. So my next question is about your GUI development
environment. Is it  as good as the others on the market? There are a lot
of  considerations that go into picking a language. With the execption of
scripting languages, tools play a big part in this decision as do other
factors.
