Well, Brian, you're clearly approaching the problem
wrong, because other people are bitching about how
stuff is easy in C and hard in Ocaml.

(I'm sorry, that interpretation was too much fun to
not remark on... ^_^)

Anyway, I agree with the sentiment. 

If you're having trouble doing something efficiently
in Ocaml that would be "so easy" in C, the procedure
is simple:

(1) See if you can think of another way.
(2) Implement it inefficiently
(3) If the inefficiency turns out to be significant:
(3a) See if you can think of another way.
(3b) Bitch.

If you haven't done 1-3a, then as far as I'm concerned
you don't have a problem.
