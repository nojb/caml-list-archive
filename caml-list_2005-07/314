                   CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND PARTICIPATION

                                 Workshop on
           MULTIPARADIGM PROGRAMMING WITH OO LANGUAGES (MPOOL 2005)
                               October 17, 2005
                             at the conference on
OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, SYSTEMS, LANGUAGES, AND APPLICATIONS (OOPSLA 2005)
               October 16-20, 2005, San Diego, California, USA



While OO has become ubiquitously employed for design, implementation, and even
conceptualization, many practitioners recognize the concomitant need for other
programming paradigms according to problem domain.  We seek answers to the
question of how to address the need for other programming paradigms in the
general context of OO languages.

Can OO programming languages effectively support other programming paradigms?
The answer seems to be affirmative, at least for some paradigms; for example,
significant progress has been made for the case of functional programming in
C++.  Additionally, several efforts have been made to integrate support for
other paradigms as a front-end for OO languages (the Pizza language, extending
Java, is a prominent example).

This workshop seeks to bring together practitioners and researchers in this
developing field to `compare notes' on their work--describe existing,
developing, or proposed techniques, idioms, methodologies, language
extensions, or software for expressing non-OO paradigms in OO languages; or
theoretical work supporting or defining the same.  High-level presentations of
position are welcome.

Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

  * non-OO programming with OO languages;
  * merging functional/logic/OO/other programs (language crossbinding);
  * non-OO programming at the meta level (e.g. template metaprogramming);
  * module systems vs. object systems;
  * OO design patterns and their relation to functional patterns;
  * multiparadigm and multilingual programming in the .NET framework;
  * type system relationships across languages;
  * theoretical foundations of multiparadigm programming with OO languages.

The workshop will consist of presentations with interspersed discussion
sessions, and longer general discussions of themes or topics derived from some
common element of subsets of presentations.  We expect the majority of the
participants to give presentations.

For authors of accepted presentations who require justification for travel the
organizers can provide official letters of invitation.


SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

Prospective authors are invited to submit abstracts, extended abstracts,
presentations, or full papers in PDF (greatly preferred), postscript,
Microsoft Word, or Microsoft Powerpoint.

Final versions of papers/presentations will be distributed at the workshop.

Submission to mpool05@c3.lanl.gov.

Other correspondence to kei.davis@lanl.gov.
