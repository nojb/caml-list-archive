Dear Colleague,

Please note that ICLP 2005 registration is now open. In fact, the
early registration deadline is not too far (July 31st). More details
can be found at the ICLP 2005 website:

http://www.iiia.csic.es/iclp2005/

Highlights include invited talks by Ian Horrocks, Peter Stuckey,
Francesca Rossi, a tutorial on "Inductive Logic Programmng,
Statistical Relational Learning and its applications" by Vitor Santos
Costa, contributed papers, posters, programming competition, panels,
conference workshops, and of course the Solar Eclipse that will take
place during the conference and will be visible in Barcelona (time has
been set aside during the conference to view the eclipse).

We look forward to seeing all of you in Barcelona.

Best wishes,

Gopal Gupta and Maurizio Gabbrielli
