The initial public release of the LablPCRE OCaml binding for PCRE is 
now available, providing access to the POSIX regular expression 
pattern matching API of PCRE (the latest "6.1" release of PCRE is 
currently supported).

With an emphasis on simplicity and ease of use, LablPCRE offers a 
small-footprint interface: four functions and a handful of public 
methods in a returned "regresult" object.

While I consider functionality to be largely complete, feedback on 
features or usability is of course welcomed... I especially encourage 
contributions to the supported build environments in the package's 
Makefile, and will integrate the common ones into future releases.

With a distribution incorporating pre-built Windows binaries, LablPCRE 
is released under the "new" BSD license, and may be downloaded here:
