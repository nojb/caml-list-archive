Thanks, dmitry - but this breaks as soon as the software is recompiled 
on a 64-bit implementation (AFAICT). :)

Yes, I use custom blocks when their functionality is needed - but here 
I really just want "opaque pointers"... I only need to store them in a 
Caml "value" and be able to hand them back across the Caml/C interface
