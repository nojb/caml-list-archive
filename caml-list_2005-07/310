Thanks, this is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping for! So the  
key points are:

1) Use the | and an empty alternative pattern to capture the "no more  
matches" case.
2) Use "as" and take advantage of expression sequencing to accumulate  
the matches into a variable (Buffer, in this case).

That makes perfect sense and now seems obvious. :-)

One hopefully final question: is there a convenient shorthand for  
saying something like "all printable characters except '=' or '['?" I  
assume not--that is, we have ranges (' '..'~') or we have variants  
('A' | 'B' | 'C'...) and that's it. I'm somewhat spoiled, I think, by  
Spirit in C++, and its notion of "character sets" and operations on  
them, so I can say, e.g. "print_p - '='" that that will match all  
printable characters other than '='.
