Your question is the same as "Would you use a char array instead of a 
string"? My answer is no. But string can only store chars...

BTW, I was talking about 'a array option, not 'a option array. You can use 
(mostly of) the implementation of Buffer, hence have the same 
efficiency... I don't understand your point about "efficiency". If you 
think that the Buffer implementation is not efficient, I may agree with 
you, but this is an algorithmic issue, not a typing issue. It has nothing 
to do with Obj.magic. Are you thinking about a specific implementation 
that you cannot do in O'Caml because of typing? If yes, tell us so we can 
help you get rid of Obj.magic if possible.
