Announcing the release of ocamldap 2.1.4, which includes bugfixes,  
and performance enhancements.

     The BER decoder sees probably its last significant performance  
increase in this release, however thats ok, because the increase is a  
quite large 2.5x speedup. To put this in perspective the bytecode  
decoder is now 10% faster than the first release of the native code  
decoder was, and is 14 times faster than perl's Net::LDAP.
