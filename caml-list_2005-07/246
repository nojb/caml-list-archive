Considering that you're the one who joined the thread by saying:

"This seems as good a time as any to delurk and jump on a soap box"  
and "The FP paradigm is intrinsically poorly adapted to the kind of  
large scale design concepts that concern most programmers.  Object  
oriented programming is a much better match,  not because of a  
conspiracy of commercial giants in the software tool business,  but  
because of intrinsic technical reasons.  Functional programming is a  
niche technology ideally suited to simple domains like language tools  
and formal methods.  It does not have much to say about complicated  
systems," I have to say that complaining about the style of others'  
comments here takes considerably bigger brass balls than I possess.  
Congratulations.

Best regards,
