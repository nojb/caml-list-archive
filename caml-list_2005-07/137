I don't think your message incites controversy. It is a thoughtful
apology of the metapattern of devising, documenting and teaching
canonical solutions to canonical problems. I recognize that this is
actually one of the fundamental ideas in Engineering as a whole.

This I would not like. Design is an eminently "artistic" activity: it
takes creativity. Applying patterns is a parrot's work. One my main
reasons for liking Ocaml is that the "general coding strategies" that
apply are do not produce the vast majority of my locs, but are usually
localizeable in a small bunch of lines in a module. This means that me
job is that of the artist, not that of the parrot. This makes me feel a
little less miserable for being a hacker ;)

It usually takes me a few minutes to explain a single "design strategy"
to a collegue. It takes a few more minutes to show an example. It might
take anywhere between a few minutes to the rest of his/her lifetime to
digest the idea. I wonder if this situation would improve, given
adequate literature and documentation.

Me too! ;)

The problem is not so much the lack of documentation, but the lack of
customers. The year of our lord 2005 is a very sad year for the IT
business, at least in Italy.
