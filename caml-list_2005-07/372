If I were to do this then it would be significantly cheaper to have entirely 
software rather than a book, simply because the distribution costs are so 
much lower for software.

I also think there is great scope for educational software which includes 
real-time 2D and 3D graphics but I'll put my money where my mouth is before 
advocating that further. :-)

What other OCaml-related educational software would people be interested in? 
DSL design?
