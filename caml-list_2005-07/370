I would probably recommend a B&W book, and some
examples and pictures online.  That way the pictures
and examples cost you nothing to distribute, people
can have a nice handy dead-tree copy, and other people
can see the examples and go, "I want to learn how to
do that..." and thus increase interest in the book.
