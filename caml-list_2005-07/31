Announcement and Call for Papers for the 17th International Workshop
on the Implementation and Application of Functional Languages (IFL'05)

September 19th-21st, 2005, Dublin, Ireland.
Website: http://www.cs.tcd.ie/ifl05
E-mail: ifl05@cs.tcd.ie

== Scope and Topics ==

The IFL workshops form a tradition that has lasted for nearly two
decades. The aim of these workshops is to bring together
researchers actively engaged in the implementation and application
of functional and function-based programming languages. They
provide an open forum for researchers who wish to present and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, preliminary
results, etc. related primarily but not exclusively to the
implementation and application of functional languages.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to
  * language concepts
  * type checking
  * compilation techniques
  * generic programming techniques
  * (abstract) interpretation
  * automatic program generation
  * (abstract) machine architectures
  * formal aspects
  * array processing
  * concurrent/parallel programming
  * concurrent/parallel program execution
  * heap management
  * runtime profiling
  * performance measurements
  * debugging and tracing
  * verification
  * tools and programming techniques

Papers on applications demonstrating the suitability of
novel ideas in any of the above areas and contributions on related
theoretical work are also welcomed. The change of the workshop name
adding the term "application", introduced in 2004, is to reflect the
broader scope IFL has gained over recent years.

== Contributions ==

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in
the draft proceedings (published as a technical report of the
Department of Computer Science of the University of Dublin) and to give
presentations at the workshop. All contributions must be written in
English, conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS series format, and not
exceed 16 pages.

or
http://www.springeronline.com/
               sgw/cda/frontpage/0,11855,5-164-2-72376-0,00.html

Papers must be submitted by August 26th as
postscript or pdf files through the workshop web page at
http://www.cs.tcd.ie/ifl05/.

All participants who give presentations at the workshop are
invited to submit revised versions of their papers for the
post-workshop proceedings. They will be refereed by the program
committee according to normal conference standards, and will be
published by Springer as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
series.
