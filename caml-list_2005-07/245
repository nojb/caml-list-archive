To be entirely frank,  I am put off by the style of your comments.
If you disagree with my answer to the subject of this discussion,
you should point the original poster to what you think is a
discussion of large scale functional design,  or present your own
explanation for why it doesn't exist.  I would be genuinely interested
in what you have to say.  But instead,  you have chosen to veer off into
rhetoric,  advocacy,  and ad hominem distractions.  I am puzzled by your
citing points about Erlang and concurrent variants of ML that sound
superficially to be relevant,  but which have no real bearing on
anything I said.  I disagree with the frequent use of this mailing list
to irrationally promote OCaml as a superior language to Java.  It is not
an advocacy forum,  and I will not be drawn into criticizing OCaml's
object system in this context.  When I crave irrational discussions,  I
visit slashdot.  I am disappointed that you have resorted to ad
hominem distractions,  projecting knowledge or "feelings" on me of
issues outside of,  and irrelevant to,  what I stated,  and which do not
represent my own feelings or anything I wish to discuss here.

In case you,  or anyone else,  is genuinely confused by what I said,
I will make a further clarification in a separate post.
