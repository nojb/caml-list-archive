I don't know whether there is a way to do this directly. You can split your 
range so that it avoids '=' and '[', or do something like this:

let printable s =
  let buf = Buffer.create 100 in
  let rec aux = parser
      [< '  ('=' | '[') >] -> Buffer.contents buf
    | [< '' '..'~' as c; x = (Buffer.add_char buf c; aux) >] -> x
    | [< >] -> Buffer.contents buf
  in aux s ;;

printable (Stream.of_string "path=/usr/src") ;;
--> - : string = "path"

Bear in mind that the '=' or '?' will be discarded by the parser. If you 
don't want so, you can use Stream.peek (but it's much more annoying).
