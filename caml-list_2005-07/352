Good heavens, no one here believes that!

Precisely.

Its just that it is way WAY ahead of Java and C++ in most domains,
and unlike many advanced academic languages, it has a reasonable
number of users, has been developed conservatively, and is
beginning to be used in RL (Xavier proofing required) industrial
applications.

For once many people would probably agree with me,
that here is a high performance advanced general purpose
proven industrial strength programming language --=20
there are few others that rate all those adjectives.
