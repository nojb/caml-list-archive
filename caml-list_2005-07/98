There are a wealth of resources related to object oriented design technique=
s
(which can certainly be applied to OCaml), but I've been pretty much unable
to find any good resources on large scale design of functional programs.
I realize that this is the sort of thing that develops over time with
experience.
Just the same, there is (most likely) a lot to learn and consider, and a=20
resource would be helpful. My recent uses of OCaml for fairly small project=
s
have been effective, but a lot of things were cumbersome in the design
and I suspect that I may be thinking about it wrong.
So, could anyone suggest a good resource or perhaps weigh
in on their thoughts on the topic?

Thanks,

Kyle
