I guess the reason is that I could not think of anything better. My
implementation of transaction calculus requiring polymorphic recursion
is of october 2003. I kind of remember a post from you on this issue,
but it must have appeared later.

I'm not sure recursive modules had been released at that time. 3.06 it
was, IIRC; whereas, recursive modules appeared in 3.07, right?

We have two instances of Obj.magic and and about as many instances of
Marshal.from_xxx. Not once have we escaped the segfault awaiting behind
the bend...

Actually, it is never for efficiency. The type-unsafeties are either due
to marshalling--there's little we can do about it at present--to
polymorphic recursion--I'll look at your proposal based on recursive
modules--or the classic set_cdr thing in a heapsort implementation on lists.
