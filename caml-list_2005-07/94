The AS/Xcaml is a mature project. We are using it to develop FreerP, a
full fledged ERP application licensed under the GPL. We are also using
it to develop GUI's to PLC applications for industrial machinery.

We have been using darcs for a while to manage the development effort,
but the sheer mass of the project has crushed the pathetic "patch
theory" Roundy declares to have concocted. I am gradually moving
everything over to arch, but I am not having time to breathe, and most
development tasks which are under my responsibility are stalling.

Anyhow, I'll ask my collegues to place a couple of demo applications on
our websites, for the joy of you all. We might also release a snapshot
of the current code, pending the availability of the tla repos.

Ernesto and Dome, do you think we can manage all this today?

Alex
