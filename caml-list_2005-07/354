Hi,

Skaller, that's one of the most sweeping generalizations I
have ever seen. Exactly what kind of games are you talking
about? The gaming industry is big - I believe the latest=20
numbers indicate that we're bigger than the movie industry=20
w.r.t to earnings.

I've been looking into O'Caml, and I've written some tools
in it (caml is great for tools), but here's a couple of points=20
against it:

1. It doesn't support console platforms.
	- The PC market is quite minor compared to consoles.
2. It doesn't support low-level constructs.
	- No SIMD (AltiVec/VMX) vector operations.
	- No explicit assignment of (bit and byte) offsets=20
	  within a record.
	- No explicit alignment specification.
	- No inline assembly.
3. There is no controlled real-time GC.=20
	- GC needs to run between frames,=20
	  and only for a controlled amount of time.
4. There is no real support for unboxed data-types.
	- This one is actually very important for consoles.

=46or game-code (AI, behaviors, etc.), it is better suited,=20
though the GC issue is there. But it doesn't support much=20
of threading - be it through pthreads or cooperatively -=20
which renders it unusable to us.=20

So in the end, ... ocaml is nice as a tool, but it is by far=20
not usable for the game console world. So, I guess we'll stick=20
with C++ for a while...

Thanks,

PKE.
