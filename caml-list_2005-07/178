You mean like this?

LablGL is excellent, BTW. You may find some of my work useful if you're 
learning it:

I think you will find OCaml to be dangerously well suited to this task. I've 
used OCaml for several somewhat-similar projects and find OCaml to be 
enormously more productive than C++ (my previous "favourite language").

I am working full-time on our presentation software so I can't afford any time 
to work on new stuff. However, there is probably some overlap and I am 
willing to open source some interesting and useful parts of our code.

That sounds like a great project. Best of luck with that. :-)
