This has already been discussed on the list--by me, actually. The common
opinion seems to be that it is very little effort on the caml-list
users' part to use the Reply-all button, or to change the address
manually. Apparently everbody is happy with the duplicate messages
generated by the former solution. The was also some discussion
concerning the drawbacks of changing the Reply-to field, but I cannot
remember the details.
