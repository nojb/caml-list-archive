Hello,

I have to announce version 0.2.6 of pftdbns,
a tool which is useful in sorting/listing/moving files.

It's name "pftdbns" is a short hand for "put files to directories (sorted) by name structure".

It takes filenames, maps each char of the filename into a char, representing
the charclass of it (a..z and A..Z -> "l" (letter), 0...9 -> "i" (integer" and so on)).

This yields to an easy way of sorting files by names, based upon file-naming
with certain filenaming-conventions.

So, for example  "hello.txt" and "ballo.txt" are part of the same name structure,
as well as "1001.txt" and "8251.txt" but also "8251.jpg" are of the same name
structure. For example "foobar.tex" and "foobar.txt" are equally structured too.

The default behaviour is to move files into directories. The names of the directories
are choosen from the string, which represents the name structure by default.



  NEW FEATURES/OPTIONS SINCE VERSION 0.2.6:
 -------------------------------------------

   -inv: inverted template filter: do NOT use the selected files (-tf option)
         but use all other files

   -ad: allow directories to be regarded as valid filenames
        Even if this option is helpful, and new, it also is
        DEPRECATED --> use only, if you know what you are doing ;-) 



  I also added (since 0.2.5, which also was for correcting errors in the
  documentation) a manpage (as *.man, *.ps, *.pdf) as well as now
  nice readable documentation of the source (created with caml2html).


I hope you enjoy this program, and I think if you have to handle a lot
of files, this will be very helpful.

You can DOWNLOAD the tool here:
    	ftp://www.belug.org/new/user/ob/Programs/Tools/pftdbns/ 

There also is a README in this directory, so that you can read more details.

A DESCRIPTION can also be found here:
   http://www.belug.org/~ob/ftp-area.html 

pftdbns can be redistributed under the GPL-license.

Best Regards,
     Oliver Bandel
