I've run into an interesting issue.  There's a bug
somewhere, but I've no clue whether it's in my code or
the library.

The code below *should* (I think) print the second
word in the text box along with it's location. 
However, when I run it with "foo bar" in the text box,
I get "(1, 4) -> foo" and I can't figure out why.  If
I run it with "foo    bar" I get "(1, 7) -> foo" so it
definately seems to be finding the location of the
second word, but not getting it correctly.  I've been
fussing with it, and can't figure out what I'm doing
wrong, if anything.  Anyone have any notions?


The code:
let rec printwords () =
        match Text.search
                ~switches:[`Regexp]
                ~pattern:"[a-zA-Z]"
                ~start:(`Atxy (0, 0), [`Wordend; `Char
1])
                text
        with `Linechar (l, c) ->
                Printf.printf "(%d, %d) -> %s\n%!"
                        l c
                        (Text.get
                                ~start:(`Atxy (l+1,
c), [])
                                ~stop:(`Atxy (l, c),
[`Lineend])
                                text
                        );;
