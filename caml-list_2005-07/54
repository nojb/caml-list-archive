I'm not aware of such a .lang and at the moment I'm not interested in
writing it. That said, writing a .lang is relatively easy and there are
a lot of examples in gedit (the more widespread application which uses
GtkSourceView), also monodevelop uses it and probably has an archive of
.lang files but I've never looked at them.

GtkSourceView support auto-indent and in LablGtkSourceView you can
enable it either from the constructor (?auto_indent param) or with
set_auto_indent. However the supported form of automatic indentation is
more limited than those found in emacs or vim. GtkSourceView indeed
support only indentation preservation (i.e. when starting a new line
copy the amount of indent of the last one).

On top of that implementing automatic indentation similar to vim's
smartindent (i.e. augment the indentation if last line ends with a word
in a given set, e.g. "then", "do", ...) should be relatively easy and I
plan to do it in next releases of LablGtkSourceView.

Cheers.
