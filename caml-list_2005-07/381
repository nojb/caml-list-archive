It seems that I am the one who is responsible for the hundreds of  
empty messages
received on the Caml list. I am very sorry.

Yesterday I changed of email adress (from something@irisa.fr to   
something@wanadoo.fr)
and configured my old  email account to forward my mails to the new  
account.
Then I used fetchmail to get all my old mail,  and all my previous  
mails that concerns
the caml-list seems to be a problem. I dont understand cos I am a  
subscriber of other
mailing lists, such as haskell, and there was no pb with those  
mailing lists.
So I unsubscribe to the caml mailing list hoping that the process  
would stop.

Again I am very sorry for the inconvenience.
