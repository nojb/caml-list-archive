Your points are very simply wrong. Functional design addresses the same
large-scale design problems that OO tries to address, and, in fact,
given cognitive compatibility with the mind of the developere, it offers
a productivity at least an order of magnitude greater on very large
scale projects (over 100klocs) where the dominant cost factor is code
maintenance. Ocaml's functional paradigm greatly stresses a priori
correctness via static type-checking, which we take advantage of to
achieve static verification of the Embedded SQL queries in our FreerP
suite of business applications. It is only thanks to the rich type
system in Ocaml that we are able to maintain coherence between a
database schema counting hundreds of relations and hundreds of Xcaml
server pages containing at least as many embedded SQL queries. Java
simply would not scale.
