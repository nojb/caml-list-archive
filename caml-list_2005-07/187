 > Hi list,

In addition to other papers mentioned on this list, there are two
unpublished papers that may have some value:

   Baudinet, Marianne and David MacQueen. 1985 (December). Tree pattern
   matching for ML (extended abstract). Unpublished manuscript, AT&T Bell
   Laboratories.

   Scott, Kevin and Norman Ramsey. 2000 (May). When do match-compilation
   heuristics matter? Technical Report CS-2000-13, Department of Computer
   Science, University of Virginia.

My paper with Kevin Scott has some tutorial stuff in it.  If you like,
I can try to dig out source code, but it's in SML and may not be so useful.
