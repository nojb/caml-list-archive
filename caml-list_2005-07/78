I'm having trouble dealing with breakpoints in OCamldebug. The 
documentation seems to make it clear that you can set a breakpoint at any 
event in your program, but ONLY at an event. This makes sense to me.

The problem is, in practice, I can't seem to set a breakpoint at an 
arbitrary event.

For starters, I used "info events Bignum" to get a list of events for 
my module (its name is Bignum). Fine. I get a long list of event points.

Then I started trying to set breakpoints at each event one after the 
other. That's when I began to see odd behavior.

I can set breakpoints at some events with no difficulty. For 
instance, "break @ Bignum #31" sets a breakpoint at offset 31 just as it 
should. With other events, instead of setting a breakpoint where I 
requested, the breakpoint is put at some earlier event. For instance, 
"break @ Bignum #50" sets a breakpoint at offset 31. This is odd, since as 
far as I know I should be able to set a breakpoint at any event. Usually 
this earlier event is the one right before the event I requested, but 
sometimes its as many as three events back.

What's truly baffling to me, though, is this: if I try to set an event at 
offset 185 (break @ Bignum #185) a breakpoint is created at offset 168, 
the event before the one I requested. However, when I try to set a 
breakpoint at offset 208, I get a breakpoint set at offset 185!!!

Either something's very wrong here, or I have a fundamental 
misunderstanding about how the debugger works with breakpoints. Any tips 
or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. For reference, the file I 
refer to in this email is attached for reference.

Thank you,
