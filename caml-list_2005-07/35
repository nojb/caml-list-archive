You probably have, but I'll ask anyway.  Have you checked the heatsink 
is seated properly and the case has suitable airflow?  I have a Athlon64 
3200 (Winchester) with a 6600GT in a room with a combi boiler in the 
cupboard and it's always bloomin' hot in here but the system never 
crashes and dies.  Mind you, it has a smaller cache and I don't live in 
Cambridge (unfortunately I live in damp dreach Glasgow).
