There are already lots of tail-recursive replacements for the List
module, most notably the one included in Extlib. So if you need to
handle very long lists you can already use them.

The common problem for all these replacements is that they are slower
than the original (non tail-recursive) functions, particularly for
short lists, which are the most frequent ones.

So there is no need to submit this code :-)

(But I wonder whether it would not be a good idea to include a
Safelist module in the standard library...)
