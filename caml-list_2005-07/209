We can begin acquaintance.! How are you? You single? And I'm single woman now. 
I'd like to find a friend in other country for corresponding. 
Would you like to communicate with me? I have been single for a long time,
I would be glad very much to correspond with you.
If you will answer me, then I'll send you more
photos and tell you more about me. 

I seldom use a dictionary, and have a good knowledge English. 

P.S. If you really are interested in acquaintance with me, 
do not overlook to send a photo of also.
