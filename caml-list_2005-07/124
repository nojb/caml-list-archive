I am painfully slow at putting up some code for the community to look
at. The trouble is that, although we are a free software company, we
tend to (find the time to) release our code only when we are paid to do so.

The Xcaml paradigm only partly solves your issues. It is aimed at
guarateeing coherence in a very large scale ERP application, which
implies that we have worked a lot on guarateeing static type safety in
queries. We have still not finished implementing the Xcaml2 API, which
will include proper static verification of HTML forms.
