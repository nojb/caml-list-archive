This exists, and is called camlp4.  I'm not sure which, if any, of the tools
that operate on .ml files doesn't "support" it via easy command line flags.

There is even a revised syntax shipped with camlp4 which has curried variant
constructors like Haskell.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of stuff in there I
disagree with, like extra bracketing of many constructs.

Here it is:

Forgive me if you already know of this and I misinterpreted your question.
