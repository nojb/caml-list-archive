Alex,

On your main page you state that ocamlnet and pxp need a patch applied, 
with OcamlODBC optionally being patched.  Since I like to use godi to 
install my packages, getting patches in there becomes a little harder.

Is there anyway we can get those patches into the official versions of 
these products so we don't need to manualy patch?

Regards,
Blair
