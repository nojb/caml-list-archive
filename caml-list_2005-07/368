Hello list,

I am announcing version 0.91 of the Netclient library. This library
includes a sophisticated HTTP client, a Telnet client, and (new!) an
experimental FTP client.

The HTTP client was more or less rewritten:

- The HTTP messages are no longer restricted to in-memory strings, 
  but can now also be channels. So large up- and downloads are now 
  possible. 

- Connection caching can now be more aggressive (i.e. connections 
  survive pipeline runs).

- The authentication framework has been rewritten. Digest authentication
  complies to RFC 2617. It it now possible to mimick browser
  behaviour.

- The client complies now fully to RFC 2616, the revised HTTP spec.

Of course, the old features have been retained (persistent connections,
pipelining, multiplexing, automatic reconnections, automatic
redirections, ...). There are a few incompatible changes in the API, but
all code I know works with the new version, too.

The FTP client is quite impressive, but not yet complete:

- Most RFC 959 features are implemented, including record files,
  EBCDIC, and block mode. The current version omits file uploads,
  however (only downloads are possible).

- Of course, the client supports multiplexing, so you can run
  several clients concurrently.

- There are issues about exceptions that limit production usage for
  now. Furthermore, the client needs testing against real FTP servers!
  (This is the main reason why it is included in this Netclient
  version.)

Download Netclient here (or update your GODI installation):
