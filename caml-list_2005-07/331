ADT's have traditionally been written in OO style. 
The thing that makes "OO programming" different from
traditional programming is that the same methodology
is extended to every component of the program. 
While yes, a stack with "push" and "pop" methods is an
ADT, surely a text widget is not, even if coded in
very much the same style.
