What you've quoted here is a direct and emphatic statement that what I
wanted to discuss is something I believe is a technical issue,  not a
conspiracy of large corporations, not an attack on a poster's
credibility,  not a claim that some broadly useful language is
horrendously bad,  not rhetorical deceptions,  not advocacy,  not ad
hominem diversions.  You didn't include it in your quote,  but I also
pointed out that functional programmers are prone to a counterproductive
form of advocacy and focus on low level issues and that they have
generally been unsuccessful at providing practical documentation.  I do
lament that,  and it is directly relevant to the original poster's
question,  but I primarily raised that point to underline that I believe
the lack of a "theory" of large scale design issues is not a result of
it.

You may disagree with me,  and you may find my statements provocative or
unsettling,  but you cannot claim that I attempted to use a game of
rhetorical deception,  advocacy,  or ad hominem diversions.

One point which might help clarify my attitude,  is that my hostility is
to advocacy on this mailing list,  not to any particular language or
paradigm.  Advocates of OCaml might misinterpret my hostility to
advocacy as a hostility to OCaml.  That would be quite off the mark,
but I do not see a good justification for further elaborating my
personal attitudes here.
