Because I wanted to test the breakpoint feature and see if it would break 
at any event I asked for  :)

That's the frustrating thing to me about this breakpoints problem, it's a 
serious thing that should be dealt with, but there are several other ways 
of more-or-less doign the same thing with stepping/goto and whatnot. 
Somehow that sort of belittles the problem where I feel it should be 
handled directly and taken quite seriously.

Oh well, I'll submit a bug report. Thanks for giving me some sort of 
validation  ;)
