Yes, well... I would count that as a point in favor of your argument 
that the community "is also inept at practical documentation and 
advocacy."  I think a really good introduction to monads for the 
practitioner, as distinct from the mathematician, would be a sign of 
growing aptitude for practical documentation and advocacy.

They're kinda hard to use in Ocaml, which my preferred functional 
language, so I don't think it would be a good idea for me to try to 
write such a thing.  It would be nice if somebody did.
