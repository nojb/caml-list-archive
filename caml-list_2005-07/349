I would have put that much more elegantly but, basically, I agree.

Never heard of Zork. Apparently you could get it on 8" discs. Have you seen 
Darwinia?

I have actually been thinking about writing an "OCaml for Games Programming" 
book. I think there is a lot of scope for interesting and unusual material in 
such a book and I think there are lots of possible examples which would 
demonstrate the power of OCaml for general purpose programming whilst also 
making wicked cool games. The downside is mainly the lack of state-of-the-art 
OpenGL bindings.

I think there is ample market for a games programming OCaml book but it would 
be difficult to sell it at a low enough price (again, I think it would really 
benefit from being full color). So I'm now thinking that it might be better 
suited to educational software rather than a book. Not least because 
on-screen 3D graphics would really help to explain things. When we finish it, 
Presenta should be ideal for this...
