Hello,

I have to announce version 0.2.8 of pftdbns,
a tool which is useful in sorting/listing/moving files.

It's name "pftdbns" is a short hand for "put files to directories (sorted) by name structure".

It takes filenames, maps each char of the filename into a char, representing
the charclass of it (a..z and A..Z -> "l" (letter), 0...9 -> "i" (integer" and so on)).

This yields to an easy way of sorting files by names, based upon file-naming
with certain filenaming-conventions.

So, for example  "hello.txt" and "ballo.txt" are part of the same name structure,
as well as "1001.txt" and "8251.txt" but also "8251.jpg" are of the same name
structure. For example "foobar.tex" and "foobar.txt" are equally structured too.

The default behaviour is to move files into directories. The names of the directories
are choosen from the string, which represents the name structure by default.

Since version 0.2.2 the default-behaviour of moving files can be changed
to only list the lilenames/namestructrues (and not moving them).



Changes in 0.2.8:
=================

Bug-Fix:
--------

  -inv option corrected!
         It didn't worked properly in version 0.2.6,
         because the filter function was stupid!
              

Source restructuring:
---------------------

Some changes in datastructures to have them more clear
and have a more efficient program (multiple/unnecessary
calls of the function "scan_string" removed).
This was done in the parts of the program, where the
file/template lists are build.




I hope you enjoy this program, and I think if you have to handle a lot
of files, this will be very helpful.

You can find the tool here:
        ftp://www.belug.org/new/user/ob/Programs/Tools/pftdbns/ 

There also is a README in this directory, so that you can read more details.

A description can also be found here:
   http://www.belug.org/~ob/ftp-area.html 

pftdbns uses the GPL-license.

Best Regards,
     Oliver Bandel
