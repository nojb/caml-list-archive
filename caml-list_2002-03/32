I have an undergrad thesis student who is working on a ``dynamic load
via http (including https) with local cache''.  She will be done by
May 1 (in order to graduate :-).

It will attempt to load byte-code versions if running in byte-code,
and the appropriate native-code versions if natively compiled.

We actually have even more exciting plans for this, but will hold the
announcement until we have things working.

Quite apart from the Windows compile problem, I don't think source
code is the right way to distribute code.  Distributing compiled
versions opens the potential for commercial (proprietary source)
libraries.
