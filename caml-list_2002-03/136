Is anyone using native threads in Ocaml 3.04 intensively on Linux these
days ?
I'm playing with a Gnutella servent, and I'm experimenting crashes
(bytecode and native).
I'm using the unix library heavily. So far, I'm aware that the DNS calls
are not reentrant,
but the rest of the library calls should be okay.

My "crashes" are weird... There is no core (ulimit -c unlimited, before
you ask).
The program "hangs", ps looks like this. Looks like a thread is stuck.

18964 pts/3    S      0:00 ./camella.opt
18965 pts/3    Z      0:00 [camella.opt <defunct>]
18967 pts/3    S      0:00 ./camella.opt

$strace -p 18964
Hangs
$strace -p 18967
select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, {0, 50000}) =3D 0 (Timeout)

My log output on stderr ends abruptly, with no obvious trace of error
(and I log a lot, and I catch stray exceptions everywhere..)

Any hint or suggestion on how to track the problem would be
appreciated...
