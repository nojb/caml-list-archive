I'm a practitioner and not a researcher, so I share many of Mr.=20

Most of my concerns revolve around the problems I expect to face in=20
bundling an application that comprises many little programs that share=20=

one or more large libraries.  I'd like to see better support for dynamic=20=

loading, =E1 la Scaml, but I can see that a policy of "source-only=20
distribution" for libraries between developers is a completely different=20=

matter.

While the "source-only distribution" policy doesn't put a clamp on my=20
personal plans, I do think that this decision will have to be revisited=20=

before Ocaml will make a successful transition from academia into=20
industry.

One of the main attractions for industry to the C and Java languages are=20=

their crude-yet-functional support for "closed-source distribution" of=20=

libraries.  Without trying to make a political statement, I would=20
suggest that Ocaml could make a *much* bigger dent in the side of the=20
world, if the Caml team were to reconsider the concerns of industry in=20=

this matter.

I've already posted my opinion about application packaging systems, but=20=

it's not a religious issue for me, so I'll just let it go.
