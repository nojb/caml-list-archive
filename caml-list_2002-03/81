I don't see this.  I can believe that consequences of implementation choices which have been made prohibit this.  For hypothetical
example, inlining behavior which could not be disabled on public interfaces would be a problem.  (I don't think this particular
thing happens in ocaml.)  But I certainly don't see "a consequence of strict typing."  Can you give a specific example?
