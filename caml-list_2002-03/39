Does anyone on the list uses Plan9?

It is possible to port Ocaml to Plan9?
I think it whould consist of:
-translating the configure script to an mkfile.
-converting ocamlyacc.
-converting Ansi C to Plan 9 C in byterun/.
-converting the assembler files.

I don't have the knowleage, nor the time, but I can test.

ps: Ocaml whould make Plan 9 much more productive, even without Tk or Gtk.

Thanks,
