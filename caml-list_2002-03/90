This is what the documentation specifies.

This is what the implementation does (if you replace "if and only if"
with "at some time when" in the above).

The weak arrays are grossly underspecified because I don't know how to
clearly explain what they do to someone who doesn't already know what
a weak pointer is.  If someone wants to do write that explanation,
I'll be very happy.
