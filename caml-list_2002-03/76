When trying to read it, one of my brain modules threw an exception:
Stack overflow. :-)


Hi Franck,

Actually I only wrote to make that joke, but to be a bit more useful:
It might be that the constructs used by the code generator you used to
translate the FA definitions into ocaml nest somewhat too deeply, and
since the ocamlcompiler parses recursive descendend (i think) its
stack overflows at some point or other.

Suggestions:

   * Try cutting down your FA, let's say to half as a test case and
     compile it then. Does it overflow still? If no, try to make your
     FA smaller and keep functionality.

   * Report a problem/bug to the tagcc people and use ocamlc in the
     meantime waiting for a bug fix. If things are like I suggest,
     that is should be called a tagcc bug, since there is IMHO no
     reason for FA execution to use nested constructs this way
     (nesting too deeply).

Regards -- Markus
