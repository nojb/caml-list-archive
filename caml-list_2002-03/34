I don't think so, but I also wish there were. Some other implementations
of ML automatically bind the result of the previous evaluation to a
special identifier "it", treating an expression "E" as "let it = E". This
is really useful if, like me, you work in the toplevel a lot and often
want to evaluate ad hoc chains of dependent expressions.

Even if the OCaml developers don't want to add this feature to the
default toplevel, it must be very easy to support using Camlp4. Perhaps
Daniel de Rauglaudre or another expert can tell us how?
