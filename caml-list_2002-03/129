There is already module caml-help.el (since 3.04) in the emacs distrib part
of caml.el that could already do that. Have you tried it?

It can be parameterized to look for documentation in either standard or
ocamldoc info stylles, or just in the stdlib, which is often the most
convenient. It does completion on (toplevel) Module names and identifiers 
bound in these modules.
