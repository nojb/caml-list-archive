Hi
I got some exceptions raised from different dynlinked CMA, and I would like
to print the stack when I'm catching them. I don't want to make them be
fatal, so is there an easy way to do that ?
( i tried to call print_exception_backtrace() but seems it only works for
unhandled ones )

BTW, would it be possible (in debug mode) to have also the names of the C
primitives instead of only "Raised from a C primitive" ?

Thanks a lot
Nicolas Cannasse
