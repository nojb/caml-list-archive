                   ICFP 2002
  International Conference on Functional Programming
       October 4-6, 2002, Pittsburgh, USA

           Final call for papers

    --------------------------------------------
    Submission deadline: 21 March 2002 18:00 UTC
    --------------------------------------------

Program Chair: Simon Peyton Jones (Microsoft Research)

Full call for papers including submission details:=20

ICFP 2002 seeks original papers on the full spectrum of the art,
science, and practice of functional programming. The conference
invites submissions on all topics ranging from principles to practice,
from foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The
scope covers all languages that encourage programming with functions,
including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as
languages that support objects and concurrency. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to, the following:

  Foundations: formal semantics, lambda calculus, type theory, monads,
  continuations, control, state, effects.

  Design: modules and type systems, concurrency and distribution,
  components and composition, relations to object-oriented and logic
  programming, multiparadigm programming.

  Implementation: abstract machines, compile-time and run-time
  optimization, just-in-time compilers, memory management,
  foreign-function and component interfaces.

  Transformation and analysis: abstract interpretation, partial
  evaluation, program transformation, theorem proving, specification
  and verification.

  Software development techniques for functional programming: design
  patterns, specification, verification and validation, debugging,
  test generation, etc.

  Human productivity of functional programming: visual, graphical
  (etc) approaches, evaluating language usability, empirical studies
  of human effectiveness, etc.

  Applications and domain-specific languages: scientific and numerical
  computing, symbolic computing and artificial intelligence, systems
  programming, databases, graphic user interfaces, multimedia
  programming, Web programming.

  Practice and experience: functional programming in education and
  industry, ramifications on other paradigms and computing
  disciplines.  Functional pearls elegant, instructive examples of
  functional programming.
