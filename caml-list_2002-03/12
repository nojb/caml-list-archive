A related issue is independance w.r.t OCaml version; if you want to try a
new OCaml release or CVS version, it is necessary to rebuild all the
libraries.  For instance, I now have three OCaml versions installed (3.04,
3.04+7 and 3.04+6 polymorphic methods), and it is a pain to maintain three
library trees.

Similarly, when you upgrade a library, you also have to rebuild all
the libraries that depend on it. Some kind of automatization in the
process would be great.

The monolithic and centralized approach of CDK does not seem to scale
well. Findlib does a good job. It would be great to have such a tool
(findlib or a clone, but why not findlib ?) in the standard
distribution...

Indeed, the new packaging facility in OCaml (-pack option, which glues
together a set of modules and allows decent namespace management) opens
the door to this kind of project.

An intermediate solution would be to distribute so-called "lambda-code",
that is the internal representation used in OCaml compilers just before
code production. The advantage is that it is common to bytecode and
native back-end, and it should be possible to design an upward-compatible
(w.r.t OCaml version) concrete representation of this code.
