I'm having some problems getting camlidl to work for me under windows NT
(well, not camlidl, but its output).  I created a very simple C routine,
bf.c and its associated .idl file, dumb.idl, which I processed with
camlidl...all went well here.  I then compiled bf.c, dumb.c, dumb.mli, and
dumb.ml without problems.  The problem comes when I try to use the results
of the above in a new program.  Here's what happens:

$ ocamlc -o bftest -custom bf.obj dumb.obj dumb.cmo bft.ml -cclib -lcamlidl
camlprim0.c
libcamlidl.lib(idlalloc.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
__imp__CoTaskMemAlloc@4
libcamlidl.lib(idlalloc.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
__imp__CoTaskMemFree@4
bftest.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 2 unresolved externals
Error while building custom runtime system

This happens both at a DOS prompt and under Cygwin (using the
Native Win32 port, not one compiled from source under Cygwin).  When I
perform the same steps under my OS X installation, everything works
fine.  Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?  Any help woud be
appreciated.

I apologize if this is a silly question or if I am leaving out vital
information -- I just had some very bad Japanese food for lunch and I can
barely remember my name right now...
