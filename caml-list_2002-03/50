So it would be as if 

expr ;;

whould have been written as

let it = expr ;;

in the top-level. Since I currently often write

let x = expr ;;

it would save me 9 keystrokes. I think it is a good idea.

(But I think that soon people would ask you to keep all the
lines, so that we would write it.(4) instead.)
