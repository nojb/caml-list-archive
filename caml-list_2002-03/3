friends--

Last night I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why an assertion 
was failing in my code when I use it with large data sets.  I'm still 
puzzled.

This morning, I inserted the following at the beginning of my main 
module:

> Gc.set {
>     (Gc.get ()) with
>     Gc.major_heap_increment = 64000
> }

This made the problem go away.

What's even more strange is that there are multiple failure modes to 
choose from depending on which number I pick for the 
major_heap_increment value.  The number I am using here just happens to 
be the one that makes the code work.

Can anyone advise me on how to find the bug here?
