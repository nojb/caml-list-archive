[Warning: Perhaps an newbie question]

I'm attempting to manipulate in O'Caml, packets of data with 
well-defined layouts (for example: X11 packets, IP and TCP 
packets).

Is there a tool that can generate code from a packet layout 
specification, for reading and writing such packets from a 
stream of bytes?  If not, any suggestions on modules to study 
before designing such a module?

Thanks,
Koshy
