It seems that the new -pack feature of ocamlc/ocamlopt (see CVS) addresses
the issue. What kind of extra support for namespace would be needed ?

Concerning the global parametrization, maybe a variation around -pack
could solve the problem. ocamlc -pack would take a list of modules
A1,...An (.cmo+.cmi) and a list of interfaces S1,...,Sm (.cmi) and produce
a functor parametrized by interfaces S1,...Sm and returning a
bundled version of A1,...,An
