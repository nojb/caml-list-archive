I think a CPAN-like-thing would be excellent and is sorely needed!  I'm 
super busy right now (who isn't?), but I'd be willing to commit some time 
to testing it at the least, and maybe contributing code after May.

I've used CPAN a little bit, but we should do a survey of other archive 
managers and learn from what works and what doesn't.  Maybe there's a web 
page somewhere.  There's also apt-get from Debian and the Redhat one to 
look at.

I wonder if we could just use one of the existing managers...although it 
seems like it should be written in caml for karmic reasons, at least.  :)

Why wouldn't it be source-only?  So people don't have to have the compiler 
installed?  It seems that there are two related but different projects:  an 
archive/package manager for developers, and one for users.  Maybe those can 
be the same thing, at least for bytecode.  But maybe the intermediate rep 
idea would work for native as well.  Or some server that builds all the 
supported platforms or something.
