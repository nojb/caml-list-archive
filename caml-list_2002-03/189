I hate when this happens.

It turns out that the code I posted doesn't build (let alone install) 
the native version of the code properly.  I've posted an update that 
seems to fix it.  The only source files that changed are the Makefile 
and the META file.  I've added a ChangeLog file.

The new distributions are here:

	http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/iox-1.00b2.tar.gz
	http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/iox-1.00b2.tar.bz2

I've also moved the locators for browsing the source and the autodocs:

	http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/iox/
	http://www.wetware.com/jhw/src/iox/doc/index.html

And, by the way, if you're building this on Mac OS X (or a BSD variant 
with a similar issue), the native version won't link until you use 
ranlib on the .a file in $PREFIX/ocaml/site-lib/iox/iox.a after you 
install it.

I think this might be because ocamlfind install doesn't know to run 
ranlib on the .a file after it moves its absolute path.
