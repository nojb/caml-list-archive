A while ago I bugged Xavier about this.  He agreed it would be nice to
have weak hash tables, so if anyone volunteered an implementation, I
suspect it would quickly make its way into the standard library.

I haven't thought hard about it, but I think it needs some additional
hooks in the garbage collector.  (Without even *considering* the whole
heirarchy of weakness in Java!)
