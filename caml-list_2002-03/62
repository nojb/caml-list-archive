| So, technically, it would be feasible to resurrect the Caml V3.1      
| behavior: evaluating "expr ;;" at top-level binds the result 
| value to the name "it".  Do others think that it would be useful?
                                                               
As I've said, I really like the "it" feature. It's also difficult to        
imagine anyone seriously objecting to it, given that the Caml Light

misfeature of being unable to GC objects only accessible via overwritten

toplevel bindings has been corrected. I hadn't noticed that change

before, but I'm very pleased to see it.
                                                             
| (But I think that soon people would ask you to keep all the
| lines, so that we would write it.(4) instead.)                      
                                                                     
If some more elaborate solution like that were contemplated, I'd like
an option to disable it or manually force forgetting and GC of earlier
items.
                                                          
John.
