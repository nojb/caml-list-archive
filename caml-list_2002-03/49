The original Caml V3.1 had such a facility -- all results of toplevel
evaluations were bound to the name "it".  This was removed in Caml
Light because of the way Caml Light handles toplevel binding: all
bindings accumulate forever, preventing the GC from reclaiming the
memory space used.  Early versions of Objective Caml had the same
problem as Caml Light, but this was fixed in version 3.01: only the
values of lexically visible toplevel definitions are kept.

So, technically, it would be feasible to resurrect the Caml V3.1
behavior: evaluating "expr ;;" at top-level binds the result value to
the name "it".  Do others think that it would be useful?
