Hi all

I got the following question : I have a type MSG wich is allocated using
alloc_tuple(3) , and contains one Int and two Int32.
Sometimes, the second Int32 is a C pointer, so I managed to garbage it by
allocating sometimes MSG using alloc_tuple(4) and then storing a custom
block in the fourth block (this custom block hold the C pointer, and will
free() it when garbaged - the C pointer is also stored as an Int32 in the
MSG to enable its access by C API ). So for the same type MSG, i'm mixing
tuple of different sizes.

Does this can cause problems ?
Does my custom_block can be garbaged before the MSG ( when let - storing the
MSG for further use ) ?
Does my ocaml-side MSG type needs to have 4 fields ?

Thanks a lot for any help
Nicolas Cannasse
