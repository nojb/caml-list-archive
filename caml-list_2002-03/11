This raises the old question of "social tools" again. Given that our
community is still comparatively small, it is absolutely mandatory
that there be tools and standards that make us as productive as
possible. Not only will this allow us to use our scarce human resources
more efficiently, it is also more likely to attract more people when they
see that contributing and benefiting from other contributions is easy.

Some standard packaging tools + automated means of resolving dependencies,
e.g. by downloading contributions from some central archive, and a
documentation standard (ocamldoc?) would surely help. Any concrete plans?

Regards,
Markus Mottl
