I think you can't do it with constant-sized hashes.  For instance, if
s_2 has 100 elements, then it has 2 ** 100 subsets.  Since R has to
behave correctly on most of those 2 ** 100 subsets, those subsets need
to have almost 2 ** 100 different hashes, so your hash can't be less
than 100 bits.

You have to know the name for each entry point into the library anyway
so you can do the linking.  We could just have one hash for the type
per entry point.  Hmm; MD5 is only 16 bytes, or 32 bytes of hex, or 22
bytes of base 62 (digits plus upper and lower case letters), so maybe
we just append the MD5 checksum to the end of the symbol.  If that's
too much and we're willing to have less-than-cryptographic security we
could truncate the added checksum to whatever number of bits is small
enough and still have a very good chance of getting the right answer.
