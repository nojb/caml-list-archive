Mmm, i have written a more complete manpage for advi (attached below),
compiling information from the README file and the command line help, but
there was no reference about this feature, are there other such 'hidden'
features in advi ?

Also, it would be very nice if this would also be available as a command line
option (-f for example), as well as the fonts preload commands.

An example on how to do that would also be nice in the documentation. 

Saddly, i don't know how to do this personally.

BTW, i have had a bug report about advi 0.3.1 (not yet tested on advi 1.0.0,
but it may well be that this problem persist, as i was not able to view one of
my dvi files). The report was about problems when previewing dvi files which
contain postscript fonts (Times), and not finfing them (noting that xdvi
shows them without problem).

Is this the normal behavior, or is something wrong about it.
