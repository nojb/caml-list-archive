List,
  A new Ensemble release is now available. As usual, the sources, documentation,
and pre-compiled binaries for windows and linux can be downloaded from
the system's site at www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble.

Ensemble is a group-communication system built in ML, and enjoying performance
equal or superior to similar systems built in C. It also features an extensive C interface.
The system was built in Cornell and the Hebrew universities.

As an aside to recent discussions on the list, I'd be very happy if Caml libraries
were shared libraries, and if exported interfaces (mli) were binary-compatible across
changes in the library internals.

Below the release notes are attached.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     RELEASE_NOTES  for Ensemble version 1.35

 1. Added a "local" stack, which simply adds property local to vsync.

2. Some slight typing changes in the Hsys module, requested by Roy Friedman.

3. Removed spurious logical-time in outboard mode (HOT). This improves
   line-utilization for HOT applications using outboard mode.

4. Added outboard mode to CE. This allows using Ensemble through a
   server and a thin client library. This is a step forward in the
   rewrite of the HOT interface. Eventually, we intend to completely
   replace it with CE, using a thin overlay layer to mimic HOT semantics.

5. make depend now works on WIN32. The make sequence is now on all platforms:
    for bytecode:
      make depend
      make all
    for optimized code:
      make depend
      make opt

6. Added staggering to the Suspect and Stability layers. This means
   that instead of a flood of messages sent when suspicions and
   stability information is computed, such events are scattered.  This
   prevents implosion at the group leader. This was suggested by Roy Friedman.

7.  Several small bug fixes and cleanup.

OCAML COMPILER VERSION
  We are using version 3.04 for this version.

PORTABILITY
  This version was tested on Linux, and WIN2000.
