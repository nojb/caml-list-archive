For our purposes, the Ocaml code could call the infrastructure to get
it to load the C library before it tries to access the C code, or to
build the original executable with the libraries we need.

I think that would be very difficult to arrange.  Again, for our
purposes, the downloadable modules would come from single site, so we
will arrange for the libraries to be consistent.
