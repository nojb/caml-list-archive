Hi
I had a quite big parametrized class and it takes me few hours to figure out
where a constraint I didn't want was occuring. It's true that I'm not very
familiar with constraints, but I think it would be nice to enable the OCaml
compiler to print some more informations about where the constraint occurs
in the code ( a simple line number will be enough. ) I don't know if that
can be done, but i think that would be somehow useful.
