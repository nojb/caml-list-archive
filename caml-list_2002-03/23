Mmm, i don't think so, altough i know the darwin project use a variation of
dpkg and apt-get for their package management. You are free to port it though,
if you want, it is open source anyway.

Also notice, that appart from the nice apt-get tool, much work has been done
to package the new ocaml 3.04 and to solve the problems related to shared libs
on debian systems. We even use a small tool ocaml-ldconf (quickly hacked by
me, so it is not optimal, but does its work) which uses 3 databases to store
the ld.conf files, one is the normal ld.conf from ocaml, and the other two
being the dpkg handled /var/lib/ocaml/ld.conf, and a system administrator
override in /etc/ocaml/ld.conf.

I would gladly contribute it if it seems usefull and people want it, but i am
not sure what help it would be without the integration permitted by apt-get,
dpkg and the debian packaging system (and the work of the debian/ocaml
maintainer team :)))
