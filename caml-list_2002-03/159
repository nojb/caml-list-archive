Yep, this seems to be the problem.

It might be wise to specifically mention in the Hashtbl documentation that the
functorial version is needed for cyclic structures. The Hashtbl.hash function
documentation easily gices the wrong impression.

The code is actually a stripped down version of a unit test, so it is not a
problem to change to an acyclic representation. The application isn't using
cyclic structures.
