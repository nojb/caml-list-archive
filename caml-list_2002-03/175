We occasionally get bug reports similar to yours, under Linux.  It's
hard to say whether it's a bug in the OCaml system thread library, or
in LinuxThreads itself.

Actually, it looks like the thread manager thread (PID N+1, where N is
the initial PID of the program) died.  It should not, and it is not
surprising that the program hangs, since once the thread manager is
gone the program can no longer create new threads.

Yes, that's another issue: OCaml allows several threads to call
Unix.gethostbyname concurrently (without holding the master mutex),
yet most if not all implementations of gethostbyname() are not
reentrant.

As Nikolaj Bjorner mentioned, some systems provide a reentrant
gethostbyname_r() function, not necessarily with the same interface,
though, making it very hard to use in the Unix library.

(An easy way to see if your problems are related to gethostbyname is
to protect calls to Unix.gethostbyname by a mutex, to ensure that only
one at a time is performed.)
