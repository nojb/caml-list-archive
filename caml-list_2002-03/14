compilation and windows is a problem. even if many windows users
use cygwin, I think the native port is very important. If there
would be commercial applications written in O'Caml, I think
they will be written for Windows (Anyone know any commercial
applications for *nix? :-) 

I got the impression that the byte-code is compatible between
different platforms (Is this true?), and then this would
simplify distribution, since especially windows-users wouldn't
have the compilationsproblems (unless they want to change the
code or use the native compiler).
