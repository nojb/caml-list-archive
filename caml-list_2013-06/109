Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Building pcre-ocaml 7.0.2 on MinGW

I have no experience with OCaml installations on Windows, but what
concerns the configuration of pcre-ocaml, it actually does use
pcre-config.  If the latter is not in your path, you can add the
configure flag "--with-pcre-config {full path to pcre-config}" to make
it work.

Regards,
Markus
