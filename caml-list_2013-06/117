Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Setting up OPAM in emacs

I've chosen  the simplest solution, that is not very versatile, but it work=
s.

Though there were provided some elegant solutions, I cannot found one that =
would mix well=20
with a typerex 2.0, which enforces its own rules.

So, my working scheme (works on linux and mac (with issues on the later))

0. clean up the system (remove old typerex, tuareg and whatever you've trie=
d=85)

1. install typerex from opam:
    `$ opam install typerex`

2. setup the environment=20=20=20
    `$ opam config setup -a`

3.  setup the typerex
   `$ ocp-edit-mode install -emacs`=20

4.  relogin (or reboot)


Then start emacs in such way, that it can benefit from the configured setup.

In linux I just start emacs as a server:

   `$ emacs --daemon`

and start frames with
    `$ emacsclient -c`

All commands works fine. Though after switching compilers it is needed to r=
estart emacs server.

On mac os I've installed Emacs.App from ports. All of the opam setup works =
fine, when I start from Terminal with:
   `$ open -a Emacs`

Nothing works if emacs is started from finder or dock.


P.S. I hope that this will help, and I've not missed anything.
P.P.S. For full experience one should use ocp-build. I'm experimenting with=
 it. It looks very nice,=20
but I still can't find how to enable syntax preprocessing. May be some clue=
s?=20
=20=20=20
