EC-TEL 2013: Eighth European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning

"Scaling Up Learning for Sustained Impact"

17-21 September 2013, Paphos, Cyprus

http://ec-tel.eu/


The European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL) is a
unique opportunity for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to
address current challenges and advances in the field. Through EC-TEL,
established and emerging researchers as well as practitioners, entrepreneur=
s,
and technology developers explore new collaborations, strengthen networks,
and compliment their core experience.

There is no doubt that Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) has created
enormous changes in schools, universities and at the workplaces. However,
these innovations have tended to be unsustainable. Too often, initiatives
need a high degree of effort to be sustained, and are consequently
endangered when funding stops. At the same time, mobile and social
information and communication technologies are fundamentally changing
our lives. Nowadays we use them naturally to keep in contact with our
friends, to seek information, to buy things and to work. In many domains,
these emerging technologies demonstrate that scaling is possible. But few
educational institutions or companies have taken these technologies up in a
systematic way to include them into their learning strategy.

To address these challenges the theme of EC-TEL 2013 is "Scaling up
learning for sustained impact".

In this spirit, we want to offer you a chance to present existing prototypes
and work in progress to ECTEL community to create sustained impact,
dissemination and create potentials for scaling up the use to a wider audie=
nce.
Extended demonstrations of prototypes and "TEL in action" will spark
discussions between different but complimentary groups, and be animated and
disseminated through live internet radio broadcasts, videos, etc. EC-TEL 20=
13
will examine and improve the transitions between research, practice and
industry.

In this special call we invite contributions for demonstrations and posters
that can be exhibited and discussed along the conference. Details of
conference topics are available at http://ec-tel.eu/, and in this second ca=
ll
especially we encourage highly visual and engaging demos, such as Serious
Games, Virtual Worlds, Immersive Multimedia, and Collaborative Learning
Systems.

Posters report on significant work in progress. We will have an interactive
poster session in which you can present your work and elicit feedback
from EC-TEL participants.

A demonstration is your chance to fully engage EC-TEL attendees at a
personal level by letting them see, touch, squeeze, or hear your visions
for the future of TEL, or demonstrate highly interactive "TEL in Action"
(e.g. through videos or real-time learning experiences).

We expect that your Demonstration will be a reliably running prototype
of your vision that is ready to be tried out, questioned and interacted
with. You need to submit a concise description of your prototype,
clearly showing how your technological innovation realises a clear learning
innovation. Please also indicate any special technical requirements needed
for the demonstration at the conference location.

At the conference, all accepted demonstrations will be invited to participa=
te
in the "EC-TEL 2013 Demo sprint contest". The audience of the
"EC-TEL 2013 Demo sprint contest" will vote for the best EC-TEL
demonstration in this session and the winner will be awarded with a prize
from Online Educa Berlin Conference (see below).
