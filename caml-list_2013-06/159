  1st French Singaporean Workshop in Formal Methods and Applications

====================================================================


The 1st French Singaporean Workshop in Formal Methods and Applications (FSFMA)
aims at sharing research interests and launching collaborations in the area of
formal methods and their applications.

The scientific subject of the workshop covers (but does not limit to) areas
such as formal specification, model checking, verification, program analysis
and transformation, software engineering, and applications in major areas of
computer science, including aeronautics and aerospace.

The workshop will bring together researchers and industry R&D experts from all
countries together to exchange their knowledge, discuss their research  
findings,
and explore potential collaborations.

A PhD session will allow Master and PhD students to present their work.
Thanks to the support from the Merlion program, the workshop is happy  
to offer a
travel grant to 2 PhD students.

Round tables will focus on French-Singaporean funding and cooperation  
opportunities.

The workshop will take place on July 15th and 16th, 2013, in Singapore as a
satellite of ICECCS 2013.
