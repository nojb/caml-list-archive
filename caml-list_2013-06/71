Subject: [Caml-list] Deadline extension: OCaml 2013, new deadline on June 18
 (anywhere on earth)

Dear all,

OCaml 2013 extends its submission deadline. The new deadline is June
18, anywhere on earth.

Let me remind you that the scope of OCaml 2013 is rather broad, and
includes experience reports, libraries, bindings, extensions,
optimizations, and virtually everything concerning about. The only
requirement is a short description of what you'd like to address, and
what you'd like to present. The description does not have to be long,
but should be explicit enough for the PC members to understand what
your presentation is about.

Some travel grants shall be available for students or people having
financial difficulties for attending OCaml 2013.

If you missed time for meeting the original deadline, if you use OCaml
in your company and would like to share your experience with OCaml
users and developers, if you have something cool to present, don't
hesitate!

Please forward this message to whoever could be interested, and redirect
questions to <michel DOT mauny AT ensta-paristech.fr>

Submissions are at:

     https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocaml2013

Below is the full (modified) call for presentations. All the best,

- Michel Mauny

                           OCAML 2013
                The  OCaml Users and Developers Workshop
                http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/
                       Boston, Massachusetts, USA

                        CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

                      Co-located with ICFP 2013
                        Sponsored by SIGPLAN
            New Submission Deadline: June 18, 2013 (anywhere on earth)
                                   
==============================================================================

The first occurrence of the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop was
colocated with ICFP 2012, in Copenhagen, following the OCaml Meetings
in Paris in 2010 and 2011. OCaml 2013 will be held on September 24,
2013, in Boston, colocated with ICFP 2013.

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together industrial
users of OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending
the language, type system and tools. Discussions will focus on the
practical aspects of OCaml programming and the nitty gritty of the
tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes.  Thus, we aim to
solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use or
development of the language and of its programming environment,
including, for example:

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not exhaustively) 
  GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design rationales

- tool enhancements by commercial consultants

- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
  situations.

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
meeting, but no formal proceedings. Slides of presentations will be
available online from the workshop homepage.

To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2
pages long) at http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/talks/ providing a
clear statement of what will be brought by the talk: the problems that
are addressed, the technical solutions or methods that are
proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup,
we will do our best to accommodate you.
