Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Papers: Logic Based Program Synthesis and
 Transformation (LOPSTR'13) in Madrid (deadline extended)


[Apologies for multiple messages]

Dear Colleague:

The paper submission deadline for LOPSTR'13 has been extended to June 24.
Please consider submitting a paper. The call for papers is included below.
The conference URL is:

http://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/lopstr/

Regards,

Gopal Gupta

============================================================

                       LOPSTR'13

                 23rd International Symposium on
        Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                          LOPSTR 2013

             http://www.utdallas.edu/~gupta/lopstr
             Madrid, Spain, September 18-20, 2013


DEADLINE: Paper submission:    June 24, 2013

============================================================


The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 23rd International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2013) will be held in Madrid, Spain; previous
symposia were held in Leuven, Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,
London, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,
Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, Manchester and
Odense (you might have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR
symposia). LOPSTR 2013 will be co-located with PPDP 2013
(International ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of
Declarative Programming).

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Both full
papers and extended abstracts describing applications in these areas
are especially welcome. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

     * specification
     * verification
     * analysis
     * specialization
     * composition
     * certification
     * transformational techniques in SE
     * synthesis
     * transformation
     * optimisation
     * inversion
     * program/model manipulation
     * security
     * applications and tools

Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).
Proceedings

The formal post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Important Dates

       Paper submission:                     June 24, 2013
       Notification (for pre-proceedings):   July 24, 2013
       Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings):   August 5, 2013
       Symposium:                            September 18-20, 2013

Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science
style. They cannot exceed 15 pages including references but excluding
well-marked appendices not intended for publication. Referees are not
required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be
intelligible without them.

Full papers can be directly accepted for publication in the formal
proceedings to be published by Springer in the LNCS series or accepted
only for presentation at the symposium. After the symposium, all
authors of extended abstracts and full papers accepted only for
presentation will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions
in the light of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then, after
another round of reviewing, these revised papers may also be published
in the formal proceedings.

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in
English) in PDF or Postscript (Level 2). Each submission must include
on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations;
contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords. The
keywords will be used to assist us in selecting appropriate reviewers
for the paper. If electronic submission is impossible, please contact
the program chair for information on how to submit hard copies.

Papers should be submitted to the submission website for LOPSTR 2013.
