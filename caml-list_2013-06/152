I can quickly report what I did to get GODI working on Windows. It is=20=20
of course not "pure Windows": You need Cygwin for doing builds, but=20=20
that's "only" because almost all build utilities are Unix-ish, and it=20=20
would be very hard to build anything without having some shell and the=20=
=20
usual file utilities at hand. (AFAIK the only build utility that works=20=
=20
in a pure Windows environment is omake.)

So GODI assumes a mixed Windows environment, and this is in deed=20=20
doable. ocaml and all compiled code run on native Windows here, and for=20=
=20
executing build scripts there is Cygwin. This solves the utility=20=20
question, but you get in return some new problems, like the different=20=20
calling conventions. All GODI core utilities have e.g. built-in support=20=
=20
for translating Cygwin paths forth and back, so they can operate on=20=20
Cygwin paths although they are native Windows programs. Another problem=20=
=20
are the strange Windows rules for splitting a command-line into words.=20=
=20
As generic fallback when there are too many "bad characters" in the=20=20
command line I simply generate a temporary script that is then executed=20=
=20
with bash. There are probably more such tricks I currently do not=20=20
remember.

So this mixed mode is actually doable, and works so well that many GODI=20=
=20
packages can be built on Windows without any special porting effort. If=20=
=20
you look at WODI, the special adaption of GODI for Windows, you will=20=20
mostly find additional C libraries (because you cannot link against the=20=
=20
libraries coming with Cygwin).

We could go further and replace Cygwin completely only if we had a=20=20
substitute for the shell utilities. That's the core of the problem, and=20=
=20
it's a hard one, because many scripts assume 100% POSIX behavior, and=20=20
e.g. using Windows command-line conventions is out of question.
