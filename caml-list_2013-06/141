Hi David,

Thank you for your response. I have installed the official windows port of
ocaml at http://protz.github.io/ocaml-installer/ . However, it mentions
that MinGW/Msys is no longer supported. I rather use Mingw/Msys as well.

It seems ocamlbuild requires cygwin to work, has this been your experience
too? If I build the latest ocaml from trunk - 4.02dev+fp will ocaml and
other tools/utilities still work on pure MingWg/Msys environment?

With regards to ocaml libraries, have you tried the Jane Street packages?
Core, core_kernel ?
