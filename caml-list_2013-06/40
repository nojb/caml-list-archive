I guess it believes Printf here is not a module name (there is no dot)
but a constructor (it is a capitalized identifier). But the syntax for
constructors is either:
  A
  A x
  A (x1, ..., xn)
In other words, if A is a constructor, "A x y" is never a valid
expression. It could also be a type error ("A x" is not a function, it
cannot be applied) but apparently it is catched by the parser.

So I would say it is the expected behavior, but that it could be
improved, as all error messages.
