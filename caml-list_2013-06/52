Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [Reminder] CFP: OCaml 2013, deadline at the end of
 the week

Hi,

Let me be more precise about the deadline for submitting presentations
for OCaml 2013: it is "June 7, anywhere on earth", as I've read on
another CFP.

Also, some people wonder whether they should have *exactly* two
pages. Of course not, it could me a little more, or a little less. The
important thing is that the PC understands what you are addressing, and
what you did/propose/plan-to-do.

Thanks for your submissions,

- Michel

> The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together industrial

> practical aspects of OCaml programming and the nitty gritty of the

> solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use or
> development of the language and of its programming environment,
> including, for example:
> 
> - compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures
> 
> - practical type system improvements, such as (but not exhaustively) 
>   GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types
> 
> - new library or application releases, and their design rationales
> 
> - tool enhancements by commercial consultants
> 
> - prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
>   situations.
> 
> It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
> meeting, but no formal proceedings. Slides of presentations will be
> available online from the workshop homepage.
> 
> To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2
