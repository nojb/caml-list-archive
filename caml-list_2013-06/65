Subject: [Caml-list] New Book: OCaml from the Very Beginning

Hi,

I've written a concise but self-contained introduction to writing 
computer programs with OCaml, suitable for the talented beginner to 
programming, or someone trying functional programming or OCaml for the 
first time.

On your local Amazon: http://asin.info/a/0957671105

E-book: http://www.ocaml-book.com

Sample chapters also at http://www.ocaml-book.com

Thanks to all those who reviewed and proof-read earlier drafts.

Reviews on Amazon are always very useful - my understanding is that if 
you have an amazon account, you can review the book based on having read 
the e-book, without buying a printed copy. Do please consider adding a 
review, especially if you like the book!

With Thanks,

--
