I only use Cygwin to compile OCaml and related libraries (again, principally for historical reasons, I develop using a normal command shell with GnuWin32 to provide Unix commands). Building using Cygwin (i.e. the supported way) has the benefit that when you get stuck, others are likely to (be able to) help! :o) Do you have a particular to want to use MSYS rather than Cygwin?

By the way, wtch out for GnuWin32. It advertises a very broad support
but it's getting old and most importantly, it lies on several things.
For instance, fork() is implemented as:
  int fork(void) {
    return -1;
  }

Because I use GnuWin32 (which has its bin folder in my PATH) I prefer not to put C:\cygwin\bin in my PATH but symlink through the required utilities in C:\Dev\OCaml\bin (C:\Dev\OCaml is my installation root for OCaml) - my OCaml installation requires bash.exe (for ocamlbuild), cpp.exe (for ocamlnet) and i686-w64-mingw32-ar.exe + i686-w64-mingw32-as.exe + i686-w64-mingw32-dlltool.exe + i686-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe + i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib.exe for ocamlopt.

Do you mean you use gnuwin32's bash.exe for ocamlbuild?

I hadn't thought about doing that but it could be a pretty good match.
It's probably faster to spawn than cygwin or msys' bash and probably has
way less dependencies.
