We had a problem with the video, during the last event (the camera settings
were on a proprietary format, that we were unable to download afterwards on
our linux boxes). Normally, the camera settings have been fixed, so we
should be able to upload the movies that will be taken next Tuesday, for
the people who cannot come.

Hello list,<br>
<br>
I would like to present you a set of tools for GPGPU programming with<br>
OCaml.<br>
<br>
I developed the SPOC library that enables the detection and use of GPGPU<br>
devices with OCaml using Cuda and OpenCL. I also developed a camlp4<br>
syntax extension to handle external Cuda or OpenCL kernels as well as a<br>
DSL to express GPGPU kernels from the OCaml code.<br>

<br>
SPOC has been presented several times and the slides and the papers<br>
references are on our website if you want more information about it.<br>
It has currently been tested on multiple architectures and systems,<br>
mostly 64-bit Linux and 64-bit OSX systems. It should work with Windows<br>
too (I tested it successfully last year with Windows 7...).<br>
<br>
To be able to use SPOC, you&#39;ll need a computer capable of running OCaml=
<br>
(obviously) but also compatible with either OpenCL or Cuda.<br>
For Cuda you only need a current proprietary NVidia driver while for<br>
OpenCL you need to install the correct OpenCL implementation for your<br>
system.<br>
SPOC should compile anyway as everything is dynamically linked, but<br>
you&#39;ll need Cuda/OpenCL eventually to run your programs.<br>
<br>
SPOC currently lacks a real tutorial, it comes with some examples and I<br>
strongly advise anyone interested to look into the slides and papers on<br>

By the way, if you are interested and if you are in Paris next week, I<br>
will be presenting SPOC etc. during the &quot;OCaml Users in PariS&quot; (O=
