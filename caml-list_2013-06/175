Subject: [Caml-list] INAP 2013 - Final Call for Papers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      20th International Conference on 
      Applications of Declarative Programming
      and Knowledge Management (INAP 2013)

      colocated with

      27th Workshop on Logic Programming (WLP 2013)

      part of the Kiel Declarative Programming Days 2013

      Kiel, Germany, September 11-13, 2013

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Declarative programming is an advanced paradigm for the modeling and
solving of complex problems. This specification method attracted
increased attention over the last decades, e.g., in the domains of
databases and natural language processing, for the modeling and the
processing of combinatorial problems, and for establishing systems for
the Web.


INAP 2013
=========

INAP is a communicative and dense conference for intensive discussion of
applications of important technologies around logic programming,
constraint problem solving, and closely related computing paradigms. It
comprehensively covers the impact of programmable logic solvers in the
internet society, its underlying technologies, and leading edge
applications in industry, commerce, government, and societal services.

We invite high quality contributions on different aspects of declarative
programming, constraint processing and knowledge management, as well as
their use for distributed systems and the Web, including, but not
limited to the following areas (the order does not reflect any
priorities): 

 * knowledge management, e.g., data mining, decision support,
   deductive databases;
 * distributed systems and the Web, e.g., agents and concurrent
   engineering, Semantic Web;
 * constraints, e.g., constraint systems, extensions of constraint
   (logic) programming;
 * theoretical foundations, e.g., deductive databases, nonmonotonic
   reasoning, knowledge representation;
 * systems and tools for academic and industrial use;
 * knowledge-based Web services - logic solvers and applications.

This year, INAP consists of the following four tracks, covering relevant
subareas of declarative methods:

 * non-monotonic reasoning;
 * applications and system implementations;
 * extensions of logic programming;
 * databases, deductive databases, and data mining.


WLP 2013
========

The workshops on (constraint) logic programming serve as the scientific
forum of the annual meeting of the Society of Logic Programming (GLP,
Gesellschaft fuer Logische Programmierung e.V.). They bring together
researchers interested in logic programming, constraint programming, and
related areas like databases, artificial intelligence, and operations
research. Previous workshops have been held in Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, and Egypt.

The joint INAP and WLP event aims to promote the cross-fertilizing
exchange of ideas and experiences among researches and students from the
different communities interested in the foundations, applications, and
combinations of high-level, declarative programming languages and
related areas.

The technical program of the event will include invited talks,
presentations of refereed papers, and system demonstrations.


Important Dates
===============

 * Submission of papers:       July 07, 2013
 * Notification of acceptance: July 28, 2013
 * Camera-ready papers:        August 18, 2013
 * Conference and Workshop:    September 11-13, 2013


Submissions
===========

Authors are invited to submit long papers (no longer than 15 pages) or
short papers (no longer than 6 pages) in the following categories:

 * technical papers;
 * application papers;
 * system descriptions.

Submissions must be unpublished original work and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. However, work that already appeared in informally
published workshop proceedings may be submitted too. All submissions
must be in PDF format using LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs.cls class
file. Paper submission is electronic via the Easychair submission
system, available at

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=inap2013

All accepted papers will be published in a technical report.
As for previous joint INAP/WLP events, it is planned to publish selected
papers in a post-conference proceedings volume in the Springer Lecture
Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.
