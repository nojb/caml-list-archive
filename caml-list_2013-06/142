There are quite a few things that make working with msys painful, which 
is the reason why I switched the installer to cygwin. The installer 
still is a 32-bit native windows program, and still generates 32-bit 
native windows programs. It's just that cygwin is an easy way to get a 
toolchain and a unix-like development environment, which ocaml kind of 
needs in order to work right (without it, you only get bytecode 
compilation).
- The main problem is that OCaml is, by default, configured to search 
executables from the toolchain with the i686-pc-mingw-whatever prefix, 
that is, the one that the mingw-w64 compilers have, when installed 
through cygwin.
- The second biggest problem is with flexdll which, IIRC, hardcodes the 
use of the mingw-w64 compilers (32-bit compilers from the mingw-w64 
project). Msys, on the other hand, uses the mingw compilers (the 
original mingw project), and the location of the libraries / 
executables is slightly different, or maybe flexdll doesn't auto-detect 
the right locations for crt2.o and friends, meaning it's painful as you 
have to manually export FLEXLINKFLAGS. At some point, it became almost 
impossible to have that combination working. I think flexdll started to 
hardcode the i686-pc-mingw prefix at some point, and there's no 
ready-made, easy to install mingw-w64/msys bundle available, as far as 
I know.
- OCamlbuild relies on bash being available in the path to run its 
external commands ; an easy way to have this is to have a cygwin 
development environment. This is a know issue that no one has stepped 
up to fix on windows.
- Finally, the quoting conventions, IIRC, are subtly different between 
mingw/msys and cygwin, and OCaml is tailored to cygwin.

For all these reasons, cygwin sounds like a better choice for you 
working environment on windows. But I believe msys is still possible. 
If there's something that prevents you from having it work properly, I 
think we (the team) would be happy to know about it.

Cheers,
