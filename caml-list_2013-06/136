Subject: [Caml-list] oasis and foreign code


A while back, I had a problem with oasis, where I wanted to put an
oasis file in a subdirectory of some larger project, and wanted it to
be able to access files on a neighboring directory.

In that case, the project was "tutorial", the subdirectory was
"tutorial/ocaml", and the neighboring directory was
"tutorial/gen-ocaml".

It was suggested that if the oasis file were moved up one directory,
things would be much simpler.  Which is true.

But now, there's a different problem.  Suppose I move that file up.
Now there are -other- subdirectories, containing code related to the
project, that aren't for ocaml consumption.  And when I do make,
ocamlbuild complains:

SANITIZE: a total of 4 files that should probably not be in your source tree
  has been found. A script shell file
  "....../sanitize.sh" is being
  created. Check this script and run it to remove unwanted files or use other
  options (such as defining hygiene exceptions or using the -no-hygiene
  option).
IMPORTANT: I cannot work with leftover compiled files.
ERROR: Leftover object files:
  File pedion_types.o in gen-cpp has suffix .o
  File Pedion.o in gen-cpp has suffix .o
  File pedion_constants.o in gen-cpp has suffix .o
ERROR: Leftover object files:
  File PedionServer.o in pedion has suffix .o

Is there a way to tell oasis to ignore certain subdirectories (and
hence, to have it generate myocamlbuild files that ignore those
directories)?

I looked at the ocamlbuild tags documentation, and nothing stands out
as being suitable.

Thanks,
--chet--
