Subject: [Caml-list] Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) 2013

Last call for CUFP, the deadline is at the end of the month!

***

Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) 2013
ICFP 2013; Boston, MA, Sep 22-24.

Proposals due June 29.

The annual CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how others are usi=
ng functional programming to solve real world problems; where practitioners=
 meet and collaborate; where language designers and users can share ideas a=
bout the future of their favorite language; and where one can learn practic=
al techniques and approaches for putting functional programming to work.

Giving a talk

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical setting, w=
e invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the workshop. We are lo=
oking for both experience reports and in-depth technical talks.

Experience reports are typically 25 minutes long (but negotiable), and aim =
to inform participants about how functional programming plays out in real-w=
orld applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights gain=
ed. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical; reflections on th=
e commercial, management, or software engineering aspects are, if anything,=
 more important.

Technical talks are also 25 minutes long (also negotiable), and should focu=
s on teaching the audience something about a particular technique or method=
ology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play out in practi=
ce. These talks could cover anything from techniques for building functiona=
l concurrent applications, to managing dynamic reconfigurations, to design =
recipes for using types effectively in large-scale applications. While thes=
e talks will often be based on a particular language, they should be access=
ible to a broad range of programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do so, p=
lease fill in the form at

   https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/cufp

There will be a short scribes report of the presentations and discussions b=
ut not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting is intended to be=
 more a discussion forum than a technical interchange. You do not need to s=
ubmit a paper, just a proposal for your talk! Note that we will need all pr=
esenters to register for the CUFP workshop and travel to Boston at their ow=
n expense.

us years, take a look at the CUFP website at http://cufp.org. Note that pre=

 July 16th.

Guidance on giving a great CUFP talk

Focus on the interesting bits: Think about what will distinguish your talk,=
 and what will engage the audience, and focus there. There are a number of =
places to look for those interesting bits.

* Setting: FP is pretty well established in some areas, including formal ve=
rification, financial processing and server-side web-services. An unusual s=
etting can be a source of interest. If you're deploying FP-based mobile UIs=
 or building servers on oil rigs, then the challenges of that scenario are =
worth focusing on. Did FP help or hinder in adapting to the setting?

* Technology: The CUFP audience is hungry to learn about how FP techniques =
work in practice. What design patterns have you applied, and to what areas?=
 Did you use functional reactive programming for user interfaces, or DSLs f=
or playing chess, or fault-tolerant actors for large scale geological data =
processing? Teach us something about the techniques you used, and why we sh=
ould consider using them ourselves.

* Getting things done: How did you deal with large software development in =
the absence of a myriad of pre-existing support that are often expected in =
larger commercial environments (IDEs, coverage tools, debuggers, profilers)=
 and without larger, proven bodies of libraries? Did you hit any brick wall=
s that required support from the community?

* Don't just be a cheerleader: It's easy to write a rah-rah talk about how =
well FP worked for you, but CUFP is more interesting when the talks also sp=
end time on what doesn't work. Even when the results were all great, you sh=
ould spend more time on the challenges along the way than on the parts that=
 went smoothly.
