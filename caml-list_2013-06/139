Subject: [Caml-list] Ocaml on windows

Hi,

I am looking to use ocaml to implement a project for my employer. However, the
environment is Windows OS. I am using cygwin and so far it seems to work but
curious on experiences others have on using ocaml on windows - both as a
development and deployment platform. Also has anyone tried using opam on
windows? Does it work?

Bikal
