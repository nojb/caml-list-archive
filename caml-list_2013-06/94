Subject: Re: [opam-devel] [Caml-list] Setting up OPAM in emacs

I don't use Emacs, but OPAM has several global command-line options that
may make your OS^H^Heditor integration easier.

* --root will set the home directory of OPAM (~/.opam by default)

* --switch will explicitly run the command under a compiler switch that
  isn't the default one, but without performing a global switch.

* "opam config exec" will run the sub-command with the right environment
  variables set to the selected switch.  So:

    $ opam config exec "ocamlc -version"

  will get the version of the current OPAM switch ocaml, irrespective
  of your PATH settings. (This is what Leo is doing for his interactive
  shell below, but I'm not sure how this interacts with the rest of=20
  Tuareg).

I would appreciate an Emacs user summarising best practises here and
letting me know so that I can include a short summary in Real World OCaml.

best,
Anil
