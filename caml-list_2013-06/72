http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780123869807

"The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a 
spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of 
a Turing machine." -TIME Magazine

In one accessible volume, this book presents the most significant original 
works from the 4-volume set of A.M Turing's collected works, along with 
key commentary from over 70 great scholarly leaders in the field, 
providing interested readers with unique insight into the context and 
significance of Turing's impact on mathematics, computing, computer 
science, informatics, morphogenesis, philosophy and the wider scientific 
world.

This remarkable volume is an essential addition to any library, private or 
institutional.

* See below for an engrossing article from Elsevier Connect on the book 
and its genesis:

- New book spotlights Alan Turing, Nazi code-breaker and 'father of 
computer science'
- Turing's work has influenced scholars in many fields; Editor Barry 
Cooper talks about compiling their commentary along with Turing's writing
