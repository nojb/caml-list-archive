Subject: [Caml-list] ANN: Real World OCaml beta1 available

Yaron Minsky, Jason Hickey and I are pleased to announce the beta release of
our forthcoming O'Reilly book, called "Real World OCaml", available online =
at
http://realworldocaml.org

The book is split into three parts: language concepts, tools and techniques,
and understanding the runtime.  As promised last year, we are making a publ=
ic
beta available for community review and to help us hunt down inaccuracies a=
nd
find areas that need more clarification.

We've had the book in closed alpha for six months or so and have developed a
feedback system that uses Github to record your comments. This lets us foll=
ow
up to each review with clarifications and keep track of our progress in fix=
ing
issues.  During alpha, we've received over 1400 comments in this fashion (a=
nd
addressed the vast majority of them!).  However, since we anticipate more
comments coming in from a public beta, we would request that you read the F=
AQ
to avoid drowning us in repeat comments: http://www.realworldocaml.org/#faq

(TL;DR followup another comment on Github directly if you can instead of
creating a new issue via the web interface)

This release is available in HTML format online at:
   http://www.realworldocaml.org

O'Reilly is currently preparing a Rough Cuts release that will make the beta
available as PDF and in popular eBook formats.   We anticipate that this wi=
ll
be available later this week, and I'll send a followup when that happens.

Finally, we would especially like to thank our alpha reviewers.  Their feed=
back
(https://github.com/ocamllabs/rwo-comments/issues) has been invaluable to t=
he
beta release. The book also includes substantial contributions to individual
chapters from Jeremy Yallop (FFI), Stephen Weeks (GC) and Leo White (object=
s).

If you have any comments that you'd like to send directly by e-mail, please
contact us at rwo-authors@recoil.org.

Release notes for beta1:

* The first-class modules chapter is incomplete, pending some portability
  improvements to the ocaml-plugins Core library.
* The binary serialization chapter is also incomplete, but has just enough
  to teach you about the Async RPC library.
* The installation chapter will be revised in anticipation of the OCaml 4.1
  release, and is currently quite source-based.
* The packaging and build systems chapter hasn't been started yet.  We're
  still deciding whether or not to make this an online pointer rather than
  a print chapter, since it's likely to change quite fast.
* We are preparing exercises per chapter that are not included in this
  particular beta release, but will be available online as soon as possible.
* The code examples will all be clonable as a separate repository in beta2.

best,
Yaron, Jason and Anil
