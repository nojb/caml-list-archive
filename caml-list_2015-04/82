Sorry, I didn't follow the whole discussion but... this looks like
hardcoding a special treatment of plugins for the native case,
forgetting the bytecode case. Would you introduce byte_plugin (or a
bytecode counterpart to "shared" which looks bad to me) as well? Even
code using Dynlink should be as generic (w.r.t. native/bytecode) as
possible...
