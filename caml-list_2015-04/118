Subject: [Caml-list] [CFP] FLOPS 2016


FLOPS 2016: 13th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming
March 3-6, 2016, Kochi, Japan

Call For Papers             http://www.info.kochi-tech.ac.jp/FLOPS2016/

Writing down detailed computational steps is not the only way of
programming. The alternative, being used increasingly in practice, is
to start by writing down the desired properties of the result. The
computational steps are then (semi-)automatically derived from these
higher-level specifications. Examples of this declarative style
include functional and logic programming, program transformation and
re-writing, and extracting programs from proofs of their correctness.

FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and
implementors of the declarative programming, to discuss mutually
interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their
implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of
these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the
design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching
of declarative programming.  FLOPS specifically aims to
promote cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among
different styles of declarative programming.

Scope

FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of the declarative
programming:
 * functional, logic, functional-logic programming, re-writing
   systems, formal methods and model checking, program transformations
   and program refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem
   provers or SAT/SMT solvers;
 * foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation
   techniques, memory management, run-time systems), applications and
   case studies.

FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of
declarative programming. Therefore, submissions must be written to be
understandable by the wide audience of declarative programmers and
researchers. Submission of system descriptions and declarative pearls
are especially encouraged.

Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:
 * Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will
   be judged on originality, correctness, and significance.
 * System descriptions: they should contain a link to a working
   system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.
 * Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or
   theories with illustrative applications.
System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked
as such in the title.

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted. See also ACM SIGPLAN
Republication Policy.

The proceedings will be published by Springer International Publishing
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as a printed
volume as well as online in the digital library SpringerLink. 

Post-proceedings: The authors of 4-7 best papers will be invited to
submit the extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue of
the journal Science of Computer Programming (SCP).


Important dates

Monday, September 14, 2015 (any time zone): Submission deadline
Monday, November 16, 2015:                  Author notification
March 3-6, 2016:                            FLOPS Symposium
March 7-9, 2016:                            PPL Workshop


Submission

Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages long
including references, though pearls are typically shorter. The
formatting has to conform to Springer's guidelines.  Regular research
papers should be supported by proofs and/or experimental results. In
case of lack of space, this supporting information should be made
accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to a Web page, or an appendix).

Papers should be submitted electronically at
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2016
