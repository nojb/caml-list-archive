Hi Kenneth,

If the expression, that you=92re trying to simplify is actually a BAP=92s B=
IL, then there=92re some optimizations in the `Bil` module. The most intere=
sting is constant folding and purging unused variables. You can also use fi=
xpoint function to drive the optimization passes.=20

In any case, even if it is not a BIL, you can look at BAP=92s constant fold=
er class.=20

Best wishes
Ivan=20
