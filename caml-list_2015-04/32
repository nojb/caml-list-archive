Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Reduce Inequality and Program in OCaml!

Is the company already using OCaml?  If so, would you be able to submit a P=
R to the Companies page on ocaml.org [1, 2]?

The description just needs to be brief and it's better to mention where/how=
 OCaml is being used.  You can look through the other examples to get an id=
ea of what to include.

Thanks,
Amir
