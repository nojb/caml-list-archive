	Aims and scope

Biomedical research is currently facing the Big Data wave created by the hu=
ge amount of experiments performed every day in omics sciences. This new si=
tuation demands appropriate IT-infrastructures and scalable software to ana=
lyse data within an acceptable timespan. Massive parallel clusters, distrib=
uted technologies, on-Chip solutions such as GPGPU and Xeon Phi must be exp=
loited with adequate algorithmic solutions to reach their full potential.

The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers interested=
 in cutting-edge methods to address the challenges posed by the huge amount=
 of data produced in omics sciences and in application to systems and synth=
etic biology. The track aims to present latest advancements concerning High=
 Performance Computing solutions required to treat multi-omics Bid Data and=
 to support the various Large-Scale challenges of current computational bio=
logy.

Relevant topics within this context include all the field of Next-Generatio=
n Sequencing data analysis and interpretation, Genomics patterns identifica=
tion and mining, Transcriptomics and Proteomics data integration, Systems B=
iology models simulation and optimization, Structural Biology and Molecular=
 Dynamics, Synthetic Biology circuits design and simulation.

	Submissions=20

Conference papers must be prepared following the guidelines illustrated on =
the CIBB website, which include the requirement of being between 4 and 6 pa=
ges in length and having five sections:

1. Scientific background
2. Material and methods
3. Results
4. Conclusion
5. References (no more than 10)

These papers should be submitted in PDF format on the Easy Chair conference=
 system (it is necessary to select this special session in the submission s=
ystem).

A second submission after the conference, in an extended version, is requir=
ed to be considered for publication in the Springer=E2=80=99s Lecture Notes=
 in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGW=
ID=3D0-164-6-73658-0). Moreover, as it has been the case in previous CIBB c=
onferences, we are planning to publish the best papers of CIBB 2015 in an e=
xtended form in a special issue of an international scientific journal, inc=
luding special session papers.

About the organisers

Dr. Andrea Bracciali is currently a SICSA lecturer at the Department of Com=
puting Science and Mathematics of the University of Stirling (from August 2=
010). Before that, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at CNR, Italy (20=
09-2010) in the Applied Formal Methods group, and at the Computer Science D=
epartment of the University of Pisa (2003-2008), where he received his Ph.D=
. (2003) in Computer Science. His main research interests are centred in th=
e formal description of interaction in computing with application for Syste=
ms Biology and Crowd Dynamics. His main research interests regard the forma=
l description of interaction in computational systems and theories and tool=
s for reasoning about such descriptions. This stream of research spawns for=
m Theoretical Computer Science, Concurrency Theory and, more recently, Syst=
ems Biology.

Dr. Ivan Merelli is currently research fellow at the Institute for Biomedic=
al Technologies (ITB) of the National Research Council (CNR) in the Bioinfo=
rmatics Division. He received his Master of Science in Biomedical Engineeri=
ng from the Politecnico di Milano, with a thesis about molecular surface mo=
delling and analysis. In February 2009 he received a PhD in Computer Scienc=
e from the university of Milano - Bicocca with a research project about sur=
face matching for macromolecular docking and functional annotation. His res=
earch activities concern the development of software for sequence based gen=
omics and for structural proteomics research, with particular interest in p=
rotein-protein interactions. He works actively on the implementation of hig=
h performance bioinformatics software using cluster infrastructures and gri=
d distributed platforms. He has been involved in the development of databas=
es and computational solutions for projects of Integrative System Biology, =
gene expression analyses and drug discovery.

Dr. Mario Guarracino is researcher at High Performance Computing and Networ=
king Institute of the Italian National Research Council. He received a PhD =
in Mathematics defending a thesis on projection techniques for parallel spa=
rse linear algebra and an Ms in Applied Mathematics. His postdoctoral train=
ing from National Research Council focused on low cost high performance arc=
hitectures for scientific computing. He has been collaborating with Center =
for Applied Optimization at University of Florida since 2005. He has taught=
 various undergraduate courses in both computer science and mathematics. Hi=
s research interests include machine learning methods for computational bio=
logy and planning and development of high performance computational compone=
nts for parallel and distributed problem solving environments. He is author=
 of publications in the field of high performance scientific computing, com=
putational biology and machine learning.
