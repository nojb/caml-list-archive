Subject: [Caml-list] TABLEAUX - Call for Papers

                     SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS 
  
                         TABLEAUX 2015

         24th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with
                Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods

                Wroclaw, Poland, September 21-24, 2015

                   http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl/


GENERAL INFORMATION
   TABLEAUX 2015 is the 24th in the series of international meetings
   on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods,
   and will be held in Wroclaw, Poland, during September 21-24, 2015.

   TABLEAUX 2015 will be co-located with the 10th International Symposium
   on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2015).

   The computer science institute of Wroclaw has a large experience
   in hosting international conferences. It has hosted 
   the IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2007), 
   the 24th International Conference on Automated Deduction 
   (CADE 2011), and the 22nd European Symposium on Algorithms (ALGO 2014).

TOPICS
   Tableaux methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools 
   for automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical
   logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large 
   groups of logics, tableaux methods can be generated automatically. 
   Areas of application include verification of software and computer
   systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its required 
   inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.
   The conference series aims to bring together researchers interested in all
   aspects of tableaux - theoretical foundations, applications, 
   and implementation techniques. 

     * tableaux methods for classical and non-classical logics 
       (e.g. modal, temporal, description, intuitionistic, substructural, 
       fuzzy, paraconsistent logics) and their proof theoretic 
       foundations.
     * related methods (model elimination, model checking, connection
       methods, resolution, BDDs).
     * sequent calculi for classical and non-classical logics,
       as tools for proof search and proof representation. 
     * flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem proving.
     * novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification
       in classical and non-classical logics.
     * systems, tools, implementations and applications (provers,
       logical frameworks, model checkers, ... ).
     * implementation techniques (data structures, efficient algorithms,
       performance measurement, extendibility, ... ).
     * extensions of tableaux procedures with conflict-driven learning, 
       generation of proofs; compact (or humanly readable) representation
       of proofs. 
     * decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures.
     * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software 
       development, protocol verification, or teaching. 

   TABLEAUX 2015 also welcomes papers describing applications of tableaux
   procedures to real world examples. Such papers should be tailored to 
   the tableaux community and should focus on the role of reasoning, 
   and logical aspects of the solution.

SUBMISSIONS
   Submissions are invited in two categories:

     A  Research papers, which describe original theoretical research, 
        original algorithms, or applications, with length 
        up to 15 pages.
     B  System descriptions, with length up to 10 pages.

   Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly will help of
   external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance
   and originality.

   For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be original,
   and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions will be reviewed 
   taking into account correctness, theoretical prettyness, and possible
   implementability. 

   For category B submissions, a working implementation 
   must be available on the internet, which includes sources. 
   The aim of a system description is to make the system available
   in such a way that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.

   Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the conference 
   proceedings (within the LNAI series of Springer).

   For accepted papers in both of the categories, at least one author 
   is required to attend the conference and present the paper. 

   Further information and instructions about submissions can be found
   on the conference website http://tableaux2015.ii.uni.wroc.pl
