AIMS:

SLSP is a yearly conference series aimed at promoting and displaying excell=
ent research on the wide spectrum of statistical methods that are currently=
 in use in computational language or speech processing. It aims at attracti=
ng contributions from both fields. Though there exist large, well-known con=
ferences and workshops hosting contributions to any of these areas, SLSP is=
 a more focused meeting where synergies between subdomains and people will =
hopefully happen. In SLSP 2015, significant room will be reserved to young =
scholars at the beginning of their career and particular focus will be put =
on methodology.

VENUE:

SLSP 2015 will take place in Budapest, on the banks of the Danube and an ex=
tensive UNESCO World Heritage site. The venue will be the Faculty of Electr=
ical Engineering and Informatics of the Budapest University of Technology a=
nd Economics.

SCOPE:

The conference invites submissions discussing the employment of statistical=
 models (including machine learning) within language and speech processing.=
 Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limi=
ted to:

anaphora and coreference resolution
authorship identification, plagiarism and spam filtering
computer-aided translation
corpora and language resources
data mining and semantic web
information extraction
information retrieval
knowledge representation and ontologies
lexicons and dictionaries
machine translation
multimodal technologies
natural language understanding
opinion mining and sentiment analysis
parsing
part-of-speech tagging
question-answering systems
semantic role labelling
speaker identification and verification
speech and language generation
speech recognition
speech synthesis
speech transcription
spelling correction
spoken dialogue systems
term extraction
text categorisation
text summarisation
user modeling
