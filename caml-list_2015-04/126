Hello list,

I developed since about a year a tools named OcLaunch. It allow to
spread launch of program across session, each time a terminal (or
anything else) is called.
For example, you may want to launch a client chat and several TODO list,
and then verify update. If add all to your .bashrc, the output will be
displayed every time it is sourced, i. e. each time you open a terminal.
What a mess!
With OcLaunch, these commands are launched one at time. So

  * You open your first terminal: the client chat is launched
  * You open the second one: a TODO list is displayed
  * ... and so on

An other advantage is that your reminder are spread across your session,
which remind you important task several times and may limit procrastination!

Official website is http://oclaunch.tuxfamily.org/home.html. You can
find a demo video if the purpose of OcLaunch is not clear and several
resources.

Email me if you need some help or to give feedback.

Leo
