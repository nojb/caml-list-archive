Subject: [Caml-list] Call for papers - SR 2015: Strategic Reasoning (Oxford,
 UK)

Our apologies if you have received multiple copies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                    SR 2015 - Call For Papers

        3rd International Workshop on Strategic Reasoning

                  Oxford, 21-22 September, 2015

        https://sites.google.com/site/sr2015homepage/home

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic reasoning is one of the most active research areas in the
multi-agent system domain. The literature in this field is extensive
and provides a plethora of logics for modelling strategic
ability. Theoretical results are now being used in many exciting
domains, including software tools for information system security,
robot teams with sophisticated adaptive strategies, and automatic
players capable of beating expert human adversary, just to cite a
few. All these examples share the challenge of developing novel
theories and tools for agent strategies that take into account the
likely behaviour of adversaries. The SR international workshop aims to
bring together researchers working on different aspects of strategic
reasoning in computer science, artificial intelligence and multi-agent
systems research, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TOPICS OF INTEREST.

The topics covered by SR include, but are not limited to, the
following:

  * Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;
  * Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;
  * Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;
  * Strategic reasoning in formal verification;
  * Automata theory for strategy synthesis;
  * Strategic reasoning under perfect and imperfect information;
  * Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;
  * Robust planning and optimisation in multi-agent systems;
  * Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;
  * Quantitative aspects of strategic reasoning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INVITED SPEAKERS.

Speakers so far confirmed include:

  * Johan van Benthem, University of Amsterdam/Stanford University
  * Joseph Halpern, Cornell University 
  * Marta Kwiatkowska, University of Oxford
  * Moshe Vardi, Rice University

----------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES. 

  * June 1st, 2015: Submission opening

  * July 1st, 2015 (strict): Abstract submission deadline
  * July 3rd, 2015 (strict): Paper submission deadline

  * July 31st, 2015: Acceptance notification
  * August 14th, 2015: Camera-ready version deadline

  * September 21st-22nd, 2015: SR 2015 workshop

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMISSION.

Extended abstracts should be submitted not exceeding 10 pages (plus
references) in the EPTCS format. If necessary, the work may be
supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be consulted
at the discretion of the PC.  Submissions must be in PDF format and
will be handled via EasyChair, using the following link:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2015

Two types of submission are invited:

  * contributions reporting on novel research;
  * expository contributions reporting on published work.

Each submission should be clearly identified as belonging to one
category or the other. In both categories, strong preference will be
given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary
audience and all contributions should be written so that they are
accessible to such an audience.

Extended abstracts will be held to the usual high standards of
research publications. In particular, they should contain enough
information to enable the PC to identify the main contribution of the
work, explain the significance of the work, its novelty, and its
practical or theoretical implications, and include comparisons with
and references to relevant literature.

Expository abstracts, which will be evaluated using similar high
standards, may survey an area or report on more specific previously
published work.

Submissions should make clear the relevance to the strategic reasoning
audience.

Submissions from PC members are also allowed. Note that, since the
workshop will have informal proceedings, extended versions of the
accepted papers can also be submitted elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEEDINGS. 

The workshop proceedings will be available as a single PDF file from
the workshop website. Extended and revised versions of the best papers
presented in the last two editions of SR have been invited for a
special issue of the Journal of Information and Computation. 
In SR 2015, we plan to do the same.
