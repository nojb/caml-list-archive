Subject: Re: [Caml-list] META file standards for ppx extensions

I'm not fond of b). ppx_deriving et ppx_import don't follow this scheme, 
and that's rather understandable given the absence of runtime library.

Otherwise yes. lwt, js_of_ocaml follow that and it was widely adopted 
for camlp4, so it shouldn't be an issue.
