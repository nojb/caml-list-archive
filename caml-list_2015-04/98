I agree with David that use of the term "retarded" is offensive and
inappropriate in this or pretty much any context. "Mental retardation" was
until quite recently (and in some places still is) an official sanctioned
medical definition and using it to mean "clearly wrong", "unpleasant" or
"not worth dealing with" is to tell people who had been diagnosed with that
condition that they are clearly wrong, unpleasant, or not worth dealing
with. Regardless of your opinion about autoconf, that's clearly not
something that any of us want.
