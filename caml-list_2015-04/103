Subject: [Caml-list] CICM 2015 - Call for Work-in-Progress Papers

                   Call for Work-in-Progress Papers

            Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
                              CICM 2015

                           13-17 July 2015
                          Washington DC, USA


Digital and  computational solutions are becoming  the prevalent means
for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of
mathematical  information.  Separate  communities  have  developed  to
investigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,
automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user
interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their
integration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added
value.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)
offers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great
challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.

CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating
related   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these
subjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),
Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),
Bremen (Germany 2012), Bath (UK 2013), and Coimbra (Portugal 2014).

This is a (short version of  the) call for Work-in-Progress papers for
CICM 2015,  which will be held  in Washington, D.C., 13-17  July 2015.
We  solicit  for  papers  which  describe  work  in  progress,  recent
developments, and other work of interest to our communities which does
not yet have the maturity for archival proceedings.

The full version of the CFP  is available from the conference web page
at http://cicm-conference.org/2015/cicm.php

**********************************************************************
