Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml Workshop 2015: 2nd CFP

[This is the second CFP for OCaml 2015. It will be the last unless
there is a deadline extension.]
==============================================================================

                              OCAML 2015
               The  OCaml Users and Developers Workshop
                http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2015/
                 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
                         September 4, 2015

                        CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

                      Co-located with ICFP 2015
                         Sponsored by SIGPLAN
           Talk Proposal Submission Deadline: May 18, 2015

==============================================================================

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together industrial users of
OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending the language,
type system and tools.
Previous editions have been colocated with ICFP 2012 in Copenhagen,
ICFP 2013 in Boston, ICFP 2014 in Gothenburg, following the OCaml
Meetings in Paris in 2010 and 2011. OCaml 2015 will be held on
September 4, 2015 in Vancouver, colocated with ICFP 2015.

Scope
=====

Discussions will focus on the practical aspects of OCaml programming and
the nitty gritty of the tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes.
Thus, we aim to solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use
or development of the language and of its programming environment,
including, for example:

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not limited to)
 GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
 situations.

Submission
==========

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
meeting, but no formal proceedings. Slides of presentations will be
available online from the workshop homepage. The presentations will
likely be recorded, and made available at a later time.

To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2 pages
long) at https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ocaml2015, providing a
clear statement of what will be brought by the talk: the problems that are
addressed, the technical solutions or methods that are proposed. If you
wish to perform a demo or require any special setup, we will do our best to
accommodate you.

Schedule
========

Monday 18th May (any time zone)   Abstract submission deadline
Monday 29th June                  Author notification
Friday 4th September 2015         OCaml Workshop

ML family workshop and post-proceedings
=======================================

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with general issues
of the ML-style programming and type systems, and is seen as more research-
oriented. Yet there is an overlap with the OCaml workshop, which we are
keen to explore, for instance by having a common session.  The authors who
feel their submission fits both workshops are encouraged to mention it at
submission time and/or contact the Program Chairs.

As another form of cooperation, we are considering combined post-conference
proceedings of selected papers from the two workshops. The Program
Committees shall invite interested authors of selected presentations to
expand their abstract for inclusion in the proceedings. The submissions
would be reviewed according to the standards of the publication.
