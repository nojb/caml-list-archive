-------------------------------------------------
AI4FM 2015 - the 6th International Workshop on
the use of AI in Formal Methods

  http://www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2015/

Edinburgh, 1st September, 2015
In association with AVoCS 2015
https://sites.google.com/site/avocs15
-------------------------------------------------
  --- First Call for Contributions ---

Important Dates
---------------
Submission deadline: 1st August, 2015
Notification of acceptance: 10th August, 2015
Final version due: 21st August, 2015
Workshop: 1st September, 2015

General
---------------
This workshop will bring together researchers from formal methods,=20
automated reasoning and AI; it will address the issue of how AI can=20
be used to support the formal software development process, including=20
requirement analysis, modelling and proof. Previous AI4FM workshops=20
have included a mix of industrial and academic participants and we=20
anticipate attracting a similarly diverse audience.=20

Rigorous software development using formal methods allows the construction=
=20
of an accurate characterisation of a problem domain that is firmly based=20
on mathematics; by applying standard mathematical analyses, these methods=20
can be used to prove that systems satisfy formal specifications. Research=20
has shown that with tools backed by mature theory, formal methods are=20
becoming cost effective and their use is easier to justify, not as an=20
academic exercise, legal requirement or niche markets -- but as part of=20
a business case. However, while industrial use of formal methods is=20
increasing, in order to make it more mainstream, the cost of applying=20
formal methods, in terms of mathematical skill level and development=20
time, must still be reduced. We believe that AI can help with these=20
issues.


Scope
---------------
We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under
development, and PhD projects, in order that the workshop can become=20
a forum for active dialogue between the groups involved in  automated=20
reasoning, formal methods and artificial intelligence.  Particular=20
areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

- The use of AI and automated reasoning to support and guide the formal=20
modelling process.
- The use of AI and automated reasoning in the requirement capture process.
- The use of AI to reuse formal models, programs and proofs.
- The use of machine learning to support interactive theorem proving.
- The use of machine learning to enhance automated theorem proving.
- The development of search heuristics.
- The use of AI for term synthesis, invariant generation, lemma discovery=20
and concept invention.
- The use of AI for counter-example generation.
- The use of constraint solvers in formal methods.=20
- The role of AI planning for formal systems developments, from requirement=
s=20
to the end product (including software and hardware).
- The interplay between reasoning and modelling and the role of AI in this=
=20
framework.
- Ontologies in the formal engineering process.
- Novel ideas on how to use AI (e.g. machine learning, pattern recognition)=
=20
in proof automation.
- Use of cloud elasticity for: scalability on large scale developments,=20
proof/lemma exploration.
- Techniques for bridging the development to maintenance gap.
=20
We want to continue the area of research beyond our sponsored project=20
(at Newcastle and Edinburgh universities), which has come to an end.
This means we would particularly encourage the submission of position=20
papers on new ideas or research directions for the use of AI techniques=20
in the proof discovery process as well as in modelling best practices.=20

Student grants
---------------

Thanks to sponsorships from FME and SICSA we can offer financial support=20
for a limited number of students registering for AVoCS in the form of a=20
registration fee waiver (full or partial). As this is limited, we ask the s=
tudents=20
that would like to take the advantage of this support to submit a short app=
lication.=20
The details on how to apply will be available in due course from the AVoCS=
=20
webpage.

History
---------------
This will be the fifth workshop in the series. Previous workshops were held=
 at:
- Singapore, May 2014 @ FM (www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2014/)
- Rennes, France, July 2013 @ ITP (www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2013/)
- Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany, July 2012 (www.dagstuhl.de/12271)
- Edinburgh, UK, April 2011 (www.ai4fm.org/ai4fm-2011.php)
- Newcastle, UK, May 2010 (www.ai4fm.org/ko-meeting.php)


Submission
---------------
The main aim for the workshop is discussion, thus submissions do not=20
need to be original. Extended versions of submissions may have been=20
published previously, or submitted concurrently with or after AI4FM=20
2015 to another workshop, conference or a journal.

Submission is by email to:

ai4fm2015@ai4fm.org

Please submit an abstract up to 3 pages in a PDF format. The extended=20
abstracts will be handed out to all participants, and will be made=20
into a technical report prior to the workshop.=20

Acceptance for presentation at the workshop will be made by the=20
organisers based on relevance to the workshop.
