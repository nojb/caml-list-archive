Subject: Re: [Caml-list] inconsistent assumptions over interface

According to the message, my guess is that you are trying to link a 
server file with a client library while having compiled it with the 
server library.
Since client and server libraries don't have the same type, they 
disagree over the interface.

My wild guess would be that your build script is broken.
