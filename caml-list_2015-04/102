*** Call for Papers ***

2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing
(BDC 2015)

December 07-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

Co-located with the 8th IEEE/ACM International Conference
on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2015)

http://datasys.cs.iit.edu/events/BDC2015/


CONTEXT AND SCOPE

Rapid advances in digital sensors, networks, storage, and computation along
with their availability at low cost is leading to the creation of huge coll=
ections
of data -- dubbed as Big Data. This data has the potential for enabling new
insights that can change the way business, science, and governments deliver
services to their consumers and can impact society as a whole. This has led
to the emergence of the Big Data Computing paradigm focusing on sensing,
collection, storage, management and analysis of data from variety of sources
to enable new value and insights.

To realize the full potential of Big Data Computing, we need to address
several challenges and develop suitable conceptual and technological
solutions for dealing them. These include life-cycle management of data,
large-scale storage, flexible processing infrastructure, data modeling,
scalable machine learning and data analysis algorithms, techniques for
sampling and making trade-off between data processing time and accuracy,
and dealing with privacy and ethical issues involved in data sensing, stora=
ge,
processing, and actions.

The International Symposium on Big Data Computing (BDC) 2015 -- held in
conjunction with 8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud
Computing (UCC) 2015, December 7-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol,
Cyprus, aims at bringing together international researchers, developers,
policy makers, and users and to provide an international forum to present
leading research activities, technical solutions, and results on a broad ra=
nge
of topics related to Big Data Computing paradigms, platforms and their
applications. The conference features keynotes, technical presentations,
posters, and workshops.

PAPER SUBMISSION

Authors are invited to submit papers electronically. Submitted manuscripts
should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed 10 letter size
(8.5 x 11) pages including figures, tables and references. Authors should
submit the manuscript in PDF format and make sure that the file will print
on a printer that uses letter size (8.5 x 11) paper. The official language =
of
the meeting is English. All manuscripts will be reviewed and will be judged
on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, quality of
presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Papers
conforming to the above guidelines can be submitted through the BDC 2015
paper submission system:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dbdc2015).

Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not
currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not
following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further acti=
on
may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the head=
s of
the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference. Submissions
received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately
structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the conference
PC Chair for more information.

At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in
order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. There is NO student
rate for the author who is responsible for registration for his/her publish=
ed
paper. If you have more than one accepted paper, you have to register for
each one individually. There is no discount if you have two or more papers
accepted. Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a
requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the
conference will not be included in IEEE  Xplore.


SPECIAL ISSUES

Selected papers from BDC 2015 will be invited to extend and submit to the
Special Issue on Big Data Computing in the IEEE Transaction on Cloud
Computing.
