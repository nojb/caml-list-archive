Gerd, do you think that something that does that could be added to ocamlfin=
d? One tricky thing is to<br>
know the library statically linked (ie. `Ocsigen_config.builtin_<u></u>pack=
ages`), perhaps ocamlfind can<br>
during linking add this information.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
I think so. For toploops, there is already code that tracks libraries<br>
already linked into the executable (i.e. if you ocamlmktop your<br>
toploop).<br>
</span></blockquote>
<br>
All was already in place indeed! It was easy to add. I kept caml-list in CC=
 for discussing the big picture in order to get comments from people. Is ma=
il still your preferred way of receiving patch?<br>
<br>
I kept it simple, no hack (no automatic: cmxa -&gt; cmxs) because I prefer =
problems in library META to be found than to be paper over.<br>
<br>
The first patch adds:<br>
- A library `findlib.dynlink` that depends on `findlib` and `dynlink`<br>
- During linking (using `ocamlfind ocaml*`) if `-package findlib.dynlink` a=
nd `-linkpkg` are used then a module `Findlib_initl...` is linked after all=
 packages and it stores the names of packages linked in `Findlib.linked_pac=
kages`.<br>
- In the main program `Fl_dynlink.load_packages [&quot;yojson&quot;]` can b=
e used to dynlink packages<br>
<br>
The second patch forbids to run `Fl_dynlink.load_packages` during the initi=
alization of packages (statically or dynamically linked), because `Findlib_=
initl...` is not yet run and because if you want to load a package that dep=
end on a statically linked package not yet initialized, there is no sane se=
mantic.<br>
<br>
Problems:<br>
- The package is named `findlib.dynlink`, the archive `<a href=3D"http://fi=
ndlib_dynlink.cm" target=3D"_blank">findlib_dynlink.cm</a>*` and the module=
 `Fl_dynlink` ...<br>
- If you don&#39;t use `-linkall` static packages could only be partially l=
inked, and you can&#39;t link the remaining part later. So perhaps `-linkal=
l` must be automatically added if `findlib.dynlink` is used.<br>
- If you define `archive(native)` and not `archive(native,plugin)` the erro=
r is not nice (in Dynlink.Error). Perhaps I should add a `Package_not_dynam=
ically_<u></u>loadable of string` error, that should catch the loading of s=
omething else than `*.cmxs`.<br>
- Often you link your binary with your own library without using `-package`=
 (the library is not yet installed), and plugins for your tools depend on y=
our library. Currently you should do before any `Fl_dynlink.load_packages`:=
 `Findlib.linked_packages :=3D &quot;mylib&quot;::Findlib.linked_<u></u>pac=
kages`. For simplicity, I don&#39;t know if I should add a function `Fl_dyn=
link.add_linked_<u></u>packages`, or an option to ocamlfind `-additional-pa=
ckage-<u></u>statically-linked `.<br>
- During the initialization of your own library (linked without -package) y=
ou should not use `Fl_dynlink.load_packages`, but the library doesn&#39;t p=
rotect you against this error.<br>
<br>
Choices:<br>
- If you don&#39;t link with `findlib.dynlink` or use `create_toploop`, the=
 variables `Findlib.linked_packages` and `Findlib.linked_predicates` are em=
pty because I don&#39;t wanted to add backward change by adding `Findlib_in=
itl...` when `findlib` is linked.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remains to do:<br>
- Fix problems<br>
- Documentations (add `plugin` in the list of standard predicates, ...)<br>
<br>
<br>
Gerg, what do you think of this first version of the patch? Of the way to f=
ix the problems?<br>
<br>
