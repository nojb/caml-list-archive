<seriousness>
Is there a market for such a thing?  Defense?  Secure operating systems?
What are all the tangible benefits?
</seriousness>

<humor>
What will the name fo the OS be?  SafeLix?  FreeBSafeD?
</humor>

<opinion>
Windows NT might already be part of the way there depending on how one views

And could Caml have also achieved it?
</opinion>

<fact>
Microsoft used Prolog in NT's network stack.
