Yes, MinGW port lacks that (as well as MSVC one -- that's Win32 without
fork() and other stuff). MSVC and MinGW ports support absolutely the same
set of OCaml libraries.

Hmm, IIRC standard 3.03 alpha contains only LablTk, not LablGTK. Yes, with
MinGW patch LablTk can be compiled out of the box. As for LablGTK, it
also should not be a problem -- gtk/Win32 does not rely on Cygwin...

MinGW port in fact do not need any extra support; it uses the same
sources as MSVC one (and even links with MS-supplied C runtime library
msvcrt.dll), and shares Make/Configure environment with all other Unixes. I
see no real problem here...

OK, I do not insist. It really may not worth your efforts. I just thought
that for people, who cannot/does not want to buy expensive and
multimegabyte MSVC but need C compiler under Win32 (for custom runtimes,
CamlIDL etc), native Win32 port of OCaml, compiled with gcc compiler, would
be very convenient...

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
