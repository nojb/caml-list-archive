I received another response that raised this same issue.

It's nice to know that the abstract Unix.inet_addr type is intended to 
represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  The current conversions to and 
from strings just deal with dot quads and don't seem to understand 
textual representations of IPv6 addresses yet, but I guess I can see the 
roadmap now.

Consider this:

	val inet_addr_of_octets: string -> inet_addr
	val octets_of_inet_addr: inet_addr -> string

If inet_addr_of_octets is applied to a string that isn't four or eight 
octets in length, then it can raise Invalid_arg.
