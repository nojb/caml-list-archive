No. The GPL is not retrospective. Consequently it can't climb the
deriviation tree to get at the Artistic code. Thus this is not a
modification of the GPL.

In any event, copyrights can only be held by individuals and or
registered organisations. The GPL itself is not such an entity.
The FSF is, but (in this argument) only as far as the GPL is
concerned.  Provided all authors agree, copyright restrictions can
be changed to anything thing they want at anytime. However, if they
do not agree, that portion which falls under the malcontents'
copyright must be completely excised.  The FSF is the copyright
holder of the GPL ("COPYING") and has not granted permission for
it to be modified or used in another in a non-GPL setting (including
by appending clauses).
