Patrick,
   Yes, there are examples for this, however, I haven't completed porting
the
graphical demos to the newer LablTk library.

   In any case, integrating networking with Tk isn't simple because you
need
to change the way alarms and timers work. This is handled in Ensemble by
an added layer of abstraction for alarms. You can take a look at how this
is done to get some ideas (file ensemble/trans/htk.ml).

     Ohad.

Hello,

I'm definitely interesting in network options for use on Windows
platforms. For the most part, I have found that the existing socket code
works well for me, but I have been unable to integrate this with a Tk
application.

Do you have any examples in Ensemble that work with Tk?

Thanks!
Patrick
