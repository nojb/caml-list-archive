This is the license from the runtime of the GNU Ada Compiler.  Note the
special exception.  Also this is GPL, with the exception:

--           Copyright (C) 1995-1998 Ada Core Technologies, Inc.            --

--                                                                          --

This seems to be working well.  It allows this library to be linked with
programs.  If someone wishes to incorporate the code, however, it
requires the GPL to be followed.

The wording would have to be changed from instantiating generics,
though.

This does also allow modifications.  If the person doing the
modifications also agrees to the exception.

I also believe this exception has been agreed upon by the FSF.
