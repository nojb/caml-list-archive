 In this case you sould have a WYSIWYG tool. But containers approach
is much better: you don't need to know anything about sizes - just do a 
widgets placing - pack them in lines, tables, lists, may be using a kinda
boxes and glue approach like in TeX...

 Hm... 500MHz Pentium-II is powerless? Be realistic...

 And you really want to produce a native compiled n-megabytes monster for
any small dialog? Why? Nothing can be lighter then scripts.

 And this solution is much better and elegant. ;)

 Tcl/Tk. Write your GUI in Tcl, and connect it to your OCaml application.
Application logic really MUST be separated from GUI, even if you only
calculates "2+2".

 Tk is a very old and widespread toolkit, so, I think, you will find
anything you want there.
