Subject: [Caml-list] Integrating Ensemble socket library?
To: caml-list@inria.fr

Somewhere in the Ensemble docs, I read that the Ensemble team did its own
implementation of the socket library which is evidently more efficient in time
and resources, and provides more complete socket support under Windows.

My first question is, has anyone successfully integrated the Ensemble socket
library (only - not the whole Ensemble system) with their ocaml development,
and if so, could you drop me some hints?  I have been struggling off and on to
build Ensemble from sources on my FreeBSD system without success.  (I'm stuck
in the maze of Ensemble makefiles and have not had the time to find my way
out.)

The second question is, has the OCaml team considered making the Ensemble
socket library part of the standard distribution?
