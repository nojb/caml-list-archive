This is feasible, I implemented them in Caml Light some years ago. But
in the implementaion of SML/NJ, continuations are "light" and natural
because their execution "stack" is implemented not by a stack but by a
list. To get the continuation, you has just to get the "stack pointer".
In OCaml, you should make a copy of the execution stack.

Why not using exceptions, then? Do you mean that you want to be able to
restart the same continuation several times?
