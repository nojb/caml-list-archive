I have read it again today, carefully, and still come to the same
conclusions:

  1. Users are allowed to reverse engineer the application

  2. Source (or possibly object files) for my application must be included
     in the distribution.

I could probably be convinced that object files are sufficient for
purposes of satisfying the license, but that just exposes the next major
problem (i.e. point #1).

The runtime source for OCaml must be included or a "written letter" must
be provided. That's quite a bit different than a link.

You also need to include either source (or again maybe object files) of
the application that uses the library.

It's not sufficient to simply ship a static executable and include a
notice where one can get the OCaml source code.

I agree that for open source commercial software, there are no problems.
This hardly represents the majority of commercial development though.

If this isn't an appropriate place to discuss issues with the Caml
license, where else is?
