But still (i have not looked at it) in the case of the str code, if it trully
uses GPLed code, which may be copyrigthed by the FSF, it may cause a problem,
since they would be much more willing to take actions, if it is ported to
their attention.

That said, i have not looked at this code directly, and it may not be a
problem.
