Subject: [Caml-list] camlidl and pointer to function

I have a C library function with interface like following:

typedef [abstract] void* SomeType;
typedef int (*CallBack)(int);
void convert( SomeType* in, SomeType* out, CallBack c);

It would be nice to use it in caml the following way:

external convert: someType->someType->(int->int)->unit = "something"
...
convert stIn stOut ((+) 1)
...

Unfortinately CamIDL language does not allow the pointer to function as a
valid type, but maybe there is some common solution/workaround for this
problem? Or the only way is writing necessary stubs and conversion
functions by hands? Is is possible at all?

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
