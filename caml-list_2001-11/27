No, no need to copy anything, just unleash the power of functors!

module IntHashtbl = Hashtbl.make(struct type t = int
                                        let equal = (==)
                                        let hash x = x land 0x3FFFFFFF
                                 end)

I'm not sure the performance gain is significant, but it's worth a try.
