Hi,

It works indeed. I was sure that it would not but I tested and there
is indeed a syntax error at "raise Foo 3".

It works, not because of priorities, but because the application is
defined as a list of simple expressions. If the construction "raise"
is defined as expression (not "simple"), it cannot be used in an
application.

I am a little bit surprised, because yacc sometimes bypass priorities
to avoid syntax errors: for example "comma" as more priority than "as":
        x, y as z
means
        (x, y) as z
but:
        function x, y as z, t -> x
is however accepted, althought it should be a syntax error at the
comma after "z".

This makes me wonder about camlp4, because to resolve this problem of
"comma" and "as", I added a rule to "try again" the continuation of a
grammar entry when a syntax error about priorities happens. And
because of that, I cannot prevent "raise Foo 3" to be accepted in
camlp4o.
