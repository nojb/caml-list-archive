Please read the licensing conditions for OCaml.  All parts that can be
linked with user's code (runtime, libraries) are distributed under the
LGPL, possibly with a future exception to clause 6 so that users can
link with this code without any additional requirements on their code.

The QPL covers only the OCaml compilers themselves -- and of course
not the code they generate.

Precisely.  That's why, say, putting the libraries under the GPL would
be unacceptable; and even putting them under the LGPL (without
exceptions) isn't quite enough to achieve this goal.
