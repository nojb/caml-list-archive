That's one of the memory management problems of Linux. It overcommits 
memory, i.e.
you can allocate more memory than you really have (including swap 
space). On the one
hand, this allows to better exhaust memory, but on the other hand, 
there is no
real criterion whether memory is out or not. In the best case, the 
process writing
to a memory page gets a segfault. The worst case is that the kernel 
needs itself
memory and begins to kill processes (this is what you see in the 
syslog).

See http://lwn.net/2000/0309/kernel.php3

Because ocamldebug checkpoints the program state by forking 
subprocesses, there are
a lot "copy-on-write" memory pages, so it is likely that you run into 
this problem.

Possible solutions:
- Increase swapspace
- Decrease the number of checkpoints of ocamldebug (set processcount, 
also set bigstep,
   set smallstep)
