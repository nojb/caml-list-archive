It would be interesting to compare FFTW's performance with the library that
I use for paralellized 2-D and 1-D FFT's written by Intel for the Pentium
architecture. I just ran a test of this based on comparisons from the Clean
list where they showed implementations ranging from 2 sec to 7 sec on a Sun
750 MHz (64 bit?). I ran my 1024 x 1024 2-D FFT on a Pentium II 350 MHz
single CPU under Win/NT 4.0 (SP6) and got times around 1.17 sec. (estimates
for the Sun workstation would be approx 4x speedup).
