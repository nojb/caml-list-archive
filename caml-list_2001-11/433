Okay, true enough. There is some loss of legal action a company can take,
but it is probably fine.

There are many ways to address the issue and this could be good
functionality to have. However, it's a lot less work to change the license
and let developers simply strip the binaries after compilation.

I brought up the topic of licensing as a status update. Xavier has said in
the past that the conditions in the LGPL are silly and I agree with him.
He also indicated that they would be looking into modifications in the
future. My intent was not to start a flamewar on license issues, although
they can be very hard to avoid with such a topic!
