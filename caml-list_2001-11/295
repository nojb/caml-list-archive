I had a conversation a couple days ago with a co-worker who is active in 
several IETF activities, and we were commiserating about the sorry state 
of industry efforts to transition away from IPv4 to IPv6.  I've almost 
convinced myself that it will never happen.  He's not nearly so 
pessimistic as me.

We agreed that one of things holding back development of IPv6 
applications are the crufty interfaces that C language programmers have 
as a result of extending the BSD sockets API in the way they did.

I'm very encouraged to see the Caml team taking appropriate steps to 
avoid that pitfall.  Very encouraged.  I had been planning to leave open 
support for AAAA or A6 resource records (whichever emerges as the 
standard) in my stub resolver, and now I have a better reason for doing 
the extra work.
