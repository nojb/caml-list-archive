A new Ensemble release is available. It is an experimental version that
has been primarily tested on Linux. It should work for other Unixes.
The code has been heavily tested, and I'm waiting for comments and bug reports.

All the best,
   Ohad.


     RELEASE_NOTES for Ensemble version 1.31

Author: Ohad Rodeh
Last updated: 13/11/2001

CHANGES

This experimental version contains an improved C-interface,
whose performance is identical to the native ML
interface. Zero-copying technology is used whereby
IO-vectors are passed between C and ML without copying.
This interface is named CE, short for "native Ensemble C interface".
CE has nothing to do with the old C interface, HOT.
An additional chapter was added to the tutorial explaining CE.

In detail:
1. The underlying routers, socket library, and reference counting
   code were completely rewritten.

2. The reference manual and tuturial were updated.

3. Removed 4-byte alignment restriction from the system.

4. No longer supported:
   - Mpi, Atm, and Sp2.
   - Threaded scheduling.
   - The Old ML interface.
   - Removed support for high-encryption, only RC4
     is natively supported. This is to abide by US encryption
     restrictions.
   -RPC code.

5. Small changes and bug fixes:
   - Fixed two race conditions in maestro (contributed by Mouna Seri)
   - Fixed the dbm demo.
   - Outboard now works only with TCP.
   - Catch EBUF error in HSYS.
   - Ported Tk to run on the new LablTk API. The life demo runs
     fine, the wbml does not (yet).
   - Pgp now works on WIN32.
   - A large number of small changes.

OCAML COMPILER VERSION
  We are using version 3.01 for this version.

PORTABILITY
  This version was tested on Linux only. It should run
fine on a Sparc/Solaris architecture, but will not run on WIN32 platforms.
