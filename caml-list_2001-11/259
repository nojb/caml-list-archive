Nope. When I left Snodfart a few classes were going from C++ to Java
but there were also transitions to C++. Realize that many (most?) hackers
don't come from CS departments but from engineering departments. Most 
programmers I meet have never heard of OCaml before, though almost all of
them have heard about it after :-).

No doubt there are more people exposed to Caml there.
