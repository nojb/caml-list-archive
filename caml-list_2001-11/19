Yes, I think so.

The O'Reilly-man told me, that the february-date is his
own estimation of a "ready-to-publish-in-the-web"-date
and that he don't want to make to much pressure on the
translating people.
And because his answer was directed to me - not a translator -
this would not cause pressure to me.

But if the translators were motivated by such a date,
that's good. I have no problem with publishing before
X-mas. If that is possible... ;-)

Ok, it was a personnel estimation, directed to an interested
person.

If that doesn't fit the actual translation-speed,
then please let me/us know it.

Because I'm not firm with french language I have
to wait with *really* programming in OCaml,
until the translation is available. I now can only
stumble around with Ocaml...

I don't think it's bad will.
