In addition to what has been said already, the 3-way comparison is
less error-prone with respect to two classic errors:
1- passing a "less than or equal" predicate where a "less than"
   predicate is expected, or conversely;
2- passing a predicate that is not a total ordering where a total
   ordering is expected.
Both errors could cause the old Sort.array or Sort.list functions to
misbehave seriously.  These errors are still possible with the 3-way
comparison approach, but less likely I think.
