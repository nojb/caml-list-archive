Mark,

Exactly.  The problems and issues with respect to complicated software
aren't solved by simplying switching to a "new" language.  Granted languages
can make one more (or less) productive, can eliminate (and create) entire
classes of problems.  I am a proponent of formal methods; I routinely use
model checkers to validate complex, concurrent processes, etc.  In my
experience with large distributed systems (1024+ nodes each with upto 64 smp
processors on each node), if you get the protocol right (I mean verified
through rigorous proof) you get to deal with broken operating systems,
broken i/o interfaces, broken compilers.

So, on this odyssey, one would expect to go on a long, dangerous journey
just to find out what mirror might have been able to suggest about where the
problem lies.  But of course one goes on the "quest" to build character,
strength, knowledge, and wisdom, so hopefully when you do return you won't
need the mirror.

What, a long, dangerous journey just to get back to where you started? :)
