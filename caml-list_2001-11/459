But if you consider using these, you might want to take the FSF's
stance on these license into account:

Artistic:
  We cannot say that this is a free software license because it is too
  vague ... We urge you to avoid using it, except as part of the 
  disjunctive license of Perl.

APSL:
  Please don't use this license, and we urge you to avoid any software 
  that has been released under it.
