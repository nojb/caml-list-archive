I am trying to get O'Caml to run in an extremely resource constrained
environment.   To this end I am interested in getting the O'Caml
program to run in as small a memory footprint as possible (GC induced
latencies are not a problem).

Today using OCaml 3.02 on FreeBSD 4.3, a simple hello world program 
like, >> print_endline "Hello World";; << translates to

        o 8554 bytes of interpreter bytecode, and,
        o 111945 bytes of executable code (using the -custom switch to
          "ocamlc")

I would like to ask if anyone has considered Caml for embedded 
applications?  

Any suggestions as to where I should start looking?
