I just wanted to send a brief note of thanks to everyone who has helped my
in my plight.  As I originally stated I needed help clearing the cobwebs
from my thinking and the response was somewhat overwhelming.

I think I've learned numerous things from this experience and I will
continue to be grateful for your contributions.

Sincerely,
Eric Newhuis
