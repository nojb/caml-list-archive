Whoa, nelly!  I don't know that I'd characterize the LGPL as a
"problem", but your reading of it is completely off the mark.  The LGPL
requires that if you distribute an application linked to a library, that
you must allow users to re-link against newer versions of the library
that maintain interface compatibility, presumably by providing object
files, bytecodes -- OR you must distribute an application that uses
shared libraries.  It is C-centric, but I do not think it poses any
problems.  (You must also redistribute any changes you make to the
LGPLed library itself.)
