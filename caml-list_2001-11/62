You can rest assured I was not referring to C#, but the common language
nirvana that Microsoft seems to be hyping.

C# is obviously "Microsoft Search & Redevelopment".  And I think it is
amazing that smart people like Anders Hejlsberg enjoy regurgitating Java at
any price.

Yes I agree with you and perhaps I am overly optimistic about Microsoft's
willingness to help bring Caml to the masses.

I am also aware of a few of the difficulties in targeting MSIL.

Nevertheless I am hopeful and I will continue the struggle.
