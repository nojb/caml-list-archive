There are many to choose from, but all of them will place some 
restrictions on the user executables developed with the covered code.  
Whether you think those restrictions are insignificant or desirable in 
some way, is a matter to be resolved.

The two licenses that spring to mind most readily to me are the Artistic 
License, and the Apple Public Source License.  Both of them would 
require tweaking to INRIA's purposes, but I think either one could 
easily be made to work, depending on how you wanted to trade off between 
protecting INRIA's investment and protecting users' freedoms.  They're 
both meet the OSI definition, and *generally* do what you want in 1 and 
2.

These licenses are just the ones I'm most familiar with (aside from the 
BSD, MIT and GPL licenses), because 1) I'm a long time Perl hacker (gave 
it up mostly for Caml); and, 2) I'm a Macintosh user and an Apple 
developer.  (Perhaps, I should also disclose that I work for Apple 
Computer, but my work there does not involve Caml...)

Anyway, it sounds like you're looking for a license that would be 
compatible with the APSL, i.e. it would permit OCaml to be integrated 
into the Darwin distribution, should that ever seem like a good idea to 
the people who manage that sort of thing.  As a personal matter, I would 
like to see that happen someday.

Good luck sorting out the license issue.
