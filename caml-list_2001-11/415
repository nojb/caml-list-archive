There have been some interesting postings on this list
about a MinGW port of the OCaml Compiler. The
attached patch was textually large but conceptually
simple.

I'm really not a specialist about this topic, but have now
(or in a near future) to choose between possible
Windows "technologies" (Visual C, Cygwin, MinGW) for
an OCaml program (only a console mode stuff in my case).

Could anybody explain to me why a MinGW isn't *always*
preferable to a Cygwin one (use of the same compiler, GCC,
MinGW being more "direct" Windows without an indirection
layer, not speaking about licensing problems, etc....).

I understand well that the Caml Team wants probably to
maintain a MS C version of the OCaml implementation,
but wanted to ask the Team if they have some ideas about
the future of Cygwin/MinGW ports. Isn't a MinGW port, in
the medium term, preferable to a Cygwin one ? Or do I
miss a point ?
