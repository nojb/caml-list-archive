If you want, you might consider steeling some code from (even better:
adding some code to ;) Lacaml:

  http://lacaml.sourceforge.net/

It's intended as a low-level library that should support the
Fortran-interfaces of BLAS/LAPACK with Bigarrays as close as possible +
some extras, which are written in C.

Currently only the functions that I need are implemented (mostly linear
regression stuff), but adding further ones is very easy. You may also
want to write a higher-level maths package that makes use of this
low-level library.

Xavier once told me that he is intending to add support for the complex
domain to the Bigarray-module. I don't know whether this will be possible
for the next release. It's not important to me, because I (currently)
don't need complex numbers.
