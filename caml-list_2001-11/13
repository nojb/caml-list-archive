Hi, I am just learning the OCaml language and was hoping to receive some
advice on the possibilities and trade offs of writing linux kernel
modules using ocaml. 

I am trying to write a module that sits in between the file system and a
hard disk device driver.  The code would interpret the calls from the
file system and relay calls back to the hard disk device driver. 
Essentially the code would be a layer over the hard disk device driver.

Is this possible using OCaml?  What are the trade offs of using ocaml
versus c.  I would appreciate any advice or help.

Thanks,
Vikas Sodhani
