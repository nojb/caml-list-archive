Locale matters somewhat, I'd think. I say this because I live in
Boston, and the MIT/Lisp connection is somewhat felt even now. 
Mostly, in the sense that startups are able to get ahold of Lisp
hackers who gripe about how defective Java is. :/ Presumably the 
same is true in and around Stanford. I guess the Lelisp effort 
morphed into Caml, so perhaps the situation is better in France?
 
Incidentally, does anyone have a pointer to how extensional 
polymorphism enables typesafe marshalling? I have to confess
that I can't figure that out -- how would I use it to go about 
writing a safe equivalent of Lisp's READ function?
