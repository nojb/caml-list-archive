Yes. Your function will always return 1, because variables on the
left-hand side of a pattern-match are bound like in a let expression. 
So the first branch of the match will always succeed, binding n0 to n, 
and then return 1.

So your code is equivalent to:

let f l n0 = 
  let n = List.length l in
  let n0 = n
  in 1

which is probably not what you want. :) Try writing this as:

let f l n0 = 
  let n = List.length l in 
  if n = n0 then
    1
  else
    0
