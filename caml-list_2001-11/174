 Please, read it again. Carefully.

 No. You must distribute a runtime source or just put a link how to get
it. Nothing more. There are a lot of commercial, closed source 
applications linked with LGPL libraries - e.g. any Linux commercial
apps linked with GNU Libc.

 It IS acceptable. But here, I think, it's offtopic. Read slashdot, and so 
on. Look at WineX, for example: open source, commercial binaries.
