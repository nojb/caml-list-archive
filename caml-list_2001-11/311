Hi,

I'm working on a small project for my wife to use at work. This project
has a graphical interface, is going to be used under windows, and should
be easy to install. The way I've done it until now is to use gtk+, and
use the mingw32 port of gcc and the corresponding gtk+ dlls. Of course
I'd really like to use caml for this, but I'd like to know how to
proceed with this. More precisely, is it possible to use lablgtk with
windows, do I need cygwin or mingw32, and if I use cygwin, is it just a
matter of providing the cygwin dll to run it ?

Thanks for any hints about this,

Alan
