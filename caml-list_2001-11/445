I agree with Jacques. At some point in the future lablgtk libglade support
and mlglade 
should be compatible. This has been discussed on the lablgtk mailing list
sometime ago. 
As for zoggy, I do not know if it has any kind of glade-like xml output.

This is indeed the main difference :
- liblglade : dynamic loading of interface through a library and no access
to the lablgtk code of your interface. But full support of gtk.
- mlglade : complete access to lablgtk code and no external library
needed. But all gtk features are not supported yet. See the tutorial or
the README for details.

You can very quickly try both approaches and see what your prefer.
Translating my "hello world" tutorial for mlglade into a libglade one is
very easy if you read the examples in the lablgtk distribution.
