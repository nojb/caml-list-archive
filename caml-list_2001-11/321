Hello list,

the ocamlnet project has finally released its first tarball: See
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocamlnet
(There is also a mirror of the tarball at ocaml-programming.de:
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/ocamlnet-0.91.tar.gz)

This release focuses on stabilizing the new CGI interface called
netcgi, but includes also a number of other goodies. The code
was mainly written by myself and by Patrick Doane.

- ocamlnet contains the netstring library (previously distributed
  separately). Besides some bugfixes, a number of new modules have
  been added:

  * Netchannels: an OO-encapsulation of in_channel/out_channel with
    special support for so-called transactional channels (that buffer
    data until they are committed)

    It is planned that the other modules dealing with I/O streams are
    rewritten with netchannels, but this is currently not the case.

  * Netdate: Parsing and printing date and time in various formats.
    Thanks to Nicolas George who contributed this module.

  * Netaddress: The datatype for email addresses

- ocamlnet contains the new CGI interface netcgi. It is simple to use,
  and supports all important CGI features, including file uploads and
  cookies. In contrast to the old interface, netcgi is object oriented,
  and it is possible to have several instances of the CGI connection
  at the same time - not useful for classic CGI, but we want to support
  better architectures in the future (e.g. fastcgi) while retaining
  the current interface.

- ocamlnet contains a POP3 client. It works, but the interface should be
  considered as experimental because we are not sure about the future
  direction.

Of course, we would like to add more network protocols than just CGI and
POP3. I could personally contribute a Telnet client, and a HTTP client,
but this makes only sense if more developers join the ocamlnet team.
So: If you have an idea for a network implementation, and want to discuss
it, please join the ocamlnet mailing list:

http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=19774

Last but not least, ocamlnet is now under the zlib/libpng license which
is similar to the MIT license used by netstring.
