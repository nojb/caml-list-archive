Well, it did - some module from there, perhaps indirectly, tried to
use Parsetree. I don't remember which module triggered this and I don't
know why.

Some module haven't found Parsetree in directories specified by -I, and
it happened that /usr/local/lib/ocaml was a symlink to /usr/lib/ocaml
where the previous version of OCaml was installed, and the new compiler
happened to actually look there despite it hasn't been installed yet,
and it found a module belonging to an older version of OCaml.

Anyway it helped and now OCaml-3.03 works for me. So if nothing there
should use Parsetree, we should investigate why it did. I can't easily
reproduce it now because I no longer have an incompatible version of
OCaml installed so it won't fail now.
