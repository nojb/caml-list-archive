Well, I asked the people from the german O'Reilley and
said a lot of nice words about the O'Reilley company. :-)
And so a woman from the german O'reilley gave me the mailaddress
of the right person to talk about it. :-)

I have not much more informations.
But they told in their last answer that there is a
webpage in frenche, where we should look at.

I mail you this at the end of the weekend (sunday or so),
becuase I#M some days in holiday.

I first ask the O'Reilley-person, if forwarding is ok.
Maybe they don't want it. If it's ok for them I forward it;
if not, I grep the informations and send it here into the list.
But it's not much more than I wrote until now.

Don't be too unpatient... I'm tired  and have a long yourney
tomorrow.

I think I can give you more informations on sunday night.

Ciao,
   Oliver
