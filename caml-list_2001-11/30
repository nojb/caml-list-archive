Mark Hayden wrote a kernel module in Ocaml, he posted a message on this
topic
about two years ago.  The major problem was memory allocation in a
different
segement using the Caml GC.

  Look it up, perhaps it will be of value to you.

     Ohad.

As Vitaly said, your best bet is to run the Caml code in user space
via some sort of kernel/userland gateway.  Kernel-land is a somewhat
restricted programming environment.  E.g. you can't even write kernel
code in (full) C++ because the run-time environment for C++
allocations and exceptions is not available in the kernel.  So, your
chances of getting OCaml code to run in the kernel are very slim :-)
