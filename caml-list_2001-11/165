I believe the intent of the section of the LGPL that Patrick is quoting
is to prevent unscrupulous people from incorporating an LGPL'd library
into a library of their own and distributing it free from the terms of
the LGPL.  Clearly this scenario would be a way of breaking the intent
of the licence.  I don't believe this section is intended to cover
applications.

Why does intent matter?  Three reasons:

1. The issue of morality.
2. The likelihood (or otherwise) of the FSF to sue.
3. Possibly even law, in some countries.

The underlying problem is that the LGPL is designed for
dynamically-linked libraries, and O'Caml is statically linked.  It's a
square peg and a round hole.  IM(limited)O, the best way to fix it is to
make OCaml use dynamic linking.

Dave.

The issue of morality is very important to me and cannot be ignored.
Besides, the FSF has plenty of motivation and resources.
