John,

Thank you for your feedback -- it's very interesting to hear from an
industrial user who got the opinions of competent lawyers.

Let me just state again what we'd like to achieve concerning the
licensing of the OCaml runtime and libraries:

1- Users can link with it, statically or dynamically, without any
   restrictions on the final program.
2- Users can modify the runtime or the libraries themselves, but then
   must make their modifications public under the same conditions as
   the original source.
3- The license should be standard, OSI-approved, and well known to the
   public that cares about these things.

All three items are easy to justify: for 1, we don't want to bother
anyone who uses OCaml; for 2, we'd like OCaml to remain open
source, meaning that everyone should be able to benefit from the
modifications on OCaml itself that someone did; and for 3, we're not
competent for inventing yet another license and get it recognized as
open source compliant.

Now the problem is that apparently there is no existing license that
matches these three criteria.  The LGPL was chosen before we realized
all its implications w.r.t. static linking.  But popular licenses such
as BSD or X don't meet criterion 2.  Our current hope is that the LGPL
with a special exception to paragraph 6 saying "you can link with our
code any way you like" would fulfill all three requirements.

Clearly, we want to allow "modifications" to the OCaml code itself
(otherwise it's not open source), but not impose this requirement on
the user code.  Are you saying that the LGPL is sufficiently ambiguous
not to distinguish clearly between library code and user code?

As for "reverse engineering", I don't really care.  If we void
paragraph 6 of the LGPL, the user isn't required to allow reverse
engineering.  Still, commercial licenses that prevent reverse
engineering are silly -- here in the European Union (and in other
countries as well), reverse engineering is explicitly allowed by law
in certain circumstances, so putting such a provision in your license
is just calling for the whole license to be invalidated by a EU court.

(Besides, if I buy, say, a TV set, I can open it and reverse-engineer the
circuit board to my heart's content; I might void the warranty this
way, but I'm not doing anything illegal.  I find it hard to understand
why it should be any different with software.)

I fully agree with this.  My proposal is basically to remove this
requirement for the OCaml libraries.

Suppose we remove the re-linking requirement.  Would that be enough to
allow distribution of an ocamlopt-compiled executable in IBM's
lawyers' opinion?

As I said above, the other standard licenses (e.g. BSD, X) don't offer
enough guarantees about the OCaml libraries and runtime themselves
remaining open source.
