AT&T's omniORB  ( http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/ ) has a similar
tricky licensing arrangement. The core CORBA library code is LGPL'ed
while the associated tools (including the IDL compiler) are GPL'ed. Since
the IDL compiler emits part of its own source in its output which then 
gets linked statically into all CORBA apps, there is an extra licensing
note covering this (otherwise people might have to GPL all their CORBA
code).

We impose no restriction on the use of the IDL compiler output. The
stub code produced by the IDL compiler is not considered a derived
work of it.

Not completely the same but nevertheless intersting...
