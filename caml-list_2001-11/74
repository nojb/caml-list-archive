I've thinking about using O'Caml in embedded system, too.

(1) Caml light
How about using caml light instead of o'caml?
A document says:
The runtime system (the part written in C) is about 100K, plus another 100K
of bytecode for the compiler.
The compiler itself is written in Caml Light and ``bootstrapped'' --
compiled by itself.

camlrun: ~50K
camltop: ~152K
stdlib.zo: ~400K
lib: *.zi, *.zix: ~318K

(2) Interpreter: ocaml
It seems that it needs "ocamlrun" at least.

ocaml: ~825K (compressed 169K)
ocamlrun: ~138K (compressed 55K)

(3) How to reference physical address.
Through Ocaml -> C interface.
