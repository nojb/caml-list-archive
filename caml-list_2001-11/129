Yes, that sounds very interesting.
I would be very interested in using that library and
in contributing code... but because of lack of detailed
OCaml-knowledge, this will start not earlier than
february (if the publishing-date of the english book is in next
february).

I now more and more come to the point, where I think
about Ocaml as being the right language for such
complex systems (instead of C for speed and Perl for
scripting)... so I'm impatient waiting for the
english translation.

I think this list is a good environment for developing
very interesting programs (because of interests and knowledge
of the people on this mailinglist) and libraries.


Happy to be on this list...  :-)


Ciao,
   Oliver
