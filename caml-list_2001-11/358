 It is an illusion. Don't believe your eyes. Tools like Delphi/Kylix/...
will not help you at all - it's much faster to write an UI in Tk by hands
then using such a WYSIWIG.

 But, if you want WYSIWIG GUI tool, just use Glade - it produces a 
portable XML representation for GUI dialogs, and, I belive, it'll be 
pretty easy to use it from Caml.

 Why do you want such a havy and thick GUI layer? GUI is for scripts!
Use Wish, it's portable. Much more portable, then Bugland tools.
