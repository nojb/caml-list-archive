The results are really pretty erroneous: Java on place 2?? Clicking on
its details sheet shows that this can impossibly be true: it's worse
than most languages on nearly every measure! I wonder how much Sun has
paid the author ;)

Well, it's probably just that the benchmark hasn't yet been correctly
ported.  For example, a couple of OCaml-entries are compiled wrongly and
therefore don't work. I hope things get fixed soon before some people
mistakenly believe that Java is the language of choice for discriminating
hackers...
