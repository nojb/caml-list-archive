No C compiler in its right mind would dare reorder the elements of an array
or struct.... padding is another issue. C is a high-level Assembly language,
and as such it produces what you write for the most part.

I used to write C compilers for a living, and I became intimately familiar
with the old specs... I used to be able to write C and see in my mind as I
went along, exactly which registers were being banged on (back in the days
of the MC680x0).

If this implicit contract were broken by some vendor an enormous amount of
legacy code would also break. They wouldn't dare!!!
