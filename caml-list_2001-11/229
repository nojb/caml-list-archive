Thanks for the suggestion.  I have added this line, but it makes
no difference:
js-23:25:58-~/ocaml/lablgtk$make nc
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/js/ocaml/lablgtk'
ocamlopt -c  -labels -w s  -I +lablgtk   calc.ml
ocamlopt   -I +lablgtk      -ccopt -L+lablgtk  lablgtk.cmxa
unix.cmxa gtkInit.cmxa     -o calc \
                        calc.cmx
Cannot find file gtkInit.cmxa
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^   
The problem is that it should use gtkInit.cmx.  There is no
gtkInit.cmxa (at least in thei Debian distribution). 

After your message I went back and read the documentation on the
compiler again.  I then tried to put
/usr/lib/ocaml/lablgtk/gtkInit.cmx on the SOURCES line and it
worked in some cases, but I suspect it is not the correct way to
do it.  I did not previously understand the difference between
.cmx and .cmxa files.  It becomes clearer now.

However the problem is not solved yet.

The following Makefile compiles (make nc) without complaints:


OCAMLMAKEFILE=/usr/share/ocaml-tools/OcamlMakefile
SOURCES=testgtk.ml /usr/lib/ocam/lablgtk/gtkInit.cmx
RESULT=testgtk
LIBS=lablgtk 
INCDIRS=+lablgtk
LIBDIRS=+lablgtk
OCAMLFLAGS=-labels -w s
include $(OCAMLMAKEFILE)

As I understand it, it should be the equivalent of 

ocamlopt.opt -w s -I +lablgtk -labels -o testgtk\
 lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx testgtk.ml

 But the latter produces a binary which runs without a problem
 and the first (make nc) produces a binary of a different size
 with a lot of error messages.

Johann.
