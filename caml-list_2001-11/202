Your first question was answered, so let me address the second one:

No additional files are needed if you perform the final link with
"ocamlc -custom".  This will create a stand-alone executable
incorporating the OCaml bytecode interpreter, runtime system, and the
bytecode for your program.

Correction: the OCaml runtime system is a C program, and as such can
require certain DLLs containing the C runtime.  Under Unix, you can
even force static linking of these C runtime libs using
  ocamlc -ccopt -static -custom
Under Windows, no such -static option exists, and you'll have to
ensure the users have the required DLLS (winsock.dll for the pure
Win32 port of OCaml, cygwin1.dll for the Cygwin port).
