Precedence: bulk

I have implementend persistent btrees as part of a larger app.  I'd be
happy to share it with anyone interested,  but don't want to
distribute it yet as it's part of a larger domain-specific database
system that's not done.   The btree portion of this project is pretty
stable, though.

That said, mail me in private you'd like the code.
