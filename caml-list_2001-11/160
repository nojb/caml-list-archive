As mentioned before - I don't think this is true. The LGPL is very clear
that the user must be able to modify the work (i.e. the application and
not the library). This is not possible to do with .cm[iox] files.

Also, I still must permit users to reverse engineer my application.

It is standard practice to strip an executable of all symbols to prevent
users from snooping around in the code.  Even if all I had to do was
include object files, the names of identifiers would still be intact.

This is a good goal - but it's not what the LPGL says.

It may be acceptable to me, but probably not for my employeer or clients
who work in vertical markets that are very sensitive about proprietary
information.
