If comparisons are very expensive -- for instance, if the elements
are long strings or large sets -- then it makes for faster execution
to use a three-way comparison. On the average you will do two-thirds
as many comparisons while sorting with a three-way comparison. 

I find this irritating becuase it just *feels* nicer to pass a 
function of type elt -> elt -> bool to a sorting function. It's
closer to how sorting is taught, and hence to my mental model. :)
