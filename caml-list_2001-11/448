Zoggy has a xml output, but not the same as glade. The main reason is that

properties for values are ocaml code in zoggy, instead of just predefined

constants in glade.
A zoggy->glade translator would be possible but some properties values 
would be lost when the given ocaml code is different from the predefined 
ocaml code values. Parameters to generated classes defined in zoggy 
would be lost too :-(

A glade->zoggy translator would be possible, but zoggy doesn't support 
all the information that glade does. All Gtk widgets will soon be 
supported in zoggy, as well as the menu definitions, but i don't know if 
i'll add the connection of functions to events in zoggy.
