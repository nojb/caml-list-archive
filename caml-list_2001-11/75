Hi,

with OCAMLRUNPARAM=b=1 my backtrace has some lines with precise
locations like 

    Called from module Main, character 12011

but lots of lines 

    Called from unknown location

What am I doing wrong? How can I get all locations?

Moreover, the start of the backtrace is wrong, it looks like

   Fatal error: uncaught exception Assert_failure("lifting.ml", 26109, 26122)
   Raised at module Format, character 5250
   Called from module Format, character 11592
   [...]

so the assertion is raised in lifting.ml, which is a plain (i.e.
without modules) ml file. Why does it print "Raised at module
Format" ?


Bye,

Hendrik
