You cannot realistically protect yourself from reverse engineering.
In many countries, you cannot even prohibit reverse engineering in your
license.  Reverse engineering for the purpose of building a work-alike
solution is an important part of a free market in software.

I suspect many businesses that have concerns about reverse engineering
are more concerned about having some dirty secrets exposed (like
GPL violations or the unlicensed use of commercial software) than about
a realistic expectation of anybody cloning their product by reverse
engineering.
