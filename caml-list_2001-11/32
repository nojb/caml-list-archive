When we are just about "sorting predicates":

I always have a little hesitation about the properties that are
assumed on this functions.

Shouldn't one say clearly in the OCaml doc that these comparison
function are simply suppposed (if I'm not wrong) to be a

  total pre-order, that is a binary predicate that is

  total (of course)
  transitive
  reflexive

BUT NOT necessarly anti-symetric.

Of course, these properties have to be "translated" back into the
3-way comparison approach (thats trivial) but I would find it helpful to
say precisely what properties these functions should have.
