Precedence: bulk

I have a system with a bunch of modules, but for simplicity, I'll
explain it with 3.

A defines some classes.

B uses those classes to create some types, I would really only like it
to see a small number of the methods of the class.

C implements some functions on the types that need to access a much
larger set of the methods of the classes defined in A.

Is there any clean way to do this?

Thanks	 ../Dave
