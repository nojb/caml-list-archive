I have ported the system to use Winsock2 on WIN32 platforms.
Testing was done on an NT4 work-station, so WIN2000 clients should work
as well. Performance is not optimal because Winsock2 is somewhat buggy on
NT4. I think
it will work much better on more advanced Microsoft OSes. Anyone care to
comment?

I've had problems with
  - Multicast : setting the TTL and LOOPBACK
  - Sending and receiving IO-vectors.
So, workarounds have been placed.

This update also includes some minor bug fixes, and a fix for a reference
counting bug
that occurs when using a mesh of TCP connections to transport messages
between group
members.

As usual, the code can be downloaded from the system homepage at:
     www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble

For the CAML people, if anyone is interested in networking code for
winsock2, here is your
chance! I had to mess around with Unix exceptions, because the native CAML
Unix library uses
winsock1 which has slightly different error codes.

Enjoy,
     Ohad.
