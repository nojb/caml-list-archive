Yes, this is the real problem for you, why not say it from the begining and
explain a bit ?

Well, you have :

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

That is, if you offer your app as downloadeable, you just need to offer the
object code from the same place.

In the other case, you probably ship a CD or something such, and probably
acompany it by a documentation, in this case, just add a page to the
documentation to comply with the LGPL.

No, it is the source you need to provide for the LGPLed library.

but again, either a letter or a downloadable version would be ok.

Well, not sure, the reasoning here is that you must agree to make the object
and library source available for at least 3 years. You cannot guarantee that
the ocaml team will be doing this for the next 3 years, altough it certainly
would. Now if you were a member of the consortium, then this may be
legailistically sufficient, but again, i am no lawyer.

That said, if you modify the ocaml compiler suite to build your app, then you
have to make these modifications available, maybe it is this that is required
?

But study have said that this represent a big share of those commercial
software that will still exist in the next few years, you have been warned
:)))

Don't know, is this of interrest to the other list participants ? If yes, we
can continue here, users bored with it can easily send it to /dev/null with a
proper mail filter. If not, then we could continue privately, or create a new
list ocaml-legalese, or something such ? What do the other mailing list member
say about this, and in particular the ocaml team ?
