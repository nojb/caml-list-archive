More than fifty people have already put and are continuing to put
a lot of work into the English translation of this book.  We
certainly have a need and a right to know their intentions.  If
they don't want to broadcast them to the whole world, they can
email the translators' mailing list, translators@pauillac.inria.fr.
Or they can personally email the translation project's O'Reilly liaison,
Benjamin Pierce, bcpierce@saul.cis.upenn.edu.  Or they can email me,
datta@math.berkeley.edu; I'm currently coordinating the project.

I don't know how they can publish the English webpages in February
without communicating with us.  Unless they have a separate translation
going, which would be a major bummer.  We have certainly kept them
abreast of our efforts.

Best wishes for a good journey.  I'm sorry if the above seems rather
negative.  It's not directed at you, we're really grateful to you
for passing on this information.  I'm just a little peeved at O'Reilly for
keeping us in the dark.
Thanks again,
