The full Cygwin provides a rather complete Unix emulation, hence the
OCaml Cygwin port supports the debugger, all of the Unix module, and
(I believe) the LablGTK GUI -- all things that are missing in the
OCaml MinGW port, if I remember correctly.

The situation is quite simple, really:

- We can't support three different Windows port of OCaml; the current
  two are already too much.

- Every time I mention this fact on this list, we get replies of the form
    "I can't live without the Visual C based port of OCaml --
     I'm doing real industrial work, and everything gcc-related is
     just amateur work"
  OR
    "I got a Windows machine because that's the company policy,
     but I really do all my work within the Cygwin environment and
     don't want to hear about anything else".

Draw your own conclusions...
