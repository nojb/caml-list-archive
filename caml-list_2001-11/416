It appears that there have been some virus problems last week
on this list.

I'm not a specialist and don't know if its feasible easily, but wouldn't
the best solution not to be to forbid any attachment ?

Examples and so on can be easily put in the message, and really
heavy patches etc... could be delivered as an URL where to download
etc...

Only pure text mails would be accepted.
