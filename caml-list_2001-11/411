I have a (rambling) question/feature request.

I've been using W3's HTML Tidy as a cleanup tool for the small bit of HTML
I'm working on.  I've also got a local copy of www.htmlhelp.com's validator
cgi program, which seems to be on par with W3's validation service.

What I'd really like is a local program that will flexibly:

- validate to the dtd in the doctype declaration, or convert to a different
one as nicely as possible, output a list of errors, optionally fix the
errors and warnings  (HTML Tidy does this pretty well, but isn't as
rigorous at validating as W3 or htmlhelp, and not flexible enough in its
options)
  -- optionally insert null attributes for those that are missing (like
summary for tables, alt for img, etc.)

- strip out all formatting that should be done with css, either leaving class
attributes that can be used in a style sheet, or doing away with the
formatting altogether

- indent properly (Tidy is good, but not quite beautiful)

- maybe validate css too

- recursive option, with options for depth/domain

- link checking

I guess what I'd like is a more featureful and thorough version of Tidy.  I
would think that this could be quite a little killer-app in its niche,
assuming it is done right -- amenable to gui wrappers, vim errorformat, et
al.  I would also think this might be a decent test vehicle for a lot of
the Bedouin code.  Unfortunately I'm too busy to do much about it myself...

Q: Is anyone working on such a beast?

in sum:

Tidy
  + up-to-date/rigorous
  + link checking
  + css
  + bells and whistles
  + very flexible
  = killer-app?
