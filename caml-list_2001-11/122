Earlier this year there was a discussion about the problems of using LGPL
for the OCaml run-time system and associated libraries.

It was suggested that some of the constraints in the LGPL were not
intended. To quote a page from the Caml website:

  "The LGPL puts no restrictions at all on programs linked with LGPL-ed
libraries. Thus, users are free to distribute (or not) OCaml-generated
binaries under whatever conditions they like."

>From my reading of the LGPL, which seems to correspond with the opinions
of others on the list, this just isn't true.  If I develop an application
with OCaml, I must distribute that application with source code.  This
isn't acceptable for commercial development and I'd really hope that the
intention is for OCaml to be used outside of academia.

Will this problem be fixed for the 3.03 release?
