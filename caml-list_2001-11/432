The LGPL says that the derived work must be licensed under terms
which "permit" the user to modify the work.  "permit" does not mean
the same thing as "make possible", and it definitely does not mean
the same thing as "make easy"!

It is in fact *possible* to modify the application given just the binary
files, of course, just not *easy*.

Yes, that's correct.  You must give users the legal permission to reverse
engineer your application.  However, you are under no obligation to make
it easy.

For C code, you can through various techniques (such as `ld -r'
and the `--retain-symbols-file' options of GNU ld) link your object
files into a single object file and strip out all of the symbols except
those undefined symbols that refer to the LGPL'd library or libraries
that you are linking with.  These techniques can also be used with other
programming language implementations that generate standard object files,
such as (my favourite example ;) Mercury.

I don't know if this is possible for Ocaml code, but if it is not, then
I think it might perhaps be more useful to ask for similar technical
features, rather than complaining about the license.
