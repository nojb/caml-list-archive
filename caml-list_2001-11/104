Silly newbie question coming up...

What's the difference between (=) and (==)?

I know that this is almost certainly a case of RTFM, but I can't seem to find 
the right place.  6.7.4 mentions "structural" and "physical" equality, but 
doesn't define either.

My guess is that "physical" equality is "are these the same object", and 
structural equality is "are these objects equivelent".  Hence:

# "Jim"=="Jim";;
- : bool = false
# "Jim"="Jim";;
- : bool = true€

I thought I'd better check I'm guessing right, or I will almost certainly 
fall over this sometime in the future.  :)

TIA,
Jim
