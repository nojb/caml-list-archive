I think it is great that enabling more widespread usage is
high on the list of goals of the OCAML project.

As far as I can tell, the GPL license that GNAT is under is 
considerably more restrictive than the LGPL license used by 
OCAML.  Under the GPL license, you cannot incorporate any 
GNAT source code into your code without redistributing your 
code under the terms of the GPL.

Furthermore, I believe Guile is distributed under the terms 
of the GPL (not the LGPL), and that is why it needs a special exemption 
when embedded in some other software system.

As I understand it, no further exemptions should be needed for a system
covered by the LGPL in order to allow its use as part of a
closed-source, proprietary system.  I would recommend consulting
a lawyer before making any changes to the LGPL--it has been carefully
crafted and vetted over many years.  Modifying it risks not only
breaking the protection it attempts to achieve, it may also scare
people away, since nobody will have any experience with what "a modified
LGPL license" actually means.  If you want to enable even more free 
distribution and usage than the LGPL, maybe it's worth considering 
another license that people already understand pretty well, like BSD or X11.
