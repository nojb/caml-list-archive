Adding complex arrays to the Bigarray module is on my to-do list.

One issue is how these arrays should be represented to allow
no-copying exchange between C and Fortran.  My understanding is that
in C, arrays of complex are generally represented as arrays of pairs
of floats (or doubles), while in Fortran some codes use the C
representation (one array of pairs) while others use a pair of arrays.
The array-of-pairs representation fits well the Bigarray interface,
but the pair-of-arrays approach does not.  

Could someone with numerical experience in Fortran provide more
information on this?
