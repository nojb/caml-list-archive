That's probably what I needed to hear.  Thanks very much for the advice.

I'll take a look at that FFTW library for more clues about using the 
monadic style.  I hope to discover that I can use monads to address a 
particularly thorny class of problems that seems to arise again and 
again in my work, and which seems not to be well addressed by objects 
alone: cross-cutting concerns in the implementation of network 
application protocols.
