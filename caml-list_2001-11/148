We haven't yet modified the LGPL to remove these silly restrictions on
linking with LGPL code, but plan to do so in the near future.  

We'd be interested in examples of other software projects that did this.
You mention Guile, however it seems to be under the (standard) GPL
(not even LGPL).

Not at all.  In case of static linking, the LGPL requires that you
give users the ability to re-link your program with modified versions
of the LGPL-ed library.  In practice, this means that you have to
provide the .cmo or .cmx/.o files for your OCaml program in the
unlikely event that someone asks for them (in order to exercise
his/her LGPL rights of re-linking with modified Caml libraries).

No big deal, really, but still silly.
