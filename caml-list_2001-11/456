Be careful, this requirement, at least in the way it is worded here,
is in contradiction to the definition of free as used by the FSF and
adopting a licence the implements it would make OCaml incompatible 
with the GPL.

See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html:
   "You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them 
    privately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that 
    they exist."

Yours, Florian Hars.
