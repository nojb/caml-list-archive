Hi Guys,

I am experimenting with ocaml and cgi on Linux/Apache.  A handy thing to
have is the ability to execute a shell command and use the result of it
in your cgi program. =20
So I used open_process_in from the Unix lib to execute the exeternal
command.  This all works well when run from the console - but when I run
the same program from cgi - the channel_in contains no information.  I
thought it may have to do with the fact that the execution runs in a
spearate thread - maybe cgi does not allow this.
If you have experienced the same problem or have any ideas/hints, please
help.
Regards
Willem
