See my implementation of Fort which works around some of these issues. For
example, initialization is also hardwired into "run_script" so we can it:

  let save_arg = Sys.argv.(0) in
  Sys.argv.(0) <- "__dummy";
  let ignore_formatter =
    Format.make_formatter (fun _ _ _ -> ()) (fun _ -> ()) in
  ignore (Toploop.run_script ignore_formatter "__dummy" Sys.argv);
  Sys.argv.(0) <- save_arg

I agree that the top-level interface should be improved. I've been able to
find workarounds so far, but it sounds like you have some issues that
require some definite changes.

Another gripe of mine is that Topdirs.dir_load does not print good
diagnostic information when it fails, so in practice I create a dummy
script containing a single "#load" directive to get the error messages to
display properly.
