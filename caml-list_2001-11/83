Hi all
     I have a list containing up to 100,000 strings
between 10 and 200 characters in length. I want to
produce a list of those that match a regular
expression. It seems that the obvious way is to
List.filter with a predicate returning true if the
string matches, however in my case this can take up to
15 seconds. Has anyone got any ideas for speeding this
up?

     thanks

           Andrew
