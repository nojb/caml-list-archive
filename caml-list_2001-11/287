I understand your irritation about the current interface, and agree
that additional functions over the inet_addr abstract type are needed,
e.g. conversions to and from arrays of integers (each integer
representing one byte of the address).

But: I'm *extremely* wary about interfaces that assume that an inet_addr
is isomorphic to a 32-bit integer or to 4 octets, because these break
horribly with IPv6 addresses.  We've been hearing for so long that
IPv6 is the wave of the future that we might just as well be ready for IPv6.
