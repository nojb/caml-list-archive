Yes, the "Str" library of OCaml is built on top of the "regexp"
library, which is owned by the FSF and distributed under the GPL.

Sure.  When we're talking about changing the OCaml licensing terms, it
really means changing the licensing terms of the code for which we are
the copyright owners.  (The LICENSE file in the OCaml distribution is
carefully worded to cover only the source files that are copyright INRIA.)

Fortunately, all of the OCaml code is copyright INRIA except this
lousy "regexp" library, which no-one is forced to use (the remainder
of the OCaml system doesn't depend on it), and which we'll replace
eventually by something more efficient.

We're talking about making the OCaml license *more* liberal, by
*removing* silly requirements of the LGPL.  I don't see users
objecting to this.
