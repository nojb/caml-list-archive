As Vitaly said, your best bet is to run the Caml code in user space
via some sort of kernel/userland gateway.  Kernel-land is a somewhat
restricted programming environment.  E.g. you can't even write kernel
code in (full) C++ because the run-time environment for C++
allocations and exceptions is not available in the kernel.  So, your
chances of getting OCaml code to run in the kernel are very slim :-)
