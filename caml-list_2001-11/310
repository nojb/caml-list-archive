Ahh ... I have the slight feeling, that I slowley get it ... thank
you. But I have to ask some more qustions to be sure ...

- In the context you have mentioned above: 'invariant' means the two
  types have *no* relationship to each other, yes?
- If you believe that contravariance isn't generally particularly
  useful, as you stated in the mail before, why can I flag some type
  with (-'a) stating this is contravariant? What sense does this make?  
- What exactly are types and subtypes in OCaml? You know, I am coming
  mainly from the imperative world. There I use languages that makes
  no distinction between classes and types. Is 'int' a subtype of
  'float'? How can I decide if something is a subtype of another one?
  I do not ask in sense of OO inheritance but in OCaml terminology.

Its ok for me that you get it wrong, because so I could detect the
flaw and ensure myself that I am of the way of understanding. But that
you probably had made same mistake in thesis is really unfortunate for
you, and I feel a pity therefore :-(


Thanks again and ciao,
Clemens.
