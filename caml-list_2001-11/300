Back in 1996/1997, Francis Dupont (Francis.Dupont@inria.fr) was working
on IPv6, and he patched the conversion functions to work with IPv6
addresses (and probably some other stuff from unix.ml/libunix) . IIRC,
he then got MMM (the web browser) to run on IPv6 enabled machines by
simply recompiling it (no source changes in the app).
I guess that this proved that you can get any OCaml application IPv6
enabled if you do the appropriate work in libunix. Maybe Francis still
has a copy of that code BTW.

I received another response that raised this same issue.

It's nice to know that the abstract Unix.inet_addr type is intended to=20
represent both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  The current conversions to and=20
from strings just deal with dot quads and don't seem to understand=20
textual representations of IPv6 addresses yet, but I guess I can see the

roadmap now.

Consider this:

	val inet_addr_of_octets: string -> inet_addr
	val octets_of_inet_addr: inet_addr -> string

If inet_addr_of_octets is applied to a string that isn't four or eight=20
octets in length, then it can raise Invalid_arg.
