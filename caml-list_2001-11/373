Hi all,

I am trying to use some C++ code from OCaml.  I am completely
inexperienced at this (and not knowing well C++ to make matters worse)
but in view of http://caml.inria.fr/Hump/msg778-782 that didn't seem
so difficult.  I will likely have more questions later but I am
already stuck at the beginning.  Indeed, the C++ code includes the
file "stl_alloc.h" which contains (gnu version, line 451)

typedef __default_alloc_template<__NODE_ALLOCATOR_THREADS, 0> alloc;

and so conflicts with the definition of "alloc" in
"/usr/include/caml/alloc.h".

What can I do ?

ChriS

P.S.  For those who wonder, this attempt arises from a need to do
symbolic computation on multi-variable polynomials (with symbolic
coefficients).  First I thought to implement this directly in Caml
but, when I saw http://www.ginac.de/ I realized it is more useful to
try to use it from OCaml since I will never have time to do 1/10th of
what they already accomplished...  BTW, if you know other good algebra
packages that fit my need, feel free to let me know...
