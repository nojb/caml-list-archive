A short summary of the information I received on my question,
and some stuff I found out after asking the question (for the 
archives and for the curious).

o Squeezing the CAML runtime

  Gerd Stolpmann's repackaging of the CAML runtime can bring the core
  interpreter down to 20KB or so, with the needed modules being 
  dynamically linked in:

  [ http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/ocamlre ]

o A proposed variant of ML that tracks memory usage using programmer
  supplied annotations

  Recursion and dynamic data-structures in bounded space: towards embedded ML programming
  John Hughes, Lars Pareto
  ICFP 1999

o The MLKit [ http://www.it-c.dk/research/mlkit/ ] supports SML'97 with the
  compiler inferring memory allocation patterns.

Thanks to all who responded to my question.

Regards,
Koshy
