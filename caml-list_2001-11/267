Ok, I see, I didn't know what kind of initializations have to be
performed.

I agree.

OCamlMakefile respects the order of files as defined by the user to
exactly avoid this problem of initialization order in the presence of
side effects. So blaming OCamlMakefile for wrong linking order is not
an excuse :-)
