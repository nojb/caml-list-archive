Ok, I see, I thought that we were talking about a library. Try the
following instead:

  OCAMLNLDFLAGS := gtkInit.cmx
  OCAMLBLDFLAGS := gtkInit.cmo

It would certainly be better to have a true library file in the
distribution rather than the "naked" compiled module file.

.cmx-files are (natively) compiled implementations of OCaml-modules,
.cmxa-files combine several such implementations, i.e. they are library
files.
