The version on SVN has more recent changes (by myself and Gregoire
Henry). They haven't yet been incorporated in a release worth of that
name most notably due to the lack of testing. We'd be welcome if you
could test the SVN version and --- assuming everything works fine ---
make a new proper release as an outcome.

Hope this helps,
Cheers.
