+1. Surely in projects where repeatability is important, the change in behaviour to randomly seeded tables would be quickly noticed (and can be quickly solved, if the appropriate "set_seed" or whatever is there) through failing unit tests and so on, surely? Repeatability seems the more niche use of a hash table, IMHO, even if it's by some of OCaml's bigger players! One could even imagine having things so that programs linked normally use a randomly seed hashtable and programs *linked* with -g use a fixed seed, for debugging (i.e. the current behaviour) - again, with suitable documentation explaining why you don't put debug builds of software on live web servers...
