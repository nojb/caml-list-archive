8K is not much.

I stopped using OCaml for new development *because* of the pain it
caused on MSWIN, so my opinion is probably not very valuable.

It looks to me like you could simply disable the feature for arguments
following -w.  However, if you want to remove the feature, I suggest
that you do so in three stages:

    1.  Disable the @responsefile feature and provide a command line
	flag to reenable it.  Warn if this conflicts with the -w @a
	style of options.
    2.  In a later release, remove the code, but make the flag print
	an appropriate diagnostic.
    3.  In an even later release, remove the flag completely.

The time between the first two steps should be determined by the
response to the first step.

This is the standard evolution: make people notice that you are taking
a feature away, but let them keep using it, followed by taking it
away, but telling them it's gone, followed by pretending it never
existed.

It's good that you're adding the desirable preliminary of asking
first.
