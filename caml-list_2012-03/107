The "I'm going to vomit files across your whole file system so that you need another bureaucratic tool/database too keep track of what I did whenever you want to remove me" way. Sure if you're looking for a business model and more bureaucracy that's the way to do it the "right way". The key insight in things like gnu stow or homebrew is that this tool/database already exists, it's the file system itself, KISS principle. And this simplicity also allows you to deal very easily with multiple version installs of the same package.

To me that seems to be an ideological objection (debian related I guess), I don't see any technical objection. KISS should be applied here: I installed that package in that directory anything related to it is in that single directory.

CHANGES and README light, html heavy ? For one thing keep it at least consistent either you choose to put nothing in SITELIB or everything. I don't want to have to lookup two different places for documentation.

I don't think it's a good idea for the whole system to underestimate the importance of documentation.

I'm all for it, but now that I'm in these things I want to move forward. So what should I write something like this (currently) nop ?  

Document xmlm
Title: "Xmlm documentation and module reference"
Format: html
Index: Xmlm.html  
Install: true
InstallDir: $docdir
DataFiles: CHANGES README doc/*.html, doc/*.css

Or should I make another Document for CHANGES README ?

It also has much more information in a machine readable format. Like the home page of the project, the maintainers, maybe even the repos etc.  

Best,

Daniel
