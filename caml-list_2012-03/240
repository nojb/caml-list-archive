It is because ospec has not be linked with the Printexc module. Since
you define a library "ospec" and you use it for the executable "ospec",
it will be linked against "ospec.cma", and not all the .cmo as you did
before. OCaml remove unused units from ".cma" files passed on the
command line when linking, it only keeps units reachable from
".cmo" files. Printexc has been removed because it was not used. To
prevent this behavior you must pass the "-linkall" switch (note that
you should always use it when you use dynlink).
