For now yes, but I plan to support only object through an Object
section, just like the Library:

The main change of .cmo -> .cma is that toplevel expression are only
evaluated if you open the module. This can be a problem if your .cmo are
used in a plugin way (i.e. toplevel expression register the content of
your library) and that you don't open it.

setup.ml will be enough for me ;-) But I am biased.

We don't support plugin, indeed. Mostly because I was not aware of it.
setup.ml doesn't yet support .cmxs. I was looking at a patch provided by
Pierre Chambart yesterday evening to do that. Will probably be in 0.3.

> 4) I'm really not interested in oasis trying to generate my _tags and myocamlbuild.ml files. Is it ok to substitute my own or does setup.ml rely on these ? 

You can substitute your own. There should be no problem. Don't hesitate
to open a feature request to explain the reason why and your solution. I
don't promise it will be implemented, but it is worth understanding the
reason.

These are also things you actually would like to remove when you do a ocamlfind remove. Is there any general agreed on strategy for packages ? Best I think would be to install that along in the package directory with ocamlfind, it makes it relatively easy/evident to lookup. 

We already discuss this CHANGES file stuff. I still didn't have the time
to work on that, but it is something that I want. In future version
there should be something like that.

Use 'PostCleanCommand: rm XYZ'

DataFiles should do that. Concerning installing this using ocamlfind, I
am a little more skeptical. We use standard cp to install in
/usr/share/doc. I don't know a lot of libraries that install their
documentation in /usr/lib, probably because there are packaging rules
against that.

I think the default Type: for document is None, which means do nothing.
You can use "Type: Custom" and have a "XCustomInstall: cp XYZ
$htmldir/xmlm"

I realize that this no good. I probably should code a plugin Static, to
have "Type: Static" and use the data you fill in Document section to
install. This is not a long job.

Could you open a bug about that, so that it will remind me to do it ?

> 7) ocaml setup -install seems to install the modules' .mli, .cmi and .cmx by finding them in _build capitalizing the filenames even though they are not (cf. [2]). That works on my case insensitive filesystem, but it mustn't work on others, the original files are not capitalized !? Is that a bug ? 
>

That is a bug. I have similar problem with the Pack: when generating
_tags with capitalized module name. I installed ocaml on a mac yesterday
to find the right solution. It will be shipped with oais 0.3.0~rc3. But
this part of the bug is not extremly important, because on case
sensitive FS, it will replace the capitalize module name by the right
name. It is a runtime evaluation so no worries on this point.
