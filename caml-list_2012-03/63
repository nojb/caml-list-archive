Yes, I understand that. I fear there's dependency hell waiting around the corner, but maybe this can be mitigated by implementing that idea of being able to easily specify your own package source in ~/.odb/packages. Well, in fact you can already do that locally by crafting your own ~/.odb/packages file. So maybe your approach is the right balancing act between usability and complexity.

If I get too annoyed with too much time on my hands (i.e. very unlikely) I may eventually do that.  

Thanks for the answers and the tool,
