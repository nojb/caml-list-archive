Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Spring release

Hello,

I'd like to announce the release of Cmdliner 0.9.1, React 0.9.3, 
Rtime 0.9.2, Uuidm 0.9.4, and Xmlm 1.1.0.

There's a mix of bug fixing and small feature additions. Consult the 
individual release notes given below. 

But foremost all the modules now support OASIS and use
setup.ml for the distribution. Thanks to Sylvain for his work and
taking time to respond to my questions.

The tarballs were tested with `odb.ml` and seem to install fine
that way. Before they eventually find their way into oasis-db
(it doesn't support oasis 0.3 yet) you'll find a few lines here [1] 
that you can add to your `packages` file to access them directly.

Best, 

Daniel

[1] http://erratique.ch/software/odb-packages.txt

* Cmdliner v0.9.1 http://erratique.ch/software/cmdliner

- OASIS support.
- Fixed broken `Arg.pos_right`.
- Variables `$(tname)` and `$(mname)` can be used in a term's man
  page to respectively refer to the term's name and the main term
  name.
- Support for custom variable substitution in `Manpage.print`.
- Adds `Term.man_format`, to facilitate the definition of help commands.
- Rewrote the examples with a better and consistent style. 

# Incompatible API changes

- The signature of `Term.eval` and `Term.eval_choice` changed to make
  it more regular: the given term and its info must be tupled together
  even for the main term and the tuple order was swapped to make it
  consistent with the one used for arguments.




* React v0.9.3 http://erratique.ch/software/react

- OASIS support


* Rtime v0.9.2 http://erratique.ch/software/rtime

- OASIS support.


* Uuidm v0.9.4 http://erratique.ch/software/uuidm

- OASIS support.
- New functions `Uuidm.v3` and `Uuidm.v5` that generate directly these 
  kinds of UUIDs.
- New function `Uuidm.v4_gen` returns a function that generates
  version 4 UUIDs with a client provided random state. Thanks to Lauri
  Alanko for suggesting that `Random.make_self_init` may be too weak
  for certain usages.




* Xmlm v1.1.0 http://erratique.ch/software/xmlm

- OASIS support.
- Fixes a bug in the UTF-16 decoder.
- Fixes a bug in `Xmlm.make_output` with a custom function. Thanks to
  Konstantinas Myalo for the report and the patch.
- New optional argument `decl` to `Xmlm.make_output` to control whether the
  XML declaration should be output.
- New function `Xmlm.output_depth`, returns the current element nesting level.
