First, a small precision (which may not be obvious from TypeRex 
documentation): as the ocp-ocamlc, ... commands are only wrappers, they 
are not tied to a particular version of the actual compilers they call. 
In fact the following three components are somehow independent:
- the installed OCaml compilers (currently only 3.12.* is supported, 
because by mistake we forgot to include 3.11 compatibility, will be 
fixed in 1.0.0)
- TypeRex (with ocp-type and ocp-ocamlc, etc.)
- the OCaml compiler used to compile TypeRex (since rc2, >=3.11 works)
However, TypeRex won't be able to handle new language constructs that 
are introduced in OCaml after we extract its front-end, which implies that:
- we will have too follow closely the language evolutions and we will 
release a new version of TypeRex for each major release of OCaml.
- using Typerex for developping the OCaml compiler prevents you to use 
the new language constructs that you introduce, until TypeRex is itself 
updated.

We would like to have the binary annotation feature included in the next 
release of OCaml. Before proposing a patch upstream, we wanted to 
stabilize the changes in the compiler and prove them to be generic 
enough. But there are two alternatives to having binary annotations in 
OCaml:
- improve the ease of use of the wrappers (there have been interesting 
suggestions in this direction on the issue tracker)
- integrate with a build system (which would also replace the ad-hoc 
.typerex file)
