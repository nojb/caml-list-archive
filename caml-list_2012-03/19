thanks for this nice tool, I've been using it for some days.
First the color scheme seemed ugly and not practical to me, but I guess 
I'm slowly getting used to it.

Concerning indentation: apparently it doesn't properly recognize the 
chars ')' and '(':

let f x =
   if x = '('
            then 1
            else 2;;

whereas

let f x =
   if x = '()'
   then 1
   else 2;;
