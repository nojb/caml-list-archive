Subject: [Caml-list] application scope for hashtable on weak pointers

I'm puzzled by this superb sentence in the refman:

"A weak hash table is a hashed set of values.
Each value may magically disappear from the
set when it is not used by the rest of the program any more."

I have a use case for an hashtable of values who'll needs to get aged and removed after a while,
what can I reuse of the standard lib, under which conditions are the values collected by the GC ?

my use case would be to first age out when a threshold of number of bindings is reached, also, after some wall time, flush oldest entries (LRU).
