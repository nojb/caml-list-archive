You can call it KISS, but I would call it short-sighted. This has nothing
to do with bureaucracy. Imagine a package has also some utilities to
install (and feeled every second package has). You just don't want to have
to include tons of bin/ directories into your PATH. It does not scale
well, but just slows down your system.

There are just different sets of principles, and they have their pros and
cons. The simplicity argument is not always the striking one.

That's really funny how you interpret this, but I guess this is just a
matter of perspective. findlib does not support subdirectories just
because I wanted to keep it lean, and to avoid adding features it does not
need for its core job. And the core job is to drive the compiler with the
right flags, and not to provide a container for storing files.

I totally understand your point that you want to have a system that makes
it easy to hack around (it's clearly no fun with the complex guys).
However, I'm really wondering why docs are your first concern here? The
real hacker does not need docs :-)
