Subject: Re: [Caml-list] New version of the binary installer for Windows

Hello!

Can you test ocamlbuild on windows? On my vertual machine with XP it
can't create _build directory and says

C:\prog\1>ocamlbuild main.byte
mkdir "C:\prog\1\_build"
bash: warning: could not find /tmp, please create!
bash: mkdir: command not found
Failure: Error during command `mkdir "C:\prog\1\_build"'.
Exit code 127.

Best wishes,
Kakadu
