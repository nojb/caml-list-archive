CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

HATS International School on Formal Models for Objects and Components
(HATS-FMOC 2012)

Bertinoro, Italy
September 24-28, 2012

http://www.cs.unibo.it/hats-fmoc/


General Information:
--------------------
Modern software systems are complex, and often structured as
composition of a high number of components or objects. The school
focuses on formal models and programming languages for such system,
including methods and tools for specifying and designing them, and for
ensuring behavioural and security guatantees. A special emphasis will
be given to methods for ensuring the adaptability and evolvability of
the systems, with which the systems can cope with changes in the
environment as well as with modified and new requirements.

The School is organised by the project HATS (Highly Adaptable and
Trustworthy Software using Formal Models), a EU Integrated Project
within the FET "FOREVER YOURS" programme, in agreement with the
EternalS Coordination Action (CA) that coordinates the research among
the four projects of the "Forever Yours" initiative: LivingKnowledge,
HATS, Connect, and SecureChange.

The School will feature lectures by world-renowned experts within the
area of formal models for objects and components. Involved working
areas are, e.g., type theory, programming languages, formal methods,
concurrency and software engineering.

information regarding speakers and topics, and travel details:

http://www.cs.unibo.it/hats-fmoc/

Since attendance is limited to 40 students, slots will be allocated on a
"first come, first served" basis.

The application deadline is June 15, 2012.


Venue:
------
The setting for the School is the Centro Residenziale Universitario of
the University of Bologna, located in Bertinoro, a small medieval
hilltop town of Bertinoro that is an excellent base for various Italian
destinations.

Bertinoro is about 70 km south-east of Bologna, at an elevation of
about 230 m. It can be reached in a couple of hours from the
international airport "G. Marconi" of Bologna by shuttle (from the
airport to the railway station) + train (from Bologna to Forlì) +
bus/taxi (from the railway station to Bertinoro). The closest airport
is the "L. Ridolfi" airport of Forlì, which is 13 km away.
