This page shows the stable, testing and unstable versions of each
package available in odb.  use --unstable or --testing to get a
non-stable version.  Unstable is the newest uploaded version, testing is
the newest version I've been able to make work.  Stable has all been
compiled together (sometimes there's version issues between packages).

While I agree it'd be nice to just parse oasis files, they're not nearly 
as trivial to parse as the k=v format.  If you can write a small enough 
parser with no external deps, I'll add it to odb and use its info to 
supplement the packages file.
