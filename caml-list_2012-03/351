What do you mean by not working at all (as in, where are you running them from)?

My build process on Windows uses Oasis setup.ml files to compile CSV (http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/csv - no patches) and Cryptokit (http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/cryptokit - tiny manual patch to two lines from Sylvain to workaround the current/past inability to pass -L options to setup.ml as Zlib is installed in a non-standard place) - but in those cases, setup.ml is invoked from a Cygwin bash prompt.
