Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Funny name for a type variable in the output: should
 this be filed on the BTS?

Jacques Garrigue recently implemented a patch that tries to keep 
user-provided type names when printing out types, and also when giving 
error messages. In your example, there probably is an internal variable 
that's called "a" because of the type name you provided. Some wizardry 
happens with GADTs, so another type variable is generated. The other 
one ends up being printed, and because it's called "a" too, the 
type-checker has to find another suitable name.

Or something like that. Maybe change type a b. to type foo bar. will 
give different results :).

Cheers,

jonathan
