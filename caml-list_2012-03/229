To your question of such a library: I don't know such a lib.
I wonder if your lines would fill some GB or RAM...?!

Not sure if it matches your question, but if there is no such lib,
you maybe want to implement the Regexp-serach by yourself...?!

For fast input the Buffe Module is really a performance boost,
compared to normal string-appending operations.
