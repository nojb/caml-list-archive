Subject: [Caml-list] ocurl: missing CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL

Hello,

I need to look at the location header,
when using ocurl.

There is
  CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME
and
  CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT

available as parameters for
curl_easy_getinfo()
but I want to look at the header and need a binding for
CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL.

Maybe developers of the OCaml-binging for curl are on this list
and may add that binding?

Would be nice.

Thanks,
   Oliver
