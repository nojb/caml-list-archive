Does the source of randomness have to be common? The decision to use a random seed doesn't need to be limited by a problem getting a good cryptographically secure generator on a given OS - you'd simply document that the implementation on that particular OS doesn't seed with a good PRNG and await a patch from someone who may care in the future, but at least the philosophy behind the decision is correct!

On Windows, as it happens, the situation is relatively easy (and it's not as even the Windows ports don't already have 1001 other workarounds and alternate methods in the runtime and standard library!): CryptGenRandom in the Crypto API or a neat little trick described in http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michael_howard/archive/2005/01/14/353379.aspx.
