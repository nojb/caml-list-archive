Subject: Re: [Caml-list] New version of the binary installer for Windows

I've understanded problem. My bash was misconfigured.


Best wishes,
Kakadu

P.S.
Btw, If I install OCaml to Program Files and call `ocaml setup.ml
-someoption` in cmd  everything fails because ocamlbuild is not found
(space in the path).
