For me you can forget about it. Jérémie convinced me that even for single module libraries cma is better (see discussion on list).

I also think so.

Never did ! Always scared me away.

Ok interesting fact. This raises a few comments/questions.  

1) You tell me that's none of oasis business. But setup.ml sports a -install option so you actually deal with installing things (even if its via ocamlfind). More than that the examples I saw for Document sections are along the lines of copying things to a specific $htmldir so oasis seems to deal with that... At least that's the place where *something* should happen so that the right info gets to the right place.

2) How does godi et al. handle documentation ? I know for sure that odb doesn't do anything about it.

3) Would ocamlfind consider extending its approach to be able to install files in subdirectories ?

I really think that easy access to README, CHANGES and other bits like ocamldoc generated doc is paramount in a good package system since you don't get to see the tarballs anymore. I try to do my best and spend long hours on the documentation of the things I distribute (doesn't mean it's perfect, I sometimes don't understand what I wrote myself...), I want them to be somehow easily accessible (and easily destroyable).  

Can't we agree on something at that level ?  

Best,

Daniel

P.S. Btw. setup.ml -install should maybe also install the _oasis files.
