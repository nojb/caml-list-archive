I was joking, but to answer seriously:

Association lists have O(1) insertion time but O(n) lookup time.  So,
you can use them as long as you're sure they are pretty short.  If
you're not sure, e.g. if malicious users of your program can grow the
a-list as much as they want, better use maps, indeed.

The joke was that we don't need a CVE to know this, just basic
algorithmic reasoning.
