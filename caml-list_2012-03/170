Subject: [Caml-list] PhD and postdoc positions in regular expressions and types

Two PhD and postdoc positions are available at DIKU, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen, in the Project "Kleene Meets Church (KMC)".  

The overall objective of KMC is to investigate the type-theoretical foundations for the prevalent use of regular expressions (and related grammars) for extracting information from an input, not just classifying it into accepting/nonaccepting; to explore and demonstrate guaranteed safety and expressiveness of programming with regular expressions as types; and to drastically improve semantic predictability and computational scalability vis a vis commonly used regular expression processing tools such as Perl.

Application deadline: March 31st, 2012.
