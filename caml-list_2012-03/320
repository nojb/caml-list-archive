Subject: [Caml-list] Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science - CfP

                         2nd CALL FOR PAPERS
                 13th International Conference on
   Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science (RAMiCS 13)
          17--21 September 2012, Cambridge University, UK
            http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/ramics13/

Scope
-----

We invite submissions in the general area of Relational and Algebraic Methods
in Computer Science. Special focus will lie on formal methods for software
engineering, logics of programs and links with neighbouring disciplines.

Particular topics of interest for the conference cover,
but are not limited to:

* Algebraic approaches to
  • specification, development, verification, and analysis of programs
    and algorithms
  • computational logic, in particular logics of programs, modal and
    dynamic logics, interval and temporal logics
  • semantics of programming languages

* Applications in fields such as
  • relational formal methods such as B or Z, tabular methods
  • information systems
  • graph theory and combinatorial optimisation
  • games, automata and language theory
  • spatio-temporal reasoning, knowledge acquisition
  • preference and scaling methods, computational social choice,
    social software

* Theoretical foundations and supporting tools, including
  • mechanised and automated reasoning, decision procedures
  • process algebras, fixed point calculi, idempotent semirings,
    quantales, allegories
  • dynamic algebras, cylindric algebras and their applications in computing


History
-------

Since 1994, the RelMiCS meetings on Relational Methods in Computer Science
have been a main forum for researchers who use the calculus of relations
and similar algebraic formalisms as methodological and conceptual tools.
The AKA workshop series on Applications of Kleene algebra started with a
Dagstuhl seminar in 2001 and was co-organised with the RelMiCS conference
until 2009. Since 2011, joint RAMiCS conferences continue to encompass
the scope of both RelMiCS and AKA.

The predecessors of this conference were held in Dagstuhl (January 1994),
Parati (September 1995), Hammamet (January 1997), Warsaw (September 1998),
Québec (January 2000), Dagstuhl (February 2001), Oisterwijk (October 2001),
Malente (April 2003), St. Catherines (January 2005), Manchester
(September 2006), Frauenwörth (April 2008), Doha (November 2009), and
Rotterdam (June 2011).


Student Program
---------------

The conference will be accompanied by a PhD training program. Details will
be published in due time in a special call and on the conference website.
