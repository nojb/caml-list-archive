Subject: [Caml-list] Efficient scanning of large strings from files


--20cf307812fe80907804bb5bd701

Dear camlers,

Say that you'd like to search a regexp on a file with lines so long that
you'd rather not load them entirely at once. If you can bound the size of a
match by k << length of a line, then you know that you can only keep a
small portion of the line in memory to search the regexp. Typically you'd
like to access substrings of size k from left to right. I guess such a
thing should involve buffered inputs and avoid copying strings as much as
possible. My question is as follows: has anybody written a library to
access these substrings gracefully and with decent performance?
Cheers,
  Philippe.
