Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] TypeRex release 1.0.0 candidate 2

Hi everyone,

This is time for a second release candidate for TypeRex, our new
OCaml development environment for Emacs. We want to thank the many early 
adopters, for their useful feedback and encouraging comments.

The new version is available on TypeRex website at:

http://www.typerex.org/

It fixes a number of issues, here is the list of changes:

- Improved performance on large libraries (lazy environments, more cache)
- Fixed encoding bug with 3bytes utf8 characters
- Use line/column positions instead of absolute bytes (fixes windows eol)
- More robust ml/mli switching (contributed by Wojciech Meyer)
- Fixed camlp4 first-class modules
- Compiles with 3.11.2 as claimed (no more 3.12 syntax in the code)
- Made the prefix key customizable (C-o by default)
- Added option --disable-version-check to configure script
- Source extensions customizable (e.g., .eliom), mlp included by default
- Allow to disable syntax coloring completely
- Applied Jun Furuse's indentation patch and changed a few defaults
- Use the caml-mode error regexp instead of tuareg's
- Fixed coloring of constructors in type definitions
- Fixed the crash when starting emacs on several files (>=3)
- Fixed wrapper for -a
- Less risky names in lisp code
- Slightly improved documentation (ocamlbuild, libraries, module packing)
- Tuareg actions use TypeRex stdlib path instead of hard-coded default


Summary of TypeRex features:

     * Improved syntax coloring
     * Auto-completion of identifiers (experimental)
     * Browsing of identifiers: show type and comment, go to definition,
       cycle between alternate definitions, and semantic grep;
     * Strictly semantic-preserving, local and whole-program refactoring:
           o renaming identifiers and compilation units
           o open elimination and reference simplification
     * Robust /w.r.t./ not-recompiled, possibly unsaved buffers
     * Scalable (used regularly on a few hundreds of source files)
