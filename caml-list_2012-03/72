Subject: [Caml-list] oasis packaging questions

Hello,  

I'd like to support oasis in the various packages I distribute. Here are a few questions (using oasis v0.3.2~rc2). 

1) All the packages I distribute are made of a single module. For now these were just installed as .cmo .cmx .cmxs. Now it seems oasis forces me to create a .mllib even if I have only one module. Is that correct ? 

2) Will the change in 1) have any impact for downstream packagers and is setup.ml enough for them ? 

3) The META plugin doesn't seem to generate the directives for plugins [1], is that right ? Does setup.ml support cmxs generation at all ? 

4) I'm really not interested in oasis trying to generate my _tags and myocamlbuild.ml files. Is it ok to substitute my own or does setup.ml rely on these ? 

5) One of the disadvantages of things like odb is that you may miss valuable information like a CHANGES file, proper documentation or sample programs. These are also things you actually would like to remove when you do a ocamlfind remove. Is there any general agreed on strategy for packages ? Best I think would be to install that along in the package directory with ocamlfind, it makes it relatively easy/evident to lookup. 

6) Regarding 5) I tried to define documentation as follows : 

Document xmlm
Title: "Xmlm documentation and module reference"
Format: html
Index: Xmlm.html 
Install: true
InstallDir: $htmldir/xmlm
DataFiles: README CHANGES doc/*.html, doc/*.css



but ocaml setup -install doesn't seem to install it. Of course this is also certainly a wrong strategy since it would install it in some directory that wouldn't be removed by ocamlfind remove. So how do we achieve that ? 

7) ocaml setup -install seems to install the modules' .mli, .cmi and .cmx by finding them in _build capitalizing the filenames even though they are not (cf. [2]). That works on my case insensitive filesystem, but it mustn't work on others, the original files are not capitalized !? Is that a bug ? 

Thanks, 

Daniel
