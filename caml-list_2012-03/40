I second here, although I never hit the limit on Windows. However,
command-line args of several megabytes are not uncommon for big projects,
especially when you call ocamlc with tons of libraries. Well, I never did
that large projects under Windows, only under Linux.

I think a very first shot could be to require that the responsefile must
be given as an absolute path (with drive letter, or as network path). This
will syntactically disambiguate it from most other uses. Normally it
points to the temp folder anyway, given as absolute path, so this
additional requirement will hardly break programs.

A cleaner solution would probably to move the responsefile implementation
up to the Arg module, so that the user (a) sees it, and (b) can enable or
disable it as needed.
