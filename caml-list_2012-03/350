Hi again,

Following all the good suggestions in this thread, I've updated the 
installer. It now downloads and runs cygwin's setup.exe so as to provide 
a fully working environment for OCaml on windows after the installer 
completes. The cygwin installer runs in silent mode, that is, the 
progress window shows up, but there is no user prompt.

I've also looked into odb compatibility, and it looks like after writing 
a few patches, odb now runs fine on Windows. However, Oasis-generated 
setup.ml files do not work at all on windows. Any help in that area 
would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,

jonathan

      I've spent the past few days improving the OCaml installer for
      windows. This should solve all issues that have been mentioned
      previously. This in preparation for the upcoming 4.0 release ;
      therefore, the "beta installer" below will install a fairly recent

      <b>Changelog:</b><br>
      <br>
      - The installer packages a working and well-configured findlib,
      out of the box. This means you can open up cmd.exe, type ocaml,
      then type #use "topfind";; in the top-level.<br>
      - The installer no longer blasts the PATH variable if it is too
      long. Moreover, it is now able to deal with PATHs that are up to
      8192 bytes long.<br>
      - The installer is now able to deal with multi-user privileges: in
      particular, you can use this installer on a <b>limited account</b>:
      OCaml will properly install into your local "Application Data"
      folder if you don't have administrator rights on your machine.
      This should be particularly useful for school computers that run
      Windows.<br>
      - Various fixes: better cleanups on exit, minor fixes for
      OCamlWinPlus, properly warn the user if it was unable to download
      ActiveTCL from the internet.<br>
      - The installer packages a newer version of flexlink, so you
      shouldn't have any more issues with gcc not accepting the
      -mno-cygwin option. However, the new, official toolchain uses the
      mingw64 32-bit compilers. This means flexlink will look for a
      i686-w64-mingw32-gcc in your path whenever you try to do native
      compilation. The official, recommended way to work is to install
      cygwin and its mingw64 packages. While in theory it should be
      possible to work within a MSys environment, some issues [1]
      currently prevent you from doing so.<br>
