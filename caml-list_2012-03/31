Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [community poll for PR#5312] Do some OCaml Windows
 users still use the @responsefile feature?

Hello gasche,

Actually i didn't even known about the @responsefile feature.
My ocaml 3.12.1 console programs still run under Windows98se, Win98 can no
more compile yet it can run.
So ocaml windows support is quite long-term.
 
I don't mind whether the @responsefile feature is removed or not.
I won't be affected.  

Thanks for the consideration,

- Damien Guichard (SpiceGuid)
