one file per package, filename is package name, contents are same format 
as rest of packages line but with \n between key=value pairs instead of 
space.

Deps are just a comma-separated list of package names, with optional 
version numbers in parentheses.  I'll document this in the packages file 
now.

I've been thinking about this for a long time, and the full consequences 
of this involve not only deep changes to odb internals, but also expose 
the code to a ton more edge cases that need to be handled, as well as 
possibly some NP-hard problems of resolving version dependencies.  Odb 
may go this way if needed, but the current practice of having a single 
string as the package identifier is sufficient for my use, so...

You're more than welcome to fork and build a better odb.  I may even 
steal any good ideas you have and put them back in my odb.  :)
