Subject: [Caml-list] Intersection Types and Related Systems (ITRS 2012) -- Final Call

**********************************************************************
                   Second CALL FOR PAPER
   Sixth Workshop on Intersection Types and Related Systems (ITRS 2012)
            June 29th, Dubrovnik (Croatia).

             http://itrs2012.di.unito.it/

         Workshop held in conjunction with LICS 2012

**********************************************************************

ITRS 2010 workshop aims to bring together researchers working on both 
the theory and practical applications of systems based on intersection 
types and related approaches.

IMPORTANT DATES

     Abstract Submission: April 13
     Author notification: April 30
     Abstract final version due: June 10
     EPTCS Post-proceedings Submission: before September 30th, 2012

SUBMISSION
The submission is in two stages.
(1) Before the workshop, authors are invited to submit an extended 
abstract (3-5 pages, max. 10 pages) in PDF format.
(2) After the workshop, authors of accepted papers will be invited to 
submit full versions, which will be referred for inclusion in EPTCS 
post-proceedings.

TOPICS
Possible topics for submitted papers include, but are not limited to:
- Formal properties of systems with intersection types.
- Results for related systems, such as union types, refinement types, or 
singleton types.
- Applications to lambda calculus and similar systems.
- Applications to pi-calculus and similar systems.
- Applications for programming languages.
- Applications for other areas, such as database query languages and 
program extraction from proofs.
- Related approaches using behavioural/intesional types to characterize 
computational properties.
