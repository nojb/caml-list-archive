If you actually took time to have a look the systems I mentioned, they symlink executables in the regular/expected directories in /usr/local. No short-sighting here, sorry, but of course you may have to question some of your pre-conceptions about package management.

Well in my opinion these system solve problems that are known to be complex (like having multiple versions of the same library) in a conceptually very simple and understandable way.

Ah, I thought findlib was a "library manager for Objective Caml". A library without documentation is useless. Frankly, beyond your initial objection, what are the costs and implications of allowing `ocamlfind install` to install files in package subdirectories ?

Fundamentally that's not the point, what I want a system that is simple to understand and fix when it breaks. Having easy things like `ocamlfind remove package` removes everything that package installed is part of such a system for me, aswell as simple concepts like everything that this package installed is located in that directory.

Good documentation and easy access to it makes me productive. I'm sure a lot of other people like to be productive.

I never pretended to be a real hacker... I don't need to show-off, I'm rather limited and actually enjoy simple solutions to complex problems.  

Best,

Daniel
