I think this is awesome. OCaml is much more pleasant to use than the
alternatives, so having it available for developing software on mobile
devices is great, even if it's only iOS. ;)

Your a frontiersman... and I hope others follow suit and write more games
in OCaml and bring it to more mobile platforms!

I've been writing a game for PC with possibility of targeting PS3... and
maybe phones. But I don't even own a phone, so that's not in-mind for now.

I appreciate your work! Even more if I do end up using it!

 Tony
