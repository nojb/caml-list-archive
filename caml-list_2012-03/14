======================================================================
SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

WADT 2012
21st International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques
http://maude.sip.ucm.es/wadt2012
June 7-10, 2012, Salamanca, Spain
======================================================================


AIMS AND SCOPE
The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of application areas (including information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems).
The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:
- Foundations of algebraic specification
- Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and models of concurrent, distributed and mobile computing
- Specification languages, methods, and environments
- Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
- Model-driven development
- Graph transformations, term rewriting and proof systems
- Integration of formal specification techniques
- Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification

WORKSHOP FORMAT AND LOCATION
The workshop will take place over four days, Thursday to Sunday, at Colegio Mayor Arzobispo Fonseca in the center of Salamanca. Presentations will be selected on the basis of submitted abstracts. Three talks will be given by invited speakers.

INVITED SPEAKERS
Roberto Bruni. Universita di Pisa, Italy
Francisco Duran. Universidad de Malaga, Spain
Kim G. Larsen. Aalborg University, Denmark

IMPORTANT DATES
Submission deadline for abstracts: April 2, 2012
Notification of acceptance: April 20, 2012
Final abstract due: May 18, 2012
Workshop in Salamanca: June 7-10, 2012

SUBMISSIONS
The scientific program of the workshop will include presentations of recent results and ongoing research. The presentations will be selected on the basis of the submitted abstracts according to originality, significance, and general interest.
The abstracts have to be submitted electronically according to the instructions published on the workshop homepage.

PROCEEDINGS
The final versions of the selected abstracts will be included in a flash drive for the workshop participants. After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit full papers for the refereed proceedings, which will be published as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer).

SPONSORSHIP
The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3, and is sponsored by IFIP TC1, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Universidad de Salamanca, Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, and IMDEA Software.
