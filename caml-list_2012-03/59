Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Can one implement greedy/inline data structures in

Cycles are fine for ocaml, pointers are pretty cheap, and I think the 
answer to your question is no - there's a regularity to values that's 
required by the garbage collector, and what you seem to want is the 
ability to inline nested structures without pointers, and OCaml's data 
representation doesn't allow this, mainly because of the tag word needed 
by the GC.

Beware premature optimization.
