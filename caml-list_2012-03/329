I haven't had a go with it, but will try it as soon as possible. However, it sounded from the description as though it offers to install ActiveTCL by downloading it from the internet and running the installer for you. Couldn't it then offer the same for Cygwin? It would simply need to pull down http://cygwin.com/setup.exe and then run:

setup.exe --root=C:\cygwin --download --quiet-mode --no-startmenu --no-desktop --packages=make,mingw64-i686-gcc-g++ >nul 2>&1

which would circumvent all licensing issues, I believe.

My own install script also adds git, subversion, patch, m4 and unzip as these are also needed for building various libraries from source. I install g++ because SpiderMonkey has portions written in C++ but you can install mingw64-i686-gcc-core instead if you don't want a C++ compiler.
