I have looked at bin_prot and sexplib previously.
They are very nice and useful.

I have found one (I guess unnecessary) disadvantage over `deriving'.
If you process your *.ml file with sexplib/bin_prot preprocessor, you
have to append "with ..." suffix to every type definition, otherwise you
will get a an error report from the preprocessor. `Deriving' does not
force you to do that. You can annotate only those type definitions,
which for you makes sense to annotate.
