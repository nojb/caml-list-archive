========================================================================

The European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing (ESOCC) 
is the premier conference on the advances in the state of the art and 
practice of Service-Oriented Computing and Cloud Computing. During the 
past edition of ECOWS (European Conference on Web Services) conference, 
the Steering Committee decided to renew and broaden its scope, and 
to start a new conference series on the topics of service-oriented and 
cloud computing. The first edition of the new series, ESOCC 2012, will 
be held in Bertinoro from 19th to 21st of September, 2012. The main 
objectives of this conference are to facilitate the exchange between 
researchers and practitioners and to foster future collaborations in 
Europe and beyond. The ESOCC 2012 conference will include invited 
speakers, presentations of contributed research papers and an industrial 
track with the participation of top researchers from industry. 
ESOCC 2012 will also include a PhD symposium and satellite workshops. 

----------
Background
----------
The success encountered by the Web has shown that tightly 
coupled software systems are only good for niche markets, 
whereas loosely coupled software systems can be more flexible, 
more adaptive and often more appropriate in practice. Loose 
coupling makes it easier for a given system to interact with
other systems, possibly legacy systems that share very little 
with it. When applications are developed with service-oriented 
architectures, they can evolve more easily during their lifespan 
and adapt better to changing or even unpredictable environments. 
On the other hand, cloud computing enables a new application 
execution paradigm where resources can be optimally utilised and 
exchanged between heterogeneous execution platforms and the cloud, 
so as to achieve fast response times and ensure immersive and 
non-interrupted user experience. Services today are developed and 
deployed in a black-box manner, which is of particular importance 
from a business perspective since services are implemented in a 
variety of technologies. Similarly, cloud computing tries to enable 
the mobility and the device and platform independence by promoting
interoperability, portability and security standards. Essential is 
agreement on integration technology and consensus has emerged in 
today's middleware market: Customers want to use Web technologies. 
However, service integrators, developers, and providers need to create 
methods, tools and techniques to support cost-effective development and 
use of dependable services and service-oriented applications in the cloud.

------------------
Topics of interest
------------------
The ESOCC 2012 program committee seeks original, high quality 
papers related to all aspects of Service-Oriented and Cloud 
Computing,  which constitute the main technology available to date 
for implementing service-oriented architectures and cloud computing. 

Topics of interest to the Research and Industry Tracks include, 
but are not limited to, the following:

- Business Process Management and Web Services
- Cloud Services Management and Composition using Web Services
- Dynamic and Adaptive Web Services     
- Economics Models and Web Services     
- Enterprise Architecture and Web Services     
- Emerging Trends of Service Composition and Mashups     
- Experience reports of novel applications of Service-Oriented and
Cloud Computing in  Health, Commerce, Finance, Telecom, Scientific 
Computing and other domains    
- Service modeling, service-oriented analysis and design  
- Formal Methods for Web Services     
- Frameworks for Building Web Service-Based Applications     
- Architectural Models for Cloud Computing
- Identity and Access Management using Web Services     
- Mobile Web Services     
- Model-Driven Web Service Engineering   
- Next Generation Web Services Middleware and Service Repositories 
- Service quality and service interface design guidelines 
- RESTful Web Services         
- Self-Organizing Service Oriented Architectures     
- Semantic Web Services     
- Service Level Agreements for Web services     
- Service-Oriented Business Collaboration     
- SOA Governance and Web Services     
- Social Web Services                
- Web Services for Grids     
- Web Services in Service-Oriented Environments     
- Web Services Life-Cycles      
- Web Services Security and Privacy 

It should be noted that papers on existing product descriptions 
or product marketing information are not within the scope of the 
ESOCC 2012 Industrial Track.

PhD Symposium
-------------
The ESOCC 2012 PhD Symposium is an international forum for PhD 
students working in any of the areas addressed by the ESOCC 
conference. The main aim of the Symposium is to give PhD 
students an opportunity to present their research activity and 
perspectives, to critically discuss them with other PhD students 
and with established researchers in the area, and to get fruitful 
feedback and advices on their research activity. 

PhD students working in any area addressed by the ESOCC 
conference can submit a short report providing a clear statement 
of the problem they intend to address, motivating the interest 
and novelty of the underlying research challenges, demonstrating 
the ideas by examples, and describing the proposed research plan 
and expected results. Reports should not exceed 6 pages formatted 
according to the LNCS proceedings guidelines. The papers should 
be authored by the PhD student and indicate the name of her/his 
supervisor. Submissions must be sent by email to the symposium 
chair Wolf Zimmermann (wolf.zimmermann@informatik.uni-halle.de).

---------------------
Submission Guidelines
---------------------
The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
