Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Re: [oss-security] CVE request: Hash DoS
 vulnerability (ocert-2011-003)

In my humble opinion, here we have two different vision of what
computer programming is, or should be. Your statement "maybe it's
better to assume that the programmer will not be aware of attacks" may
be true for the average Java programmer (please, no flame, no insult
intended to Java programmers reading this list!) but not for an OCaml
programmer. I want to be perfectly aware of attacks, and I want to be
in control of the data structure I use, and not "be unaware"...

In Python, the other language I use every day, dictionaries are
implemented as hash tables and not having reproducibility is a PITA.
