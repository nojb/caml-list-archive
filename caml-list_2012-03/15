AIMS and SCOPE

The aim of the WS-FM workshop series is to bring together researchers=20
working on Web Services and Formal Methods in order to catalyze fruitful=20
collaboration.

Web services are fundamental to cloud computing and other computing=20
paradigms based on service-oriented architectures and applications.=20
They make functional and autonomous building blocks available over=20
the Internet, independent of platforms and programming languages, and=20
both within and across organizational boundaries. These can then be=20
described, located, orchestrated, and invoked. Virtualization technology=20
has moreover led to the Software as a Service, Platform as a Service,=20
and Infrastructure as a Service notions.

Formal methods can play a fundamental role in research on these=20
concepts. They can help define unambiguous semantics for the languages=20
and protocols that underpin web service infrastructures, and provide a=20
basis for checking the conformance and compliance of bundled services.=20
They can also empower dynamic discovery and binding with compatibility=20
checks against behavioral properties, quality of service requirements,=20
and service-level agreements. The resulting possibility of formal=20
verification and analysis of (security) properties and performance=20
(dependability and trustworthiness) is essential to cloud computing and=20
to application areas like e-commerce, e-government, e-health, workflow,=20
business process management, etc. Moreover, the challenges raised by=20
research on these concepts can extend the state of the art in formal=20
methods.

The scope of the WS-FM workshop series is not limited to technological=20
aspects. In fact, there is a strong tradition of attracting submissions=20
on formal approaches to enterprise systems modeling in general, and=20
business process modeling in particular. Potentially, this might have a=20
significant and lasting impact on the ongoing standardization efforts in=20
cloud computing technologies.

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions must be original and should neither be already published=20
somewhere else nor be under consideration for publication while being=20
evaluated for this workshop.

Papers are to be prepared in Springer LNCS format and must not exceed 15=20
pages. If necessary, the paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked=20
appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of the program=20
committee. Post-proceedings of WS-FM will be published by Springer in=20
their Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

All papers must be submitted following the instructions at the WS-FM'12=20
submission site, handled by EasyChair:=20
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dwsfm2012
