Hi,

I've spent the past few days improving the OCaml installer for windows. 
This should solve all issues that have been mentioned previously. This 
in preparation for the upcoming 4.0 release ; therefore, the "beta 
installer" below will install a fairly recent trunk version of OCaml.

http://yquem.inria.fr/~protzenk/caml-installer/ocaml-4.01.0+dev0-i686-mingw64.exe

*Changelog:*

- The installer packages a working and well-configured findlib, out of 
the box. This means you can open up cmd.exe, type ocaml, then type #use 
"topfind";; in the top-level.
- The installer no longer blasts the PATH variable if it is too long. 
Moreover, it is now able to deal with PATHs that are up to 8192 bytes long.
- The installer is now able to deal with multi-user privileges: in 
particular, you can use this installer on a *limited account*: OCaml 
will properly install into your local "Application Data" folder if you 
don't have administrator rights on your machine. This should be 
particularly useful for school computers that run Windows.
- Various fixes: better cleanups on exit, minor fixes for OCamlWinPlus, 
properly warn the user if it was unable to download ActiveTCL from the 
internet.
- The installer packages a newer version of flexlink, so you shouldn't 
have any more issues with gcc not accepting the -mno-cygwin option. 
However, the new, official toolchain uses the mingw64 32-bit compilers. 
This means flexlink will look for a i686-w64-mingw32-gcc in your path 
whenever you try to do native compilation. The official, recommended way 
to work is to install cygwin and its mingw64 packages. While in theory 
it should be possible to work within a MSys environment, some issues [1] 
currently prevent you from doing so.

Please let me know if anything doesn't work as expected. This will be 
the official installer for the 4.0 release.

Cheers,

jonathan
