     Full paper submission   26 March 2012 (23h59 GMT)  > EXTENDED <
     Notification            21 May 2012
     Camera-ready            10 June 2012
     Conference              11-13 September 2012


Objective

Static Analysis is increasingly recognized as a fundamental  tool
for  program  verification, bug detection, compiler optimization,
program understanding, and software maintenance.  The  series  of
Static Analysis Symposia has served as the primary venue for pre-
sentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances  in
the area. The Nineteenth International Static Analysis Symposium,
SAS 2012, will be held in Deauville,  France.  Previous  symposia
were  held  in  Venice, Perpignan, Los Angeles, Valencia, Kongens
Lyngby, Seoul, London, Verona, San Diego,  Madrid,  Paris,  Santa
Barbara, Pisa, Aachen, Glasgow, and Namur.


Topics

The   technical   program   for  SAS 2012 will consist of invited
lectures and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions  are
welcomed  on  all  aspects of static analysis, including, but not
limited to:

             abstract domains     abstract interpretation
             abstract testing     bug detection
           data flow analysis     model checking
             new applications     program transformation
         program verification     security analysis
       theoretical frameworks     type checking

Submissions  can  address  any  programming  paradigm,  including
concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative,   logic,  object-
oriented,  aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU  programming.
Survey papers, that present some aspect  of  the   above   topics
with  a  new  coherence,  and application papers,  that  describe
experience with industrial applications, are  also welcomed.


Submission Information

Papers  must  describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not  substantially  overlap  with  papers  that
have  been   published  or that are simultaneously submitted to a
journal or a conference with  refereed   proceedings.   Submitted
papers  will  be  judged  on  the  basis  of  significance, rele-
vance,  correctness,  originality,   and   clarity.  They  should
clearly  identify what has been  accomplished and  why it is sig-
nificant.

Paper    submissions   should  not  exceed 15 pages in Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science LNCS format, excluding bibliog-
raphy   and  well-marked appendices.  Program  committee  members
are  not required to read  the  appendices,  and thus papers must
be intelligible without them.
