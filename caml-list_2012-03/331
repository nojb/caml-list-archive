Subject: [Caml-list] Reducing boxing for floats

Dear caml-list,

I'd like to ask for the community help in evaluating the benefits of a 
new strategy to control boxing/unboxing of floats in ocamlopt.

I've implemented this new strategy in the more_unboxing branch of the 
SVN. You can find some description (and micro-benchmarks) there:

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5204


If numerical code is the bottleneck of one of your applications, it 
would be helpful if you could you try out the more_unboxing branch 
(forked from the trunk in january 2011, IIRC) and report the results on 
Mantis.

Thanks!


Alain
