Subject: [Caml-list] Very slow compilation


--20cf300fb3a7993b7904baf32d60
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

We encountered a problem of a slow compilation. When the project grew up,
the time of compilation increased considerably. We have many classes and
objects, and the type checking of objects and classes performs very slowly.
I have Core i3 3GHz iMac, and the average compilation time of one module is
7-13 seconds. The entire projet is compiled within 10-15 minutes. The major
part of the time is taken by "Typemod.type_implementation", which include
many calls of Ctype.unify (80% of compilation time). Now, it is getting
hard and slow to develop the projetct, are there any ways to accelarate it?
It is difficult to get all fine points, but I wish I could make the process
faster. Thanks for any help or comments. Looking forward to your reply
