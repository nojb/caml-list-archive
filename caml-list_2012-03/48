Subject: [Caml-list] Semantic Web Journal: Special Call for Surveys on Application Areas of
 Semantic Technologies

Semantic Web journal

Special Call for

Surveys on Application Areas of Semantic Technologies

<http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/semantic-web-journal-special-call-surveys-application-areas-semantic-technologies>

Semantic Web technologies are currently in a transition from research to 
practice. The amount of progress made in different application areas, 
however, differs significantly, as do the challenges which lie ahead.

The Semantic Web journal calls for survey papers on the state of the art 
in research, development, and deployment of Semantic Web technologies in 
specific application areas and domains. Surveys should focus on one 
specific application area and discuss in a comprehensive way

* its importance,
* the particular (past, present, and future) challenges faced in 
applying Semantic technologies in this area, and
* the state of the art in developing foundational principles and 
practical solutions related to this area.

Application areas covered may range from those where commercial 
solutions have already been deployed, to areas where basic research is 
still under way. They may address very specific needs, e.g., mobile 
recommender systems, or span broader scientific domains, e.g., the life 
sciences.

Survey articles should have the potential to become well-known 
introductory and overview texts. They will be reviewed along the 
following dimensions: (1) Suitability as introductory text, targeted at 
researchers, students, or practitioners, to get started on the covered 
topic. (2) How comprehensive and how balanced is the presentation and 
coverage. (3) Readability and clarity of the presentation. (4) 
Importance of the covered material to the broader Semantic Web community.

Prospective authors must take notice of the submission guidelines posted 
at http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors

Authors must submit an intention to contribute, consisting of 
(tentative) list of authors, (tentative) title, and a short abstract, by 
March 15th. The reason for this requirement is to avoid that multiple 
surveys are written on very similar topics.


Deadlines:

Intention to contribute: March 15th, 2012
Paper submission: May 15th, 2012
First notification: Usually within 8 weeks of submission
