THE TOPIC
---------

Intelligent computing covers a hybrid palette of methods and techniques
derived from classical artificial intelligence, computational intelligence,
multi-agent systems a.o. Distributed computing studies systems that contain
loosely-coupled components running on different networked computers and that
communicate and coordinate their actions by message transfer. The emergent
field of intelligent distributed computing is expected to pose special
challenges of adaptation and fruitful combination of results of both areas
with a great impact on the development of new generation intelligent
distributed information systems. The aim of this symposium is to bring
together researchers involved in intelligent distributed computing to allow
cross-fertilization and synergy of ideas and to enable advancement of
researches in the field.

The symposium welcomes submissions of original papers concerning all aspects
of intelligent distributed computing ranging from concepts and theoretical
developments to advanced technologies and innovative applications. Papers
acceptance and publication will be judged based on their relevance to the
symposium theme, clarity of presentation, originality and accuracy of results
and proposed solutions.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Intelligent Distributed Architecture
------------------------------------
Hybrid systems involving software agents and human actors
Intelligent integration of data and processes
