With two Jacques who reasonably frequently post onto caml-list on the

                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                                WGP 2012

             8th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic Programming
                           Copenhagen, Denmark
                       Sunday, September 9th, 2012

                     http://www.wgp-sigplan.org/2012

                           Co-located with the
     International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2012)
======================================================================


Goals of the workshop
---------------------

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class
hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and to theoreticians, and, for at least 20 years,
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research
in the functional and object-oriented programming communities. Generic
programming has gradually spread to more and more mainstream
languages, and today is widely used in industry. This workshop brings
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
from around the world, and features papers capturing the state of the
art in this important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

     * generic programming,
     * programming with (C++) concepts,
     * meta-programming,
     * programming with type classes,
     * programming with modules,
     * programming with dependent types,
     * type systems for generic programming,
     * polytypic programming,
     * adaptive object-oriented programming,
     * component-based programming,
     * strategic programming,
     * aspect-oriented programming,
     * family polymorphism,
     * object-oriented generic programming,
     * implementation of generic programming languages,
     * static and dynamic analyses of generic programs,
     * and so on.

Proceedings and Copyright
-------------------------

We plan to have formal proceedings, published by the ACM.  Authors must
transfer copyright to ACM upon acceptance (for government work, to the
extent transferable), but retain various rights
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy). Authors are
encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper (source code,
test data, etc.); they retain copyright of auxiliary material.

Submission details
------------------

Deadline for submission:     Friday    2012-06-01
Notification of acceptance:  Wednesday 2012-06-27
Final submission due:        Tuesday   2012-07-10
Workshop:                    Sunday    2012-09-09

Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at

   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wgp2012

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (two-column, 9pt). The length is
restricted to 12 pages.

Travel Support
--------------

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see its web page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).

History of the Workshop on Generic Programming
----------------------------------------------

Earlier Workshops on Generic Programming have been held in

   * Tokyo, Japan 2011 (affiliated with ICFP11),
   * Baltimore, Maryland, US 2010 (affiliated with ICFP10),
   * Edinburgh, UK 2009 (affiliated with ICFP09),
   * Victoria, BC, Canada 2008 (affiliated with ICFP),
   * Portland 2006 (affiliated with ICFP),
   * Ponte de Lima 2000 (affiliated with MPC),
   * Marstrand 1998 (affiliated with MPC).

Furthermore, there were a few informal workshops

   * Utrecht 2005 (informal workshop),
   * Dagstuhl 2002 (IFIP WG2.1 Working Conference),
   * Nottingham 2001 (informal workshop).

There were also (closely related) DGP workshops in Oxford (June
3-4 2004), and a Spring School on DGP in Nottingham (April 24-27
2006, which had a half-day workshop attached).
