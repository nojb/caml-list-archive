Subject: Re: [Caml-list] New version of the binary installer for Windows

Unfortunately, ocamlbuild requires a unix-like environment, with a few 
utilities in the path: bash, mkdir...

The installer only provides the very basics. It does not provide a unix 
environment on windows, only the ocaml binaries, flexlink, and 
ocamlfind. If you want to go further, e.g. use ocamlbuild, or benefit 
from native compilation, you need to install a development environment, 
such as cygwin, or msys. Currently, because of bug 5465, cygwin is the 
recommended way.

I've successfully used ocamlbuild under cygwin and msys, and it works 
fine.

Cheers,

jonathan
