Yes, this is possible.  Most details of this are already implemented; 
the code to do `ocamlfind remove foo` is already implemented as part of 
--force for reinstalling/upgrading packages that don't ocamlfind remove 
themselves as part of their `make install`, but...

This doesn't remove the package.  It only stops ocamlfind from 
complaining about double installation of the same package.  If users 
want to remove an ocamlfind package, they can type "ocamlfind remove 
foo" themselves; it's saving them only a few keystrokes to have an odb 
alias for the same thing, and even if it were added, it wouldn't work 
properly in many cases, as it wouldn't deal with executables and any 
other files installed by a program (documentation, etc.).

For myself, when I want to remove something installed by odb, I usually 
just nuke my whole ~/.odb directory and reinstall the packages I want to 
keep.

Thus my resistance to 'odb --remove foo'.
