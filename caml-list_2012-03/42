Thanks for TypeRex. I'm impressed by the possibilities that someone like
TypeRex offers. It might finally be a way to close the gap among the
limited capabilities of our current "IDE-s" and IDE-s for other
programming languages. The refactoring helper, in particular, is
something I'm delighted to see coming.

At the same time, I'm not thrilled at the idea of having to use a
different ocamlc just to benefit from TypeRex. Having to do so brings a
number of disadvantages, the first and foremost being that now the
programmer needs to worry about having synchronized versions of the
"legacy" ocamlc installed on his machine and the version shipped by
TypeRex. But there are more disadvantages, unfortunately.

Can you tell us why we can't (or maybe *when* we will be able to :-))
have the nice features offered by TypeRex on top of the stock ocamlc
compiler?

Having a perspective on when, if ever, TypeRex will be able to work on
the stock ocamlc compiler will help driving my choice of whether
adopting TypeRex or not. And I'm probably not the only one with similar
doubts.

Many thanks in advance,
Cheers.
