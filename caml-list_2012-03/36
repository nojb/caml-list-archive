If I understand the situation correctly, this approach is not
currently an option, as the @responsefile expansion is done by the
OCaml runtime -- affects all programs, before they process their
arguments -- while the "-w" exception would only make sense for the
compiler toolchains; there is no reason why an user program (that
currently can use the @responsefile feature) would suddenly stop
expanding @-files after a "-w", an option which may have completely
different semantics in this program command-line interface.
