Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.10.2

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Grace Hopper by 
announcing
the release of OCaml version 4.10.2.

This exceptional release makes OCaml 4.10 available on the new 
macOS/arm64 platform,
and fixes some compatibility issues for the mingw64 and FreeBSD/amd64 
platform.
If OCaml 4.10.1 already works on your platform of choice, this release 
should be
completely transparent to you (and can be safely ignored).
Note that those fixes were backported from OCaml 4.12: further 
improvement to the support
of the macOS/arm64 platform will happen on the 4.12 branch.

The release is available as a set of OPAM switches,
and as a source download here:

https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.10.2.tar.gz
https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.10/

Happy hacking,

-- Florian Angeletti, for the OCaml team.

OCaml 4.10.2
-------------------

- #9938, #9939: Define __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0 for the mingw-w64 ports to
   prevent their C99-compliant snprintf conflicting with ours.
   (David Allsopp, report by Michael Soegtrop, review by Xavier Leroy)

### Supported platforms:

- #9699, #10026: add support for iOS and macOS on ARM 64 bits
   Backported from OCaml 4.12.0
   (GitHub user @EduardoRFS, review by Xavier Leroy, Nicolás Ojeda Bär
    and Anil Madhavapeddy, additional testing by Michael Schmidt)

### Code generation and optimization

- #9752, #10026: Revised handling of calling conventions for
   external C functions.
   Provide a more precise description of the types of unboxed arguments,
   so that the ARM64 iOS/macOS calling conventions can be honored.
   Backported from OCaml 4.12.0
   (Xavier Leroy, review by Mark Shinwell and Github user @EduardoRFS)

- #9969, #9981: Added mergeable flag tqo ELF sections containing mergeable
   constants.  Fixes compatibility with the integrated assembler in 
clang 11.0.0.
