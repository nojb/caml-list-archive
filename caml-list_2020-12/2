Thread-Index: V9S5Gj3X2dFFYFebpy0G3MuP7uhoiw==
Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 4.12.0, second alpha release

Dear OCaml users,

The release of OCaml 4.12.0 is approaching. We have released a second alpha
version to help fellow hackers join us early in our bug hunting and
opam ecosystem fixing fun.

Beyond the usual bug fixes this new alpha version removes the type system c=
hange that
restricted the propagation of type information between branches of a "match=
".
The newly introduced warning was more troublesome than expected, the featur=
e has
been thus postponed to 4.13 .

The base compiler can be installed as an opam switch with the following com=
mands

opam update
opam switch create 4.12.0~alpha2 --repositories=3Ddefault,beta=3Dgit+https:=
//github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

If you want to tweak the configuration of the compiler, you can pick config=
uration options with

opam update
opam switch create <switch_name> --packages=3Docaml-variants.4.12.0~alpha2+=
options,<option_list> --repositories=3Ddefault,beta=3Dgit+https://github.co=
m/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

where <option_list> is a comma separated list of ocaml-option-* packages. F=
or
instance, for a flambda and afl enabled switch:

opam switch create 4.12.0~alpha2+flambda+afl --packages=3Docaml-variants.4.=
12.0~alpha2+options,ocaml-option-flambda,ocaml-option-afl --repositories=3D=
default,beta=3Dgit+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

All available options can be listed with "opam search ocaml-option".

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.12.0-alpha2.tar.gz
 https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.12/ocaml-4.12.0~alpha2.tar.gz

If you want to test this version, it is advised to install the alpha opam r=
epository

https://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository

with

opam repo add alpha git://github.com/kit-ty-kate/opam-alpha-repository.git

This alpha repository contains various packages patched with fixes in the
process of being upstreamed. Once the repository installed, these patched
packages will take precedence over the non-patched version.

If you find any bugs, please report them here:
 https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Happy hacking,

-- Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.

Changes from the first alpha:
----------------------------

## Removed feature

-* #9811: remove propagation from previous branches
  Type information inferred from previous branches was propagated in
  non-principal mode. Revert this for better compatibility with
  -principal mode.
  For the time being, infringing code should result in a principality warni=
ng.
  (Jacques Garrigue, review by Thomas Refis and Gabriel Scherer)


## New bug fixes

Entries marked with "+" contains were already present in the previous alpha
but contain more bug fixes


+ #9500, #9727, #9866, #9870, +#9873: Injectivity annotations
  One can now mark type parameters as injective, which is useful for
  abstract types:
    module Vec : sig type !'a t end =3D struct type 'a t =3D 'a array end
  On non-abstract types, this can be used to check the injectivity of
  parameters. Since all parameters of record and sum types are by definitio=
n
  injective, this only makes sense for type abbreviations:
    type !'a t =3D 'a list
  Note that this change required making the regularity check stricter.
  (Jacques Garrigue, review by Jeremy Yallop and Leo White)


- #2195: Improve error message in bytecode stack trace printing and load
  debug information during bytecode startup if OCAMLRUNPARAM=3Db=3D2.
  (David Allsopp, review by Gabriel Scherer and Xavier Leroy)

- #10050: update {PUSH,}OFFSETCLOSURE* bytecode instructions to match new
  representation for closures
  (Nathana=EBl Courant, review by Xavier Leroy)

- #10035: Make sure that flambda respects atomicity in the Atomic module.
  (Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoni, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- #8796: On Windows, make Unix.utimes use FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS flag
  to allow it to work with directories.
  (Daniil Baturin, review by Damien Doligez)

- #10008: Improve error message for aliases to the current compilation unit=
.
  (Leo White, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- #9938, #9939: Define __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=3D0 for the mingw-w64 ports t=
o
  prevent their C99-compliant snprintf conflicting with ours.
  (David Allsopp, report by Michael Soegtrop, review by Xavier Leroy)

- #7813, #9955: make sure the major GC cycle doesn't get stuck in Idle stat=
e
  (Damien Doligez, report by Anders Fugmann, review by Jacques-Henri Jourda=
n)

- #9991: Fix reproducibility for `-no-alias-deps`
  (Leo White, review by Gabriel Scherer and Florian Angeletti)

- #9998: Use Sys.opaque_identity in CamlinternalLazy.force
  This removes extra warning 59 messages when compiling afl-instrumented
  code with flambda -O3.
  (Vincent Laviron, report by Louis Gesbert, review by Gabriel Scherer and
   Pierre Chambart)

- #9999: fix -dsource printing of the pattern (`A as x | (`B as x)).
  (Gabriel Scherer, report by Anton Bachin, review by Florian Angeletti)

- #9970, #10010: fix the declaration scope of extensible-datatype construct=
ors.
  A regression that dates back to 4.08 makes extensible-datatype constructo=
rs
  with inline records very fragile, for example:
    type 'a t +=3D X of {x : 'a}
  (Gabriel Scherer, review by Thomas Refis and Leo White,
   report by Nicol=E1s Ojeda B=E4r)
