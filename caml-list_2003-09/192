Well, actually, I recall only one such occasion. I have since 
incorparated some of your comments and explained why I didn't do so for 
  some others. Of course, I may have overlooked something, so I am 
always open to further suggestions. Which part of the page you think is 
no longer up-to-date, or what is missing, particularly with respect to 
the SML->OCaml direction in question?

(But please always bear in mind that the page intentionally makes no 
attempt to cover constructs that cannot be mapped reasonably between 
languages, e.g. objects, poly variants, user-defined fixity, advanced 
library issues, etc.)

In the light of this thread I may add a section about comparisons and 
eqtypes. I hesitate because the simplistic tabular form of the page 
seems a bit unsuited to cope with the respective subtleties properly. 
Any ideas welcome.

	- Andreas
