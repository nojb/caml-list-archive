Hi there, 
 
We are using PCRE (4.3 -latest version- and 4.2) 
and PCRE OCAML (5.02 and 5.03) libraries for a UE 
project called POESIA. When compiling the 
application, we get the following errors: 
 
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/pcre/libpcre_stubs.a(pcre_stubs.o): 
In function `pcre_ocaml_init': 
pcre_stubs.o(.text+0x159): undefined reference to 
`pcre_callout' 
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/pcre/libpcre_stubs.a(pcre_stubs.o): 
In function `pcre_get_stringnumber_wrapper': 
pcre_stubs.o(.text+0x9bd): undefined reference to 
`pcre_get_stringnumber' 
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/pcre/libpcre_stubs.a(pcre_stubs.o): 
In function `pcre_config_int': 
pcre_stubs.o(.text+0x9ff): undefined reference to 
`pcre_config' 
 
Apparently, the error is the same as the one that 
Makus Mottl posted last 30th July. 
It was like this: 
> when i install the lates version of pcre-ocaml , 
i can not make examples.  
> here is the error code. 
> 
../../lib/libpcre_stubs.a(pcre_stubs.o)(.text+0x1f5): 
In function `pcre_ocaml_init': 
> : undefined reference to `pcre_callout'

solve it. 
 
The solution proposed was to install the latest 
version of PCRE. We've tried 4.3 -latest- version 
and 4.2, but the errors remain the same. 
 
Could anyone help us? 
 
Thank you very much from Boecillo (Spain).
