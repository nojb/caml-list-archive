Really interesting, thanks for this contribution!
I'm working on schema implementation and this library turns out to be
really handy wrt date/time/periods comparison.

I'm interested in releasing a debian package of it, if it's ok for you.

I've also some comments on the library, I will be happy to know your
position on them:

1) why the timezone setting is global? It's really a non functional
   approach and it turns out to be very annoying.
   I would rather prefer to have an optional timezone attached to both
   time and dates. This could be reflected in an optional parameter of
   date/time constructors and in destructors to fetch timezones raising
   exceptions when it's undefined.

2) often user defined pretty printing is needed for time/dates. What
   about adding more pretty printing functions in addition to the
   already provided to_string? Implementing a generic pretty printing
   format which use the "date" unix command format will be fantastic for
   unix gurus. Just to start a generic destructor function will be
   great.

I'm willing to help working on this changes if you like.

Minor observations:

- the library isn't on the humps, am I wrong?

- there's a wonderful typo (look at the day) :-))))

        (* Return [true] if a date is a leap day
         (i.e. February, 24th of a leap year); [false] otherwise. *)
      val is_leap_day : t -> bool

Thanks for the library, this is the tipical piece of code that thousands
of people keep on reinventing!

Cheers.

P.S. what about ocamldefun? :-)
