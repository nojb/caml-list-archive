Hello,

I am currently involved in a project to re-build a compiler for an old
system from the mid-1980's, where we have the original compiler docs, we
have the original source files in the language used, but the actual
compiler itself is lost.  This is an interesting pursuit, and I am
making use of it to learn ocaml.

However, due to the nature of this language, which is not very regular
at all, I am having trouble expressing a parser in ocamlyacc that isn't
a large hack.  What would be ideal would be to have one main parser, and
then one sub-parser that I could call only for a specified domain.
However, all the source code is in one place.

Is there a way to specify a separate parser and lexer (using ocamllex
and ocamlyacc), and then to jump into them from an ocamlyacc action?

Thanks for the help,
John
