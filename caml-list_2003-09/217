Java and Windows and Solaris all jumped the gun and 
use 16 bit (UCS-2/UTF-16) encoding. That encoding should not
be supported in any new system, except for a 
codec UTF-16 <--> UCS-4 to allow UTF-16 strings to be
converted for use with UCS-4 facilities (and the results
converted back).

Agree. Too many LGPL contributions, which I can't
use in my open source project because it has a 
public domain licence -- I *desire* to encourage
commercial use of my code: the more users the better.
