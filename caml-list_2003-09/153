The reason is: Ocaml comments are designed to be able to
comment out code.

If you consider the code:

	" (* " ^ x

and comment out the first part like this:

	(* " (* " ^ *) x

it wouldn't work unless the (* in the string was detected
as being inside a string and ignored. The contents of
comments are not ignored, in the sense that every lexer
even C's, has to find the comment terminator.

Bash and C++ comments:

	# ....
	// ....

do not have this problem, since they're terminated
by end of line.

Also: Ocaml, wrongly I think, allows strings to
span lines. 

Hmm .. Felix doesn't do the string detection .. which
means its nestable /* .. */ comments wont
wrap code containing strings containing /* or */ .. 
Hmmmm .. thanks for raising this issue  ..
