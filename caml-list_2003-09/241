Except it's a third party product with a restrictive LGPL
licence which makes it useless to me :(

I can use an LGPL library only if it is part of the standard
distribution, otherwise I have to be able to make
it part of my own source tree (I will not require end 
users to download X packages from all over the place
that don't come with any kind of support assurance) 
-- and I happen to provide a FFAU (free for any use) licence,
which excludes including said sources in my source tree.
Sane for PCRE: it might as well not exist.

So I agree with Mattias: it's needed in the standard
distribution since they're no FFAU alternative.

I also think, quite separately, that the Ocaml compiler
itself ought to be upgraded to modern i18n concepts.
Some pain there (since Latin-1 is supported, but that
code set is unsuitable).
