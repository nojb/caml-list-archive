What do you mean by ``not type safe at all'' ?

The common acceptation is ``it could lead to type errors at runtime''.
If you ever exhibit such a problem with format strings, please show us
a complete example, since you indeed discovered an unpleasant bug in
the compiler :(

Remember that our claim for the printf/scanf and format strings
implementation is the same as for the rest of the language: programs
are safe and can never go wrong (i.e. they never produce bus errors or
jeopardize type safety).

(To be precise, this claim evidently does not apply to programs that
could use faulty interfaces with foreign languages, functions from the
Obj module, uncautious input_value/output_value calls, or are compiled
with the -unsafe option.)
