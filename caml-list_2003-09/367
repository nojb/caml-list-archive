That is the problem with commercial distributions, and the people doing
commercial distributions of stuff should be prepared to pay the price of
it (that is recompiling when there is a new ocaml release). Doing otherwise
would be unhonest to your customers, but then this has not stopped
people from doing so over the past, altough with the advent of open
source, i guess that less and less customer will be willing to purchase
software in these conditions.
