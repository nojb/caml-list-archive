This approach implicitely assume that most of the time you're dealing
with dates/times which are relativa to a common timezone and that
sparingly you have to convert from a timezone to another. What if most
of the time you're dealing with non-homogeneous timezone date/times?
Many applications have such a requirement.

If you want to keep it imperative at least a functor that permits to
preserve different timezone states would be great. It's still worst than
timezone associated to date/times IMHO.
