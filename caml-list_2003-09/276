Really?  An author may not *voluntarily* release his or her own work into
the public domain?  I don't see how that may be so.  It is certainly not
true under US copyright law, nor is it the doctrine of the Berne
Convention.  I was under the impression that possession of the copyright
to a particular work implies you also have the full and unlimited power
to license your work as you see fit.
