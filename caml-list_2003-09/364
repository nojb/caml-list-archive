Hi list,

only one day after the 3.07 release there is an updated GODI
distribution. GODI is a source-based ocaml distribution, available from

http://www.ocaml-programming.de/godi/

GODI installs a fresh O'Caml 3.07 system along with a number of
packages, and allows easy maintainance of the installation.

GODI has been tested on Linux (several flavours), FreeBSD 4.8, Solaris
8. It probably runs on more operating systems, but not on Windows (the
Cygwin port has made some progress but is not yet done). There is still
a problem for FreeBSD concerning threads, so it might be a good idea to
wait until I have found the problem (any help appreciated).

-- How to install GODI: --

Download the bootstrap tarball from
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/godi-bootstrap-20030929.tar.gz
and follow the instruction in the README file.

If you have already a GODI installation for 3.07beta2, you can upgrade
it to 3.07 provided it is not too old. If your bootstrap tarball was
from September, it will definitely work. To do the upgrade, edit
godi.conf, and set GODI_SECTION=3.07. Start godi_console, download the
new build archives (menu 1), and select all packages for build (menu 2,
key 'u' = upgrade). Start the build, and after a while your whole system
is upgraded. (Cool, isn't it.)

-- Packages available for GODI: --

cryptgps, equeue, findlib, lablgl, lablgtk, netclient, ocamlnet, pcre,
pxp, rpc, shell, wlex, xstr, xstrp4

-- Plan: --

Currently, I am working on an improved version of godi_console that will
be able to handle more than just a dozend packages. There is very little
time for me to create new packages, so I would appreciate any help
getting more libraries packaged.
