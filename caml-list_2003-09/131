You are right that Glut.mainLoop makes vmthreads useless, but this doesn't
imply that vmthreads are of no use for Glsurf (see below).

Another way to look at it is that it limits the use of GLUT, which ought
to have an open event loop as in SDL and OCaml's Graphics library.  Using 
OCamlSDL would probably make it possible to use vmthreads, though I
haven't tried it myself.

Have you tried recompiling your Linux kernel?  Which distribution are you
running?
