I would not conclude that from this stack trace. libc_r is a user-level
multi-threading emulation, and many system calls (such as "poll" here)
are redefined to get the effect of the emulation. Maybe the code crashes
in __sys_poll because kcontrol called "poll" with an invalid pointer; a
userland threading library cannot check whether addresses are valid like
the kernel does for real system calls.

Concerning the stability of libc_r I found the bug that the signal mask
is not restored after the signal routine has finished execution. For
most multi-threaded applications this is not a big problem: They usually
do not define signal handlers at all, because this has the disadavantage
that it is undefined in which thread the signal handler runs. Instead,
there is often a separate thread that watches for signals (sigsuspend).
However, O'Caml relies on correct signal semantics, especially for
multi-threaded applications, because it uses an alarm timer to implement
its own time-sharing policy. Consider O'Caml as a "stress test" for the
multi-threading implementation.
