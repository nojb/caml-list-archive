Obviously under no circumstances, but I've had it happen a few times.

If it's a native code version, try running it under gdb and look at
the stack trace. You can usually work out from the name which module
was being compiled. It'll be something like Module__entry for the
toplevel code, or Module__function_123 for 'function' in the module.

(You might need to supply the -g option to gcc, ie. ocamlopt -ccopt -g)
