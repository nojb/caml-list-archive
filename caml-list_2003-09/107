I find that I am often writing code like
    { field1 = field1; field2 = field2; field3 = field3 }
when matching and constructing records.  I guess it's because thinking
up good names for the record fields is nontrivial and having similar
but different names for the bindings just bothers me.

How about allowing syntax like that used for labels:
    { ~field1; ~field2; ~field3 }
would expand into the above, in both pattern matching and construction
contexts.

This is orthogonal to (and I think much simpler than) omitting some
fields via "..." notation.
