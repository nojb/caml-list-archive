I just use htmlc, which is simple and efficient:

  http://pauillac.inria.fr/htmlc/

It uses $identifiers as you suggested, + some Server Side Includes
expansions, + local environment definition facilities, + what you
would like to add to it in the future :)

Here is a brief excerpt of the Changes file:

1.20 (Documents environment variables expansion)
----
 - Inside documents variables of the form $X, $(X), or ${X} are
   considered to be bound in the Htmlc's global environment hash table
   and expanded as their corresponding string associated value.
 - New -e argument to load environment files that set up Htmlc's
   global environment table. Environment files are list of lines
   that contain a variable name and an associated string (following
   Caml' lexical conventions).
 - New server side directive: the line
   <!--#include environment="filename"-->
   in a document loads environment file ``filename'' and enriches the
   global environment accordingly.
 - New -s compilation flag to expand .shtml files into .html files.

1.10 (User's environment variables expansion)
----
 - Throughout documents passed to htmlc, tags of the form <$X>
   are considered to reference the variable X in the user's
   gloabal environment: <$HOME> is thus replaced by the string
   representation of the user's HOME directory.
   (This expansion mechanism is disabled when including verbatim
   files).

Hope this helps,
