I don't understand your approach. You don't like a licence, you need
something else for a given project. Why don't you ask to library author
for a specific authorization, explaining your arguments and motivations,
instead of discarding the possiblility of using the library?

As the author of LPGL'd OCaml libraries, I wouln't object giving special
licences for open source or commercial projects, if I agree with their own
licensing conditions. The licence is not attached to the software, but to
a given distribution; it is always possible to provide (give/sell)
different licences for different users.
