Hello,

I think you should take a look at ensemble. It seems to be a great tool
to do what you are describing.

Another option, but i don't know it very well, is to have a look to
ocaml-soap, xml-rpc et al. I think it should also work.

All this link are in the humps.

Regard
Sylvain LE GALL

ps : take a look at mldonkey for a p2p application in ocaml. 
pps : i will be very intersted in the result
