The main problem will be to 'translate' code structure from SMLNJ module 
system to Ocaml'
modules and classes. The library as You can see is written in OO-style 
but whithout classes
(due to the absense of classes in SML :)) ).  So the main problem  is 
usual -- code stucture
and the general design.  The rest -- is mechanical coding:)

Somewere in documentation for SMLNJ(if my mind does non fail me) I have 
founded the
description of the differences between SML and OCaml.The most of them 
are concerning
the syntax.
