So we need some kind of WYSIWYG editors.
Imagine your source code contains "special regions", that you can edit
using a custom WYSIaWYG editor (what you see is almost what you get),
called from your favorite text editor.
Maybe it would be enough to specify line-breaking keywords and tabulation
marks to generate a minimalist WYSIaWYG editor.

(*BEGIN { tabs = [Before "<td>"; Before "<th>"; Before "</tr>"];
          newlines = [After "<br>"; After "</tr>"] } *)
<table>
 <tr><th>$header_number_1</th><th>$short</th></tr>
 <tr><td>$x</td><td>$y</td></tr>
</table>
(*END *)

would be displayed as:

 <table>
  <tr><th>$header_number_1</th><th>$short</th></tr>
  <tr><td>$x</td>              <td>$y</td>    </tr>
 </table>

(+ syntax highlighting for fake spaces, insertions, keywords, ...)
