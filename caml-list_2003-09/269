Sure. LD_LIBRARY_PATH is meant to override the runtime library search
path that is included in the executable (via -rpath or via
LD_RUN_PATH).

I think you've got it backwards : what you see is LD_LIBRARY_PATH
doing what it is meant to do, that is overriding '-rpath' options.

[I don't know about SunOS actually but that's the behaviour on GNU
systems].
