We're using Gtk (lablgtk2) to write a medium-sized simulation
application that works across Windows and Linux. We're using the
Gtk-Wimp theme on Windows which gives Gtk a reasonable Windows look
and feel. It's not perfect, but not bad.

Gtk is a very rich and powerful widget set, and we've written custom
widgets (graphs, flow diagrams, dialogs, etc.), all in straight OCaml.

Lablgtk is (to be honest) a bit odd, but once you get used to it,
there'll be almost nothing you can't do that you couldn't do with any
other language or widget set. Most things work identically on Windows
and Unix, so much so that I don't spend much time testing on each
platform separately. There are a few annoying differences in fonts
which I had to wrap into a little library.

We're using OCam'OLE (on Windows) to communicate with Excel -- load
files, run macros, that sort of thing.

We're using NullSoft's NSIS to generate the installer (on Windows).

Emacs! You need something else??

Rich.

PS. The lablgtk mailing list is down now?
