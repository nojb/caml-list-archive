judging by the interface and docs, it looks pretty nice.
i would be glad to have this in caml.

i still would like to browse the code before deciding, but i am quite 
tempted to take this on as a little project.

does anyone have experience porting sml code to caml? i would expect 
everything is fairly mechanic, or can there be differences which require 
non-trivial effort to resolve?

thanks
