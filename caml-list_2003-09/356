I've done considerable programming both in languages that have
printf-style formatting (checked and unchecked), as well as languages
that require operators or such to build up formatting.  Any time I've
wanted to output something, I have one of two responses, depending on
the language:

  - Grumble, grumble, grumble.
  - Just write it.

You can probably guess which is which.  That ocaml has been able to
integrate printf formatting in a type-safe way is truly amazing, and to
me one of the things that makes ocaml a wonderful language.

True, it isn't universally extensibly, but it is a lot more so than most
people think.
