Sorry to those who have seen this, already, I asked on the beginners list with no reply.

How can I use the ocaml debugger to debug a program that uses ncurses?
I can't run the program from inside the debugger as the mixture of
ncurses output from my program, and the non-ncurses output from the
debugger produces garbage.

The manual seems to hint that I can run the program, and then run the
debugger externally (on a different virtual terminal), and then connect
the debugger to the program.  The key to this is passing the -D <socket>
parameter to ocamlrun, as mentioned in section 16.8.6 of the manual.
Except that ocamlrun does not recognise the -D parameter.  :(

Thanks in advance,
Jim
