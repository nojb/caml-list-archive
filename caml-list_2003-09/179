I have seen the very powerfull graph library in MLRISC package which is
included to New Jersey SML distribution (SMLNJ). MLRISC is a big and 
quite universal set of libraries for building SML compilers for RISC
architectures.

For the first look, the graph library is quite usefull and
clear('understandable' :)),
but it is written in SML. It is not very hard to rewrite it in OCaml
language.
If this project will start, You may consider me as a participant. But I
have not much
time for such work(for me this work will be the 'fun-project').
Let You look at MLRISC graph library and give Your opinion about the
library
and about the possibility of using it in Your tasks :)

The second variant. You may search caml-list for 'graph'. Some times ago
it was
small discussion there about exactly the same problem. You may find some
links to less powerfull and universal graph libraries but written in
ocaml.

Regards!
