ok for me.

Yes, it is an imperative approach. I think you mostly set the time zone
once at the beginning of your program: you don't change the time zone
while you're computing some values. Sometimes, you may want to convert a
time from a time zone to another one and I produce some converters to do
that. So, my philosophy is:
(1) set the time zone globaly: easier use of times and dates
(an optional parameter is ok... if the default value is as you wish ;).
(2) change the time zone localy if you need (use the converters).

Yes, great idea. It is now in my TODO list :).

You're right (but not my responsibility).

Not a typo !!! :o))) And the implementation of [is_leap_day] follows this
specification.

The justification comes from the calendar FAQ
(http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html):

==================================
2.3. What day is the leap day?
------------------------------

It is 24 February!

Weird? Yes! The explanation is related to the Roman calendar and is
found in section 2.7.1.

>From a numerical point of view, of course 29 February is the extra
day. But from the point of view of celebration of feast days, the
following correspondence between days in leap years and non-leap
years has traditionally been used:

        Non-leap year           Leap year
        -------------           ----------
        22 February             22 February
        23 February             23 February
                                24 February (extra day)
        24 February             25 February
        25 February             26 February
        26 February             27 February
        27 February             28 February
        28 February             29 February

For example, the feast of St. Leander has been celebrated on 27
February in non-leap years and on 28 February in leap years.
