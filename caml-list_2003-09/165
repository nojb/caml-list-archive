I'm currently writing an i18n library for OCaml (locales, timezones, dates, 
numbers etc...). It is in early stages of development but date calculations 
are at the top of my TODO list (i'm actually testing week of month, day of 
week (...) inference). Maybe you should look at it ? I'm particularly 
interseted in getting comments and advices from experienced caml developers 
about this code.
