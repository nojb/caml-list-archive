well, I was not aware that compilation of polymorphic variants is an area
of ongoing research. In the OCaml manual, they are not mentioned under
"Language extensions" but as a section in the chapter "An introduction to
Objective Caml". There is a statement

    "In programs, polymorphic variants work like usual ones. You just
    have to prefix their names with a backquote character `."

and this is not true, at least in 3.06. After spending another evening
with weird type errors, I replaced polymorphic variants with ordinary
ones. My project looks uglier now since I had to split up some files,
but at least it compiles and runs.
