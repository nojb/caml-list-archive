I might be biased, but

>   Q1. How advanced might be the GUI in OCaml applications?

As advanced as you wish.
GUI is a lot of dirty work to get ill-conceived toolkits to do what
you really want...

GTK+ (both 1 and 2), and Tcl/Tk.
Tcl/Tk is included in the distribution.

I suppose you mean GUI-builders?
You can use glade in combination with LablGTK, and there are also a
few other options (all for LablGTK).
However, you must realize that Caml programming being much
higher-level in flavour compared to C, once you have a reasonnable
level of proficiency with the toolkit, you work faster by writing the
GUI code yourself.
You can have a look at the following link for LablGTK related  software
  http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html

>   Q4. And what are the near plans concerning the issues above?

Hopefully LablGTK2 should become the main platform.
My only concern is that there is no good native Gtk for MacOSX yet.
(This just means that you have to install Apple's X11 first)

Cheers,
