The instrumentation code it adds (to every function, even small ones, although that could be changed relatively easily by adding some kind of function-length metric, maybe what the inliner uses) will take some time, but in the brief test I did it didn't make much difference in my game, which was a pleasant surprise (even when it was added to tiny things like a 2D vector addition that's used everywhere).  Maybe inlining happens before cmmgen or something, I don't know.

That would be easy, since the printout is in C and just fprintfs to stderr.  I should also add a caml interface to it in Sys or something, that just returns the data, so you can put a try ... with _ -> Sys.get_debug_native_backtrace () around your whole program (or in an atexit) and do whatever you want with it.

A couple others have asked for it, so I'll clean it up and post it on my website.  I'll send mail to the list when I do that.

Ah, I probably should have searched, but it sounds like yours is not available anymore, and it's also part of something bigger?  Did you instrument in cmmgen.ml as well, or do it differently?
