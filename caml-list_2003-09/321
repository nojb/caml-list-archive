I just used HereDoc to create a set of web pages, and found it pleasant 
to work in.

I used his old codebase, instead of the alpha version, since it looks 
like the alpha version hasn't been touched in 2 years.

http://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/frisch/soft.html#HereDoc

He has a syntax like yours:

<< Hello, $firstname $lastname. >>

or

<< I am $$ string_of_int age $$ years old >>

He doesn't appear to have any syntactic sugar for conversions.  Which 
wasn't a problem.

He has constructs for creating loops, and the ability to include 
templates from other files.

He's also abstracted out the printing so that you can tell it where you 
want to send the generated text.
