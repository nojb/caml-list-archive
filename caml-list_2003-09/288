Well there are two issues here: how much portability do _you_ need?
and how portable would bindings to a C library be?

If you specifically need this to work on multiple (Unix + non-Unix)
systems, then using open_process_in/popen wouldn't be the way to
go. However I cannot answer that question, only you can.

Would C bindings to the bind resolver library be any more portable I
wonder? (Actually I don't have the faintest clue whether this library
is available on Windows).

A pure OCaml resolver library would be a massive chunk of work, and
pretty pointless to boot.
