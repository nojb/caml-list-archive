To build the MinGW version of OCaml, you need full Cygwin; the
non-Cygwin MinGW distribution + MSYS tools are not supported.  

Maybe this version of OCaml should have a more descriptive name such
as "compiler runs under Cygwin but produces non-Cygwin, pure Win32
code", but that's quite a mouthful...

More generally speaking, one of the major problems with the Windows
version of OCaml is the huge diversity of development environments
available under Windows.  We go so far as to support 3 Windows
configurations (full Cygwin, Cygwin-MinGW, and MSVC), which is already
stretching things quite far. (By comparison, the Unix sources and
Makefiles support > 10 different flavors of Unix with less
configuration-specific cruft.)  We're sorry, but it's simply not
possible to support more Windows configurations.
