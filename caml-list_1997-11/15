It's my pleasure to announce a new distribution of camltk, the library
interfacing Caml and Tcl/Tk.
With camltk, you can program nice graphical user interfaces in Objective Caml,
portable to any Unix/X-Windows platform as well as to Windows 95/NT.

Currently (as of ocamltk41), the library requires Objective Caml 1.06
(it will not compile with previous versions of Objective Caml), and
Tcl/Tk version 7.5/4.1 or 7.6/4.2.

The source distribution is available at
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/cristal/caml-light/ocamltk41-R106.tar.gz
The binary distributions of Objective Caml 1.06 already include camltk.

Apart from various fixes and internal cleanup, the main novelties in this
version are : support for the native ocamlopt compiler, support for 
Windows 95/NT (very little testing was done, though), crude support for
raw pixmap manipulations.

camltk is written and maintained by:
 Jun Furuse, Francois Pessaux, Francois Rouaix.
The main page for camltk is
<URL:http://pauillac.inria.fr/~rouaix/camltk-readme.html>


Changes since first version of ocamltk41:
 - Updated to O'Caml 1.06 (C interface changes)
 - Added support for ocamlopt
 - Added support for Windows NT (except some accessory parts of ocamltk41)
 - Added support for BLT Drag&Drop
 - Added -o and -I options to tkcompiler
 - Added support for Japanese mode autodetection (jtk)
 - Added support for raw pixmap
 - Bug fixes:
     * focus in Frx_ctext
     * jpf/Balloon fix
     * Text.insert (tag parameter was incorrect)
 - Internal changes
     * removed Hashtblc now that space leaks in Hashtbl have been fixed
     * added display of compactions in Frx_mem
     * access to Tcl variables is now done in C (Tcl_Get/SetVar)
       instead of interpreted Tcl  "set var". It should be possible to 
       compile with Tcl/Tk8.0. Fixed variable traces management (free didn't
       remove traces).
 - Compilation does not need Tk source tree.
