There were two problems with the Unix.ioctl functions:
1- You had to hardwire the ioctl number and couldn't use the symbolic
names provided by the C include files.  This makes code extremely
hard to read and fragile w.r.t. upgrades of the OS.
2- For ioctl_ptr, exploiting the result (which may be a complex
struct) was very incovenient.

For those two reasons, I think it's better to write a C function that
does the ioctl you're interested in, and returns to Caml the results
you're interested in.
