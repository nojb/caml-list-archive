The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see
below at scope).

Please be aware that TFP uses two distinct rounds of submissions (see
below at submission details).

TFP 2019 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming
events. TFP 2019 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take
place on June 11.


== Scope ==

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various 
routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify 
the following five article categories. High-quality articles are 
solicited in any of these categories:

     Research Articles:
         Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
     Position Articles:
         On what new trends should or should not be
     Project Articles:
         Descriptions of recently started new projects
     Evaluation Articles:
         What lessons can be drawn from a finished project
     Overview Articles:
         Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for 
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of 
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or 
experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques 
to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

     Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
     Functional programming in the cloud
     High performance functional computing
     Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
     Dependently typed functional programming
     Validation and verification of functional programs
     Debugging and profiling for functional languages
     Functional programming in different application areas:
     security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
     systems, global computing, grids, etc.
     Interoperability with imperative programming languages
     Novel memory management techniques
     Program analysis and transformation techniques
     Empirical performance studies
     Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
     (Embedded) domain specific languages
     New implementation strategies
     Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of TFP, 
please contact the TFP 2019 program chairs, William J. Bowman and Ron 
Garcia.


== Best Paper Awards ==

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper
accepted for the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, 
acknowledging
that students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A 
student
paper is one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the 
work of
students, the students are listed as first authors, and a student would 
present
the paper. A prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the best
paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive both 
prizes.


== Instructions to Author ==

Papers must be submitted at:

     https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2019

Authors of papers have the choice of having their contributions formally 
reviewed either before or after the Symposium.


== Pre-symposium formal review ==

Papers to be formally reviewed before the symposium should be submitted 
before an early deadline and receive their reviews and notification of 
acceptance for both presentation and publication before the symposium. A 
paper that has been rejected in this process may still be accepted for 
presentation at the symposium, but will not be considered for the 
post-symposium formal review.


== Post-symposium formal review ==

Draft papers will receive minimal reviews and notification of acceptance 
for presentation at the symposium. Authors of draft papers will be 
invited to submit revised papers based on the feedback receive at the 
symposium. A post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset 
of these articles for formal publication.


== Paper categories ==

Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are submitted as 
extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages in length) or full papers (20 pages). 
The submission must clearly indicate which category it belongs to: 
research, position, project, evaluation, or overview paper. It should 
also indicate which authors are research students, and whether the main 
author(s) are students. A draft paper for which all authors are students 
will receive additional feedback by one of the PC members shortly after 
the symposium has taken place.


== Format ==

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For 
more information about formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site.
