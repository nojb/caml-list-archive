*NEW*  - ETAPS 2019 is running a mentoring workshop to encourage
students to pursue graduate studies.

The workshop is held on Sunday April 7 in conjunction with ETAPS
in Prague.

In addition to the workshop on Sunday, attendees are invited to
mentoring breakfasts and evening lectures.

The ETAPS Mentoring Workshop is organised with the intention of
helping students early in a program with advice on research,
career, and (academic) life in the fields of Computing that are
covered by the ETAPS conference. Students will attend lectures
that describe key ideas in the field but also how the researchers
came up with those ideas, what obstacles they had to overcome and
other helpful advice. Students will work together during the
workshop to meet a common goal, and will present their results for
the mentoring researchers and get feedback.

During mentoring breakfasts, students will get to interact
one-on-one with researchers at. Prospective Ph.D. students
(undergraduates and Masters) will be assigned mentors who will
help them navigate the conference.

This is a closed workshop: an application is required to attend.
It is possible to be both a Student Volunteer and an mentoring
workshop attendee.

            *** Application deadline: March 1st. ***

A purpose of the workshop is to promote diversity and increase the
participation of students who are members of underrepresented
groups in graduate studies in the fields of the conferences and
workshops under the ETAPS umbrella. We therefore especially
encourage applications from women, Aboriginal peoples, persons
with disabilities, and other groups underrepresented in computing.
This workshop provides these students with valuable opportunities
for mentorship and networking.

Very limited funding may be available for students who would not
be able to attend otherwise (these funds depend on our ability to
raise industrial sponsorships). Students may also apply to be
Student Volunteer to be able to attend the rest of the conference,
There are also 10 ETAPS Student Scholarships which give 500 Euros
to students coming to Prague.
