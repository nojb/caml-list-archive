The Programming Languages and Systems (PLAS) group at the University of Ken=
t's School of Computing invites applications for 12 fully-funded 3-year PhD=
 scholarships (for UK/EU students).

Applications are due by the 26th April 2019.

The PLAS group is one of the largest programming languages research groups =
in Europe. It is currently ranked 17th worldwide by the independent CSranki=
ngs website: http://csrankings.org/#/index?plan&world.

We provide a supportive environment for research and we have a vibrant post=
graduate population. We encourage our students to engage with the wider res=
earch community through attending conferences and taking internships with l=
eading industrial companies. We are located in Canterbury, a lively and cos=
mopolitan historic town with convenient travel links to London and Europe.

You can apply to study for a PhD in any topic that falls within our range o=
f expertise. We have studentships up to a value of =C2=A319,945 per annum t=
hat are available by competition.

Application process:
Select a potential supervisor (see below) and send them an informal project=
 proposal as well as a brief CV (preferably by the first week of April 2019=
). Staff contact details can be found on their web pages.
Submit your formal applications through the university admission system by =
the 26th April 2019. Your application should include a completed online adm=
ission form; the name and contact details of two referees; an original docu=
ment providing confirmation of your degree (or a transcript if the degree i=
s not yet awarded). For non-native English speakers, a certificate of compe=
tence in English is required at IELTS 6.5 or higher, with no element less t=
han 6.0 (or equivalent).
