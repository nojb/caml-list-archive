Subject: [Caml-list] Call For Presentations: Compose NYC, June 24-25, 2019

The Compose Conference is back in New York City! This is a wonderful
conference focused on strongly typed functional programming. The call for
presentations is now open. See below. Hope to see many OCaml talks again
this year.

In past years, there has also been an unconference over the weekend
adjacent to the conference.  The unconference details this year have not
been finalized yet, but please keep that in mind when making travel plans.


*************************
Compose Conference NYC 2019
Call for Presentations
June 24-25, 2019
New York City
http://www.composeconference.org/2019/cfp

The audience for Compose is people using Haskell, PureScript, OCaml, F#,
SML, and other strongly typed functional programming languages who are
looking to increase their skills or learn new technologies and libraries.
Presentations should be aimed at teaching or introducing new ideas or
tools. We are also interested in presentations aiming at taking complex
concepts, such as program derivation, and putting them into productive use.
However presentations on anything that you suspect our audience may find
interesting are welcome. The following are some of the types of talks we
would welcome:

*Library/Tool Talks* =E2=80=94 Exploring the uses of a powerful toolkit or =
library,
be it for parsing, testing, data access and analysis, or anything else.

*Production Systems* =E2=80=94 Experience reports on deploying functional
techniques in real systems; insights revealed, mistakes made, lessons
learned.

*Theory made Practical* =E2=80=94 Just because it=E2=80=99s locked away in =
papers doesn=E2=80=99t
mean it=E2=80=99s hard! Accessible lectures on classic results and why they=
 matter
to us today. Such talks can include simply introducing the principles of a
field of research so as to help the audience read up on it in the future;
from abstract machines to program derivation to branch-and-bound
algorithms, the sky=E2=80=99s the limit.

Check out the Compose YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=3DPLNoHgLVTxtaoolkQo4hLy4ZsA1prUJ51m>
to see videos of talks we've had previously and get an idea of the kinds of
topics we usually feature.

We also welcome presentations for more formal tutorials. Tutorials should
be aimed at a smaller audience of beginner-to-novice understanding, and
ideally include hands-on exercises.

The due date for submissions is *April 23, 2019*. We will send out notice
of acceptance by *April 30th*. We prefer that submissions be via the
EasyChair website (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcompose2019).
Please suggest a title, and describe the topic you intend to speak on.
Talks can be either 30 or 45 minutes, please indicate how much time you
would prefer to take. You may submit multiple talks if you have several
ideas and are unsure which would be the most likely to be accepted.
Accepted talks will be asked to submit slides for review prior to the
conference.

Feel free to include any additional information on both your expertise and
interesting elements of your topic that would be appropriate for inclusion
in the public abstract. Furthermore, if your abstract doesn't feel
"final"=E2=80=94don't worry! We'll work with you to polish it up. If you wa=
nt to
discuss your presentation(s) before submitting, or to further nail down
what you intend to speak on, please feel free to contact us at
nyc@composeconference.org. We're happy to work with you, even if you are a
new or inexperienced speaker, to help your talk be great.

*Diversity*
We would like to put an emphasis on soliciting a diverse set of speakers -
anything you can do to distribute information about this CFP and encourage
submissions from under-represented groups would be greatly appreciated. We
welcome your contributions and encourage you to apply!
