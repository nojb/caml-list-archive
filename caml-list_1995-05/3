Regarding the announcement of the release of Caml Light 0.7 beta 4

> The Macintosh version has not been recompiled yet.

I don't know how easy it would be to do this but as a Mac user of
Caml Light I find it very inconvenient to keep switching between 
the Caml application and my editor. Would it be possible
to make Caml Light scriptable by AppleScript, and to maybe log its top-level
output to a file for easy error location? The simplest interface to Caml Light
would just be a script command which accepts a string and treats it as if it
were top level input. Even better, the command could return the 
top-level output as a string to the calling application.

Just a thought,

Claudio
