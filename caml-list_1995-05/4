Probably an even better way would be to have input and output to Caml via
apple events, so that you could run it using Alpha as a shell. You would
then have all the facilities of Alpha, and input and output to Caml would
appear in Alpha windows. I've just been working with Tom Kiffe on doing
this with CMacTeX, and it's really quite easy; if anyone wants more
details, I can send them.
