Release 0.7 beta 4 of the Caml Light system is now available by
anonymous FTP from the usual place:

        host:      ftp.inria.fr
        directory: lang/caml-light/Release7beta

Both the Unix version (cl7beta4unix.tar.gz) and the PC 386 version
(cl7beta4pcbin.tar.gz and cl7beta4pcsrc.tar.gz) are available.
The Macintosh version has not been recompiled yet.

This release fixes (hopefully) all the bugs reported for release 0.7
beta 2. No major new feature has been added, except in the
CamlTk-based interface browser, which has been considerably enhanced.

As usual, bug reports should be addressed to caml-light@pauillac.inria.fr.

Thank you for your attention,

- Xavier Leroy
