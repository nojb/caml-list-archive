===============================================================
APLAS 2014
  12th Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
  http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/APLAS2014/

  17-19 November 2014, Singapore

CALL FOR PAPERS
 Abstracts due June 2 (full paper by June 8)
===============================================================

INVITED SPEAKERS
================

Zhenjiang Hu	 (NII, Japan)
Dexter Kozen	 (Cornell University, USA)
Julien Verlaguet (Facebook, USA)

==========
BACKGROUND
==========

APLAS aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas
in programming languages and systems.  APLAS is based in Asia, but is
an international forum that serves the worldwide programming language
community.

APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software
(AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers
from Europe and the USA.  Past APLAS symposiums were successfully held
in Melbourne ('13), Kyoto ('12), Kenting ('11), Shanghai ('10), Seoul
('09), Bangalore ('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05),
Taipei ('04) and Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops.
Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in Springer's LNCS.

======
TOPICS
======

The symposium is devoted to foundational and practical issues in
programming languages and systems.  Papers are solicited on topics such
as
* semantics, logics, foundational theory;
* design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi;
* domain-specific languages;
* compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
* program derivation, synthesis and transformation;
* program analysis, verification, model-checking;
* logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming;
* software security;
* concurrency and parallelism;
* tools and environments for programming and implementation.

Topics are not limited to those discussed in previous symposiums.
Papers identifying future directions of programming and those
addressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms
are especially welcome.  Demonstration of systems and tools in the
scope of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool presentations
category.  Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic
are welcome to consult with the program chair prior to submission.

==========
SUBMISSION
==========

We solicit submissions in two categories:

*Regular research papers* describing original scientific research
results, including tool development and case studies.  Regular
research papers should not exceed 18 pages in the Springer LNCS
format, including bibliography and figures.  They should clearly
identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant.
Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance,
correctness, originality, and clarity.  In case of lack of space,
proofs, experimental results, or any information supporting the
technical results of the paper could be provided as an appendix or a
link to a web page, but reviewers are not obliged to read them.

*System and Tool presentations* describing systems or tools that support
theory, program construction, reasoning, or program execution in the
scope of APLAS.  System and Tool presentations are expected to be
centered around a demonstration.  The paper and the demonstration
should identify the novelties of the tools and use motivating
examples.  System and Tool papers should not exceed 8 pages in the
Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and figures.  Submissions
will be judged based on both the papers and the described systems or
tools.  It is highly desirable that the tools are available on the
web.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2014

Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF.  Submitted papers must be
unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.  Papers must
be written in English.  The proceedings will be published as a volume
in Springer's LNCS series.  Accepted papers must be presented at the
conference.
