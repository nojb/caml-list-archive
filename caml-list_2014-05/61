****************************************************************************
**************
3rd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF NATURAL COMPUTING

TPNC 2014

Granada, Spain

December 9-11, 2014

Organized by:

Soft Computing and Intelligent Information Systems (SCI2S)
University of Granada

Research Group on Mathematical Linguistics (GRLMC)
Rovira i Virgili University

****************************************************************************
**************

AIMS:

TPNC is a conference series intending to cover the wide spectrum of
computational principles, models and techniques inspired by information
processing in nature. TPNC 2014 will reserve significant room for young
scholars at the beginning of their career. It aims at attracting
contributions to nature-inspired models of computation, synthesizing nature
by means of computation, nature-inspired materials, and information
processing in nature.

VENUE:

TPNC 2014 will take place in Granada, in the region of Andaluc=EDa, to the
south of Spain. The city is the seat of a rich Islamic historical legacy,
including the Moorish citadel and palace called Alhambra.

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical, experimental, or applied interest include, but
are not limited to:

* Nature-inspired models of computation:

- amorphous computing
- cellular automata=20
- chaos and dynamical systems based computing
- evolutionary computing
- membrane computing
- neural computing
- optical computing=20=20
- swarm intelligence=20

* Synthesizing nature by means of computation:

- artificial chemistry
- artificial immune systems
- artificial life

* Nature-inspired materials:

- computing with DNA
- nanocomputing
- physarum computing
- quantum computing and quantum information
- reaction-diffusion computing

* Information processing in nature:

- developmental systems=20
- fractal geometry
- gene assembly in unicellular organisms
- rough/fuzzy computing in nature
- synthetic biology
- systems biology

* Applications of natural computing to: algorithms, bioinformatics, control,
cryptography, design, economics, graphics, hardware, learning, logistics,
optimization, pattern recognition, programming, robotics, telecommunications
etc.

A flexible "theory to/from practice" approach would be the perfect focus for
the expected contributions.

STRUCTURE:

TPNC 2014 will consist of:

- invited talks
- peer-reviewed contributions

Kalyanmoy Deb (East Lansing, US), Multi-Criterion Problem Solving: A Niche
