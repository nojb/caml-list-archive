[FINAL CALL FOR PARTICIPATION]

3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in 
Education (TFPIE 2014)
May 25, 2014
Utrecht University
Soesterberg, The Netherlands
(http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/)


The 3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in 
Education, TFPIE 2014, will be co-located with the Symposium on Trends 
in Functional Programming (TFP 2014) at Soesterberg, at the “Kontakt der 
Kontinenten” hotel in the Netherlands on Sunday, May 25th. TFP will 
follow from May 26-28.


The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals 
that use, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in 
education. TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested 
ideas and work-in-progress on the use of functional programming in 
education are discussed. The one-day workshop will foster a spirit of 
open discussion by having a review process for publication after the 
workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2014 will screen submissions to 
ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of interest to 
participants. Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended 
abstract (4-6 pages) or a draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. 
The authors of accepted presentations will have their preprints and 
their slides made available on the workshop's website/wiki. Visitors to 
the TFPIE 2014 website/wiki will be able to add comments. This includes 
presenters who may respond to comments and questions as well as provide 
pointers to improvements and follow-up work. After the workshop, 
presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version of) their 
article for review. The PC will select the best articles for publication 
in the journal Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science 
(EPTCS). Articles not selected for presentation and extended abstracts 
will not be formally reviewed by the PC.

TFPIE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012) 
and in Provo Utah, USA (2013).
