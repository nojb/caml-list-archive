VeriSure 2014: CAV Workshop on Verification and Assurance
               23 July 2014 in Vienna, Austria

               http://fm.csl.sri.com/VeriSure2014/

             Call for Papers/Proposals/Participation

VeriSure is a workshop whose goal is a productive dialog between those
who develop and use computer-aided verification tools and methods, and
those with responsibility for system assurance, acceptance, and
certification.

We solicit position papers, experience reports, and research papers on
relevant topics, which include but are not restricted to the following.

* Quantitative and qualitative assurance claims and arguments
* Verification and proof in relation to argumentation and defeasibility
* Integration of formal verification with assurance cases
* Modular and incremental methods of verification and assurance
* Toolchains for integrated assurance arguments
* Soundness guarantees for tools, toolchains, and workflows
* Certification and regulatory requirements and standards
* Experience reports and challenges

We are looking for interesting experience, work, and ideas (possibly
preliminary and exploratory) that will stimulate discussion and thought.


The workshop will be held as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic
http://vsl2014.at/, under the auspices of CAV, the 26th International
Conference on Computer Aided Verification http://cavconference.org/

This will be the second VeriSure workshop; the first was held in
conjunction with CAV 2013 in St Petersburg, Russia.  You can see the
program at http://fm.csl.sri.com/VeriSure2013/
