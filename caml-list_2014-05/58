6th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Resilient Systems
	  October 15-16, 2014, Budapest, Hungary
	      http://serene.disim.univaq.it/


***** Important dates *****

- Submission due: June 2, 2014
- Notification: July 8, 2014
- Camera ready papers: July 22, 2014
- Autumn school: October 13-14, 2014
- Workshop: October 15-16, 2014


***** Workshop topics *****

Unprecedented level of complexity of modern software and software-based sys=
tems=20
makes it difficult to ensure their resilience - an ability of the system to=
 persistently=20
deliver its services in a dependable way even when facing changes, unforese=
en=20
failures and intrusions. Yet we are observing the increasingly pervasive us=
e of=20
software in evolvable and critical systems like transportation, health care=
,=20
manufacturing, and IT infrastructures. This trend urges the research commun=
ity=20
to develop powerful methods for assuring resilience of software-intensive s=
ystems.

These challenges has also appeared in the scope of the current Horizon 2020=
 calls=20
that aim at developing tools and methods for incorporating resilience into =
evolving=20
software systems; and also in calls related to specific application areas l=
ike=20
advanced cloud infrastructures and services, smart objects, and robotics.

The SERENE 2014 workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners=
=20
to exchange ideas on advances in all areas relevant to software engineering=
 for=20
resilient systems, including, but not limited to:

Design of resilient systems:
- Requirements engineering & re-engineering for resilience;
- Frameworks, patterns and software architectures for resilience;
- Engineering of self-healing autonomic systems;
- Design of trustworthy and intrusion-safe systems;
- Resilience at run-time (mechanisms, reasoning and adaptation).

Verification, validation and evaluation of resilience:
- Modelling and model based analysis of resilience properties;
- Formal and semi-formal techniques for verification and validation;
- Experimental evaluations of resilient systems;
- Quantitative approaches to ensuring resilience;
- Resilience prediction.

Case studies & applications:
- Empirical studies in the domain of resilient systems;
- Cloud computing and resilient service provisioning;
- Resilient cyber-physical systems and infrastructures;
- Global aspects of resilience engineering: education, training and coopera=
tion.


***** Contributions *****

We welcome relevant contributions in the following forms:

- Technical papers describing original theoretical or practical work;

- Experience/Industry papers describing practitioner experience or field st=
udy,=20
addressing an application domain and the lessons learned;

- PhD Forum papers describing objectives, methodology, and results at=20
an early stage in research;

- Project papers describing goals and results of ongoing projects;

- Tool papers presenting new tools or new versions of existing tools that=20
support the development of resilient systems.


***** Submission *****

Papers can be submitted via EasyChair:
	https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dserene2014

Each paper must be submitted in PDF and

- be formatted according to the Springer LNCS Guidelines: http://www.spring=
er.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0

- be no longer than 15 pages for technical and experience/industry papers, =
and 8 pages for all others.

Submitted papers must describe novel work and not be published elsewhere.
 All papers will be peer-reviewed and assessed for relevance to the worksho=
p topics,=20
technical soundness, innovation, scientific and presentation quality. Accep=
ted papers
 must be presented by (one of) the author(s). The Proceedings of SERENE 201=
4 will=20
be published as a volume in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (pen=
ding approval).
