5th International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal
Verification
September 10 - 12, 2014,
Verona, Italy

http://gandalf2014.di.univr.it

           ************************************************
           |                 EXTENDED DEADLINES                     |
           ************************************************


*AIM
The aim of the symposium is to bring together researchers from academia 
and industry which are actively working in the fields of Games, 
Automata, Logics, and Formal Verification. The idea is to cover an ample 
spectrum of themes, ranging from theory to applications, and stimulate 
cross-fertilization. Papers focused on formal methods are especially 
welcome. Authors are invited to submit original research or tool papers 
on all relevant topics in these areas. Papers discussing new ideas that 
are at an early stage of development are also welcome.

The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to:
- Automata Theory
- Automated Deduction
- Computational aspects of Game Theory
- Concurrency and Distributed computation
- Decision Procedures
- Deductive, Compositional, and Abstraction Techniques for Verification
- Finite Model Theory
- First-order and Higher-order Logics
- Formal Languages
- Formal Methods for Systems Biology, Hybrid, Embedded, and Mobile Systems
- Games and Automata for Verification
- Game Semantics
- Logical aspects of Computational Complexity
- Logics of Programs
- Modal and Temporal Logics
- Model Checking
- Models of Reactive and Real-Time Systems
- Program Analysis and Software Verification
- Run-time Verification and Testing
- Specification and Verification of Finite and Infinite-state Systems
- Synthesis

- Phokion G. Kolaitis - http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kolaitis/
- Alessio R. Lomuscio - http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~alessio/
- Joel Ouaknine - http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/joel.ouaknine/home.html


*IMPORTANT DATES
- May 27th   Abstract submission (extended)
- June 1st   Paper submission    (extended)
- July 3rd   Notification     (extended)
- July 25th  Camera-ready submission

*PUBLICATIONS
The conference proceedings will be published by Electronic Proceedings 
in Theoretical Computer Science. A special issue of a major 
international journal to publish an extended and revised version of the 
best symposium papers is also under consideration. Revised versions of 
the selected papers from the previous editions lead to one special issue 
of the International Journal of Foundation of Computer Science (GandALF 
2010), two special issues of Theoretical Computer Science (GandALF 2011 
and 2012), and one special issue of Information and Computation (GandALF 
2013).

*SUBMISSIONS
Submitted papers should not exceed fourteen (14) pages using EPTCS 
format, be unpublished and contain original research. For papers 
reporting experimental results, authors are encouraged to make their 
data available with their submission. Submissions must be in PDF or PS 
format and will be handled via EasyChair 
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gandalf2014).
