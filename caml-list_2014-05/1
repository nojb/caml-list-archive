                                CALL FOR PAPERS

4th INT. WORKSHOP ON ADAPTIVE SERVICES FOR THE FUTURE INTERNET


                                  WAS4FI 2014

            Held in conjunction with ESOCC 2014
             September 2, 2014, Manchester, UK
                           http://was4fi.lcc.uma.es

                     Paper Submission Due: May 30th, 2014

GOALS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Future Internet has emerged as a new initiative to pave a novel
infrastructure linked to objects (things) of the real world to meet the
changing global needs of business and society. It offers internet users a
standardized, secure, efficient and trustable environment, which allows
open and distributed access to global networks, services and information.

To be consistently adopted, the Future Internet will be enabled through
standards-based notations for messaging, semantics, process and state (such
as those RDF, OWL, SOAP, REST and WS-BPEL), enabling distributed systems
and entities to be described in a scalable and flexible robust dynamic
environment. Multi-tenancy will enable their remote access as Software as a
Service (SaaS), by performing the integration into larger networks of
communicating software (e.g., a mashup or a plug-in to a Cloud platform).
Future Internet applications will have to support the interoperability
between many diverse stakeholders by governing the convergence and
life-cycle of Internet of Contents (IoC), Services (IoS), Things (IoT), and
Networks (IoN). These applications should handle dynamic and continuous
change: for example, in the provisioning of services, availability of
things and contents, connectivity of networks, diversity of user devices
etc. They should also bear in mind that the Future Internet should provide
a better experience for the user journey, with personalized and
context-aware contents, adapted to their preferences, and where users also
play an active part in creating or sharing services.

There is a need for both researchers and practitioners to develop platforms
made up of adaptive Future Internet applications. In this sense, the
emergence and consolidation of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA), Cloud
Computing and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) give benefits, such as
flexibility, scalability, security, interoperability, and adaptability, for
building these applications. Although there already are emerging solutions
to host software services and data on remote computers and create public
sensor networks by using these technologies; the mentioned solutions employ
simple technical approaches related to replication strategies to ensure
availability and to achieve a load-balancing scalability. Future Internet
systems, however, will also need to sense and respond to a huge amount of
signals sourced from different entities in real-time. In this context, an
event would be detected if, for example, there is non-existence of a signal
which normally occurs, affecting the execution of other services. These
events would be produced by IoT and processed in the IoS. In order to build
business level events Complex Event Processing (CEP) may be used. CEP
allows detecting complex and meaningful events and inferring valuable
knowledge for end users. The main advantage of using CEP to process complex
events is that the latter can be identified and reported in real time,
reducing the latency in decision making, unlike the methods used in
traditional software for event analysis. Event-Driven Service-Oriented
Architectures (ED-SOA or SOA 2.0) are also being used to respond to events
that occur as a result of business processes.

The first edition of WAS4FI was held in conjunction with ServiceWave 2011,
in Poznan, Poland, on October 28th 2011. The second edition was held in
conjunction with ESOCC 2012, in Bertinoro, Italy, on September 19th 2012.
The third edition was also held in conjunction with ESOCC 2013, in M=C3=A1l=
aga,
Spain, on September 11th 2013. In this fourth edition, WAS4FI again aims to
bring together the community at ESOCC and addresses different aspects of
adaptive Future Internet applications, emphasizing the importance of
governing the convergence of contents, services, things and networks in
order to achieve building platforms for efficiency, scalability, security
and flexible adaptation. In this workshop, we cover the foundations of the
aforementioned technologies as well as new emerging proposals for their
potential in Future Internet services. To promote collaboration, WAS4FI has
a highly interactive format with short technical sessions complemented by
discussions on Adaptive Services in the Future Internet Applications.

TOPICS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

WAS4FI encourages a multidisciplinary perspective and welcomes papers that
address challenges of Future Internet applications. Participation of
researchers and practitioners from academia and industry are encouraged in

not limited to:

- Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA)
- Cloud Computing Environments (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS)

- Model-Driven SOA and Service Systems Deployment
- Sensor Web Enablement and Web-Connected Devices (Sensor Web, smartphone,
RFID)
- Services Computing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Mobile Ad-hoc
  Networks (MANET)
- Service-Oriented Middleware Deployment for Sensor as a Service
- Software Engineering for Sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT)

Authors are invited to submit original, previously unpublished research
papers in two categories. Both regular papers (must not exceed 12 pages)
and short papers (must not exceed 8 pages) should be written in English and

formatting instructions and templates see the Information for LNCS authors
in Springer website
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the international
program committee. Paper acceptance will be based on originality,
significance, technical soundness, and clarity of presentation. It is
planned to publish the proceedings with Springer in their Communications in
Computer and Information Science series (final approval pending). As in
