The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 24th International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2014) will be held at the University of Kent,
Canterbury, United Kingdom; previous symposia were held in Madrid,
Leuven, Odense, Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice, London,
Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester, Leuven,
Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester.
LOPSTR 2014 will be co-located with PPDP 2014 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Both full
papers and extended abstracts describing applications in these areas
are especially welcome. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

    * synthesis
    * transformation
    * specialization
    * composition
    * optimization
    * inversion
    * specification
    * analysis and verification
    * testing and certification
    * program and model manipulation
    * transformational techniques in SE
    * applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application papers that describe experience with
industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC co-chairs in case of questions).


Important Dates

 Abstract submission:                            May 30, 2014
 Paper/Extended abstract submission:             June 6, 2014
 Notification:                                   July 18, 2014
 Camera-ready (for electronic pre-proceedings):  August 25, 2014
 Symposium:                                      September 10-11, 2014


Submission Guidelines

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English)
in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style.
Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors
and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to
four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate
reviewers for the paper. Page numbers should appear on the manuscript to
help the reviewers in writing their report. Submissions cannot exceed 15
pages including references but excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus
papers should be intelligible without them.
Paper should be submitted via the Easychair submission website for LOPSTR 2=
014.
If electronic submission is impossible, please contact the program co-chairs
for information on how to submit hard copies.


Proceedings

The formal post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Full papers can be directly accep=
ted
for publication in the formal proceedings, or accepted only for presentatio=
n at
the symposium and inclusion in informal proceedings. After the symposium, a=
ll
authors of extended abstracts and full papers accepted only for presentation
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the light of t=
he
feedback solicited at the symposium. Then, after another round of reviewing,
these revised papers may also be published in the formal proceedings.
