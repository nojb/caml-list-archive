Student Research Competition
------------------------

This year ICFP will host a Student Research Competition where
undergraduate and postgraduate students can present posters. The SRC
at the ICFP 2014 consists of three rounds:

Extended abstract round:

All students are encouraged to submit an extended abstract outlining
their research (800 words).

Poster session at ICFP 2014:

Based on the abstracts, a panel of judges will select the most
promising entrants to participate in the poster session which will
take place at ICFP. Students who make it to this round will be
eligible for some travel support to attend the conference. In the
poster session, students will have the opportunity to present their
work to the judges, who will select three finalists in each category*
(graduate/undergraduate) to advance to the next round.

ICFP presentation:

The last round will consist of an oral presentation at the ICFP to
compete for the final awards in each category.


Prizes
-----

* Both the top three graduate and the top three
                undergraduate winners will receive prizes of $500,
                $300, and $200, respectively.

* All six winners will receive award medals and a
                two-year complimentary ACM student membership,
                including a subscription to ACM=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s Di=
gital Library.

* The names of the winners will be posted on the SRC
web site.

* The overall first place winner of the SRC will be
invited to participate in the ACM SRC Grand Finals,
an on-line round of competitions among the winners of
other conference-hosted SRCs.

* Grand Finalists and their advisors will be invited to
                the Annual ACM Awards Banquet for an
                all-expenses-paid trip, where they will be recognized
                for their accomplishments along with other
                prestigious ACM award winners, including the winner
                of the Turing Award (also known as the Nobel Prize of
                Computing).

* The top three graduate Grand Finalists will receive an
                additional $500, $300, and $200. Likewise, the top
                three undergraduate Grand Finalists will receive an
                additional $500, $300, and $200. All six Grand
                Finalists will receive Grand Finalist certificates.

* The ACM, Microsoft Research, and our industrial
                partners provide financial support for students
                attending the SRC. You can find more information
                about this on the ACM website.


Eligibility
--------

The SRC is open to both undergraduate (not in a PhD programme) and
graduate students (in a PhD programme). Upon submission, entrants must
be enrolled as a student at their universities, and are ACM student
members.

Furthermore, there are some constraints on what kind of work may be
submitted.

Previously published work:

Submissions should consist of original work (not yet accepted for
publication). If the work is a continuation of previously published
work, the submission should focus on the contribution over what has
already been published. We encourage students to see this as an
opportunity to get early feedback and exposure for the work they plan
to submit to the next ICFP or POPL.

Collaborative work:

Students are encouraged to submit work they have been conducting in
collaboration with others, including advisors, internship mentors, or
other students. However, submissions are individual, so they must
focus on the contributions of the student.

Submission Details
---------------

Each submission should include the student author=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s =
name,
institutional affiliation, e-mail address, and postal address;
research advisor=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s name; ACM student member number; =
category
(undergraduate or graduate); research title; and an extended abstract
addressing the following:


* Problem and Motivation: Clearly state the problem being
            addressed and explain the reasons for seeking a solution to
          this problem.

* Background and Related Work: Describe the specialized (but
          pertinent) background necessary to appreciate the
          work. Include references to the literature where appropriate,
          and briefly explain where your work departs from that done by
          others.

* Approach and Uniqueness: Describe your approach in attacking
          the problem and clearly state how your approach is novel.

* Results and Contributions: Clearly show how the results of
       your work contribute to computer science and explain
       the significance of those results.

The abstract must describe the student=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s individual =
research and must
be authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with
others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make
clear what the student=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s role was and should focus o=
n that portion of
the work. The extended abstract must not exceed 800 words and must not
be longer than 2 pages. The reference list does not count towards
these limits. To submit an abstract, please register through the
submission page and follow the instructions. Abstracts submitted after
the deadline may be considered at the committee's discretion, but only
after decisions have been made on all abstracts submitted before the
deadline. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to contact the
competition chair.
