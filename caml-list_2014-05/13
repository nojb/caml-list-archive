Subject: [Caml-list] PPDP 2014: 2nd Call for Papers

======================================================================

             2nd Call for papers
           16th International Symposium on
      Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming
                  PPDP 2014

        Canterbury, Kent, September 8-10, 2014
            (co-located with LOPSTR 2014)

         http://users-cs.au.dk/danvy/ppdp14/

======================================================================

          SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 15 MAY, 2014

PPDP 2014 is a forum that brings together researchers from the
declaratrive programming communities, including those working in the
logic, constraint and functional programming paradigms, but also
embracing languages, database languages, and knowledge representation
languages. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical
formalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analyzing
computations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity,
concurrency, object-orientation, security, verification and static
analysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools
in industry and education are especially solicited. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to

* Functional programming
* Logic programming
* Answer-set programming
* Functional-logic programming
* Declarative visual languages
* Constraint Handling Rules
* Parallel implementation and concurrency
* Monads, type classes and dependent type systems
* Declarative domain-specific languages
* Termination, resource analysis and the verification of declarative programs
* Transformation and partial evaluation of declarative languages
* Language extensions for security and tabulation
* Probabilistic modeling in a declarative language and modeling reactivity
* Memory management and the implementation of declarative systems
* Practical experiences and industrial application

This year the conference will be co-located with the 24th
International Symposium on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2014).

The conference will be held in Canterbury, UK. Previous symposia were
held at Madrid (Spain), Leuven (Belgium), Odense (Denmark), Hagenberg
(Austria), Coimbra (Portugal), Valencia (Spain), Wroclaw (Poland),
Venice (Italy), Lisboa (Portugal), Verona (Italy), Uppsala (Sweden),
Pittsburgh (USA), Florence (Italy), Montreal (Canada), and Paris
(France). You might have a look at the contents of past PPDP symposia.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of
questions). The proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital
Library.

After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to
extend their submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the
symposium. The papers are expected to include at least 30% extra
material over and above the PPDP version. Then, after another round of
reviewing, these revised papers will be published in a journal.

   Symposium:                  8-10 September, 2014

   Invites for journal publication:   To be announced
   Submission of journal version:     To be announced
   Notification:               To be announced
   Camera-ready version:          To be announced


Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in
PDF. Papers should be submitted to the submission website for PPDP
2014. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title;
authors and their affiliations; abstract; and three to four
keywords. The keywords will be used to assist the program committee in
selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Papers should consist
of the equivalent of 12 pages under the ACM formatting
guidelines. These guidelines are available online, along with
formatting templates or style files. Submitted papers will be judged
on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and
clarity. They should include a clear identification of what has been
accomplished and why it is significant. Authors who wish to provide
additional material to the reviewers beyond the 12-page limit can do
so in clearly marked appendices: reviewers are not required to read
such appendices.
