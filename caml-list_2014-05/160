Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Win-builds 1.4.0 - package management on/for
 Windows

Hi,

[ this is mostly a copy of an email sent on mingw-w64-public@, apologies
if you got it there too ]

The 1.4.0 release of win-builds is now officially available at
http://win-builds.org .

The win-builds.org project is a package manager along with free software
packages. Everything can be ran on Windows (with or without
MSYS*/Cygwin), Linux and other systems. It focuses on stability and
versatility.

The main changes in this version are bug fixes and usability
improvements. Packages have been updated too, in particular wrt security
issues.

GDB, libao, libid3tag, madplay, libmad, libsndfile, libtasn1, pcre,
harfbuzz, fribidi, have been added.
Most EFL packages (eet, embryo, edje, ecore, evas, eina) have been
merged together by upstream into a single "efl" package.
This brings the package count to over 60.

Installation has been greatly simplified; package updates even more so:
double-clicking on yypkg.exe is enough to update packages.
All pango, cairo, gdk, fontconfig caches are properly created at the end
of installation; moreover, fontconfig's fc-cache stopped leaking memory.

While there was an attempt to handle security updates in the previous
versions, some things didn't work out so well. This version fixes them
and security updates will be provided.

Tooling on Linux has been made simpler and more efficient. Build
procedure has been changed slightly: it now builds the cross-toolchain
on each machine  and reuses the windows packages, giving great
flexibility while saving most of the build time.
It has been tested on Exherbo, Slackware Linux, Debian Jessie and is
compatible back to wheezie and Ubuntu 12.04.

Documentation has been updated and improved.

There are also countless improvements which add up and make for a much
improved and matured release.
Note however that it isn't possible to update a 1.3 installation to 1.4
without manual intervention because of the tooling changes. If really
needed, get in touch on the bug tracker.

PS: next release (in 3 months or so) should include an updated OCaml
cross-compiler based on trunk along with some packages.

Happy installations,
Adrien Nader
