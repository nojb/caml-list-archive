*** THIRD CALL FOR PAPERS  ***

26th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence
ICTAI 2014

November 10-12, 2014, Limassol, Cyprus

http://ictai2014.cs.ucy.ac.cy


Aim & Scope
The annual IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial
Intelligence (ICTAI) provides a major international forum where
the creation and exchange of ideas related to artificial intelligence
are fostered among academia, industry, and government agencies.
The conference facilitates the cross-fertilization of these ideas and
promotes their transfer into practical tools, for developing intelligent
systems and pursuing artificial intelligence applications. The ICTAI
encompasses all technical aspects of specifying, developing and
evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and applied mechanisms
of the AI-based components of computer tools such as algorithms,
architectures and languages.

Topics (not limited to)

- AI in WWW, Communication, Social Networking, Recommender Systems,
   Games and E-Commerce
- AI in Finance and Risk Management

AI in Computer Systems
- AI in Robotics, Computer Vision and Games
- AI in Software Engineering, Real-Time and Embedded Applications,
   and Sensor Networks

AI in Data Analytics and Big Data
- Visualization Analytics for Big Data
- Computational Modeling for Big Data
- Large-scale Recommendation and Social Media Systems
- Cloud/Grid/Stream Data Mining for Big Velocity Data
- Semantic-based Big Data Mining

Machine Learning and Data Mining
- Data pre-processing, reduction and feature selection

- Preference/Ranking, Ensemble, and Reinforcement Learning

Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Cognitive Modelling
- Knowledge Representation, Reasoning
- Knowledge Extraction, Management and Sharing
- Case-Based Reasoning and Knowledge-based Systems
- Cognitive Modelling and Semantic Web

AI and Decision Systems
- Decision Guidance and Support Systems
- Optimization-based recommender systems
- Group, distributed, and collaborative decisions
- Crowd-sourcing and collective intelligence decision making
- Strategic, tactical and operational level decisions

- AI in manufacturing control and planning

Paper Submission
The submissions should contain original, high quality, not submitted
or published elsewhere work. Papers should be submitted electronically
through the EasyChair system in pdf format and should conform to IEEE
specifications (single-spaced, double-column, 10-point font size, up to 8
pages).

Paper Presentation
Each accepted paper should be presented by one of the authors and
accompanied by at least one full registration fee payment, to guarantee
publication in the proceedings. All accepted papers will be included in
proceedings of ICTAI 2014 that will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society.

IJAIT special issue
Extended versions of the best papers of the conference will be invited
for publication in a special issue of the International Journal on Artifici=
al
Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) (SCI Indexed).

Important Dates
Paper submission: June 30, 2014
Paper notification: July 30, 2014
Camera-ready paper: August 30, 2014
