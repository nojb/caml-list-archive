Subject: [Caml-list] [GCM 2014] Last CFP : Graph Computation Models

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                       Last CALL FOR PAPERS

                            GCM 2014

                  Fifth International Workshop on
                     Graph Computation Models

                     York, UK, July 21st, 2014
                       http://gcm2014.imag.fr/

                         Part of ICGT 2014
                  http://www.2014.icgt-conferences.org/

Full versions of best papers will be included in an issue of the
the international journal of the "Electronic Communications of the EASST"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  Aims

The aim of the  International Workshop  GCM2014  is to bring together
researchers interested  in all aspects  of computation models based on
graphs    and graph transformation    techniques.    It promotes the
cross-fertilizing exchange of  ideas and experiences among researchers
and   students from   the different   communities interested in the
foundations, applications,   and implementations of  graph computation
models and related areas.

GCM  2014 is a one-day  satellite event of ICGT   and STAF, which will
take place in York, UK, from 21 to 25 of  July 2014. Previous editions
of GCM series were held in Natal, Brazil (GCM  2006), in Leicester, UK
(GCM 2008), in  Enschede, The Netherlands   (GCM 2010) and  in Bremen,
Germany (GCM 2012).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Topics of Interest

GCM 2014  solicits  papers in all   areas of Graph Computation Models
including but not limited to:

Foundations : Models of graph transformation; Parallel, concurrent, and
distributed;  graph transformations; Term  graph rewriting; Logics on
graphs  and graph transformations; Formal graph languages Analysis and
verification   of   graph   transformation  systems; Foundations of
programming languages

Applications  :  Software  architecture; Software validation; Software
evolution; Visual   programming;   Security models; Implementation of
programming   languages;  Rule-based  systems;    Workflow and business
processes;    Model-driven  engineering;  Service-oriented applications;
Bioinformatics and system biology; Quantum computing, Case-studies

Abstract submission: 18 May 2014
Paper submission: 25 May 2014
Notification: 15 June 2014
Preliminary Proceedings: 29 June 2014
Workshop: 21 July 2014

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

                         Submissions and Publication

Authors are invited to submit either regular papers  (up to 15 pages),
or  position papers, system  descriptions, work  in progress, extended
abstracts (5-7 pages), via the EasyChair system, at URL

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gcm2014

Submissions should be in  PDF format, using  Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) style.

Preliminary proceedings will be distributed at the workshop. Selected
authors will be invited to submit a full version of their papers after
the workshop. These  submissions will pass through  a second round of
reviewing and accepted contributions are to  be published as a special
issue of  the international journal  of the "Electronic Communications
of the EASST".
