Depends: if the library is C then you can perfectly mix the two
compilers. Keep in mind that when you build with GCC on Windows, you're
still using the Windows libraries like msvcrt.dll or kernel32.dll and
they've been built using MSVC.

IIRC even the MSVC port is built from Cygwin and I think it won't mind
whether there are trailing '.exe' or not.
But now I'm not sure I understand: what is calling flexlink? Is it your
build system or the ocaml compiler's?
