Subject: [Caml-list] CICM 2014: Invited Speakers & Call for Work-in-Progress
 Papers, 1 June 2014

   CICM 2014 - Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
      7-11 July 2014 at the University of Coimbra, Portugal
               http://www.cicm-conference.org/2014

         * * *  Announcement of Invited Speakers  * * * 

 * * * Call for Work-in-Progress Papers -- Deadline June 1 * * *

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater
opportunities arise  for intelligent mathematical  computation.  While
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we are  now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these
areas.  CICM  2014 offers  a venue  to discuss  these areas  and their
synergy.

The conference will take place at the University of Coimbra, Portugal,
and consists of four tracks:

* Calculemus, Chair: James Davenport

* Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML), Chair: Petr Sojka

* Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM), Chair: Josef Urban

* Systems and Projects, Chair: Alan Sexton

As  in previous  years, there  will be  a Doctoral  Programme for  the
mentoring of Doctoral students and several co-located workshops.

* MathUI 2014: Mathematical User Interfaces
* OpenMath Workshop 2014
* The Notion of Proof 2014
* ThEdu 2014: TP Components for Educational Software
* Doctoral Programme
  
All of these are now accepting contributions.  Please see the web site
for their calls for submissions.

The  overall  programme is  organised  by  the General  Program  Chair
Stephen Watt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Work-in-Progress Call-for-Papers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Work-in-progress submissions are  intended to provide a  forum for the
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for
submission as a  full or system description paper.  This includes work
in progress  and emerging trends.   Papers may  be on any  CICM topic,
including those from Calculemus, DML, MKM and Systems and Projects.

Accepted work-in-progress  papers will be presented  at the conference
as  short   teaser  talks   and  as  posters.    The  work-in-progress
proceedings  will   be  published  digitally  in   the  CEUR  Workshop
Proceedings series (CEUR-WS.org).

WiP  papers  should  be  prepared in  LaTeX  and  formatted  according
Springer's  LNCS   series  (the  corresponding  style   files  can  be
downloaded     from    http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).
Papers should be between 5 and 10 pages in length.

By submitting  a paper  the authors  agree that if  it is  accepted at
least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.

==========
Calculemus
==========

Calculemus   2014  invites   the  submission   of  original   research
contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the
conference. Calculemus  is a  series of  conferences dedicated  to the
integration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for
mechanised  reasoning  like  interactive   proof  assistants  (PA)  or
automated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently, symbolic  computation is
divided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional
ones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as well  as
newly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory
exploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to
bring these developments  together in order to  facilitate the theory,
design,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant
systems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer
scientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in
their every day business.

All  topics  in  the  intersection of  computer  algebra  systems  and
automated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.  These
include but are not limited to:

* Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.
* Computer algebra in theorem proving systems.
* Adding reasoning capabilities to computer algebra systems.
* Adding computational capabilities to theorem proving systems.
* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for
  computer mathematics.
* Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation and
  reasoning.
* Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories.
* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.
* Theory exploration techniques.
* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.
* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages,
  and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.
* Homotopy type theory.
* Infrastructure for mathematical services.

===
DML
===

Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked, validated and
verified.   It is  estimated that  the entire  corpus of  mathematical
knowledge  published over  the centuries  does not  exceed 100,000,000
pages,   an   amount   easily  manageable   by   current   information
technologies.

Track objective  is to provide  a forum for development  of math-aware
technologies, standards, algorithms and formats towards fulfillment of
the  dream  of global  digital  mathematical  library (DML).  Computer
scientists  (D)  and librarians  of  digital  age (L)  are  especially
welcome to  join mathematicians  (M) and discuss  many aspects  of DML
preparation.

Track topics are  all topics of mathematical  knowledge management and
digital  libraries  applicable  in  the context  of  DML  building  --
processing of math knowledge expressed in scientific papers in natural
languages, namely:

* Math-aware text mining (math mining) and MSC classification
* Math-aware representations of mathematical knowledge
* Math-aware computational linguistics and corpora
* Math-aware tools for [meta]data and fulltext processing
* Math-aware OCR and document analysis
* Math-aware information retrieval
* Math-aware indexing and search
* Authoring languages and tools
* MathML, OpenMath, TeX and other mathematical content standards
* Web interfaces for DML content
* Mathematics on the web, math crawling and indexing
* Math-aware document processing workflows 
* Archives of written mathematics
* DML management, business models
* DML rights handling, funding, sustainability 
* DML content acquisition, validation and curation 

===
MKM
===

Mathematical  Knowledge Management  is an  interdisciplinary field  of
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop
new and better ways  of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,
based on innovative technology of  computer science, the Internet, and
intelligent   knowledge  processing.   MKM   is   expected  to   serve
mathematicians,  scientists,   and  engineers  who  produce   and  use
mathematical  knowledge; educators  and students  who teach  and learn
mathematics;   publishers  who   offer   mathematical  textbooks   and
disseminate   new    mathematical   results;   and    librarians   and
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:

* Representations of mathematical knowledge
* Authoring languages and tools
* Repositories of formalized mathematics
* Deduction systems
* Mathematical digital libraries
* Diagrammatic representations
* Mathematical OCR
* Mathematical search and retrieval
* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
* Web presentation of mathematics
* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
* Computer algebra systems
* Collaboration tools for mathematics
* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows

====================
Systems and Projects
====================

The  Systems and  Projects  track of  the  Conferences on  Intelligent
Computer Mathematics is  a forum for presenting  available systems and
new and ongoing  projects in all areas and topics  related to the CICM
conferences:

* Deduction and Computer Algebra (Calculemus)
* Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)
* Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)

The track aims  to provide an overview of the  latest developments and
trends within the CICM community as  well as to exchange ideas between
developers and introduce systems to an audience of potential users.
