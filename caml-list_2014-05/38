GOALS
=====

The Future Internet has emerged as a new initiative to pave a novel 
infrastructure linked to objects (things) of the real world to meet the 
changing global needs of business and society. It offers internet users 
a standardized, secure, efficient and trustable environment, which 
allows open and distributed access to global networks, services and 
information.

To be consistently adopted, the Future Internet will be enabled through 
standards-based notations for messaging, semantics, process and state 
(such as those RDF, OWL, SOAP, REST and WS-BPEL), enabling distributed 
systems and entities to be described in a scalable and flexible robust 
dynamic environment. Multi-tenancy will enable their remote access as 
Software as a Service (SaaS), by performing the integration into larger 
networks of communicating software (e.g., a mashup or a plug-in to a 
Cloud platform). Future Internet applications will have to support the 
interoperability between many diverse stakeholders by governing the 
convergence and life-cycle of Internet of Contents (IoC), Services 
(IoS), Things (IoT), and Networks (IoN). These applications should 
handle dynamic and continuous change: for example, in the provisioning 
of services, availability of things and contents, connectivity of 
networks, diversity of user devices etc. They should also bear in mind 
that the Future Internet should provide a better experience for the user 
journey, with personalized and context-aware contents, adapted to their 
preferences, and where users also play an active part in creating or 
sharing services.

There is a need for both researchers and practitioners to develop 
platforms made up of adaptive Future Internet applications. In this 
sense, the emergence and consolidation of Service-Oriented Architectures 
(SOA), Cloud Computing and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) give benefits, 
such as flexibility, scalability, security, interoperability, and 
adaptability, for building these applications. Although there already 
are emerging solutions to host software services and data on remote 
computers and create public sensor networks by using these technologies; 
the mentioned solutions employ simple technical approaches related to 
replication strategies to ensure availability and to achieve a 
load-balancing scalability. Future Internet systems, however, will also 
need to sense and respond to a huge amount of signals sourced from 
different entities in real-time. In this context, an event would be 
detected if, for example, there is non-existence of a signal which 
normally occurs, affecting the execution of other services. These events 
would be produced by IoT and processed in the IoS. In order to build 
business level events Complex Event Processing (CEP) may be used. CEP 
allows detecting complex and meaningful events and inferring valuable 
knowledge for end users. The main advantage of using CEP to process 
complex events is that the latter can be identified and reported in real 
time, reducing the latency in decision making, unlike the methods used 
in traditional software for event analysis. Event-Driven 
Service-Oriented Architectures (ED-SOA or SOA 2.0) are also being used 
to respond to events that occur as a result of business processes.

The first edition of WAS4FI was held in conjunction with ServiceWave 
2011, in Poznan, Poland, on October 28th 2011. The second edition was 
held in conjunction with ESOCC 2012, in Bertinoro, Italy, on September 
19th 2012. The third edition was also held in conjunction with ESOCC 
2013, in Málaga, Spain, on September 11th 2013. In this fourth edition, 
WAS4FI again aims to bring together the community at ESOCC and addresses 
different aspects of adaptive Future Internet applications, emphasizing 
the importance of governing the convergence of contents, services, 
things and networks in order to achieve building platforms for 
efficiency, scalability, security and flexible adaptation. In this 
workshop, we cover the foundations of the aforementioned technologies as 
well as new emerging proposals for their potential in Future Internet 
services. To promote collaboration, WAS4FI has a highly interactive 
format with short technical sessions complemented by discussions on 
Adaptive Services in the Future Internet Applications.

TOPICS

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

Authors are invited to submit original, previously unpublished research 
papers in two categories. Both regular papers (must not exceed 12 pages) 
and short papers (must not exceed 8 pages) should be written in English 
and following LNCS format. Please, submit papers via the WAS4FI 
conference management tool (EasyChair submission system, 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=was4fi2014) in PDF format. 
For formatting instructions and templates see the Information for LNCS
