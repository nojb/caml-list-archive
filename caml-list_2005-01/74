Good to know :-)

I would be glad to help if I can.

However, my concerns are more about how to integrate regular expressions
in the language so that they can be checked at compile-time just like the
rest of the program. My Camlp4 syntax extension
(http://martin.jambon.free.fr/micmatch.html) works just fine for this
purpose and I am not asking for any change in the core OCaml syntax ;-)
