The core ocaml-mode has been written by so many people, that nobody
will take the blame (I hope so, or you could face a vendetta.)
The problem with it is that the code is such spagetthi that it gets
difficult to improve it (at least the indentation part.)

Having never tried Tuareg (mostly out of inertia, since I'm satisfied
with the core mode), could you be more precise about what is better in
Tuareg. Excluding indentation style of course, as this is a matter of
taste. (But note that in order to replace the core mode, you have to be
able to indent in exactly the same way.)

Just curious.

Ditching the core mode would indeed save time for some people.

Cheers for the new year.
