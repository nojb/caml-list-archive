I don't know about the exact details, but I notice the difference when
I have to use a machine which doesn't have tuareg-mode installed.  So
much so that I just install tuareg before going any further.
Integration with font-lock-mode seems better.

I'm quite sure that tuareg-mode can be configured to indent
the same way as the core mode.

Since tuareg-mode is actually developed at INRIA, it would seem fairly
logical to integrate it into OCaml.
