I don't see it as a big problem if you are lagging by one bugfix 
version.
The differences are small anyway, and it's not like 3.08.2 is horribly
broken.

I would have announced it if I had known about it.  From now on, I will 
put
a reminder about binary compatibility in the release notes for each 
bugfix
release.

I'd say it's a drawback of blind upgrading, which nobody does in a
real project anyway.
