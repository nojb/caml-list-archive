My guess is that you aren't including the unix library on your compile 
command line:

         ocamlc [other_options] unix.cma [other_files]
         ocamlopt [other_options] unix.cmxa [other_files]

Strings are indexed from 0, so change above to
let file_content = read file_reader !buff 0 5 in

Also, using the Unix libray is probably overkill for this kind of thing. 
  You might want to switch to the Pervasives library, which is 
automatically included with all ocaml programs.

There is a whole group for asking beginning OCaml questions:
