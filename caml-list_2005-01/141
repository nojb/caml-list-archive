As a teacher I'd like to be able to open an Ocaml Graphics window on each of my students display.
It's not possible with one instance of Ocaml, because Graphics.open_graph does 2 actions, 
opening a socket with an X11 server and opening a window on this server -- further instance 
of open_graph will only do the second action with the previous opened socket.

Perhaps will I have to rely on another mechanism to replicate windows over displays.
