I'm running 10.3.7 -- I don't think there's any newer version.  When I 
run harmonic4 as follows:

time ./harmonic 1000000000
21.3005

real    1m3.764s
user    1m0.590s
sys     0m0.130s

the above is what I get.  I'm not sure why I'm not exactly 2x faster 
than you, but there's plenty of things which could affect that.

Running the bytecode on my system gives:

time ./harmonic.bc 1000000000
21.3005

real    11m51.239s
user    11m11.600s
sys     0m0.940s

I would be pretty surprised to see the bytecode come even close to the 
native code version --- are you sure about the numbers on your system?

Will
