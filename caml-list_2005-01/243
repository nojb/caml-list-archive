 I am trying to extract all the
comments i.e. all the text between (* and *) in a text file and store
them in a list of string. How do u determin the length of the file?

My idea is to read in the file_descr into a string variable, buff. Then
extract the comments recursively from buff. What would be the
appropriate string functions to do so? Or is there a simpler way to read
the comments in directly from file?

The code I come up with is as folllows:
open Unix;;

let fileReader = openfile "student.cd" [O_RDONLY] 0o640;;
let buff = ref "file content:	";;
(*let fileSize = (fstat fileReader).st_size;;*)
let fileSize = 10000000;;
let noOfChar = ref 0;;

let rec extract_comment () =
  let openIndex = 0 in
  noOfChar := read fileReader !buff openIndex fileSize;;


let main () =
  (*let fileContent = read fileReader !buff 0 5 in
  print_int fileContent;*)
  print_int !noOfChar;;
  print_newline();;
  print_string !buff;;
  print_newline();;


main ();;

Thanks

Daisy
