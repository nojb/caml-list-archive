I while ago I patched the debian package of the o'reilly book to avoid
exercises texts and solution be layered one on top of the other (which
made both exercises and solutions unreadeable).

This is the relevant part of the package changelog:

  ocaml-book (1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low
  ...
  * {fr,en}/html/videoc.js
    - hacked JavaScript's {open,close}PopUp so that they output <div>
      and </div> tags around exercises' solutions. This avoid pop up
      mass on mozilla-like browsers. Solutions aren't popped up on
      request but at least they are available and exercises aren't
      hidden behind them (Closes: Bug#180799, Bug#185266)
  ...

You may have a look at the debian package and see if it fixes your
problem.

Cheers.
