Hello,

I would like to ask O'Caml developers why they have chosen QPL license
for the compiler and GPL for libraries?

Of course they have a full right to choose a license they want but I
think that GPL for the compiler and LGPL for the libraries would be a
much better choice.

Now it is for example impossible to distribute an O'Caml package as a
part of some O'Caml GPL project source package. Users have to know that
this program is written in some unusual programming language and they 
have to download and compile the O'Campl compiler first. For them it
would be much better to just download the application sources and type
/configure; make; make install
.and build process would compile the ocaml compiler (if it's not already
present) and then compile application sources and install native
executable (just like C/C++ apps).

Best regards,
	Jozef
