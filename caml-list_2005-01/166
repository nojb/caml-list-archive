I think this problem is due to different ocaml versions being used to gener=
ate=20
lablgtk and threads.

Interfaces between OCaml compilation units are *very* brittle. This is bein=
g=20
discussed on the list at the moment, as even a minor version change of the=
=20
compiler (e.g. 3.08.2 -> 3.08.3) breaks compatibility.

The good news is that this binary incompatibility is because the compiler i=
s=20
very pedantic about interfaces and guarantees that everything will work.

Your best bet is either to compile all of the packages yourself or to use=20
someone else's packages. I find Debian to be excellent in this respect.

Cheers,
Jon.

PS: 3.08 has some useful additions which you may well find that people use =
in=20
their code now (e.g. immediate objects).
