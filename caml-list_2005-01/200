<br>I could go on and on, but I won't. We have many programs the children love. But I would give them ALL up to keep my BORING noun program. I thank THE PARENT daily for her insight.
<br>The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made.	-Groucho Marx (1890-1977)	
<br>Another rule implemented was that the student was allowed to spend as much or as little time at the computer as he/she wished. There would be no more, 'We aren't finished, yet.' The student would to be in charge of his own learning at the computer.
