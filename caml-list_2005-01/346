Well, I don't know who disputed this, at least it is an OSI recognized
open-source license, which I believe to be the definition of
"officially open-source".

To the best of my knowledge, Trolltech decided to release a GPL'ed
version of Qt because the QPL is not compatible with the GPL, which is
no surprise at all: by definition the GPL is only compatible with
itself, or strictly weaker licenses, like BSD or LGPL.

This is less of a problem with ocaml, because the part covered by the
QPL is the compiler, not the library, so this should only concern
persons hacking the compiler itself.
