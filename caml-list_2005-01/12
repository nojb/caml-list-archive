This is a rather funny comment.
I just realized recently that the choice of colors with the core caml
mode is not optimal with Xemacs: for some reason most of the used
faces appear to be colorless. I didn't realize it before, because I'm
always using GNU emacs, for which colorization works perfectly.

But honestly, you're not going to say this is the main advantage.
Colors can be configured so freely that you could correct this
instantly: just replace the (not (boundp 'font-lock-type-face)) in
caml-font.el by t.

Or is there a more serious problem?

This is not the same team, so there is no direct relation.
