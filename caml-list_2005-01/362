Indeed, Baretta DE&IT plans to become a member of the Consortium. Since 
all our code is released under strict GPL, except for patches to other 
free software projects which are released under the same terms as the 
orginal code, we would request that INRIA licensed to the code to us 
under strict GPL or under terms allowing us to relicense it under GPL.

Will the caml ... ahem ... /authors/¹ allow me to do this?

historic dichotomy classyfing developers as "caml riders" or "caml 
breeders". I am thinking very hard to come up with a new one. ;)
