It's worse than that ..

.. it's worse .. some cases could be infinite recursion:
see Frisch & Cardelli.

It is known PCRE has this problem. It was hacked to
fix one of the common cases. The hack isn't general.

Which are worthless junk if you're generating them.. 

The point is -- this is folklore not mathematics.

Indeed, but they also have another problem: they don't support 
captures at all.

Hehe .. but the main use of the algorithm is in the specialist
XML processing language XDuce...
