Has anyone done a set of camlp4 macros for "do" notation in ocaml?  I am
experimenting with some (non-state) monadic code in ocaml, and writing =
all
of it in "long form" is really quite tiresome!

I don't even need 'return', just syntactic sugar for >>=3D would be
sufficient.

Thanks,
Jacques

PS: of course, if there are other, better ways to do this, I welcome any =
and
all pointers.
