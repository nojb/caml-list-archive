Jozef, 

With the current licence, which is not strictly the QPL anymore, please read
it, it is perfectly acceptable to distribute ocaml into debian/main, so i
doubt there is any additional restriction you may have for whatever obscure
need you may have.

The only real problem is if you want to link your stuff with the ocaml
compiler pseudo-QPLed code. But mere agregation, even if it is Makefile
enabled, do not cause the GPL/QPL incompatibility to come to life, only true
linking.

And anyway, real OSes have ocaml packages :)

Friendly,

Sven Luther
