Yes!

I've been working on a vector graphics library for the past few years. Over 
the last couple of years I have completely rewritten it entirely in ocaml. I 
intend to release my first commercial software product (a vector graphics 
editor for Linux and Mac OS X) soon.

I have been using glut. Most of the GUI uses vector graphics. However, I'd 
like conventional load and save dialog boxes. So I am about to port the main 
program from lablglut to lablgtk2 just to provide this functionality.

Please let me know if you think there will be any problem with this before I 
embark on the port! :-)

I personally believe that many more people will start to develop GUI 
applications using OpenGL once they see what is possible. An OpenGL+GTK 
version of ocamlbrowser could be much better than the current implementation, 
for example.

Cheers,
Jon.
