It uses either Str or PCRE. The PCRE variant makes me feel very
satisfied and as you know, a programmer which feels this way is unlikely
to spend time to improve his tools :-)

You can also integrate ulex by yourself if it is possible.
In that case, it should be relatively straightforward to reuse the
existing micmatch core which is already shared between the 2 existing
variants.
