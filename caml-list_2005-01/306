Hello,

Some explanations on the license choice for O'Caml can be found on
the web
<http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/LICENSE.html>
It may answer some of your questions.

As far as I understand, nothing in a licence prevents easy configuration
and installation (and indeed installing Ocaml from the site
<http://caml.inria.fr/index-eng.html> is what you describe
(configure/make/make install)

As I see it, different packaging organizations have different policies
as regards licenses...
