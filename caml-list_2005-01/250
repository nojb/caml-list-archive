This (~%) operator is called 'flip' in Haskell, and it is used there all =
the
time.  It is kind-of surprising that flip is not in Pervasives [as has =
been
mentionned before http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200106/msg00093.html].

There are two different patterns for function signatures: the Hashtbl=20
pattern and the Map pattern. Both are "good", depending on the context.=20
Since I need both approaches I have come up with a little trick to get=20
the best of both worlds.

# let (~%) f =3D fun x y -> f y x

The ~% operator swaps the first and the second parameter in a function=20
call. The following is a trivial example of its use.

# ~% Printf.kprintf "Hello %s!" failwith "World";;
Exception: Failure "Hello World!".
