Actually, according to the W3C markup and CSS validators, the Exercise 
pages (and stylesheets) are... compliance-challenged. :)

And it isn't all about the "layer" element, although the problems 
using caused by using this Netscape-only NON-standard element do 
figure prominently into the list of [W3C] sins.

Quick-fix-wise, forcing the rendering into "quirks" mode didn't really 
help... unfortunately, this is yet one more example of pages for which 
one keeps IE around - IE6 handles the pages fine, although I don't 
know if that is an option for you or not...
