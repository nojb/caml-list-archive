Very cool. I was about 90% ready to write one myself. :)

I see approx uses libcurl which makes it less cool again. Curl, among
other things, has no support for serializing multiple downloads into a
keep-alive connection. What I mean is that you can send 10 GET
requests to a server and then wait for 10 files to be send back. No
point sending each GET only after the previous file is done and
waiting for the round trip.

Anyway, a nice feature would be support for apt methods. Interfacing
with apts methods is real easy and you automatically get support for
file, copy, http, ftp urls and any future protocol to come.


I will try to test approx too but over the last month I heard many
complains about apt-proxy so approx might be welcomed immeditatly by
many.
