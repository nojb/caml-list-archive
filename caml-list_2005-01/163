There are a couple in the humps 
<http://caml.inria.fr/humps/caml_Cryptography.html>, including Xavier's 
cryptokit and an open-ssl binding.  I've also got my own update of 
cryptokit with some additions (SHA 256/384/512, hash chains, additional 
prime/random number generation routines, etc), and modifications to work 
with GMP (via David Monniaux's mlgmp) that I'd be happy to send your way.
