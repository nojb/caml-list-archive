Hi,

I am building a custom unstripped ELF executable that contains
the Caml runtime. The executable is segfaulting in runtime GC
routines. Can someone suggest how to cross reference these
routines with the corresponding file and line numbers of the Caml
source code so that gcc can tell me where the executable is
segfaulting?

Thank you

Lex

ps: Damien, I have tried using ocamldebug. It looks like an
excellent tool. In particular, it's time travel features are
powerful. However, in this case, it's use is limited by its
disconnected socket-based implementation; the executable
segfaults and the debugger loses contact.
