A commercial product may bundle and use the ocaml compilers and run-time in 
their entirety (e.g. by executing ocamlopt) without infringing the license. 
Commercial products may not link to or lift code from the compilers though, 
of course, as this counts as redistribution of a modification to the 
compiler.

I can see this descending into a discussion about the definition of linking in 
the presence of HOFs... :-)

IMHO, academics be encouraged by their funding bodies to release their code 
under an artistic/BSD license because they are funded by the tax payer. 
Naturally, this shouldn't apply to me.
