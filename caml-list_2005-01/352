Cool, ...

I wonder if this should be packaged apart, or together with the other
ocaml-written package related code, namely ara. I don't know if you are aware
of that effort.

I am CCing this to debian-ocaml-maint mailing list, where all debian related
folk interested i ocaml dwell. Maybe comments will come from there, and i will
try to test and reply more in details later this week, as i am soon going to
the Solutions Linux forum in Paris, and am not sure i will really have time
for testing this kind of stuff until next WE.

Friendly,
