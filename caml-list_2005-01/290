I should mention that as a Sourceforge developer I complained
that their Trove categorisation for developer skills had
a list of programming languages which did not include Ocaml.

I was informed recently that this system has been changed,
so that a more general categorisation is now used, which
does include Ocaml as a skills category (via the programming
languages category which did include Ocaml). This
note from the Sourceforge site therefore includes my
complaint as a feature request, and I believe the changes
they have done have resulted in a satisfactory fix.

"Software Map, Trove, Skills, Project Help Wanted: An initiative has
been completed to review and process all outstanding RFEs (Requests for
Enhancement, Feature Requests) related to addition of categories to the
Trove system, used for developer skills, the Software Map and the
Project Help Wanted systems. More than 200 requests have been reviewed
and processed, resulting in a more complete, well-managed category set
within the Trove system. Further, a process has been put in to place for
the regular review and processing of future requests for new Trove
categories. Projects are encouraged to review the categorization of
their projects to ensure it is listed in places that end-users would go
to look for software of that type."

I just wish my local Employment web site would include
Ocaml as a programming language (it has Simula, Cobol 
and IBM JCL but no modern or scripting languages .. :(
