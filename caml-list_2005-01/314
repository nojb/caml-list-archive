What's the status of SOAP (web services) under OCaml?  I urgently need
to access a SOAP-based web service, and while I could do this via Perl
and Perl4Caml, if there is a pure OCaml alternative I would rather use
that.

I've found: http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml-soap/ but it seems to be rather
out of date.  In particular I can't find a "way in" to begin using it.
The manual doesn't have any examples, and in the code there is one
example client, but it's frankly incomprehensible.

O'SOAP (http://www.asp.cornell.edu/osoap/) seems to have different
goals - writing command line clients apparently.

Can it be done with a current or future version of PXP or ocamlnet?

Rich.
