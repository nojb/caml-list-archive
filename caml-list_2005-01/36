Hello,

I am not sure if this exactly fits your needs, but PsiLAB
(http://psilab.sourceforge.net/) is available for the types of
mathematical operations you are talking about.  At the very least, it
provides extensive matrix/linear algebra operations, which you could
use to write your own (assuming another is unavailable).

Regards,

Sachin.
