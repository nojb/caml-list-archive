Indeed.

This is an issue mostly ignored right now, where there is no clear will to
solve it, and given the small case of code concerned, nobody bothered.

That said, given the restrictions of the QPL, the GPL compatibility may be
solved by those modification the ocaml team applied  to 3.08.2, or future
modifications.

Another solution is to licence differently the toplevel code.
