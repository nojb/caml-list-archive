I think this is a recent Mingw problem? I just tried building Ocaml =
3.08.1
with the same version of Mingw and the same problem occurs, where it was
working in the past with an older Mingw setup.

I think the binaries are corrupt. Here's the output of dumpbin on =
ocamlc.exe
and ocamlc.opt.exe (note that ocamlc.exe doesn't work, and =
ocamlc.opt.exe
does work):

Perhaps you have *too much* memory.

Your situation reminds me of problem I've had with > 2GB disks and older
installation programs who computed remaining disk space with 32 bit =
integers
and thus failed. OCaml maybe computes remaining memory with 31 bits so 1 =
GB
is the max (on 32 bit machines) ?
