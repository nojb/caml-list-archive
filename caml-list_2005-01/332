Sure, and that is what we will have to do. This is a lengthy process though,
and we had hoped to avoid this. This means not only changing the LIBDIR name,
but also changing the virtual versioned package from ocaml-3.08 to
ocaml-3.08.3, which our autobuilders still have trouble with.

We should really have done this for 3.08.2, but 3.08.1 was ok.

Also notice that on debian systems, you should not install into plain
/usr/local, but into /usr/local/lib/ocaml/3.08.3 too. the default ld.conf
knows about that, but sadly ocaml doesn't know how to look for various LIBDIR
path by itself.

Friendly,

Sven Luther
