Oh well.

What would be nice in this light, would be an exact list of the digests, and
thus the modules, that changed, so we could only rebuild the packages that are
actually affected. That said, such behavior is a major drawback for using
ocaml in real projects, i believe.

Yep, understood that now, 3.08.2 came as a big surprise though, as we somehow
expected no binary compatibility change for a bug fix release.

But now we know about it, and i will enable the full-rebuild process for the
3.08.3 release, hoping that it will be in time for the debian/sarge release.
