Yep, we are going to try to make it, it should be possible to hasten the
process some if we stage the uploads just right, and implement some smart
(build) dependency tree travelling to make sure that we forget no package. 
The matter is complicated because ocaml uses a virtual ocaml-3.08 package as
build-dependency, to be able to make sure we don't have a package builded
against a binary-incompatible version. This will become ocaml-3.08.3, but the
debian tools have trouble with dependencies on virtual packages, especially
the autobuilders. Oh well, we will handle.

Ah, so we were not the only one surprised :)

Well, it was a bug fix release. I looked over the changelog, and everything
seemed reasonable in it. I did not look over the actual source code, and
nothing hinted at binary compatibility problems in the changelog, or maybe i
just missed it. If each individual changelog entry which breaks binary
compatibility listed the affected modules, that would be a great solution to
this problem.
