assuming the file "sudent.cd" exists and contains enough bytes.

assuming you meant

main ();;

in the last line,....

then you have a problem, when you read from position with index "1" (instead of "0"
for the fiorst byte) and read 5 bytes into the 5 byte long string....

There is not enough space in your buffer for writing all your data into it.

You may start writing at position 0 instead of 1 or only read in 4 bytes, or
make your buffer larger.


You may set the len of bytes to the size of bytes of your String
(String.length !buff) . But you have to write from position (offset) 0.


It would be better to use the  try/with
construct around your unix-calls; then you can handle exceptions.

E.g. when there is no file "sudent.cd" then your program fails
in your first line.

Ciao,
