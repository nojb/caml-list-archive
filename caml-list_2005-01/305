I'm not exactly sure what your question is, but there is nothing about the
QPL or GPL that would forbid you from distributing the sources of the ocaml
compiler with another product.  Both licenses would allow this.  The only
thing that would be restricted would be if your program links with or uses
parts of the compiler itself.

Also, the ocaml library contains an exception that allows linking with
non-GPL programs, and is fairly liberal.
