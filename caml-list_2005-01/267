Sadly, this is very true. Camls are no genies capable of generating 
correct code when the programmer exerts friction against the computer's 
case. This is also the reason behind such DSLs as CDuce.

Of course, it is very reasonable to state that PXP is sound, but in now 
way does it guarantee the absence of runtime errors of the kind 
"required attributed not found". Here at DE&IT we are doing a good deal 
of work on extending the type system to handle XML well formedness 
constraints and possibly, to some extent, validity constraints.
