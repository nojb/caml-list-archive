                ON COORDINATION LANGUAGES AND WEB SERVICES

		 APPLICATION DEADLINE: MARCH 1ST 2005

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the framework of the "Namur Institutional Programme of postdoctoral
grants", a one-year postdoctoral position is available on the subject
of coordination languages and web services at the University of Namur,
Belgium.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

It is more and more acknowledged that modern information systems will
be formed out of numerous heterogeneous components, in general,
disseminated through networks. This fact induces a radical change in
the design of information systems perceived yesterday as isolated and
recognized today as open, distributed, mobile, interactive, and
heterogeneous. At the programming level, this evolution results in a
growing interest for so-called coordination languages, coordination
models, and component-based systems. At the application level, this
has resulted in an increasing attention for web services, and, in
particular, for the integration of these services.  

However, the foundations of this new way of thinking information
systems is far from being completely understood. The proposed
postdoctoral research aims at contributing to this goal by studying
coordination models in the context of web service integration. Topics
of interest include but are not limited to:

- design of coordination mechanisms for web service integration 
- study of the expressiveness of such mechanisms 
- methods for verifying properties of web services 
- development of behavioral types for web services integration 
- methodologies for coordinating web services.


PROFILE FOR THE APPLICANT 

Following the general policy of the university, candidates should be
not older than 35 years and should have obtained a Ph.D. in Computer
Science within 5 years in a non-Belgian university. They should also
have a research experience in coordination languages or web services,
preferably in one of the topics listed above.


RESEARCH GRANT

The research grant includes a two-way air ticket and health
insurances. The fellowship is of 1800 EUR (net) per month for 12
consecutive months starting during the academic year 2005-2006.


APPLICATIONS

Applications must include a CV, a motivation letter, and three letters
of recommendation. They should be addressed by March 1st 2005 to
