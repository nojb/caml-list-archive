Hello, Jacques--

I owe you thanks for your patient response to my somewhat grouchy 
questioning. Sorry about the long delay; I just haven't been dealing 
well with e-mail lately.

I certainly know that. Unfortunately, the people affected most by a 
problem aren't always in the best position to fix it. I guess I was 
frustrated because I would like to provide a complete package, and it 
happens that the problematic component is one that I really don't 
understand well.

I will probably provide gtkglarea as part of the lablgtk2 package. I 
don't think it's good policy to introduce new Linux packages whose 
upstream source is no longer maintained.

I don't doubt it, and in principle I have always been a strong advocate 
of backwards compatibility. But in this case I wonder (as mentioned in 
an earlier post) how much it really matters. Are there in fact 
significant projects using LablGTK2 with OpenGL?

Thanks for the clarification.

Oh, yes, an old familiar story. Back around '98 or '99 I got very 
annoyed at the GTK development team: it seemed about once a month they 
would release a new "must-have" version that would break half the 
applications on my system, including--most ironically--the GIMP. Things 
have settled down a good deal since then.
