I'm pleased to announce the release of version 0.9.0 of perl4caml.

Perl4caml allows you to call Perl code and libraries directly from
OCaml code.  It is licensed under the LGPL + OCaml linking exception.

http://merjis.com/developers/perl4caml

The reason for the large jump in version number (0.3.15 was the last
release) is that I have fixed up a lot of reference counting problems
in the code, so now perl4caml should operate much more reliably, and
by default frees Perl objects at the correct time.  I have also added
a test suite ('make test') which exercises large parts of the library.

I have also wrapped up more CPAN classes, and added more coverage to
the existing wrappers.

Rich.
