Hi,

I am trying to link object files generated by ocamlopt with object files
generated by the C compiler (cl for instance) and got a lot of unknown
symbols errors. I tried adding some or all of the libraries in the lib
directory, and still a few symbols remained unknown. Is there a list of
libraries one has to link with to make this work.

(The reason I am doing this is to try instrumentig my code to work with
boundschecker to discover memory leaks in my C code that is linked
together with some CAML code. To do this, I need to use NuMega linker so I
cannot use ocamlopt.)

Thanks,

Roy
