Subject: OCaml infix function-composition
Sender: weis


Dear caml-list,

We are in the process of converting our Caml code into OCaml, and
have a problem choosing an infix syntax for function composition
(right to left, as in (fun f g x -> f (g x))).  Previously we used "o"
for this, but I believe we cannot make "o" an infix operator in
OCaml, nor ".", which was our second choice.  We are considering "<<"
and "$" now.

What do other OCaml people use for function composition?  Is there a
standard emerging?  If we choose an operator, how can we be sure that
our selection won't be upset by the next version of OCaml?


Thanks
