Hi,

I am trying to write a Tk text widget that emulates a command window,
from
which the user can type a Caml function and have it executed.  One
functionality I need from Caml is that, given a string such as "let x =
fib 5;;",
Caml can parse it and execute it.  Is there any way I can get
Caml to do this, or am I doing it in a correct way?

Many thanks,
Freddy
