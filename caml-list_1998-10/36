I can't work out how to create a custom toplevel with both
Unix and Threads under NT.  (I did manage to get the
Unix module added to a toplevel by following the instructions
in the manual.)  Does anyone have the correct incantation?
Is it possible to have these two modules included under NT?
Why aren't they available in the default ocaml.exe?

Cheers,

Andrew

P.S. Here is what happened..
