Subject: Caml GC internals documents?

Hello,

We're about to do some research on garbage collection and would like
to use Caml as our experiment platform. We are aware of the Gc module
where we can control the behavior of gc. 

However, we would like to know if there's any documentation of the garbage 
collector, its structure (there is a minor and a major heap, and then?), or even 
more detailed documents which would help if we will go hacking the source 
code of the gc (is it recommended? :>)

Thank you very much.

sincerely,
