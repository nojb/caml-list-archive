Here is a suggestion so that I can link ML with C++
and avoid using -output-obj when I don't need it (particularly
to build a toplevel).

with two new options for ocamlc, one could choose ...

* ocamlc -cc my-ccompiler
  ... an alternative C compiler internally used
  to compile the internal primitive table and other C codes.
* ocamlc -clinker my-clinker
  ... an alternative linker used to link native objects before
  concatenation of ocaml cmo files
  this one is most important to C++ users because it makes it
  possible to let a C++ tool link object files.

I have emulated this thanks to an ugly hack that I would like
to remove. I have made my local gcc startup script
read an environment variable and link with another
linker when the variable is set (in my case, a C++ linker).

It gives me the ability to build a C++/ML program (or toplevel) with
ocamlc (or ocamlmktop) -custom which is just what I need.

I also have a request about the toplevel module:

The #quit directive happens to call directly exit
this is a problem if the toplevel is embedded in a C (or C++)
main () function because after #quit, the program
exits instead of finishing main ()'s code.

In the case of C++ it's even worse because destructors are
not called.

I would suggest an internal toplevel_exit exception
raised by #quit
and handled by the toplevel loop to return properly from caml_main ()

Thank you.
