Thank you for answering

I must now face a problem:

It would be really nice if I could use -custom but ...
 
How can I ask ocamlc -custom to :
1) use a user-provided compiled main() (potentially compiled with C++)
2) link with a user-provided linker (aka g++)
3) I know that internally, some C code is output and compiled
   (for the external primitives I think), I think this code should
   still be compiled with the C compiler used to build ocaml.

Are there any clues to help me build this toplevel with C++ code
without -output-obj ?

Thanks
