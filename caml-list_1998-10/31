Toplevels need access to their own symbol table, and they look inside
their executable file to find it.  The symbol table information is not
available if -output-obj is selected.

A regular bytecode executable file is composed of several sections:
code, data, symbols, and debug info.  Currently, only the first two
are available when a C object is generated instead of a regular
executable file.

For the same reasons, you can't debug a Caml program built with
-output-obj.

Hope this helps,
