Hi,
I've recently upgraded to RedHat  (Linux) 5.1 and am having problems, I
was wondering if anyone else has had exeperience with RH5.1 so I can
identify whether my problems are to do with RH5.1 or with my local
setup.
First off I tried to simply 'configure' as follows:

./configure -bindir $DEPOT/dsg/local/arch.linux/bin -libdir
$DEPOT/dsg/local/arc
h.linux/lib/ocaml -mandir $DEPOT/dsg/local/man/man1 -cc gcc -x11include
/usr/X11
R6/include -x11lib /usr/X11R6/lib

This all worked fine.
Then I did make world and got:

make[1]: Entering directory
`/a/azdak/root/depot0/.primary/dsg/local/src/ocaml-2.00/byterun'
sed -n -e '/^  /s/ \([A-Z]\)/ \&\&lbl_\1/gp' \

This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.

make[1]: Leaving directory

make: *** [coldstart] Error 2

So I checked my compiler:

gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-linux/egcs-2.90.29/specs
gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)

I suspect this is the problem.  Has anyone else succesfully compiled
with egcs?

n.b. I remembered to use sh and not csh or other.

Thanks,
