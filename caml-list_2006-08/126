Hmm ... well, I happen to have the heretical view that in an age of 
cheap, powerful PCs and inexpensive software, running X remotely is just 
plain absurd in most situations. Okay, yeah, there are thin clients, but 
who actually uses them--other than a few large corporations, for whom I 
have no sympathy?

However, I also know that my philosophy is on the fringe, and from a 
practical standpoint people actually do some of these absurd things, so 
... thanks for the heads-up.

Wait a minute, though. According to the Gdk reference manual, 
<http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gdk/gdk-Pixbufs.html#id2861842>

   Pixbufs are client-side images.

If that's true, I don't understand how loading pixbufs from files would 
affect the X server.
