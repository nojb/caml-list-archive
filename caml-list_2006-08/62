I spend several hours (in fact weeks), trying to hack automake to make
it work with OCaml target... I don't think it could work. As said in
this thread, automake is mainly made for C/C++ like langages... In
particular if you want to compile something, you need to have a ".o"
somewhere in your compilation path (don't ask me why, that's thing i
have discovered trying to do this). Automake is actually a good tool for
doing what it is made for : provide portable build system to C/C++
project. I don't think it is a general purpose build system.

But anyway, if you think you could perform to make automake works for
ocaml, let me know !

Maybe you can have a look at the "carbon ml"/"mlmm" which  is an ocaml 
project and use automake.

Concerning autoconf, it is a great tool, the configure.in you have
already discovered is the best available source for doing ocaml stuff
with autoconf...

Kind regard
