Sigh - this was first sent 15 hours ago, and a single "Mail Delivery 
Subsystem" notice about a non-fatal error came back at the 4-hour 
mark... but as it has never shown up, here it is again.

Here is what I use:

open Unix
module U2 = struct
   let socketpair af typ proto =
     let listener = socket af typ proto in
     let listener_addr = ADDR_INET(inet_addr_loopback, 0) in
     bind listener listener_addr;
     listen listener 1;
     let listener_name = getsockname listener in
     let connector = socket af typ proto in
     connect connector listener_name;
     let acceptor_full = accept listener in
     close listener;
     (* assert ((getsockname connector) = (snd acceptor_full)); *)
     (connector, (fst acceptor_full))
end

... and then select this socketpair or the one from the Unix module at
runtime.
