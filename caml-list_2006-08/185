Ok, I did understand _what_ you are trying to do, I'm just not sure why 
anyone wouldn't choose the path of least resistance -- a solution in C 
is likely to be more error-prone (as you've discovered ;)) and harder to 
maintain if there are changes in OCaml internals -- whereas Unix.select 
is likely to remain that way "forever". Of course if the aim of the 
whole exercise is to get the modified select included in OCaml then I 
guess there's your motivation for doing it in C ;).

However, if you just want a nicer interface then there are other 
solutions such as Gerd Stolpmann's "Equeue" framework. I would just use 
that instead of worrying about Unix.select. It provides much nicer 
abstractions:
