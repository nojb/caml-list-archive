I would expect the port to be straigthforward, but I'll need to get
access to such a machine to see whether the application binary
interface differs between Linux/AMD64 and MacOSX/AMD64.  So, the
answer to your question is: MacOSX/AMD64 will be supported at some
point, but I can't say when.

I did a MacOSX/PPC64 port a few months ago.  That will be released as
part of 3.10, or you can give it a try now using the CVS trunk
sources.
