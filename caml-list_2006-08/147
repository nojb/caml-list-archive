Hi Christoph,

I must admit that I've never built PCRE from scratch but I might
still be able to help.

Thats probably because you haven't install PCRE first.

Probably. Building any Unix software on windows is a royal PITA
so people often include a bunch of special files for building
under windows.

For sane systems like Unix and MaxOSX, building PCRE support for
Ocaml probably requires that the PCRE library is already installed
on the system. You can get that library here:

    http://www.pcre.org/

There may also be instructions with the Ocaml bindings. You should
read the Unix section of those instructions.
