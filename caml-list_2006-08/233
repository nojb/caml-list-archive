"Select on windows" certainly does work... and why not use a socket 
pair, just as one might on a *nix system?  That way, it will work on both.

And the fact that socketpair has been left out of the Windows version 
of the Unix module is not an impediment - it is easy to write a useful 
implementation in OCaml (I can supply one if needed).
