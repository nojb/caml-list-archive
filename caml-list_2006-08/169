Indeed. That's because min and max are not primitives provided by the
runtime library but regular caml functions from pervasives.ml :
,----
| let min x y = if x <= y then x else y
| let max x y = if x >= y then x else y
`----

I don't know, float comparisons tend not to be 'pretty simple' usually
(because of NaNs).
