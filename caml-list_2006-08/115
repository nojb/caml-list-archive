Hi,
=46or the category "Documentations :: Books" of the Hump
(http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/hump.fr.cgi?sort=3D0&browse=3D14)
here are two books *in french* that could perhaps be added:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Programmation en Caml
  cours et ateliers
      Jacques Rouabl=E9  (Eyrolles)

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Programmation par l'exemple en Caml
  (exemples et probl=E8mes corrig=E9s)
      Louis Gac=F4gne  (Ellipses)

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D


(They are not strictly for OCaml, but for Caml Light, but there are very fe=
w=20
and trivial things that an OCaml user would have to adapt.)
(They are several years old too. Maybe they are not available anymore,=20
I've found those in a library, not in a bookshop.)
