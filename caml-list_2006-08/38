I totally agree that building on the knowledge of Autotools would be 
better. But in my experience I have to write a lot of shell code in 
configure.in because the tests I require are not provided (or I can't 
find them). There is no guarantee that this code does not break in 
specific scenarios (but the chance of breaking is slimmer - I admit).
