Hi,

Does the ocaml team ever plan on supporting unicode to some degree?

What about being able to parse utf-8 encoded files, but keeping the
ascii only grammar? Then with the only change that if it's a utf-8
file, that the utf-8 encoding of string constants are maintained. With
this scheme, you could theoretically bail on non-ascii characters
everywhere else. And a 3rd-party library like camomile could be used
for higher-level processing of the utf8-encoded string constants (from
the camomile docs, utf8 strings use the ocaml string type too).

I must admit that I have no idea how complex even a seemingly small
change like this may be, but at least the detection of the byte order
mark should make it a compatible change...

Jonathan
