I have been developing for a few months with ocaml and find it adds a 
lot enjoyment to programming. One small irritation that has bothered me 
for a while is the handling of comments in the default emacs mode 
'ocaml-mode' that comes with the ocaml installation. I may have a 
setting wrong in my customization of emacs, but multiline comments never 
seem to maintain a consisten color. Usually I will start comment using 
the default keystroke M-; (which produces '(* *)') and proceed to type 
in the commented area. The first line stays the color of a comment as 
determined by the font-lock settings but when I hit enter to go to the 
next line and indent, the coloring reverts to the standard non-comment 
colors. Using the 'fill-paragraph' command (M-q) usually gets the whole 
multiline comment to turn the comment color, but it seems that this 
shouldn't be required. Also, there is no smart 'fill-paragraph' for 
ocaml-mode so that program code will be filled in with the comments if 
there is not a blank line separating them.

I have experimented a bit with Tuareg-mode, the alternate mode for ocaml 
editing, and it did solve this, but I prefered the indenting in the 
default ocaml-mode and Tuareg seemd to have trouble with font colors for 
functions with labels.

There seem to be a number of similar discussions between the two emacs 
modes in the archives on this list but I couldn't locate anything that 
dealt with these specific issues, the multiline comments and comment 
filling, in ocaml-mode. If anyone has pointers to other discussion or 
tips, please enlighten me.

Cheers,
Chris
