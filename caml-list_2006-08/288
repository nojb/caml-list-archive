You can also easily try this in C with fgetc() contrasted with fgets(). 
The difference is _huge_ even if they both do comparable numbers of 
syscalls -- assuming that the buffering is identical (I haven't checked, 
but I think it is a reasonable assumption). In the C case, the inlining 
is not really guaranteed, but I don't think it is in OCaml either -- 
though I honestly don't know. You'd have to check the assembler output 
to see if the call gets inlined.

Inlining aside, memory prefecthing probably also makes a difference in 
favor of reading in bulk and then processing "in bulk".

I would guess so, yes.

(There may of course be other reasons for a large portion of the 
difference as others have pointed out.)
