You might look at the OMake build system[1].  It's a concise and
declarative like make, but with far superior dependency tracking and
support for large projects.  Support for OCaml is particularly strong,
since it's the primary language used for OMake itself and most of the
other projects in our lab.  In particular, it takes care of keeping
the .cmo files in proper order.
