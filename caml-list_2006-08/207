I see.  In that case I move we eliminate the whole Unix module.  It's
all written in error-prone, complicated, non-portable C!

The point is that we need *some* interface to the select system call.
By it's nature, it must be written in C.  We can, with very little
work (about 10-20 LOC or less), have a more elegant interface to the
select system call that reduces the amount of cruft needed to make a
typical select call.  I'm doing this work, because it's useful to me.
Because I believe it could be useful to others, I'm also trying to
create a patch against the compiler for submission to the ocaml team.
I'm not claiming it's a revolutionary change or massively faster, just
an interface that's more pleasant to program with.

Cheers,
