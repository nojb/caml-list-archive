Hello,

Yes, I have a copy of it. But I'm also interested in small compilers
(even with reduced capabilities) like MinCaml that are easier to
understand for a beginner, as well as ML specific items like type
inference, pattern matching, garbage collection, ... That's probably
the most difficult on the compilation topic: there is a lot of books,
articles, etc. but it is sometimes hard for a beginner to determine
the minimal set of knowledge needed to start and the improved
algorithms that can be learned later. For a hobby compiler, one not
necessarily looks for the most efficient algorithms but simpler ones
that are easier to grasp.

Best wishes,
d.
