Like others before me, I'm hitting the frustrating limitation that
it's impossible to select on a channel.  This limitation forces one to
reimplement buffered IO in many situations where using channels would
otherwise be easy and sensible.  There has been discussion on this
list in the past about this limitation[1], and there have been two
requests filed in mantis for this feature[2,3], but the ocaml dev team
has been silent on the matter.  Is this feature objectionable to the
dev team or is it just a case of "too much work, not enough time?"  If
somebody was to submit a quality patch implementing the feature would
it be accepted?

Cheers,
