I recently got a Macbook Pro, and attempted to build OCaml from the CVS 
sources, but the build failed with the following error:

cd camlp4; make all
CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../otherlibs/unix ../boot/ocamlrun ../ocaml -I 
../stdlib -I ../otherlibs/unix build/build.ml
Cannot load required shared library dllunix.
Reason: dynamic loading not supported on this platform.
Reference to undefined global `Unix'
make[1]: *** [yam] Error 2
make: *** [camlp4out] Error 2

Building from the tarball source works fine, but it also appears that 
dynamic loading doesn't work here either:

[254]  2:48PM% ocaml unix.cma
Cannot load required shared library dllunix.
Reason: dynamic loading not supported on this platform.

Note that the configure phase seems to indicate that dynamic loading 
should be working with the following message: NSLinkModule() found. Using 
darwin dynamic loading.

Is it the case that dynamic loading isn't working yet of OS X/Intel, or is 
something odd just happening with my build?  I can't find anything about 
this in the distribution or via google.
