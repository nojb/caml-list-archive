Only if you use lame build systems like autotools :)

If you use a better system such as the one used by Felix
or OMake, which are both designed to work on Windows as well 
as Unix, it isn't so bad: probably using Manifests on Win64
is the same difficulty as coping with the plethora of
incompatible Unicies.

The biggest problem is non-portable C code .. Ocaml code tends
to build out of the box everywhere provided you can find
the libraries you need .. congrats to the Inria team on 
managing this well.

BTW: why use PCRE? TRE is a better system IMHO (and is Posix
compliant).
