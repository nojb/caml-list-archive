I altered some of the code in my program to remove aliases that were created by 
the style mentioned in my previous post. This did not seem to affect the number 
of times caml_adjust_gc_speed was called. I guess my questions will go 
unanswered until I find some time to dig into the inner workings of the garbage 
collector. Let me know if someone sees this in the future and has similar 
problems and/or finds a solution.
