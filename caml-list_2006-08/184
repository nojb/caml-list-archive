IMHO: the lack of debugging support on Windows is an illusion.
Ocaml code just works (TM), you don't need a debugger. A couple
of debugging prints is usually enough to find problems.

I never use debuggers. Debuggers are for assembler geeks
and would-be assembler geeks writing low level C code :)

I think this is a matter of education -- you're looking
for a tool you don't need in the first place.

As to IDE support -- well it is much the same. I'm happy
enough with a text editor and command line compilation
with a script. It is only slightly more painful on Windows
than on Unix.

However I think you're right that a Visual Studio plugin
is the way to go. No one familiar with the VS editor
would ever want to learn a horrendous monstrosity like
Emacs .. let alone Vim's archaic terminal editing concepts
(ducks for cover!)

In an industrial setting, having Ocaml as part of a VS
project would be winner.
