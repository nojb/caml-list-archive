Select doesn't work on window pipes. In retrospect sockects
would be the better choice. I stumbled in a strange dead lock
with theses pipes, because under windows the pipe buffer
is set to 1024 bytes (otherlibs/win32unix/pipe.c) and will then
block til the reader reads the contents. IMO this
value (SIZEBUF) should be zero to let the system choose the best
buffer size. [1]

Please supply one.
