                             CUFP 2006
      THE THIRD COMMERCIAL USERS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING WORKSHOP
             "Functional programming as a means, not an end"

                         Portland, Oregon, USA
                         September 21st 2006
                         Co-located with ICFP

Functional languages have been under academic development for over 25  
years,
and are still proving to be very fertile ground for programming language
research. Consequently, most of the development focus of these languages
is driven by academic and theoretical questions. More recently, however,
functional languages have been very successfully used in commercial,
industrial, and government settings, as well as in the open-source  
community.
In these settings, the advantages of functional languages have provided
dramatic leverage.

The goal of CUFP is to act as a voice for commercial users of functional
programming languages and technology. It aims to help functional  
programming
become increasingly viable as a technology for use in the commercial,
industrial, governmental, and open-source space by providing a forum
for FP professionals to share their experiences and ideas, whether  
business,
management or engineering. It also aims to enable the formation and
strengthening of relationships and alliances that further the commercial
use of functional languages. Providing user feedback to language  
designers
and implementors is not a primary goal of the workshop, though it
will be welcome if it occurs.


Program
-------

The meeting will last a full day, with a mix of invited and submitted
presentations, plus discussion sessions.  Confirmed speakers include:

*Richard Cleis* on embedding PLT Scheme in device controllers for the  
Air Force.

*Roope Kaivola* on his work for Intel constructing functional models  
and the verifying hardware against such models using reFLect, Intel's  
reflective functional language.

*J. Garrett Morris* on Aetion Technologies and how they use Haskell  
to rapidly prototype new systems and to develop generic software  
foundations that enable them to extend to new markets quickly.

*Erik Stenman* on Kreditor, a company that successfully sells  
invoicing services to web shops; all of their software is written in  
Erlang.

*Clifford Besher* on his work at Linspire on using functional  
languages for all of their tools and his efforts to promote the use  
of Haskell/FP within the open source community.

*Steve Sims* on Reactive Systems, a company that licenses an  
automated testing tool for embedded software, mostly written in SML.

*Yaron Minsky* on  Jane Street Capital,  a proprietary trading  
company, whose trading systems and infrastructure are all implemented  
in OCaml.

There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to be
more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.
