Hello,

2006/8/1, Joel Reymont <joelr1@gmail.com>:

Could you give a pointer to those slides?

In the original Caml book ("Le Langage Caml",
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/books-eng.html#camlprimer) in
French, you have a description of a short Pascal-like compiler, as
well as a description of a basic Caml type inference system.
Unfortunately, this book is hard to find.

You'll find some interesting information on MinCaml web site and code:
  http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/index-e.html

BTW, I'm also interested in information for wanabee compiler writer.

Best wishes,
d.
