There is a really stupid question I want to ask, I have been searching
online for some days now and couldn't get it answered...

How can you load the whole module hiearchy (many modules, dependent on one
another) with a single command in toploop?

Say I have files a.ml:

  let f x = x - 1

and b.ml:

  let g x y = x + f y - f x


and I compile them into bytecode

  ocamlc -c a.ml
  ocamlc -c b.ml

and then I want to be able to load them into the toploop so that I could
access both modules A and B:

  # let simplify x = B.g x - A.f x


How do I do that?
