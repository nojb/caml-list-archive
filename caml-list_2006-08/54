                    CALL FOR POSTER PRESENTATIONS

   The Fourth ASIAN Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
                             (APLAS 2006)

                       November 8-10, 2006
           University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia

              Deadline for Abstracts: September 11, 2006

APLAS 2006 will include a poster session during the conference.  The
session aims to give students and researchers an opportunity to
present their research to the community, and to get responses from
other researchers.

SCOPE:

Poster presentations are sought in all areas of programming languages
and systems, including (but not limited to):

- semantics, logics, foundational theory
- type systems, language design
- program analysis, optimization, transformation
- software security, safety, verification
- compiler systems, interpreters, abstract machines
- domain-specific languages and systems
- programming tools and environments

FORMAT:

A space of A1 paper size (594 mm wide and 841 mm high) will be
provided for each presentation.  If you need more space, contact the
poster chair (sumii AT ecei DOT tohoku DOT ac DOT jp).  Links that may
be useful for preparing good posters include:

- http://www.kumc.edu/SAH/OTEd/jradel/Poster_Presentations/PstrStart.html
- http://www.siam.org/siamnews/general/poster.htm

REGISTRATION:

Each presenter should e-mail a 1-2 page abstract in PDF or PostScript
to the poster chair (sumii AT ecei DOT tohoku DOT ac DOT jp) by
September 11th, 2006.  The program of the poster session will be
announced by September 22nd, 2006.  We hope to accommodate every
poster, but may restrict presentations (based on relevance and
interest to the community) for the limitation of space.  We may also
need to cancel the session if there are too few presentations.

IMPORTANT DATES:

- 1-2 page abstract submission deadline    September 11, 2006
- notification                             September 22, 2006
- conference                               November 8-10, 2006

For questions or requests, please contact the APLAS 2006 poster chair,
Eijiro Sumii (sumii AT ecei DOT tohoku DOT ac DOT jp).
