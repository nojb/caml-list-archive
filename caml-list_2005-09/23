There is no native Gtk2 port for OS X.  Gtk requires the user to run
an X server under OS X and doesn't provide native look or feel.  For
OS X there's Qt, XUL, wxwidgets, tk, and probably some others I'm not
including.

I'm starting to think this is the most promising direction.  Build it
on top of a cross-platform graphics toolkit like Cairo or SDL, then
handle all the logic in ocaml.  It gives developers a single target to
write for at the expense of (probably) never getting native look and
feel.

Alas, the cross-language cross-platform gui toolkit with native
look-and-feel is a wheel that has yet to be invented.
