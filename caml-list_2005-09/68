Unfortunately, I couldn't connect with this site, but I will venture a 
comment anyway. Since I know nothing about your project, I can only 
respond in the most general terms.

And I imagine the same people who said that would also advise you not to 
use higher-order functions and variant types. Just sacrifice some of 
OCaml's most powerful features for the sake of compatibility ... or 
perhaps we should say (social) conformity. It might be a useful tactic 
in some specific cases, but as a general principle, if you're going to 
do that, why bother with OCaml at all?

Let's assume you had good reasons for choosing OCaml (people who use 
non-mainstream languages usually do). The question then is whether there 
is any practical need for the members of that forum to accept your 
methods. If so, then try again to make your case ... I'm sure there are 
people here who can suggest some "talking points." Otherwise, well, 
innovation has always met with resistance, and probably always will. 
Have confidence in your choices and forge ahead. Or give up. It's your 
choice.

Best of luck with your project.
