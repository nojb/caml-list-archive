@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Euromicro Conference  on Digital  System Design  (DSD) addresses  all aspects of
(embedded) digital and mixed hardware/software system engineering.

It is a discussion forum  for researchers and engineers working  on state-of-the
art investigations, development, and applications.

It  focuses  on  advanced  system,  design,  and  design  automation   concepts,
paradigms, methods  and tools,  as well  as, modern  implementation technologies
that  enable  effective  and efficient  development  of  high-quality (embedded)
systems for important  and demanding applications  in fields such  as (wireless)
communication and networking;  measurement and instrumentation;  health-care and
medicine; military, space, avionic and automotive systems; security; multi-media
and ambient intelligence.

The main areas of interest are the following:

T1: Systems-on-a-chip/in-a-package: generic system platforms and  platform-based
design;  network  on  chip; multi-processors;  system  on  re-configurable chip;
system  FPGAs and  structured ASICs;  rapid prototyping;  asynchronous systems;
power, energy,  timing, predictability  and other  quality issues;  intellectual
property, virtual components and design reuse.

T2: Programmable/re-configurable architectures: processor, communication, memory
and software architectures  with focus on  application specific and/or  embedded
computing,  co-processors;  processing  arrays;  programmable  fabrics; embedded
software; arithmetic, logic and special-operator units. 

T3:  System,  hardware  and   embedded  software  specification,  modeling   and
validation:   design   languages;   functional,   structural   and    parametric
specification and modeling; simulation,  emulation, prototyping, and testing  at
the system, register-transfer, logic  and physical levels; co-simulation  and co
verification.

T4: System, hardware and embedded software synthesis: system,  hardware/software
and  embedded  software  synthesis;  behavioral,  register-transfer,  logic  and
physical  circuit  synthesis;  multi-objective  optimization  observing   power,
performance, communication,  interconnections, layout,  technology, reliability,
robustness,  security, testability  and other  issues; (dynamic)  management of
computational resources,  power, energy  etc.; design  environments for embedded
systems and re-configurable computing.

T5: Emerging technologies, system  paradigms and design methodologies:  optical,
bio,  nano  and quantum  technologies  and computing;  self-organizing  and self
adapting (wireless) systems; wireless sensor networks; ambient intelligence  and
augmented reality; ubiquitous, wearable  and implanted systems; deep  sub-micron
design issues.

T6: Applications of  (embedded) digital systems  with emphasis on  demanding and
new applications  in fields  such as:  (wireless) communication  and networking;
measurement  and  instrumentation; health-care  and  medicine; military,  space,
avionic  and  automotive  systems;  security;  multi-media,  instrumentation and
ambient intelligence;  health-care and  medicine; military,  space, avionic  and
automotive systems; security; multi-media and ambient intelligence.

Special Sessions and Tutorials: 

Proposals for special sessions, pre-conference workshops and tutorials  relevant
to the conference topics are  invited. The deadline for submitting  the proposal
is January 15, 2006.

Panel Sessions and Embedded Tutorials:  

Proposals  for panel  sessions and  embedded tutorials  are especially  welcome.
Please contact Program Chair (venki@dsdconf.org). 

Submission of papers: 

Regular Papers:  Submissions can  be made  that describe  innovative work in the
scope of  the Conference,  and especially,  in any  of the  above main  areas of
interest (please indicate the topic area). Prospective authors are encouraged to
submit their manuscripts for review electronically trough the following web page
(http://www.dsdconf.org/) or by sending the paper to the Program Chair via email
venki@dsdconf.org  (only in  the case  of the  web access  problem) before  the
deadline for submission. Each manuscript should include the complete paper text,
all illustrations, and references. The manuscript should conform to the required
format single-spaced, double column, A4/US letter page size, 10-point size Times
Roman font, up to 8 pages. In order to conduct a blind review, no indication  of
the authors' names should appear in the submitted manuscript. 

Case  Study and  Application Papers:  Submissions can  be made  which report  on
state-of-the-art digital  systems, design  methods and/or  tools, and (embedded)
applications.  Papers  discussing  lessons  learned  from  practical experience,
demanding  or  new  applications,  and  experimental  research  are particularly
encouraged. Manuscripts may be submitted in the same way as regular papers. 

The Program  Committee will  decide if  papers will  be accepted  for a long
presentation (30 minutes), short presentation (15 minutes), or as a  poster.
For long and short presentations, 8 pages will be assigned in the  published
proceedings.  A  poster  presentation  will  be  assigned  4  pages.  Papers
exceeding the page limit will be charged 50 Euro per page in excess. If  the
paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must pre-register and pay the
conference fee before  the deadline for  submitting the camera-ready  paper.
Otherwise the paper will not be published in the proceedings. 

Check List: 
Prospective authors  should check  that the  following information  are included
while submitting the paper(s) for refereeing purpose. 

() The paper and its title page should not contain  the name(s) of the  author(s), 
   or their affiliation  
() The first  page of  the paper  should the  following information  
      * Title of the paper 
      * Track  Area 
      * Conference  topic area (write  the most appropriate  topic area) 
      * Up to six keywords
