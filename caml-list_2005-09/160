Hi,

only,
> but not in the toplevel.

ok. Excuse me for this stupid question (but the error messages are not
clear). My true question is: why does it not work in the toplevel ? Why is
it not possible to load a special Marshal module for the toplevel ? I would
be nice to have your program (in my case, parallel programs) that works
in the toplevel (for debugging) and as compiled programs.

To debug a program, I used many times the toplevel. And in my case, I need
to  serialized functions. In the compiled program, it works but not in the
toplevel. But before have a program which works
I need the toplevel...paradox....
