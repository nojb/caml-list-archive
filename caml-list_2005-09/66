Where is that (even outdated) camlp4 documentation? The current ocaml docs do not containt anything related to camlp4 (except maybe streams).

Also camlp4 doc request was just the second question in my original message - I was able to read the comments in pa_macro.ml. But I was not able to make LOG() macro work. Does anybody have an idea how to achieve that? I think that's not something extraordinary - just the very basic usage.
