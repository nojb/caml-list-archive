Hello,

I'm glad to announce that a lot of development has been done on Cameleon2,
the lablgtk2 port of Cameleon. Well, it is more that a port, since almost
all the code was rewritten.

DBForge was completely rewritten and is not yet fully tested.

Report was rewritten too but remains compatible for binary files, that
is you have to convert your old report files to the new format with:
  report -obin -o foo.rep myfile.tep
  report2.x -ibin -o myfile.rep foo.rep

The Config_file library by Jean-Baptiste Rouquier is used and replace
the Options module.

Topcameleon, the graphical toplevel, is available if you have the compiled
sources of OCaml installed.

OCamlcvs, Configwin, Okey and the documentation browser are only ports to
Lablgtk2.

Zoggy is dead, now we use Glade and lablglade to generate GUI code.

Some utils modules are added.

At last, all Cameleon is based on commands and views as introduced in the
(small) documentation on the web site.

You can have a try, tests and comments are welcome. If you encounter
difficulties, please post on this list so that everybody can follow the
discussions.

The web site is here:
http://home.gna.org/cameleon/

Snapshots are made every night and available here:
http://download.gna.org/cameleon/

A caml-get plugin is available in caml-get:
  http://pauillac.inria.fr/~guesdon/camlget.en.html
It allows the configuration and browsing of your caml-get repositories,
and provides a menu-oriented interface to insert caml-get elements in your
source files.

Enjoy,

-- 
Maxence Guesdon
