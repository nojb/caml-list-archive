This is on my "to do" list.  This port will generate 64-bit binaries
only, but of course the 32-bit Windows port will still be there for
those who need to generate 32-bit binaries.

At this point, the main difficulty in this port is to set up a Win64
development machine.  There are no Win64 machines in my vicinity, and
given the way purchase orders work at INRIA, it's unlikely there will
be one before March 2006.

Also, I could use recommendations and experience return about 64-bit
Windows development tools.  What does Microsoft provides, preferably
for free?  (What is needed: a C compiler, a linker, an assembler, and
import libraries for standard Windows DLLs.)  Where is the reference
manual for the assembler syntax?  (As usual, I couldn't find any
complete description in MSDN.)  Any hints on when x86-64
versions of Mingw and Cygwin will be available?

Feel free to reply privately, as this isn't very topical for caml-list.
