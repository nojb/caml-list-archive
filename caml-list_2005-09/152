We are proud to announce the latest release of the OMake Build System -
OMake version 0.9.6.5.

OMake is a build system, similar to GNU make, but with many additional
features. The home site for OMake is http://omake.metaprl.org/ . OMake
features include:

   o Support for projects spanning several directories or directory
     hierarchies.

   o Comes with a default configuration file providing support for
     OCaml, C and LaTeX projects, or a mixture thereof.
     Often, a configuration file is as simple as a single line

        OCamlProgram(prog, foo bar baz)

     which states that the program "prog" is built from the files
     foo.ml, bar.ml, and baz.ml.

   o Fast, reliable, automated, scriptable dependency analysis using
     MD5 digests.

   o Portability: omake provides a uniform interface on Win32, Cygwin,
     and Unix systems including Linux and OS X.

   o Builtin functions that provide the most common features of programs
     like grep, sed, and awk.  These are especially useful on Win32.

   o Full native support for rules that build several files at once.

   o Active filesystem monitoring, where the build automatically
     restarts whenever you modify a source file.  This can be very
     useful during the edit/compile cycle.

   o A companion command interpreter, osh, that can be used
     interactively.

OMake preserves the style of syntax and rule definitions used in
Makefiles, making it easy to port your project to omake.  There is no
need to code in perl (cons), or Python (scons).  However, there are a
few things to keep in mind:

   1. Indentation is significant, but tabs are not required.
   2. The omake language is functional: functions are first-class
      and there are no side-effects apart from I/O.
   3. Scoping is dynamic.

OMake is licensed under a mixture of the GNU GPL license (OMake engine
itself) and the MIT-like license (default configuration files).

OMake version 0.9.6.5 in mostly a bugfix release. The changes in this
version include:

  - Improved support for configure-style scripts.
  - LaTeX rules improvements.
  - Fixed the "which" function and ocamlfind support under Cygwin.
  - New built-in functions: get-registry (Windows-only), removeprefix,
    html-string.
  - Improved processing of complex shell pipelines.
  - A number of documentation fixes.
  - Numerous other bug fixes and improvements.

For a more verbose change log, please visit
http://omake.metaprl.org/changelog.html#0.9.6.5 .

Source and binary packages of OMake 0.9.6.5 may be downloaded from
http://omake.metaprl.org/download.html . In addition, OMake may be
obtained via the GODI packaging system (3.08 and "dev" branches).

To try it out, run the command "omake --install" in a project directory,
and modify the generated OMakefile.

OMake 0.9.6.5 is still an alpha release.  While we have made an effort
to ensure that it is bug-free, it is possible some functions may not
behave as you would expect.  Please report any comments and/or bugs to
the mailing list omake@metaprl.org and/or at http://bugzilla.metaprl.org/
