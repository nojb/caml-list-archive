A) No I haven't, so judge the following comments with this in mind

B) One of the reasons I don't like Okasaki's $ notation is that it 
represents both suspending the computation and forcing the computation.  I 
often times have trouble figuring out which meaning is meant with any 
given use.  Which I'm wondering might not be your problem- if I have a 
hard time figuring it out, how hard is it going to be for the computer to 
figure it out?
