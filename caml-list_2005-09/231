Hi,

We're trying to figure out how to provide some sort of dynamic linker
for DST to load ocaml native code at runtime on an ocaml native code
kernel.

Is there any document that details the format of .cmi/.cmx files;
also, are these (esp .cmi) able to provide the necessary details on
the symbols in the kernel for building a dynamic linker that can
resolve symbols to kernel functions in ocaml code loaded at runtime?

I know Dynlink module doesn't work with native code, and if I'm
correct, the unsupported Asmdynlink module provided a runtime
environment for bytecode ocaml code in native code programs right?
Which is not what we'd be looking for.

Sorry if my questions come across a bit weird: it's not an easy
subject for me to think about ;-)

Kindest Regards,

Jonathan
