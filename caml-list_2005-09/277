I managed to get dynamic linking for OCaml (i.e. making OCaml producing
DLLs that could then be used by other native code/binaries) to work on
almost all our supported platforms (Linux x86, Windows (2000/XP),
Solaris 2, Mac OS X).
The only platform which I couldn't get to work was Linux AMD64. I tried
to modify the OCaml emitter for AMD64 to accommodate position
independent code using the offset tables, but it was too hard. If anyone
picks up this task, please let us know. As it stands today we cannot use
OCaml for production code.

Follow-up on dynamic linking for native code:

I believed this didn't exist for ocaml, but I just learned that
MetaOCaml does it, at least on x86.
So this is not only possible, but an implementation is available.
(I understand this is partly work in progress.)
