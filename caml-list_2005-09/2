I'll fix that. In my copy Help -> About does, but the entire thing is
built such that it doesn't need to know the version. Unfortunately the
best thing I can do is grab the first line from ocaml.exe... which is
fugly. If the EXE is stamped I'll take out of the NT image headers.

OCamlWinPlus really needs an embedded toplevel. Because piping in that
toplevel is a sonofabitch. I could spruce the thing up big time or
drop it into Eclipse/MSVS if I could step through the toplevel code
wise. Alas I'm not quite sure how to start this.

Personally MingW should come second to MSVS. But I don't think your
'first in PATH' to be correct.

I agree.

CL is the primary on that 'toolchain'. I was unaware of being able to
go around it.

My thoughts, I'll get on the OCamlWinPlus stuff right now.
