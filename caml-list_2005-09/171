Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the release of dynaml 0.6-alpha.  dynaml is a
camlp4 extension to O'Caml which allows values to be typed dynamically
at runtime, rather than statically at compile time.

Dynaml is available from
http://farrand.net/dynaml.shtml

There are plenty of examples in the tutorial, if you want to get an
quick overview of what dynaml can do:
http://farrand.net/dynaml-tutorial.txt

Dynaml is alpha quality, experimental software, and is licensed under
the LGPL with the linking exception.

In this release, the code has been cleaned up a simplified greatly, and
some work has been done on overloading functions.

Regards,
Jim
