Sometimes you can capture enough. Sometimes not enough. The point is
that some of the alternative expansions of S are meaningful in some
contexts and not in others.

Not quite. Remember "semantic actions"? A parser generator like yacc
maps semantics onto a set of strings by recognizing structures generated
by a grammar. We are hardly ever interested in recognizing but almost
always in "semantizing" a string of a language.

I'm not sure what I would write in a generalized grammar framework. What
I definitely sometimes feel the need for is the possibility of selecting
within a semantic action the set of "active" productions which are the
parser is "allowed" to use until further notice. This would allow me to
provide an explicit distinction in cases where contextual
information--implicitly available within the scope of a semantic
action--allows to discriminate any ambiguity in the production rules.
