I have a small request for the Ocaml Windows installers:

There are TWO Windows based Ocaml ports: MinGW and Win32 native
plus the Cygwin port.

Please could the builders of these packages=20
distinguish them??

Make the default install points, desktop icons, menu items,
etc all distinct. Plus, with the OcamlWinPlus thing, make sure
the port/version of Ocaml being used is displayed on the titlebar:=20
even the help/about does not tell you this (hmm .. and 'ocaml'
command should tell you this too)

I have, and need, all three versions of Ocaml installed,
and it is all very confusing, both MingW and native ports
think they own the world and use the same OCAMLLIB variable,
and also both expect themselves to be first in the PATH.

Please don't add the binary directory to the system PATH
without asking, just as for registering Ocaml file types,
please DO ask whether to do this (for installing both
ports .. the answer will be NO in both cases).

For the MinGW port it is required to use Cygwin? the port
doesn't appear to actually work with MSYS (standalone
Mingw tools including gcc/as and bash)?=20

The Windows native version using native code compiler
seems to work provided you have the assembler ML.EXE=20
and ML.ERR installed, but you also seem to need=20
MSVC++ compiler CL.EXE and some .lib and .dll files.

I don't quite understand why CL.EXE is required,
why isn't LINK.EXE good enough? Isn't everything
done via assembler?

Anyhow, helloworld.ml compiles to native code fine using
ML.EXE 6.15, and Visual Studio Pro 2003 versions of=20
CL.EXE plus the required Lib and Dll files.=20

[If someone knows how to fix the PATH variable pls
email me privately .. I forget how to edit=20
environment variables .. :]

--=20
