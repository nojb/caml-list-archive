Okay, I thought that was probably what you meant. And you're probably right.

Yes, using Text for a spreadsheet is pushing the envelope quite a bit. 
It's certainly possible with Canvas. The other option would be to have a 
bunch of Text or Entry widgets laid out with the Grid geometry manager.

Okay, you've got my attention. I've had vague thoughts in that direction 
myself, and it happens that I taught English as a Second Language for a 
few years before getting into geekery. What thoughts do you have about 
the opportunities in that field?

It might be a good idea. My starting point was enlightened 
self-interest: I know Tk and LablTk fairly well, and I perceive that 
LablTk needs some help if it is to remain (become?) useful. Whereas I'm 
almost totally ignorant of OpenGL. It's one of the many things I think I 
ought to learn, but haven't found time.
