Hmm, I'd like to think so. Jef Raskin[*] wrote something to the effect 
that we need better interfaces than what we have now, and something 
better will necessarily be different--with which I heartily agree.

But in terms of "industry acceptance" in the near term ... I've been 
involved in a number of discussions of why Tk is awful (or not), and one 
point that always comes up is that users allegedly don't like Tk apps 
because they look different.
