Great! Thanks. Only a small thing: not many people will have
multiple Camel's installed, but some Felix developers will,
at least whilst we're trying to get all the different build
configurations to work ;(

I'm not even sure why OCAMLLIB is set: the doco claims it isn't
needed for XP. Probably you're right about the PATH thing,
I'm not sure: how does bytecode find ocamlrun?

Well, there is a linker, LINK.EXE .. and an assembler, ML.EXE,
so why would you need a C/C++ compiler if ocamlopt generates
assmebler only?

Anyhow thanks: it's only a minor thing .. but it is very
confusing, especially OCAMLLIB, since it even influences
the Cygwin version of Ocaml (and then can't find Pervasives)
