Why? Hyperthreading allows two completely independent processes
to execute on a hyperthread enabled P4 .. the hardware can already
do it .. even better with dual core.

There is no lack of small scale low level parallelism in 
modern computing systems, just a lack of software that knows
how to take advantage of it.

There are plenty of places in an average program where one
can determine parallel execution would be ok, so it is really
a lack of capability in the software.

I personally don't think of this as real parallelism,
that's something you get on a machine with K's or M's
of processing units .. eg the human eye.
