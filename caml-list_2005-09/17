At present I believe that is correct. However, it doesn't
seem impossible to provide 'dummy' equivalent Debian
packages which you can install with GODI to fool other Debian
packages into believing certain packages are installed
(well, the code *is* installed, just not by Debian).

OTOH, GODI could be a Debian package .. and Debian
packages could be built which install the equivalent
code using GODI.

The question is whether it is worth it: GODI can serve
the heavy Ocaml user on platforms Debian can't=20
(because they're not Debian ..). OTOH a lighter user
would find Debian more convenient. IMHO. So it is good
to have both, and not clear if there would be much
advantage making them interoperate.

A final alternative (what I use, actually), BOTH:=20
Debian does the 'master' install in /usr/*, whilst Godi
installs in /usr/local/godi: by default I am using
the Debian packages, but if I want to play with the
latest CVS Ocaml, I would use GODI, since it knows
when and how to rebuild libraries from source.

I think this is pretty nice, provided under GODI
build I don't accidentally use Debian tool .. which
is possible since they're always in the path.
