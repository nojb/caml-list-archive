Subject: [Caml-list] CfP: Workshop of the 2nd SICSA MultiCore Challenge (n-body problem)

[ -- apologies for multiple copies of this call -- HWL]


		 Call for Participation: Workshop of the 2nd SICSA MultiCore Challenge (n-body problem)
		 ======================================================================================


The goal  of the SICSA  MultiCore challenge is  to bring together  researchers in the  area of parallel  programming, by
implementing one or  more challenge applications on (networks of)  multi-core machines.  The goal is  to learn about the
strengths and  weaknesses of current systems  for parallel programming by  comparing them on a  common application.  The
final workshop will feature  presentations of the individual implementations, assessing both  raw performance as well as
ease of parallelisation and other aspects in the development of this parallel application.

The application chosen for the  second phase of the Challenge is the n-body problem. We  have chosen this problem as the
core component of a realistic application that is  of interest for parallel computation. It offers several approaches to
parallelisation,  and the  web  page giving  the  concrete specification  and  the input  data  discusses the  available
options. Furthermore, sequential implementations  are available for a large number of  programming languages, and linked
from the web page below.

This  workshop provides  a venue  for showing  off the  suitability of  a particular  system to  exploit  parallelism on
multi-core machines. For the broader community it is an  opportunity to get an overview of commonly used systems (a list
of ongoing implementations will be added to the Wiki  page).  Finally, we plan to discuss candidate applications for the
next phase  of the  SICSA MultiCore challenge,  possibly focussing more  closely on  one particular application  area to
high-performance computing.
