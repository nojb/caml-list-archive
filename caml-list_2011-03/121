Not safe.

Your first version of rec2_b is safe: it throws an exception when the "downcast"
fails.  With your second version, anything can happen if the argument is not a
rec2 (program crash, wrong result, silent failure, strange side effects, correct
result, whatever).

Also, as others have noted, the Obj version might actually do more tests than the
proper one (I can't be bothered to check exactly).
