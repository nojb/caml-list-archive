For now, this kind of syntax extension has to be handled directly into
the _tags file of ocamlbuild. There will probably be a native support in
oasis 0.3.0.

The solution for now is, considering that pa_labelscope.cmo and
pa_openin.cmo are provided by the findlib package piqi.camlp4:

[...]
# OASIS_STOP

"myfile.ml": syntax_camlp4o, pkg_piqi.camlp4


Adding this line enables the syntax extension. You should also 
"BuildDepends: piqi", to notify your dependency on the package (but
don't BuildDepends on piqi.syntax, because piqi.syntax is in between a
build tools and build depends).

Cheers,
Sylvain Le Gall
