I think you're simply seeing the underlying difference in handling of EOF between Unix and Windows - files in text mode on Windows are terminated by an EOF character but this is not the case on Unix.

You can make this work by calling set_binary_mode_in stdin before you start but you'll have to handle end-of-line marker differences manually in your code (in my experience of writing cross-platform text processing programs in OCaml, this is necessary anyway as if you read a file on Unix which happens to use Windows end-of-line markers then you probably aren't actually after each line ending with \r which is what you'll get)
