Subject: [Caml-list] Efficient OCaml multicore -- roadmap?

Where does the OCaml team stand on the multicore issues?  A year or so ago, when there was a prototype parallel GC implementation, IIRC, Xavier said it has to be done right.  So what are the official plans and the status of integrating what volunteers had done?

WIth Scala having a robust actors model and AKKA kernel, and Clojure built around efficient shared memory concurrency with agents and references and STM, and Haskell also really parallel, OCaml is lacking behind.  Furthermore, F# builds on strongly parallel .NET, overcoming granddaddy.  With multicores common even in laptops and iPads, we need an efficient  multicore OCaml!  Due to the model different from Haskell or Scala and Clojure, now all on github, OCaml is both more stable and also is slower to advance -- what do folks think about this situation?  How do you do shared memory parallelism now?

Cheers,
Alexy
