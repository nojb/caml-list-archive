Not sure I fully understand, but if you want to take your own source
code and generate an OCaml AST and then OCaml code, you can use
printers.

yziquel@seldon:~/git/ocaml/camlp4/Camlp4Printers$ ls
Camlp4AstDumper.ml    Camlp4NullDumper.ml      Camlp4OCamlPrinter.ml
Camlp4AutoPrinter.ml  Camlp4OCamlAstDumper.ml  Camlp4OCamlRevisedPrinter.ml

Off the top of my head:

Camlp4OCamlPrinter generates standard OCaml code.
Camlp4OCamlOCamlRevisedPrinter generates OCaml code in the revised
syntax.
Camlp4OCamlAstDumper dumps the Ast in a not-so-readable format.
Camlp4AutoPrinter behaves like Camlp4OCamlPrinter when the standard
output is a tty, and as Camlp4OCamlAstDumper otherwise. It's the default
if I'm not mistaken.

That may help to replace OCaml's backend with your own interpreter.
