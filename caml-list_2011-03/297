It's funny, because I'm studying why language succeed or not, for my M1
dissertation (M1 Management), and it's one of the big factor, among others,
of sucess.
Ocaml is highly expressive, so you could turn around, but it's a big
problem.

I think it would be important and interesting to create a little
organization which discuss bout a standard lib and would begin making a
synthesis of all these "standard" library.

It would be very interesting too, to  a lot of company which could take
advantage of the "0 debug" advantages of caml : This fact imply a lot of cut
in software building costs which would be a great advantage for company who
would offer service based on OCaml.

OCaml is now mature, it could be considered out of the laboratory, it thus
become able to cross the chasm :
http://robrozicki.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/crossing_the_chasm1.png

But making a good compiler with a minimal API isn't sufficient.

So, in summary :
- OCaml is ready to cross the chasm, it was too early 10 years ago
- Ocaml need a huge __standard__ API. And there a lot of work to unify about
this
- Ocaml need a standard lib package management, and some good ones exist for
Ocaml
