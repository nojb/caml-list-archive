Subject: Re: [Caml-list] variable sharing

Sorry. It's my mistake. 
not variable sharing, but "value sharing" which means alias.

For example, there is a big set and I want to make many subset of it.
In my thought, if the aliases are made efficiently, the memory explosion does not make sense.
I don't know exactly what's the problem (my programming style, data type, or it is a natural result, etc..).
So I want to know the principle.

Thank you.
