INTRUSO 2011
1st INternational Workshop on TRUstworthy Service-Oriented Computing 
Affiliated with 5th IFIP International Conference on Trust Management 
(IFIPTM'11) Copenhagen, June 27, 2011, Technical University of Denmark

http://www.ifiptm.org/IFIPTM11/INTRUSO11

Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is an emerging paradigm for distributed 
computing aiming at changing the way software applications are designed, 
delivered and consumed. SOC is triggering a radical shift to a vision of 
the Web as a computational fabric where loosely coupled services (such 
as Web services) interact publishing their interfaces inside dedicated 
repositories, where they can be searched by other services or software 
agents, retrieved and invoked, always abstracting from the actual 
implementation. The proliferation of such services is considered the 
second wave of evolution in the Internet age. In order to realize this 
vision and to bring SOC to its full potential, several security 
challenges must still be addressed. In particular, consensus is growing 
that this "service revolution" will not eventuate until we resolve 
trustworthiness?related issues. For instance, lack of consumer trust and 
Web service trustworthiness still represent two critical impediments to 
the success of Web service-oriented systems. Although software 
trustworthiness is a wide topic, far from being an issue only for SOC, 
the intrinsic openness of this vision makes it even more crucial. The 
SOC vision, indeed, faces with a large, open and dynamic 
service-oriented environment where anyone can publish his own (even 
malicious) services. In this scenario, a client (human or software 
agent) faces a dilemma in having to make a choice from a bunch of 
services offering the same functionalities. Thus, selecting the right 
service requires addressing at least two key issues:

1. Discovering the service on the basis of its functionality
2. Evaluating the trustworthiness of the service (how well the service 
will work)

Although concrete applications coping with the first issue are far from 
being widely adopted, the significant effort spent on its investigation 
in the current literature is recognizable (OWL-S and the SOAP/WSDL/UDDI 
Web service framework to mention only some contributions). Instead, 
service trustworthiness is still in its infancy and represents a barrier 
for widening the application of service-oriented technologies. The open 
and dynamic nature of the SOC vision raises new challenges to 
traditional software trustworthiness. Indeed, in a traditional closed 
software system all of its components and their relationships are 
pre-decided before the software runs. Therefore, each component can be 
thoroughly tested as well as its interactions with other components 
before the system starts to run. This is not possible in the SOC vision 
due to its openness and dynamicity. For instance, in the Web service 
dynamic invocation model, it is likely that users may not even know 
which Web services they will use, much less their trustworthiness. 
Traditional dependability techniques, such as correctness proof, fault 
tolerant computing, testing, and evaluation and more in general 
"rigorous software development" might be used to improve the 
trustworthiness of Web services. However, again these techniques have to 
be redesigned to handle the dynamicity and openness of SOC.

The 1st INternational Workshop on TRUstworthy Service-Oriented Computing 
(INTRUSO 2011) aims at bringing together researchers, engineers and 
practitioners interested in all the different aspects of Trustworthiness 
and Dependability in service-oriented environments. Since the overall 
goal of Trustworthy SOC includes the investigation of several 
cross-disciplinary issues such as a deep understanding of trust vs. 
trustworthiness in a service domain, trust-based approaches for service 
rating and selection (reputation systems, recommendation systems, 
referral networks.), service dependability, service 
evaluation/monitoring/testing, etc., a synergy between different 
scientific communities and research disciplines is needed. For this 
reason, although the workshop seems naturally focused on SOC-specific 
issues, contributions from different disciplines such as philosophy, 
sociology, psychology, communication sciences, as well as from computer 
science specific sub-disciplines such as software engineering and 
dependability are welcomed and encouraged.

The workshop is expected to stimulate discussions about the future 
development of appropriate models, methods, notations, languages and 
tools for building a variety of trustworthy service-oriented systems.

Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:

* Trust and trustworthiness in the Web service domain
* Trust-based approaches for Web service rating and selection 
(reputation systems, recommendation systems, referral networks, .)
* Trust negotiation for Web services
* Service monitoring and testing
* Service dependability
* Fault-tolerant mechanisms for SOC
* Security for SOC
* Architectures for trustworthy SOC
* Software engineering methodologies for trustworthy SOC (e.g., 
deployment life cycle for trustworthy services)
* Policy assurance for trustworthy SOC
* Formal methods and frameworks for trustworthy services
* Quality of Service (QoS) for service discovering and trustworthiness
* Case studies on trustworthy SOC
* Industrial experiences in the adoption of trust-based approaches for SOC
* Rigorous Software Development to ensure service trustworthiness

Submitted full papers must not exceed 16 pages in length, including 
bibliography and well-marked appendices. Papers can be submitted using 
the following link on EasyChair:

https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=intruso2011

Please use the LNCS templates and style files available from:

http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0.

Submitted papers will be evaluated by the program committee and chosen 
for presentation based on their scientific contribution and relevance to 
the topics of the workshop. At least one author of each accepted paper 
must register to the workshop and participate presenting the paper.

The collection of the accepted papers of all the IFIPTM workshops will 
be published in a technical report at Technical University of Denmark 
(DTU). We already agreed with the editor of an international journal to 
have a special issue in November 2011 with extended versions of best 
papers selected from IFIPTM workshops.
