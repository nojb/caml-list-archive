Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Re: Arithmetic operations

Selling cars without tires !

This is a huge problem of the ocaml community. Who wants a minimal  
library ?
What makes other languages popular ? There are huge API.
For Ocaml, the main web site is just for the compiler, the ocaml hump  
is refreshed
each month with few new things. So I need to use as well godi (another  
web site),
batteries (still in progress, another web site), janestreet (another  
solution, another
web site). Everybody is making is own api, which is not very  
interesting for the end user.

When I use python or latex, eveything is centralized, I pick the  
packages I need, and all is done.
Ocaml situation would be understandable if this was something new, but  
after 15 years, it's just
the french way : "We have good ideas, but we don't care how to sell  
them".
And this must be a reason why ocaml community is still small.
