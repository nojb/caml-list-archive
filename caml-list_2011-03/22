                     FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

                                   ATE-2011
                       CADE23 Workshop on
                 Automated Theory Engineering
                             (31. July 2011)

                    Deadline: 29 April 2011
                http://www.nicta.com.au/ate2011/


GENERAL INFORMATION
   The first Workshop on Automated Theory Engineering will
   be held in July 2011 in Wroclaw. It is associated  with
   the 23th International Conference on Automated Deduction
   (CADE23).


SCOPE
   Theory engineering  means the development and mechanisation
   of mathematical axioms, definitions, theorems and inference
   procedures as needed to cover the essential concepts and
   analysis tasks of an application domain. It is essential for
   the  qualitative and quantitative modelling and  analysis of
   computing systems. The aim of the workshop is to present users
   with lightweight domain specific modelling languages, and to
   devolve the technical intricacies of analysis tasks as far as
   possible to tools that provide heavyweight automation.

   The workshop brings together tool and theory developers with
   industrial engineers to exchange  experiences and ideas that
   stimulate further tool developments and theory designs. A main
   goal is the creation of a repository of case studies that
   allows developers to test and improve their theories and tools.



TOPICS
   Theory engineering is relevant to the design of systems, programs,
   APIs, protocols, algorithms, design patterns, specification
   languages, programming languages and beyond.  It involves technology
   such as  ITP systems, ATP systems, SAT/SMT solvers, model checkers
   and decision procedures. Specific topics of the workshop include,
   but are not limited to:
     o  qualitative and quantitative modelling and  analysis
     o  formal specification and verification
     o  domain specific models, languages and solvers
     o  theorem proving technology for theory engineering
     o  integration of theories and tools
     o  applications of mechanised reasoning to formal modelling
     o  industrial case studies/experiences

   We especially invite industrial contributions from the areas of
   network protocols and concurrent systems, but any submission on
   the topics outlined  is very welcome.

INVITED SPEAKER
   o  Timothy Griffin, University of Cambridge, UK
   o  TBA

SUBMISSIONS
   Submission of papers for presentation at the workshop are now
   invited. Submissions are limited to 10 pages,  but shorter extended
   abstracts are welcome. All papers will be reviewed by the programme
   committee, and a balanced programme will be selected based on
   relevance and technical soundness. Submissions must  be in PDF
   using the LaTeX EasyChair-format http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip
.
   Accepted papers will be published as CEUR Workshop Proceedings.

   If quality and quantity of the submissions warrants this, we
   plan to publish a special issue of a recognized journal on the
   topic of the workshop.


IMPORTANT DATES:
   Submission:    29 April 2011
   Notification:    30 May 2011
   Final version:   1 July 2011
   Workshop:       31 July 2011
