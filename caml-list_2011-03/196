Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Java JVM is becoming more strict


Then you should never use standard pipes within a Windows GUI 
application unless you're 100% sure that a console will always be 
available (either attached or allocated).

Some systems have issues when standard pipes are incorrectly used, 
others do not. I'm not sure which setting triggers this behavior. 
However, JAVA is not to blame here.
