GOOD DAY,



HOW ARE YOU DOING ? HOPE FINE.



MY NAME IS REV.AUSTIN, I AND MY WIFE AND 3 KIDS ARE ON A CHRISTIAN MISSION TO AFRICA AND I CAME ALONG WITH MY 2 BEAUTIFUL WHITE MALTESE PUPPIES BOTH MALE AND FEMALE.  AFTER A WHILE WE NOTICED THAT THE AFRICAN WEATHER IS NOT GOOD FOR THERE HEALTH AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM THE WAY I ALWAYS DO, BECAUSE OF MY JOB.



THEY ARE A KC REGISTERED. HOME RAISED,VACCINES & HEALTH GUARANTEE AND ALSO GO ALONG WITH OTHER ANIMALS AND KIDS,THEY ALSO COME WITH TRAVEL CRATE AND TOYS. I NEED SOMEONE TO ADOPT THEM FREE AND TAKE CARE OF THEM THE WAY I ALWAYS DO.



IF YOU CAN TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM, DO SEND A REPLY AND I WILL EMAIL YOU WITH MORE INFO.



I HOPE TO READ FROM YOU.



GOD BLESS YOU.



REV AUSTIN.
