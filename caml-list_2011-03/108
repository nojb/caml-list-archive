Subject: [Caml-list] [CAV 2011] Call for Workshop Submissions

We are pleased to announce an exciting set of workshops co-located with
23rd International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (CAV) 2011. CAV
2011 Workshops will be held before the main conference on July 14 and
15. Please considering submitting papers and participating in the CAV
workshops.

(CAV Workshops Chair)

*** apologies for multiple postings ***

The following workshops are soliciting original papers in various
domains.  Please go to the workshop webpage for additional details on
paper submissions and topics of interest. The workshops will also
feature talks from invited speakers.

NSV 2011: Fourth International Workshop on Numerical Software
							Verification
********************************************************************

The NSV workshop is dedicated to the current development and future
prospects on applying logical and mathematical techniques for
reasoning about numerical aspects of software. The workshop will also
be an occasion to discuss robustness of software and systems under
uncertainty of values and numerical perturbations, which is a central
issue in numerical methods and robust control

Deadline for submission of full papers: March 31, 2011
Workshop: July 14, 2011

********************************************************************
SPIN 2011: 18th International SPIN Workshop on Model Checking of
							Software
********************************************************************

The SPIN workshop is a forum for practitioners and researchers
interested in state space-based techniques for the validation and
analysis of software systems. Theoretical techniques and empirical
evaluations based on explicit representations of state spaces, as
implemented in the SPIN model checker or other tools, or techniques
based on combination of explicit representations with other
representations, are the focus of this workshop.

Workshop: July 14-15, 2011


********************************************************************
CA-CAV 2011: Computer Algebra in Computer-Aided Design and
							Verification
********************************************************************

This workshop aims to bring together researchers in computer algebra
tools community and researchers who apply these tools for verification
to discuss their ideas, implementations and challenges. It invites
researchers from different application domains to discuss how
computer-algebra techniques can be integrated within theorem-provers
and SMT-solvers.

********************************************************************
FAC 2011: Frontiers in Analog Circuit (FAC) Synthesis and
						 Verification
********************************************************************


While digital design is supported by a plethora of EDA tools, the
development of analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits has lagged behind,
remaining essentially an ad-hoc and artistic activity.  With the
advent of embedded systems-on-chip, this state of affairs puts the
development of analog sub-systems (necessary for all interactions with
the physical world) in the critical path of new product development
and the semi-conductor industry now realizes that it needs more
advanced CAD tools for simulation, verification, test, design-space
exploration, model reduction, synthesis and integration with digital
sub-systems. The goal of this workshop is to bring together analog
designers, EDA tool providers, and researchers from the relevant
disciplines (verification, simulation, control) to advance the state-
of-the-art of AMS synthesis and verification.

SMT 2011: International Workshop on Satisfiability Modulo Theories

********************************************************************

The aim of the SMT 2011 workshop is to bring together researchers
working on SMT and users of SMT solvers. Topics of interest include
but not limited to new theories, decision procedures, novel
implementation techniques, applications, and evaluation techniques.

(EC)^2 2011: Exploiting Concurrency Efficiently and Correctly

********************************************************************


While developing tools for verifying and debugging concurrent systems
has been an important theme at CAV, we believe that formal methods
research can go beyond checking existing code/systems, and play a role
in identifying the "right" abstractions for concurrency. The goal of
this workshop is to bring together CAV researchers with experts who
are involved in developing multicore architectures, programming
languages, and concurrency libraries.

********************************************************************
PDMC 2011: 10th International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed
					methods in VerifiCation
********************************************************************

The aim of the PDMC workshop series is to cover all aspects related to
the verification and analysis of very large and complex systems, in
particular in using methods and techniques that exploit current
hardware architectures. The PDMC workshop aims to provide a working
forum for presenting, sharing, and discussing recent achievements in
the field of high-performance verification

http://pdmc.cz/PDMC11/

Deadline for submission of full papers: May 16, 2011
Workshop: July 14, 2011



The following workshops are not soliciting papers, but, will feature
talks from invited speakers who are leaders in the respective areas.

********************************************************************

FM-R 2011: Formal Methods for Robotics and Automation

********************************************************************


The goal of this workshop is to start a dialog between robotics
researchers and the formal methods community. We aim to present the
specific challenges, the current approaches in robotics (such as the
use of temporal logics to specify tasks, correct by construction
controllers, etc) and explore how ideas from these two disjoint
communities can be used in this specific domain.

PSY 2011: Practical Synthesis for Concurrent Systems

********************************************************************

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers to exchange
and develop new ideas in all aspects of formal program synthesis, with
emphasis on concurrent systems. The workshop will feature invited
talks from a wide spectrum of areas, ranging from basic theory to
applied practical work.
