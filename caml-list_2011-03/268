SCOPE

The Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems (WWV)
is a yearly workshop that aims at providing an interdisciplinary forum to facilitate
the cross-fertilization and the advancement of hybrid methods that exploit concepts
and tools drawn from Rule-based programming, Software engineering, Formal methods
and Web-oriented research.

Nowadays, many companies and institutions have diverted their Web sites into interactive,
completely-automated, Web-based applications for, e.g., e-business, e-learning, e-government
and e-health. The increased complexity and the explosive growth of Web systems has made their
design and implementation a challenging task. Systematic, formal approaches to their
specification and verification can permit to address the problems of this specific domain
by means of automated and effective techniques and tools.

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to:
- Rule-based approaches to Web system analysis, certification, specification, verification, and optimization.
- Languages and models for programming and designing Web systems.
- Formal methods for describing and reasoning about Web systems.
- Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems.
- Analysis and verification of linked data.
- Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to the semantic Web.
- Intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web specifications authoring.
- Middleware and frameworks for composition and orchestration of Web services.
- Web quality and Web metrics.
- Web usability and accessibility.
- Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications.



INVITED SPEAKER

Elie Najm		Telecom ParisTech, France



SUBMISSION

Submitted papers should present original unpublished work and cannot be
under review for publication elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a thorough
evaluation by at least three reviewers, chosen by the Program Committee.
Contributions should be in PDF format and prepared in LaTeX using the
EPTCS-style format (http://style.eptcs.org/) and should not exceed 15 pages (typeset 11 points).

Submissions are handled using the EasyChair online system and
can be uploaded using the following link:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wwv2011

Submission is a firm commitment that at least one of the authors
will attend the conference, if the paper is accepted.



PUBLICATION

Accepted papers will be included in the pre-proceedings,
which will be made available in electronic form through the WWV web site.
After the workshop, authors of accepted papers will be asked to prepare,
by incorporating insights gathered during the event, a final version of
their paper to be published in the post-proceedings.

Workshop post-proceedings will be published as a volume of the
EPTCS (Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, http://eptcs.org/) series.

An open call for a special high-quality journal issue on the topic
of the WWV workshop is envisaged.
