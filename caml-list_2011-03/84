SCOPE

The Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems (WW=
V) is a yearly workshop that aims at providing an interdisciplinary forum t=
o facilitate the cross-fertilization and the advancement of hybrid methods =
that exploit concepts and tools drawn from Rule-based programming, Software=
 engineering, Formal methods and Web-oriented research.

Nowadays, many companies and institutions have diverted their Web sites int=
o interactive, completely-automated, Web-based applications for, e.g., e-bu=
siness, e-learning, e-government and e-health. The increased complexity and=
 the explosive growth of Web systems has made their design and implementati=
on a challenging task. Systematic, formal approaches to their specification=
 and verification can permit to address the problems of this specific domai=
n by means of automated and effective techniques and tools.

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limit=
ed to:
- Rule-based approaches to Web system analysis, certification, specificatio=
n, verification, and optimization.
- Languages and models for programming and designing Web systems.
- Formal methods for describing and reasoning about Web systems.
- Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems.
- Analysis and verification of linked data.
- Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to the semanti=
c Web.
- Intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web specifications authorin=
g.
- Middleware and frameworks for composition and orchestration of Web servic=
es.
- Web quality and Web metrics.
- Web usability and accessibility.
- Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications.



INVITED SPEAKER

Elie Najm		Telecom ParisTech, France



SUBMISSION=20

Submitted papers should present original unpublished work and cannot be und=
er review for publication elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a thorough eva=
luation by at least three reviewers, chosen by the Program Committee.=20
Contributions should be in PDF format and prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS=
-style format (http://style.eptcs.org/) and should not exceed 15 pages (typ=
eset 11 points).

Submissions are handled using the EasyChair online system and can be upload=
ed using the following link:

Submission is a firm commitment that at least one of the authors will atten=
d the conference, if the paper is accepted.



PUBLICATION=20

Accepted papers will be included in the pre-proceedings, which will be made=
 available in electronic form through the WWV web site.=20
After the workshop, authors of accepted papers will be asked to prepare, by=
 incorporating insights gathered during the event, a final version of their=
 paper to be published in the post-proceedings.

Workshop post-proceedings will be published as a volume of the EPTCS (Elect=
ronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science, http://eptcs.org/) serie=
s.

An open call for a special high-quality journal issue on the topic of the W=
WV workshop is envisaged.
