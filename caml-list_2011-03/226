Nice. What will be the use? (if there is any upper level project
unless adding a feature for the library was the only goal right now?)

Indeed. About these endless optimization... I had another response
(not made it to the list) with a link to uuidm code (also
implementation a native Ocaml SHA1). I saw it uses Char.unsafe_chr
instead of Char.chr. I didn't know this function, checked the source
of ocaml, saw it is indeed in the interface but hidden behind (**/**)
(so it did not appear in the doc).

In my benchmark, I think it improves a little, but barely (enough so
that I am not fully sure if the improvement I see is the randomness of
consecutive benchmark tests). Still I keep it (as you say, endless
optimizations: that's mostly when you don't know what else to do) as
my code already makes sure that the code I pass to make a char is
valid. But I wonder if this hidden function is meant to disappear some
day... Is there some official status about this function?

I see. So that's a limitation of the Ocaml compiler or is it anyway
very difficult to have control on this kind of thing?

Yes I was thinking for quite some time (I mean, some days as this code
is a few days old anyway) to try a int implementation when the
platform is 64 bits (masking over 4 bytes). I just decided to do so
yesterday. And it divides the benchmark time by 2.

On the small 64 bits machine I have access (slow but slightly faster
than my netbook), my Int32 implementation was running my benchmark in
0.25 seconds, and the int implementation of the same code otherwise in
0.12 seconds! So now I make some conditional implementation with
macros so that I use int on 64 bits platform and the generic Int32 on
32 bits (or if I can't detect for sure I am on 64 bits).

But the C implementation must have made some crazy optimization in
assembly for 64 bits platform because they run in around 0.008
seconds! So they are like 15 times faster now from my Ocaml
implementation when it uses int!

Oh and to come back to macros (using pa_macro with camlp4o), why is
int validity checked by camlp4?!
I had some tests like this:

IFNDEF ARCH_64 THEN
        0x8F1BBCDCl
ELSE
        0x8F1BBCDC
ENDIF

Then when on a 32 bits machine, this stupid camlp4 ends in error
because 0x8F1BBCDC is over max_int! But that's why I do the IFDEF
test! Why does it ever bother checking this? I thought camlp4 was only
about syntax, not about code validation. If camlp4 was to only do its
job and pass the code to the compiler, this one would tell me if I
really made an int error (which was not the case).
Anyway that's not nice, I had to pass these int values as additional
macros instead which is not pretty in my opinion.

I see. Still I am pretty happy of my code right now. It is not as good
as OpenSSL, but that's still pretty good when you think of it. I am
still doing 10.000 computations now in around 0.1 second on very weak
machines (even my notebook which does not read most videos well, I
have now optimized down to around 0.35 seconds).

I think I'll stop here for my sha1 implementation (unless someone
points me to some really neat improvement I did not see). I am happy
with it. :-)

Thanks all!
