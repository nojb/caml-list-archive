Subject: [Caml-list] ODNS version 0.3 release

Hi all,

I just wanted to announce the release of ODNS version 3. Many changes,
but probably among the most interesting are a runtime cache using the
time to live of resource records (the use of the cache is thread-safe,
which means you can have several resolvers making queries in
concurrencies, all will use the same cache without conflicting), also
some nice improvements on the helpers (using some multi-thread to make
several DNS queries at once) and various configuration related new
possibilities.

All details in the release note:
http://odns.tuxfamily.org/2011/03/02/odns-and-ring-version-0-3/

I plan still many interesting improvements for a 0.4.
See you then!

Jehan
