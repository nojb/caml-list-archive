Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Netamqp, a client for AMQP-0-9-1

Hi,

the ocaml team at Mylife is proud to release another library to the
public: Netamqp is a client of the AMQP-0-9-1 protocol which is used to
talk to message queue servers. Netamqp is an independent implementation
of such a client, and not simply a wrapper around a C library.  Netamqp
has been tested against RabbitMQ.

Message queues are another way of establishing communication paths
between independent processes. The nice aspect about this architecture
is that message queues form a store-and-forward network: Each
participant is only a client of the central store, and is not required
to permanently check for the arrival of input. Messages arriving when
the client cannot pay attention are preserved in the queue. This makes
message queue networks very robust and easy to operate. The downside is
that there is a single point of failure, namely the queue server.

Messages are just strings of any length. AMQP does not attempt to define
a serialization format.

The Netamqp client allows synchronous and asynchronous message
processing, the latter with the help of Ocamlnet's event loop.

The homepage is at: http://oss.wink.com/netamqp/. See there for download
links, and the online manual.

There is a GODI package for Ocaml 3.12: godi-netamqp.
