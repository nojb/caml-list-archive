============================================================

                      Call for papers
               21th International Symposium on
       Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                         LOPSTR 2011

             http://users.dsic.upv.es/~lopstr11/
            Odense, Denmark, July 18-20, 2011
     (co-located with PPDP 2011, AAIP 2011 and WFLP 2011)

============================================================

Objectives:

The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 21st International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2011) will be held in Odense, Denmark; previous
symposia were held in Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,
London, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,
Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester (you
might have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR symposia). LOPSTR
2011 will be co-located with PPDP 2011 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).


Topics:

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development,
all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-
in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing
applications in these areas are especially welcome. Contributions are
welcome on all aspects of logic-based program development, including,
but not limited to:

- specification
- synthesis
- verification
- transformation
- analysis
- optimisation
- specialization
- partial evaluation
- inversion
- composition
- program/model manipulation
- certification
- security
- transformational techniques in SE
- applications and tools

Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application  papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe
original work, be written and presented  in English, and must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed
proceedings. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.

Following past editions, the formal post-conference proceedings will
be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series.


IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:


- Paper submission: March 27,  2011
- Extended abstract submission: April 3, 2011
- Notification (for pre-proceedings): May 16, 2011
- Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings): June 12, 2011
- Symposium: July 18-20, 2011


Submissions can either be (short) extended abstracts or (full) papers
whose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages (including references),
respectively. Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science style (excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication). Referees are not required to read the appendices,
and thus papers should be intelligible without them. Short papers may
describe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.

Both short and full papers can be accepted for presentation at the
symposium and will then appear in the LOPSTR 2011
pre-proceedings. Full papers can also be immediately accepted for
publication in the formal proceedings to be published by Springer
in the LNCS series. In addition, after the symposium, the programme
committee will select further short or full papers presented
in LOPSTR 2011 to be considered for formal publication. These authors
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the
light of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then after another
round of reviewing, these revised papers can also be published in the
formal proceedings.
