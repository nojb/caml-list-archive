The problem is not the packaging of the software. Actually, we are doing
quite well, given that multiple organizations and individuals feel
responsible.

What is really French thinking is that centralism is good, btw. The
current situation is at least supporting some competition between
solutions. Whether there is one or several APIs is irrelevant as long as
they can be used together. In some sense, this is the "Linux" way of
doing it - only the core of the system is centralized, and for
everything else there is a free market.

We are not living in a time where it is easy to make a language popular.
If you are a company, you have to spend 100 of millions to make this
happen (see what Sun and Microsoft had to spend for their platforms).
And most of that goes into marketing, i.e. paying people for constantly
praising the product.

The main reason why the Ocaml community is small: Functional programming
is not widely taught at Universities (worldwide). Because of this, it
can still be ignored by the industry (remember the industry depends on
the knowledge of the graduates - and it's the graduates who create the
market for jobs, contrary to their own reception of the situation).
