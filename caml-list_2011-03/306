Xavier Leroy has already said, for example during the former OCaml Meetings,
that they would be happy to link to a more complete "OCaml distribution"
provided by the community, including the core "INRIA lib" and some more. I
think there is no clear consensus right now on what that would be, and
that's why it hasn't been done yet, but there are several orthogonal efforts
in that direction (more on that later).

Batteries is meant to be an extension of INRIA's stdlib, as a continuation
of the [Extlib] effort. Great care is taken that a code using the existing
standard library should be able to replace it with Batteries without
changing a line of code. If something breaks when converting to batteries,
it should be filed as a bug.

 [Extlib] http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/

The Core library from Jane Street has liberated itself from this
conservative position. Programs should be written directly using Core, and
it is not in principle easy to transition from INRIA's stdlib to Core (of
course you could include both and be careful to avoid conflicts with
"open"). The advantages are plenty: it allows Janestreet to provide a
coherent set of packages and make different design choices (arguably some
aspects of INRIA's stdlib are more "non choices"). On the other hand, it
means that direct "synthesis" of both efforts (Core and Batteries) is not
likely. There is also the difference that Batteries is a community-driven
effort, while Core is more internal to Jane Street; they would probably
welcome contributions, but their internal code is naturally their top
priority, and the external release model has been rather sporadic for now.

After the first OCaml Meeting, there has been some discussion on the Cocan
Wiki, but I think the site is down currently.

Sylvain Le Gall has been working on a CPAN-like repository for OCaml, using
his "oasis" distribution tool:
   http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/oasis-db.html

Sylvain has been doing great work for the OCaml community for some years.
With the help of other tools (ocamlfind, godi, ocamlbuild...), the Ocamlcore
Forge, etc., it is now more and more easy to use, share and deploy OCaml
code. Of course, there still are a lot of rough edges, but the only way to
go further is that the community (yes, you!) try to use those tools,
popularize them, and also report feedback on what could be improved.

For a very long time, using OCaml has been a joyful but solitary activity.
If you want a more vibrant community, the only thing to do is to do your
part of the work as you would need the others to do. Set a standard, so that
things that are now rare are taken for granted in the future. Nobody, except
maybe Sylvain, has the devotion to work full-time on the small details that
will improve things in the long run, and this is ok. Yes, writing an oasis
file (or even a META) or contributing an obvious function to Batteries is
tedious and certainly less sexy that a lot of things you're working on. But
this won't happen magically.
