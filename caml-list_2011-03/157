Subject: [Caml-list] CUFP 2011: call for presentations

Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop (CUFP) 2011
Call for Presentations

Sponsored by SIGPLAN
Co-located with ICFP 2011

Tokyo, Japan
Sep 22-24

Proposal Submission Deadline: 15 June 2011

Functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic
research for over 35 years, and they have seen an ever larger practical
impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial firms to
biomedical research labs. At the same time, a vigorous community of
programmers employing functional languages has come into existence.

CUFP is designed to serve this community. The annual CUFP workshop is a
place where people can see how others are using functional programming
to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and collaborate;
where language designers and users can share ideas about the future of
their favorite language; and where one can learn practical techniques
and approaches for putting functional programming to work.

# Giving a CUFP Talk

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical setting,
we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the workshop. We're
looking for two kinds of talks:

*Experience reports* are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to inform
participants about how functional programming plays out in real-world
applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights
gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical; reflections
on the commercial, management, or software engineering aspects are,
if anything, more important.

*Technical talks* are also 25 minutes long, and should focus on teaching the
audience something about a particular technique or methodology, from the
point of view of someone who has seen it play out in practice. These talks
could cover anything from techniques for building functional concurrent
applications, to managing dynamic reconfigurations, to design recipes for
using types effectively in large-scale applications. While these talks
will often be based on a particular language, they should be accessible
to a broad range of programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone
to do so, send an e-mail to avsm2(at)cl(dot)cam(dot)ac(dot)uk or
yminsky(at)janestreet(dot)com by 15 June 2011 with a short description
of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should
give a talk about. Such descriptions should be about one page long.

There will be a short scribes report of the presentations and discussions
but not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting is intended
to be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange. You do not
need to submit a paper, just a proposal for your talk!
