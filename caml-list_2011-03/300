Your view of Ocaml is skewed by your choice of the Apple OS. On
Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora, a large number
of libraries are available via the distro's packaging system.

I'm running Debian and there are well over 100 Ocaml library 
packages available for installation using apt-get.
