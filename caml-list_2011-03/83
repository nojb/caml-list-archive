                           Call for Papers

                             FMICS 2011

                  16th International Workshop on
            Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems
               http://events.fortiss.org/fmics2011/

                  August 29/30, 2011, Trento, Italy

                       Co-located with RE 2011

====================================================================

Scope

The aim of the FMICS workshop series is to provide a forum for
researchers who are interested in the development and application of
formal methods in industry. In particular, FMICS brings together
scientists and engineers that are active in the area of formal
methods and interested in exchanging their experiences in the
industrial usage of these methods. The FMICS workshop series also
strives to promote research and development for the improvement of
formal methods and tools for industrial applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

        * Design, specification, code generation and testing based on
          formal methods.

        * Methods, techniques and tools to support automated analysis,
          certification, debugging, learning, optimization and
          transformation of complex, distributed, real-time systems
          and embedded systems.

        * Verification and validation methods that address
          shortcomings of existing methods with respect to their
          industrial applicability (e.g., scalability and usability
          issues).

        * Tools for the development of formal design descriptions.

        * Case studies and experience reports on industrial
          applications of formal methods, focusing on lessons learned
          or identification of new research directions.

        * Impact of the adoption of formal methods on the development
          process and associated costs.

        * Application of formal methods in standardization and
          industrial forums.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Dates

    * Abstract submission: March 18th, 2011

    * Paper submission: March 25th, 2011

    * Notification: May 6th, 2011

    * Final version due: May 20th, 2011

    * Workshop: August 29th-30th, 2011

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Paper Submission

    Submissions must describe authors' original research work and
    their results. Contributions should not exceed 15 pages formatted
    according to the LNCS style (Springer), and should be submitted as
    Portable Document Format (PDF) files using the EasyChair
    submission site:

    https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=fmics11

    Submitting an abstract does not put any obligation on the authors
    to submit a full paper. Abstracts without an accompanying full
    paper by the paper submission deadline are automatically
    considered withdrawn; the authors are, however, encouraged to
    explicitly withdraw their abstract, if they decide not to submit a
    full paper.

    All submissions must report on original research. Submitted papers
    must not have previously appeared in a journal or conference with
    published proceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to
    any other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference or
    archival journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or
    concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.

    Submissions should clearly demonstrate relevance to industrial
    application. Case study papers should identify lessons learned,
    validate theoretical results (such as scalability of methods), or
    provide specific motivation for further research and development.

    All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee who
    will make a selection among the submissions based on
    the novelty, soundness and applicability of the presented ideas
    and results. A printed version of the proceedings will be
    distributed among participants during the workshop. The
    proceedings of the workshop will be published the Springer series
    Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

    Participants will give a presentation of their papers in twenty
    minutes, followed by a ten-minute round of questions and
    discussion on participants' work.

    Following the tradition of the past edition, a special issue of an
    international scientific journal will be devoted to FMICS
    2011. Selected participants will be invited to submit an extended
    version of their papers after the workshop. These extended
    versions will again be reviewed by a program committee,
    which will decide on their final publication on the special
    issue. In the last few editions of FMICS, a special issue of
    Science of Computer Programming or STTT has been dedicated to this
    workshop and we similarly plan to devote a special issue of one of
    these journals to FMICS 2011.
