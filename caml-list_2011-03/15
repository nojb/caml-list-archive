Call for Papers

20th International Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic Programming
WFLP 2011
Odense, Denmark
July 19, 2011
Co-located with PPDP 2011, LOPSTR 2011, AAIP 2011

===============================================================================
Conference Overview:

The 20th International Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic 
Programming will
take place in July 2011 in Odense, Denmark.
The Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic Programming aims at 
bringing together
researchers interested in functional programming, (constraint) logic 
programming, as well as
the integration of the two paradigms. It promotes the cross-fertilizing 
exchange of ideas and
experiences among researchers and students from the different 
communities interested in the
foundations, applications and combinations of high-level, declarative 
programming languages
and related areas.

WFLP 2011 solicits papers in all areas of functional and (constraint) 
logic programming,
including but not limited to:
• Foundations: formal semantics, rewriting and narrowing, non-monotonic 
reasoning,
dynamics, type theory
• Language Design: modules and type systems, multi-paradigm languages, 
concurrency
and distribution
• Implementation: abstract machines, parallelism, compile-time and run-time
optimizations, interfacing with external
• Transformation and Analysis: abstract interpretation, specialization, 
partial evaluation,
program transformation, meta-programming
• Software Engineering: design patterns, specification, verification and 
validation,
debugging, test generation
• Integration of Paradigms: integration of declarative programming with 
other
paradigms such as imperative, object-oriented, concurrent, and real-time 
programming
• Applications: declarative programming in education and industry, 
domain-specific
languages, visual/graphical user interfaces, embedded systems, WWW 
applications,
knowledge representation and machine learning, deductive databases, advanced
programming environments and tools

The previous WFLP editions were: WFLP 2010 (Madrid, Spain), WFLP 2009 
(Brasilia,
Brazil), WFLP 2008 (Siena, Italy), WFLP 2007 (Paris, France), WFLP 2006 
(Madrid, Spain),
WCFLP 2005 (Tallinn, Estonia), WFLP 2004 (Aachen, Germany), WFLP 2003

This year the workshop will be colocated with the 13th International 
Symposium on
Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP 2011), the 22st 
International
Symposium on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 
2011), and the
International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive 
Programming (AAIP
2011).


Proceedings:

The proceedings will be published in the LNCS series of Springer-Verlag.


Important Dates:

Submission of abstract: April 9, 2011
Paper submission: April 10, 2011
Notification: May 1, 2011
Camera-ready: May 10, 2011
Workshop: July 19, 2011


Submission Guidelines:

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in English, 
and must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are 
simultaneously
submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed 
proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may 
be submitted
(please contact the PC chair in case of questions).
Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF. 
Papers should be
submitted via the submission website for WFLP 2011 at
http://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/pi/konferenzen/wflp2011/wflp2011.htm
Papers should consist of up to 15 pages under the LNCS formatting 
guidelines. These
guidelines are available at http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/ 
(follow link for LNCS
authors) along with formatting templates and style files.
Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, 
correctness,
originality, and clarity. They should include a clear identification of 
what has been
accomplished and why it is significant.
