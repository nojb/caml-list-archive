Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Unix.Unix_error(31, "write", "") raised from
 format.ml!? This is not right.

I eat my words. :( I was doing the Printexc.get_backtrace () call
immediately after a printf statement (printing information about the
exception), so I got a stack for that instead!

Sorry for the noise!
