Now I think I'm seeing what you was refering to.
This problem seams to be general to ocaml. For instance, if I have
a directory foo with object files bar.cmo and cmi in it, then from
ocaml:

# #load "foo/bar.cmo";;
# module X = Bar;;
Error: Unbound module Bar

While if I copy bar.cmi into the current directory the module Bar is
bound.

I find it weird that the cmi is not looked for in the same directory
where the cmo was found. Is there a way to change this ?
