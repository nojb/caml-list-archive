  Submission of abstract: Friday 27th May 2011

**********************************************************

Aim: Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages. A growing number of programming languages from commercial
and academic spheres have been given usable semantic descriptions
by means of structural operational semantics. Because of its
intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural operational semantics
has found considerable application in the study of the semantics of
concurrent processes. It is also a viable alternative to denotational
semantics in the static analysis of programs, and in proving compiler
correctness. Moreover, it has found application in emerging areas of
computing such as probabilistic systems and systems biology.
Structural operational semantics has been successfully applied as a
formal tool to establish results that hold for classes of process
description languages. This has allowed for the generalization of
well-known results in the field of process algebra, and for the
development of a meta-theory for process calculi based on the
realization that many of the results in this field only depend upon
general semantic properties of language constructs.

This workshop aims at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for
future investigation, in the field of structural operational
semantics. One of the specific goals of the series of SOS workshops
is to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming
language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

     - programming languages, process algebras and higher-order
       formalisms
     - foundations of SOS
     - category theoretic approaches
     - conservative extensions and translations of SOS
       specifications
     - congruence results and their meta-theory
     - modal logics, program logics and SOS
     - ordered, modular, and other variants of SOS
     - SOS of probabilistic, timed, stochastic and hybrid systems
     - SOS and rewriting systems, reactive systems and other forms
       of operational specification
     - comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and structural
       operational semantics
     - software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS.

Reports on applications of SOS to other fields, including:
     - modelling and analysis of biological systems,
     - security of computer systems,
     - programming, modelling and analysis of embedded systems,
     - specification of middle-ware and coordination languages,
     - programming language semantics and implementation,
     - static analysis,
     - software and hardware verification, are also most welcome
     - semantics for domain-specific languages and model-based
       engineering.

Paper submission
----------------

We solicit unpublished papers reporting on original research on the
general theme of SOS. Prospective authors should submit a paper via
Easychair (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sos2011) by
Wednesday, 3rd June 2011. Papers should take the form of a pdf file
in EPTCS format (http://www.eptcs.org/), whose length should not
exceed 15 pages (not including an optional "Appendix for referees"
containing proofs that will not be included in the final paper). We
will also consider 5-page papers describing tools to be demonstrated
at the workshop.

Proceedings
-----------

Preliminary proceedings will be available at the meeting. The final
proceedings of the workshop will appear as a volume in the EPTCS
series. If the quality and quantity of the submissions warrant it, the
co-chairs plan to arrange a special issue of an archival journal
devoted to full versions of selected papers from the workshop.
