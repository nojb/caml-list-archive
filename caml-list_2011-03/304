Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml Meeting 2011, 1 week before end of registration

This mail is a copy of a post you can find here:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=781

== Hacking day ==

There will be hacking day (week-end), the day after the meeting
organized by Pierre Chambart at IRILL.

== OCaml Meeting ==

For the fourth time, I am proud to invite all OCaml enthusiasts to join us at
OCaml Meeting 2011 in Paris.
 
This year event takes place in Paris on Friday 15th April 2011. Registration is
opened now and will be closed on Friday 8th April 2011.

As last year, participants are invited to give a talk on what they are doing
with OCaml, submit a description of your talk on the wiki or contact me.

__ Only 30 places left and only one week before remains __ 

We are still looking for:
* someone to handle the camrecorder
* someone to welcome people and direct them to the cafeteria

Both of these tasks will only take you a limited amount of time during the
meeting. It will help the organization team a lot. 

The meeting is sponsored by INRIA CAML Consortium and organized OCamlCore.

Hope to see a lot of you 
Regards 
Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of the OCaml Meeting organization team

p.s. the registration website is made with Ocsigen and connected to the forge,
so you need to be logged in the OCaml Forge to be able to subscribe.
