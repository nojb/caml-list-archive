SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers by uploading
them to the evaluation web site at:  http://world-comp.org
Submissions must be uploaded by April 10, 2011 and they must be
in either MS doc (but not docx) or pdf formats (about 5 to 7
pages - single space, font size of 10 to 12). All reasonable
typesetting formats are acceptable (later, the authors of accepted
papers will be asked to follow a particular typesetting format to
prepare their final papers for publication.) Papers must not have
been previously published or currently submitted for publication
elsewhere.
The first page of the paper should include: title of the paper,
name, affiliation, postal address, and email address for each
author. The first page should also identify the name of the Contact
Author and a maximum of 5 topical keywords that would best
represent the content of the paper. Finally, the name of the
conference that the paper is being submitted for consideration
must be stated on the first page.

The length of the final/Camera-Ready papers (if accepted) will be
limited to 7 (two-column IEEE style) pages.

Each paper will be peer-reviewed by two experts in the field for
originality, significance, clarity, impact, and soundness. In cases
of contradictory recommendations, a member of the conference
program committee will be charged to make the final decision
(accept/reject) - often, this would involve seeking help from
additional referees by using a double-blinded review process. In
addition, all papers whose authors included a member of the
conference program committee will be evaluated using the
double-blinded review process. (Essay/philosophical papers will
not be refereed but may be considered for discussion/panels).

All proceedings of WORLDCOMP will be published and indexed in:
Inspec / IET / The Institute for Engineering & Technology,
DBLP / CS Bibliography, and others. In the past, all tracks of
WORLDCOMP have also been included in EI Compendex/Elsevier.
Like prior years, extended versions of selected papers will appear
in journals and edited research books (a large number of book
projects and journal special issues are in the pipeline: Springer,
Elsevier, BMC journals, ...)

An important mission of WORLDCOMP is "Providing a unique
platform for a diverse community of constituents composed of
scholars, researchers, developers, educators, and practitioners.
The Congress makes concerted effort to reach out to participants
affiliated with diverse entities (such as: universities,
institutions, corporations, government agencies, and research
centers/labs) from all over the world. The congress also attempts
to connect participants from institutions that have teaching as
their main mission with those who are affiliated with institutions
that have research as their main mission. The congress uses a
quota system to achieve its institution and geography diversity
objectives."

One main goal of the congress is to assemble a spectrum of
affiliated research conferences, workshops, and symposiums into
a coordinated research meeting held in a common place at a
common time. This model facilitates communication among
researchers in different fields of computer science, computer
engineering, and applied computing. The Congress also encourages
multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary research initiatives;
ie, facilitating increased opportunities for cross-fertilization
across sub-disciplines.

According to "Microsoft Academic Search" (a Microsoft initiative)
all tracks of WORLDCOMP are listed as worldwide "Top-ranked
Conferences" (based on various metrics but mainly based on the
number of citations). You can access "Microsoft Academic Search" to
extract citation data for each individual track of worldcomp using
the following link: http://academic.research.microsoft.com/
As of March 4, 2011, the papers published in the proceeedings have
received 14,385 citations which is a higher citation than many
reputable journals in computer science.
