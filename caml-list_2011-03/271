Subject: [Caml-list] walking a graph in parallel

I have a giant graph of Twitter data which takes several gigabytes in RAM, as a Hashtbl.  I need to walk it, collecting various statistics, and building equally huge data structures under each node.  Currently I do it all in a single OCaml program, which uses up to 60 GB of RAM and works fine.    However, out of the 8 powerful CPUs the box has, only 1 is used.

Having seen Joel's tasty bites of ZeroMQ and Thrift and Piqi, I'm thinking of exploring 0MQ as a parallel MPI/Erlang-like way to walk the graph.  I'd move the graph into a server, and walkers would be separate processes.   I only need inter-process communication, IPC, for the box.  I could do threads and inter-thread in 0MQ if OCaml would allow real parallel threads.  

How would you manage 7 identical worker processes and 1 server, so that in the end, the results of the workers are all reduced together?  What's the best way to set up the server?  Some ideas:

-- hold the graph in MongoDB, it allows for parallel queries
-- keep the graph in an OCaml process, it allows for custom queries; but will 0MQ try to fork and copy it when replying to several workers?  Copying is impossible, too big

Or, is it possible to use a huge chunk of shared memory, to place the read-only graph there and query it somehow separately from each worker, then use 0MQ for the reduce communication phase?
