Yes, an informative, grokable site would be nice! So often with OCaml
projects I just don't know what they're for and the sites provide bare-bones
info. As a recent example, I saw OASIS mentioned a few times here so I
checked the site... but the most informative thing there was the link to
Haskell's Cabal. After I read the Cabal page, then I understood the intended
role of OASIS.

OCaml stuff seems to lack *exposition*... a description of intent. Too often
it's very terse "this is what it is" with no "this is why it exists and how
you use it".

Bigger than that, what is a practical OCaml setup? I'm still basically
running with the compiler, some specifically downloaded modules, and "my own
stdlib". If I manage my OCaml environment with GODI, will I run into
limitations, or is everyone using it and it's purely beneficial? I have no
idea what an appropriate setup is, and don't want to spend time trying to
figure it out myself and possibly messing up the ad-hoc configuration I've
ended up with. Advice from those with experience would be welcome.

Perhaps other developers run into the same issues. The only known is the
compiler... need that. Some confusions arise from the split choices...
P4/P5... ocamlbuild/makefile. And you don't find out what choice to make
until you hit a problem. What do you experts do in practice? That's the kind
of overview I feel is missing. There's no place to go (that I've seen) where
a practical OCaml environment(s) is(/are) described... perhaps because it
would require being partisan to one choice or another. At least info to help
make that choice. It seems every time I consider doing a camlp4 extension I
look up camlp4 vs camlp5 and after my brain turns to fuzz I give up and do
something else.

I've been programming in OCaml for about 6 years now, and if I were to start
with a clean build, I'd still just build the basic package from INRIA and
gather specific modules as I needed them... often the "install" is just
copying the  library/object/mli files into a subdir of .../lib/ocaml. There
must be a better way? What I need is guidance. :)

Without any direction, I think OCaml developers end up "going their own",
and we have this fractured mess. People don't know if the functions they
need (such as fairly basic math functions, to touch on the original topic)
exist somewhere. I didn't know about extlib or batteries for some time.
Where do you start? Google is not the most friendly or useful interface for
poor, under-represented OCaml. :)

So yes, Ashish, I think a better website for OCaml could be a simple and
effective way to address these problems!

N-like repository for OCaml, using his &quot;oasis&quot; distribution tool:=

<br>Sylvain has been doing great work for the OCaml community for some year=
s. With the help of other tools (ocamlfind, godi, ocamlbuild...), the Ocaml=
core Forge, etc., it is now more and more easy to use, share and deploy OCa=
ml code. Of course, there still are a lot of rough edges, but the only way =
to go further is that the community (yes, you!) try to use those tools, pop=
ularize them, and also report feedback on what could be improved.<br>





<br>For a very long time, using OCaml has been a joyful but solitary activi=
ty. If you want a more vibrant community, the only thing to do is to do you=
r part of the work as you would need the others to do. Set a standard, so t=
hat things that are now rare are taken for granted in the future. Nobody, e=
xcept maybe Sylvain, has the devotion to work full-time on the small detail=
s that will improve things in the long run, and this is ok. Yes, writing an=
 oasis file (or even a META) or contributing an obvious function to Batteri=
es is tedious and certainly less sexy that a lot of things you&#39;re worki=
ng on. But this won&#39;t happen magically.<div>

Ocaml is highly expressive, so you could turn around, but it&#39;s a big pr=

<br>I think it would be important and interesting to create a little organi=

So, I think INRIA could continue to work on a good compiler, and company wh=
