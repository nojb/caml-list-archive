My wording awkwardly suggests that all the mentioned tools are Ocamlcore
projects. This is not true :
- ocamlfind and godi are tools from Gerd Stolpmann and have been around for
much longer; if you want to help the ocaml ecosystem, it's a good idea to
begin by writing META files for all your released projects; they are very
simple to write from an existing example, and very useful in combination
with ocamlfind
- ocamlbuild is from Nicolas Pouillard and Berke Durak; it is a simple and
extensible compilation system for OCaml, but relatively new; other build
systems for OCaml exist, such as OCamlMakefile (a generic GNU Makefile to
help write usual makefiles for OCaml program) and OMake.
