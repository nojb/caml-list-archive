Subject: [Caml-list] TIME 2011: Call for Workshop Proposals

Call for Workshop Proposals

The 18th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME 2011) will be hosted by the University of Lubeck, Germany. TIME 2011 aims to bring together researchers from distinct research areas involving the management of temporal data as well as the reasoning about temporal aspects of information.

This unique and well-established event further has as its objectives to bridge theoretical and applied research, as well as to serve as an interdisciplinary forum for exchange among researchers from the areas of artificial intelligence, database management, logic and verification, and beyond.

The organizers have made arrangements to facilitate the running of one day workshops and invite workshop proposals. Dates for possible workshops are:

  Sunday, September 11
  Thursday, September 15

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops on topics relating to artificial intelligence, database management, logic and verification. Workshops will have to be financially self-supporting. The TIME Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted workshops subject to the availability of space and facilities. It is not necessary to register for TIME in order to attend workshops. Meeting rooms will be reserved by the TIME organizers. 

Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list of previous or related workshops (if relevant). A second, organizational part should include:

- contact information of the workshop organizers.
- estimate of the audience size.
- proposed format and agenda (for example, demo sessions, tutorials, etc.)
- procedures for selecting papers and participants.
- prefered date of the workshop.

Proposals are due by March 31, 2011. Organizers will be notified by April 5, 2011. Proposals should be submitted electronically (by email) to nowotka@fmi.uni-stuttgart.de .
