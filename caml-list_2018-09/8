The emerging field of secure compilation aims to preserve security
properties of programs when they have been compiled to low-level languages
such as assembly, where high-level abstractions don=E2=80=99t exist, and un=
safe,
unexpected interactions with libraries, other programs, the operating
system and even the hardware are possible.
For unsafe source languages like C, secure compilation requires careful
handling of undefined source-language behavior (like buffer overflows and
double frees).
Formally, secure compilation aims to protect high-level language
abstractions in compiled code, even against adversarial low-level contexts,
thus enabling sound reasoning about security in the source language.
A complementary goal is to keep the compiled code efficient, often
leveraging new hardware security features and advances in compiler design.
Other necessary components are identifying and formalizing properties that
secure compilers must possess, devising efficient security mechanisms (both
software and hardware), and developing effective verification and proof
techniques.
Research in the field thus puts together advances in compiler design,
programming languages, systems security, verification, and computer
architecture.

The Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) is a relatively
new, informal 1-day workshop without any proceedings.
The goal is to bring together researchers interested in secure compilation
and to identify interesting research directions and open challenges.

The 3rd edition of PriSC will be held in Lisbon, together with the ACM
SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL),
2019.
The exact date will be either January 13 or January 19 (to be decided by
the POPL organizers).

More information is available at http://popl19.sigplan.org/track/prisc-2019
Important Dates
* Presentation proposal submission deadline: 17 October 2018, AoE
* Presentation proposal notification: 10 November 2018
* PriSC Workshop takes place: either Sunday, 13 January 2019 or Saturday 19
January 2019 (to be decided by the POPL organizers)

Anyone interested in presenting at the workshop should submit an extended
abstract (up to 2 pages, details below) covering past, ongoing, or future
work.
Any topic that could be of interest to secure compilation is in scope.
Secure compilation should be interpreted very broadly to include any work
in security, programming languages, architecture, systems or their
combination that can be leveraged to preserve security properties of
programs when they are compiled or to eliminate low-level vulnerabilities.
Presentations that provide a useful outside view or challenge the community
are also welcome.
This includes presentations on new attack vectors such as
microarchitectural side-channels, whose defenses could benefit from
compiler techniques.

Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* attacker models for secure compiler chains.
* secure compiler properties: fully abstract compilation and similar
properties, memory safety, control-flow integrity, preservation of safety,
information flow and other (hyper-)properties against adversarial contexts,
secure multi-language interoperability.
* secure interaction between different programming languages: foreign
function interfaces, gradual types, securely combining different memory
management strategies.
* enforcement mechanisms and low-level security primitives: static
checking, program verification, typed assembly languages, reference
monitoring, program rewriting, software-based isolation/hiding techniques
(SFI, crypto-based, randomization-based, OS/hypervisor-based),
security-oriented architectural features such as Intel=E2=80=99s SGX, MPX a=
nd MPK,
capability machines, side-channel defenses, object capabilities.
* experimental evaluation and applications of secure compilers.
* proof methods relevant to compilation: (bi)simulation, logical relations,
game semantics, trace semantics, multi-language semantics, embedded
interpreters.
* formal verification of secure compilation chains (protection mechanisms,
compilers, linkers, loaders), machine-checked proofs, translation
validation, property-based testing.

Extended abstracts should be submitted in PDF format and not exceed 2 pages.
They should be formatted in two-column layout, 10pt font, and be printable
on A4 and US Letter sized paper.
We recommend using the new acmart LaTeX style in sigplan mode:

Submissions are not anonymous and should provide sufficient detail to be
assessed by the program committee.
Presentation at the workshop does not preclude publication elsewhere.

<br>
The Workshop on Principles of Secure Compilation (PriSC) is a relatively ne=
w, informal 1-day workshop without any proceedings.<br>
The goal is to bring together researchers interested in secure=20
compilation and to identify interesting research directions and open=20
challenges.<br>
<br>
The 3rd edition of PriSC will be held in Lisbon, together with the ACM=20
SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL),=20
2019.<br>
The exact date will be either January 13 or January 19 (to be decided by th=
e POPL organizers).<br>

<br>
Anyone interested in presenting at the workshop should submit an=20
extended abstract (up to 2 pages, details below) covering past, ongoing,
 or future work.<br>
Any topic that could be of interest to secure compilation is in scope.<br>
Secure compilation should be interpreted very broadly to include any=20
work in security, programming languages, architecture, systems or their=20
combination that can be leveraged to preserve security properties of=20
programs when they are compiled or to eliminate low-level=20
vulnerabilities.<br>
Presentations that provide a useful outside view or challenge the community=
 are also welcome.<br>
This includes presentations on new attack vectors such as=20
microarchitectural side-channels, whose defenses could benefit from=20
compiler techniques.<br>
<br>
Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br>
* attacker models for secure compiler chains.<br>
* secure compiler properties: fully abstract compilation and similar=20
properties, memory safety, control-flow integrity, preservation of=20
safety, information flow and other (hyper-)properties against=20
adversarial contexts, secure multi-language interoperability.<br>
* secure interaction between different programming languages: foreign=20
function interfaces, gradual types, securely combining different memory=20
management strategies.<br>
* enforcement mechanisms and low-level security primitives: static=20
checking, program verification, typed assembly languages, reference=20
monitoring, program rewriting, software-based isolation/hiding=20
techniques (SFI, crypto-based, randomization-based,=20
OS/hypervisor-based), security-oriented architectural features such as=20
Intel=E2=80=99s SGX, MPX and MPK, capability machines, side-channel defense=
s,=20
object capabilities.<br>
* experimental evaluation and applications of secure compilers.<br>
* proof methods relevant to compilation: (bi)simulation, logical=20
relations, game semantics, trace semantics, multi-language semantics,=20
embedded interpreters.<br>
* formal verification of secure compilation chains (protection=20
mechanisms, compilers, linkers, loaders), machine-checked proofs,=20
translation validation, property-based testing.<br>

<br>
Extended abstracts should be submitted in PDF format and not exceed 2 pages=
.<br>
They should be formatted in two-column layout, 10pt font, and be printable =
on A4 and US Letter sized paper.<br>
We recommend using the new acmart LaTeX style in sigplan mode: <a href=3D"h=
ttp://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/acmart/current/acmart-sigplanproc=
.zip" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http://www.sigplan.org/sites/def=
ault/files/acmart/current/acmart-sigplanproc.zip</a><br>
<br>
Submissions are not anonymous and should provide sufficient detail to be as=
sessed by the program committee.<br>
Presentation at the workshop does not preclude publication elsewhere.<br>
<br>
