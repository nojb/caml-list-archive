Subject: [Caml-list] Release Candidate 4.07.1+rc1

Dear OCaml users,

The release of OCaml version 4.07.1 is imminent.  We have
created a release candidate for your testing pleasure.  Please
try it in opam and test your favourite software with it.  Then
let me know whether it works for you.

We want to know about any show-stopping bugs, especially in the
compilation and installation phases.

This release candidate will soon be available as a bunch of OPAM
switches. It is also available as source code at this address:
  http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.07/

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.
