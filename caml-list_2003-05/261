                         IFL 2003
              15th International Workshop on the
            IMPLEMENTATION OF FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES

                          Edinburgh
                          Scotland
                  September 8th - 10th, 2003
                http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ifl03

=============================================================
Important dates
---------------

       Registration deadline: August       1st, 2003
       Submission deadline  : August      22nd, 2003
       Workshop             : September 8-10th, 2003

=============================================================


Scope of IFL 2003
-----------------

The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and
users actively engaged in the implementation and application of
functional programming languages to discuss results and new
directions of research.


The workshop is intended to provide an open forum for researchers
who wish to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in
progress, preliminary results etc. related primarily but not
exclusively to the implementation of functional or function-based
languages. A not necessarily exhaustive list of topics includes

       language concepts
       type checking
       compilation techniques
       (abstract) interpretation
       automatic program generation
       (abstract) machine architectures
       array processing
       concurrent/parallel programming and program execution
       heap management
       runtime profiling and performance measurements
       debugging and tracing
       verification of functional programs
       tools and programming techniques

Contributions on applications of functional programming, e.g., in
teaching, or on theoretical work in any of the above areas are also
welcome.

This year's workshop is co-located with the 4th International
Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP'03)
<http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stg/workshops/ISTFP/>.

Contributions
-------------

All attendees are encouraged to submit papers to be published in
the draft proceedings and to give presentations at the workshop.
Submitted papers must be written in English, conform to the LNCS
format (available at: http://www.springer.de/comp/authors/index.html)
and not exceed 16 pages.

Papers should be submitted by August 22nd as postscript or pdf files
using the submission page of the workshop accessible through
http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ifl03

After the workshop, a high-quality subset of contributions will be
published in the Springer LNCS series. All speakers attending the
workshop are invited to submit a paper. Papers for the LNCS
proceedings will be refereed according to normal conference standards.

                             TFP 2003
                 Fourth International symposium on
                 Trends in Functional Programming

                       Edinburgh, Scotland
                   September 11th - 12th, 2003

          http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stg/workshops/TFP/

The international symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
continues the Scottish Functional Programming Workshop series. These
workshops bring together researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming languages. Papers on all aspects of functional
programming are welcomed, be they implementation-oriented,
theoretical, or experience papers.

This year's workshop is co-located with the 15th International
Workshop on the Implementation of Functional Languages (IFL '03)
<http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ifl03>.


Workshop Topics

Papers on any aspect of functional programming are welcome. Papers on
the following subject areas are particularly welcome.

    * rich type systems, including type systems for expressing resource
      bounds or other safety properties;
    * linear type systems, soft type systems, typeful programming;
    * reasoning about functional programs, semantics of functional
      languages;
    * inductive or co-inductive techniques, proof nets;
    * mobile-code functional programming languages;
    * parallel programming with functional languages, cost models for
      functional programs;
    * compilation of functional languages for the Java Virtual Machine;
    * functional aspects of imperative programming, functional bytecode;
    * interoperability with imperative programming languages, calling
      imperative from functional or vice versa;
    * type inference algorithms, type error repair, deep types;
    * strongly-typed imperative languages with inference (e.g. Cyclone);
    * performance measurements, optimisation techniques, implementation
      techniques;
    * experience papers: applications of functional programming or
      functional programming in education.

The above list is not exhaustive. Papers on other topics are also welcome.


Contributions

All attendees are encouraged to submit papers to be published in the
draft proceedings and to give presentations at the workshop. Submitted
papers must be written in English and not exceed 16 pages. Papers
should be submitted as postscript (or pdf) by email to the workshop chair,
Stephen Gilmore <stg@inf.ed.ac.uk>.


Proceedings

We intend to publish a high-quality subset of contributions in a
highly-regarded series. All speakers attending the workshop are
invited to submit a paper. Papers for the proceedings will be
refereed according to normal conference standards. This implies (among
other things) that:

    * the paper should be written in English
    * the paper is well written
    * topic of the paper should be stated clearly
    * the approach to solve the problem should be outlined clearly
    * a detailed discussion of the solution has to be given
    * the solution is compared with relevant related work
    * there is an abstract, introduction and conclusion.
    * the conclusion should summarise the problem, the solution, and how
      this solves the problem.
    * the paper should not exceed 16 pages.
    * the paper should be submitted as postscript (or pdf) by email to
      the workshop chair, Stephen Gilmore <stg@inf.ed.ac.uk>.
