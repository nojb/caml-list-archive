Your basic argument is reasonable, but I seem to remember one of the
main reasons the previously userland Linux nfs server implementation was
rewritten as a kernel-space server was to improve performance.

Perhaps it's because the typical nfs server serves most of its pages out
of its ram cache so context switches becomes more of an issue?

Anyway, drifting off-topic for this list.
