I recently asked a similar question and got some helpful replies, see
http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200304/msg00189.html and followups.

2 months later, having coded my GUI using lablgtk, i would say the 
following:

On the one hand, lablgtk has many features and works great. 
On the other hand, to get something good out of it you do need to invest 
quite some effort. Mostly due to lack of documentation, it's not just a 
matter of writing code to an API, 
because I found myself having to go and inspect the code pretty often to 
figure out how to use this or that. Also, though my UI was relatively 
straightforward I stumbled across 2 pretty trivial bugs, which gave me the 
impression that lots of the code has not been very well exercised yet.
