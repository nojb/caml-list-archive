For me there is too much "noise" in the regular expression. All the
single quotes do not have a meaning, the just say "this is a
character". But I know that " or x is a character, I don't think
writing '"' or 'x' makes this fact clearer.

That's right, but you don't have to use single quotes around every
character.
