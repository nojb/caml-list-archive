I am new to ObjectiveCaml and am wondering whether it has been used for any
large projects (i.e. hundreds of thousands or more lines of code, possible
>100 modules)?  If so, how well has it scaled, in terms of performance,
memory usage, compile time, and any other relevant characteristics?  If not,
is this because there are known issues that would prevent it from being
effectively used beyond a certain size project?
