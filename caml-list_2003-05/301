You can also look at:
* The CDK, and its net/ library. I think there is a simple HTTP client, HTTP server and an FTP client.
* MLdonkey, where the net/ library (mldonkey/src/utils/net/) contains the kernel of a mono-threaded
   generic network program (ie BasicSockets, TcpBufferedSockets, UdpSockets, TcpServerSockets), wired
   on select/poll system calls, with some kind of bandwidth control, and an HTTP client and server.
