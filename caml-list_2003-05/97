I may have wanted to say an array is not something you append to, but a 
"vector" in C++ terminology is.... Sorry for the inappropriate manner.

In fact, the data structure library should be careful enough to distinguish 
list ADT implemented with extensible arrays from list ADT implemented with 
linked lists. I was thinking about this the other day. That distinction is 
probably one of the few things that C++ standard library has implemented 
quite well. (I personally don't like the "iterator" abstraction at all)

Also, a dynamic array which you can resize would be worthwhile. Any name 
suggestions for such a module? I used Dynarray for the small code I posted on 
the list but somebody else may have a better one (like "flex" in algol) I 
always end up using strange names.
