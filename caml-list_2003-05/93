  ...

Probably because it wouldn't make much sense.  Either the only way you=20=

could access age in the above is by matching Bar { age =3D x }, which is=20=

not very useful (you might as well have Bar of int, or a tuple for=20
multiple fields), or the record type needs to have a name so that x in=20=

the pattern Bar x has some printable type.
