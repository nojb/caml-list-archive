I've never used ocamlc -- I have no reason to, so I tend to think of
ocamlopt as the ocaml compiler.  Ideally, ocamlc and ocamlopt would be
equally flexible.  

It never occurred to me that I'd have to create a more complex
makefile just to get real separate compilation during development by
using ocamlc, doing ocamlopt only at the end.
