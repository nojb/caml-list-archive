Xavier Leroy points out something more complicated than I was thinking. 
  What I was going to do was, for each function f with a definition in 
the top environment, generate the list of all other such functions 
lexically bound inside f.  Maybe add a hack for non-functor modules or 
something.  So that throws out all anonymous functions and lots more.  
It's not really about call path.  I was presuming it was for assisting 
visual code inspection.

What is it for in reality?
