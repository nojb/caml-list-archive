Hi Caml experts,
We are using register_global_root to register addresses in the malloc'd
C heap that contain Caml values.  We noticed that register_global_root
(comment below) expects a global C variable, but we assumed that it should
work with malloc'd addresses as well.  Is there any reason that it would not?

/* [register_global_root] registers a global C variable as a memory root
    for the duration of the program, or until [remove_global_root] is
    called. */

We are getting (somewhat random) core dumps after calling the same Caml
function repeatedly on the same Caml value (which is referenced
from the C heap).

Thanks,
Mary
