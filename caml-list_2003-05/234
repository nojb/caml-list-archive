Theme: Ad-Hoc networks are wireless, self-organizing
systems formed by co-operating nodes within
communication range of each other that form temporary
networks.
Their topology is dynamic, decentralized, ever
changing and the nodes may move around
arbitrarily. The last few years have witnessed a
wealth of research ideas on ad hoc networking that are
moving rapidly into implemented standards.
