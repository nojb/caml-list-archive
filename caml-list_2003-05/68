Few people here are currently running the "ExtLib" - ocaml extended
library - project, and are trying to answer theses questions. For an example
of a structure that can be used to convert from and between several
different data structures, you could have a look at the Enum module from the
ExtLib CVS here :

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocaml-lib

This is a purely functionnal way of dealing with conversions between Arrays,
Lists, etc. with lazy-functionnal support that enable you to map-and-convert
a list to an array without having to build an intermediate data structure
for storing mapped elements.
