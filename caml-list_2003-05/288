Yamagata must read a computational geometry text, he shall find that 
structures like interval trees provide for such operations. But according to 
which operations you need fast you may have to design your data structure....

Structure monster just got out of a computational geometry project disaster so 
he can't really help in a substantial way (^_^)

All I can say is don't try to make it very functional.

Of course a computational geometry library would be nice :) But it's so hard 
to write decent code in that area.

Cheers,
