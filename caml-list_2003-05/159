My guess (without profiling) is that most of the time is being spent 
doing regular expression matching.

Regular expressions can be much slower than you might expect for 
non-trivial cases.  The expression in your program looks particularly 
nasty, since there are a lot of ambiguous cases (whether '-' should 
match '.*' or '-' depends on everything that follows).

You might want to try using Str.split instead.
