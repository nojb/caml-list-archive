The ocamlopt executables are not fully static. Only the compiled O'Caml
code is static, the system libraries are dynamically linked.

Add -ccopt -static to the ocamlopt call to produce a fully static
executable.

It is not possible to compile a program on a glibc-2.3 system and run it
on a glibc-2.2 system. The reverse way should work, though. (You can 
find out the glibc version number by _running_ /lib/libc.so.6. The
library prints a nice summary of its features.)

Regarding libpcre.so.3: There seems to be no standard for the versions
attached to so files. libpcre.so.3 is often called libpcre.so.0 because
the author of pcre does not add a version number, and the Linux
distributors often follow this decision. Not nice.

Unfortunately, this is still a major problem for Linux. Static
executables are no real solution, and especially glibc should be
dynamically linked to enable all the special configurations of the
system (e.g. special login modules and all that).
