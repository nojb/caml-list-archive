If you expand each line of megabyte file to list of characters -- it
cannot be fast.

On my box reading 32M file (800k lines) takes 3.4s with List.rev at the
end and 2.8s without. Reading the same file into array takes 2.3s. All
using ocamlopt, x86 linux, glibc 2.3.2. Doing the same thing in C
(using strdup() to remember lines) takes 0.7s (the C program is flawed
in some aspects, so don't take it too seriously).
