Good point. I don't know why I didn't think of that in the first place.

Okay, I've run into that with other languages. But I didn't know you had
to do that in OCaml. Is that documented anywhere?

Oh, I've seen those warnings more than once, and was thinking about
asking on the list, but it didn't seem urgent.

By the way, why doesn't the compiler just reject regexes with single
backslashes? What is the point of issuing warnings and then accepting
the incorrect syntax?

How strange. I actually didn't try compiling to bytecode. I had tried
using the function in the interactive toplevel, and finding it very
slow, went straight to native code in the hope that it would perform 
reasonably well. Any idea why bytecode would be faster?

Ah, another good point. I think I'll go with Str.split, but I'll keep
this in mind for future reference.

Thank you both for the suggestions.
