I have developed a program on Debian Sarge Linux using pcre and
ocaml-tools.  I thought that a static (ocamlopt) compilation of the
program would allow me to run it on other Linux systems without having
to install ocaml (or pcre-ocaml) on them.  But this seems not to be
the case.

Trying to run the program on a Redhat 7.2 system firstly complained
about a missing libpcre.so.3 file.  After copying a libcpre.so.3 from
another system to /usr/local/lib and making a symlink to /usr/lib/ the
next complaint was 

zsh % sncd
sncd: /lib/i686/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.3' not found (required by
sncd)

I then installed ocaml-3.06-1.src.rpm on the system and did a rpm -ba,
installed the binary package, converted Debian libpcre-ocaml-packages
to rpm's, installed it and recompiled my program (sncd) and ... at
last I have sncd running.

Is there an easier way distribute a binary program?

Regards.
Johann
