Unfortunately for you, the camlp4 manual suggests to use syntax extensions =
for
infix operators (http://caml.inria.fr/camlp4/manual/manual007.html)...=20
But this doesn't mean that you have to write one syntax extension for
every infix operator you want to create: you may extend the syntax once wit=
h a
rule which will itself make the necessary extensions, such as the following
example:
---
(* file infix.ml4. compile it with
   ocamlc -c -pp 'camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo -impl' -I +camlp4=20
   -impl infix.ml4

   usage: infix id x y =3D ... ; creates an infix operator.
*)
open Pcaml

if !Sys.interactive then print_endline "infix definitions";;
EXTEND str_item:
[ [ "infix"; p =3D LIDENT; argts =3D LIST0 LIDENT; "=3D"; e=3Dexpr ->
      let def =3D List.fold_right (fun arg e -> <:expr< fun $lid:arg$ -> $e=
$>>)
                  argts e
      in=20
        (* we create a new extension which recognizes the expression
           e1 'p' e2, where 'p' is our new operator. Unfortunately, the
        EXTEND ... END syntactic sugar cannot help here, since p would be=20
        considered as an entry of the grammar and not as a new keyword*)
        Grammar.extend
          [Grammar.Entry.obj expr, Some (Gramext.Before "apply"),
           [None, None,=20
            [[Gramext.Sself; Gramext.Stoken ("",p);Gramext.Sself],
             Gramext.action
               (fun e2  _ e1 loc  ->=20
                  (MLast.ExApp=20
                     (loc, MLast.ExApp (loc, <:expr< $lid:p$>>, e1), e2)))]=
]];
        (* definition of the operator itself. *)
        <:str_item< value $lid:p$ =3D $exp:def$ >>]];
END=20
----=20
Note that this is far from being perfect, since for instance it does not=20
allow you to give the type of the arguments of your operator. Anyway, it=20
works on simple examples:
        Objective Caml version 3.06
# #load "camlp4r.cma";;
        Camlp4 Parsing version 3.06

# #load "infix.cmo";
infix definitions
# infix \=3D=3D=3D x y =3D x =3D y;
value ( =3D=3D=3D ) : 'a -> 'a -> bool =3D <fun>
# \=3D=3D=3D 1 1;
- : bool =3D True
# 1 =3D=3D=3D 1;
- : bool =3D True
# infix foo x y =3D x + y;
value foo : int -> int -> int =3D <fun>
# 1 foo 1;
- : int =3D 2
# \foo 1 1;
- : int =3D 2

Hope this helps,
--=20
E tutto per oggi, a la prossima volta
Virgile
