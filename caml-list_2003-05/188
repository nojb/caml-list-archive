You are missing the point. It is not true that building a program requires
full recompilation. The point that Prof. Hickey made was that a program
requires full recompilation if you make a change then build *native* code.
The bytecode compiler (ocamlc) does allow separate compilation. I believe
that nightly builds are done for checking code compilability, ensuring
that interfaces still compile against one another, and for generating an
executable to run correctness regression tests against. I don't believe
nightly builds exist to either generate an executable target for
performance tests or generate binary product code; the reasons one would
use ocamlopt over ocamlc.
