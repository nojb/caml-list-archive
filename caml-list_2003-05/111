It happens to work in this case, but relies on features of the
implementation.  It's better to use "==" only between mutable data
structures, where it has a well-defined meaning (two mutable
structures are == iff an in-place modification to one of them affects
the other one as well), and "=" otherwise.

Both Caml Light and OCaml ensure [] == [], but again it's better not
to rely on this fact.

> The (=) has more overhead

It doesn't: the OCaml compiler is clever enough to compile "lst = []"
as a direct comparison against the integer value zero.
