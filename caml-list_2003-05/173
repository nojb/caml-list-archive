let foo x = x.bar
What is the type of foo if there is no named record in scope having field bar?

I don't say that I like it but it's a consequence of the OCaml's type system. 
Haskell has that too (but theoretically type classes could be made to help). 
SML is what you would like; it has sort of overloading of certain builtin 
operations and in this case requires the type of x to be statically known 
somehow. There is no problem with dynamically typed languages, and 
"non-functional" statically typed ones require to explicitly write the type 
of bound variables anyway. Having the same field name in various record
types just doesn't mix well with type inference.
