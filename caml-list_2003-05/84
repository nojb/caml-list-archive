Hi list !

I'm please to announce the first release of ODLL.

If you're having a boss asking you to write C librairies but if you prefer
to write them in OCaml, this tool is for you ! ODLL is creating a Win32 DLL
from an OCaml library, and automatically generating the C stubs needed to
interface the OCaml code and the C code and the .H interface. Simply run
ODLL with you CMA/CMXA and one or several CMI interfaces and ODLL
will do the job for you.

The distribution is available at http://tech.motion-twin.com
Comments/suggestions are welcome,

Thanks to Lexifi - member of the Ocaml consortium - for their support in
this project.

Nicolas Cannasse
