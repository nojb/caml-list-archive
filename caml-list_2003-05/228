Have you ever wondered whether PsiLAB works on your SuSE distribution? A 
year ago I failed to compile PsiLAB for SuSE 8. Had a conversation with 
the author but didn't request from him to ponder over my problem because 
I was just a lurker and it wouldn't pay off for him.

But yesterday I found out that the second pre-compiled PsiLAB version 
just /works/ fine under SuSE 8.

PsiLAB sounds interesting and is similar to Python+Numeric+DISLIN.

This was always on my wishlist to have something like PsiLAB for Clean, 
but as I wrote Clean is dead and the community is dead too (you normally 
do not get help or feedback from there).

Until now I used Bigloo and my self-written Bigloo binding to the high 
quality plotting library DISLIN.

Does one know whether it is possible to use the PsiLAB command-line 
interpreter in Emacs mode?
