something i was always curious about:  why do you need to 
specify the "rec" in a "let rec" function definition?  as opposed
to, say, having the compiler figure out when a function is recursive?

is it a compiler/grammar optimization?  or to help the user, forcing them
to be precise with recursion?  or required by the type system?

do other ML's do it this way?

just curious.
