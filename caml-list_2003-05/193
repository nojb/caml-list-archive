You can also use Ocamake : http://tech.motion-twin.com/ocamake which is more
like a "make for ocaml" , entirely written in OCaml, and does not rely on
external tools such as bash , make, and so on... ( in particular, one
doesn't need to install cygwin gnu make on Windows platform to compile ) .
OCamake can then be called as "fully portable" since it works exactly the
same on all platforms OCaml is working on ( and who would like to compile
ocaml code on a platform where ocaml doesn't work ?? )
