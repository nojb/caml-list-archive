Hi:

Is there a better way in Ocaml to read a file line by line than via the 
read_line function?

I use read_line on a file, perform some tasks on this line and store the 
results in a list and after having red the file I use List.rev. The 
problem actually is on big files the function is awfully slow. As 
similar Clean function takes 15 seconds, my Bigloo program takes 25 
second and my C++ programs (via templates) takes 25 secondes but my 
Ocaml program takes 8 minutes.

I am not sure how quick List.rev actually is? In Bigloo reversing a list 
has more or less no overhead. My Bigloo function is similar to my OCaml 
function. Could it be that OCaml is that slow because I use "try and 
with" constructs in order to check for the end of a file?

Why my Clean function is that fast is incomprehensible for me. Does one 
know whether there exists a function in OCaml which converts a String to 
a character-list? I use this construct in Clean then in order to extract 
floating point numbers from that character list: ['1','.','2',...] and 
store this floating point numbers via pattern matching in my result-list.
