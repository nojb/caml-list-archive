Precedence: bulk

1. It's been said that Camlp4 is not as easy to use as Lisp macros, but is it as powerful? Is there anything that can be done with Lisp macros that can not be done using Camlp4 in the context of their respective languages?

2. Has Camlp4 been completely orphaned or is it still developed by INRIA?

3. If an error is detected by OCaml in the code produced by Camlp4, how does Camlp4 decide what to tell the user? Camlp4 is a separate program, so how does it do it?

4. SML/NJ also has some quote and antiquote operators. How do they relate to Camlp4 and Lisp macros w.r.t. power and ease-of-use?

5. I think most Lisp programmers actively use macros. Do many working Caml programmers use Camlp4? Humps have only a handful of Camlp4-related projects.
