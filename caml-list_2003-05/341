Hello, all--

Over the past couple of weeks I have been learning about the various
OCaml parsing and lexing tools, with an emphasis on Camlp4. It's
fascinating, and I've learned a lot, but I am still having trouble
grasping how the different components fit together. I think what I need
now is to look at some examples of working, real-world code that use
Camlp4 ... something non-trivial, but not enormously complex. Can anyone
suggest a good place to start?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
