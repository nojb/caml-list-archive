As far as I know, there are currently no real multi-platform GUI
toolkits in Ocaml. GTK on Windows does not work correctly. You should
probably consider using another language for the GUI (C++ and
wxWindows for example), and write stubs for callbacks to Ocaml. It might
be a pain to write, but I think it is worth it if you really want a
nice GUI.
