Mind you, I am not a novice of any sort and nobody really answered my 
questions in sufficient detail. I can design and implement a large number of 
advanced data structures and the implementations you refer to will not 
satisfy my needs. In particular I don't think I would ever use a 
straightforward hash table unless the problem presented opportunity for an 
admissable hash function.
