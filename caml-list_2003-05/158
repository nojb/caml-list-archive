Hi,

I've been trying to clean up the iCalendar parser that I've been working
on, to be able to release something (even if it's not finished). I'm
trying to make it as simple as possible to use, and I have a small
question.

I have a dependency among modules that look like this:
        _____ parser  _______
       /                     \
syntax ------ printer ________ main

where main abstracts away some details by providing a read (input
channel to iCalendar abstract syntax) and write functions.

Now I'd like to make all this available using some mli file that
exposes the two functions from main, and the syntax. It feels like there
must be an easy way to do it, without duplicating all the syntax
definition.
