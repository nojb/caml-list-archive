Well, I've been chasing quite a red herring.  I got so frustrated with
the SQLite binding "causing" the SEGVs that I stubbed all of the calls
out.  My program still randomly SEGVs.

Turns out the problem is in Unix.LargeFile.lstat.  For more information,
see bug 1665.  The binding there suffers from the same problem that I
have no so easily learned to spot: field assignments with something that
can activate the garbage collector.
