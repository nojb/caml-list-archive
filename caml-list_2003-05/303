	HLPP 2003: Second International workshop on
	High-level parallel programming and applications

        Call for participation

	Monday/Tuesday 16-17 June, 2003 
	Paris, France

	Detailed informations: http://hlpp.free.fr

************************************************************************

Many applications of computing require performance levels attainable
only on parallel architectures.  Such systems are now readily
available as their price/performance ratio continues to improve.  The
rapid development of affordable hardware for parallel computing makes
the need to develop high-quality parallel software increasingly
urgent.

Sequential programming has long benefited from high-level programming
techniques and tools that have made today's immense range of software
economically viable.  Two decades of research into high-level parallel
programming has produced methods and tools that improve the
price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of
target applications.

GRIDs offer a tremendous computing power. Nevertheless, this power is
far from being effectively exploited. In addition to technical problems
related to portability and access, Grid computing needs new
programming paradigms. Research on high level grid programming is
particularly relevant.

This workshop follows HLPP 2001 and is aimed at

 - computer science researchers, practitioners, graduate students
 - scientific computing researchers, practitioners, graduate students
 - high-performance application developers (e.g. in DBMS, data-mining,
   parallel model checking, virtual reality)
