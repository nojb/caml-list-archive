Hello,

I'm not much of a programmer, but I need to port OCaml to SCO UnixWare 
7.01  system, so I can build and run the Unison package, which utilizes 
OCaml.

During the compilation process (with both GCC 2.95 and the SCO 
Development System CC compiler), I get the following errors:

         gcc -I../../byterun -O -fno-defer-pop -Wall -Wno-unused
  	    -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64  -g -c scheduler.c
	scheduler.c:97: conflicting types for `thread_t'
	/usr/include/sys/types.h:305: previous declaration of `thread_t'
	*** Error code 1 (bu21)
	UX:make: ERROR: fatal error.

The 'thread_t' declaration in types.h reads:

	#ifndef _THREAD_T
	#define _THREAD_T
	typedef id_t    thread_t;      /* thread id type       */
	#endif

I'm not sure what the issue is, but I suspect it's a fairly simple fix 
in terms of how the 'thread_t' type is being called, vs. how the include 
file is defining how it should be called?

If anyone has any thoughts or ideas, I would greatly appreciate any 
input.  This is version 3.04 of OCaml that I'm trying to build. Please 
respond with me in the TO or CC field, as I'm not a regular subscriber 
to the email list.  Thank you.

v/r
Shane
