Is it really not defined by Ocaml?  Ocaml implements the empty list as
the integer value zero.  Although (==) won't tell you if two cons-cells
have the same contents, it will tell you if they are the same.

So is there any implementation of a caml language where [] == [] isn't
always true, for any way that [] is generated?

The (=) has more overhead, and in this case, I'm not sure it is
necessary.
