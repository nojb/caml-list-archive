I've found the lack of error recovery (in Moscow ML) particularly tiresome 
when reporting mismatches between signatures and structures, and also
when multiple undefined identifiers exist.  Error recovery certainly
improves productivity in these cases, from my experience with NJSML.
I also think it helps with syntax, at least for the SML syntax.
