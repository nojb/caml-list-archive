Subject: O'Caml & 32-bit ints
Sender: weis

I've read over the manual and looked through the libraries but I
couldn't find any support for full 32-bit integers/words (something
like Int32 and Word32 in SML) in O'Caml.  Did I miss something?
If I didn't miss it, then has anyone already written a library to
support them that they are willing to share?
