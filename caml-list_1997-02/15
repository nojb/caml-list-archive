Subject: string variables in Printf.* calls: Bug, or lack of understanding?
Sender: weis

Hello,

[I apologize for the lack of a French version of this message.]

I recently observed the following while runing Objective Caml under
Windows NT and UnixWare 1.1:

	    Objective Caml version 1.03

[1] # let s = "%f" in Printf.printf s 10.5;;
    Characters 30-31:
    This expression has type string but is here used with type
      ('a, out_channel, unit) format

[2] # Printf.printf "%f" 10.5;;
    10.500000- : unit = ()

I don't understand why the variable s, which is bound to a string value,
causes the error in statement 1, while using a literal string in
statement 2 works as expected.  Can anyone explain?  Or is this a bug?
