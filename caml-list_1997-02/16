Hello,

There does not seem to have a browser for O'Caml sources with the
O'Caml release of CamlTk (like the one that exists for Caml
Light). Is there any hope to have such a browser with a future release
of CamlTk ? Or, has anyone written something similar ?

Is there any scheduled release of CamlTk for tcl7.6 / tk4.2 ?

Thank you.
