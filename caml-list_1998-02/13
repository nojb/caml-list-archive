Try using the "-linkall" option to ocamlc when linking your main
application (the one that does the dynamic linking).

The "-linkall" option disables the normal elimination of unused
modules and C primitives, and makes sure that all the modules and
libraries you mention on the command line are linked in and thus
available to dynamically-linked code.  (The accompanying C primitives
are dragged in the executable along the way.)

Hope this helps.
