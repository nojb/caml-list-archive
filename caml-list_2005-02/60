Sometimes it's Ocaml, sometimes it's Erlang or Oz, sometimes  it's Ruby, 
etc.  Very rarely do I find C a good match for the problem - it takes a 
certain level of skill to not screw up with C, a level I don't currently 
possess.

I use OCaml as my language of choice for graphics work and some general 
purpose tasks.  It's got several benefits over some languages, the 
compiler is pretty good and the community is fairly substantial.  It has 
good library support and some decent tutorials, references.
