A language is more than just syntax plus a rule how to translate that to 
machine code. One may come to such a conclusion by looking e.g. at C, but 
frequently, much more happens between syntax and machine code.

Take the GC. Take fundamental data types.

Exactly. One of the greatest medical achievements was not the discovery of 
Penicillin, but the introduction of statistical methods and the 
double-blind experiment. Only this allowed us to do systematic studies of 
what's useful and what's not.

No one has a clue how to systematically do a quantitative study of what 
makes a useful language. We even do not seem to be really interested in 
finding the appropriate questions to ask.
