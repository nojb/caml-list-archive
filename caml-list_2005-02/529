Good question.  Answer is unfortunately no.  The native look and feel
is provided by the Gtk-Wimp theme (http://gtk-wimp.sourceforge.net/)
which was recently intergrated into Gtk itself.  However the theming
only applies to widgets, and not to such things as the file->open
dialog.

Note that even Microsoft isn't consistent in this area.  Office XP,
for example, uses its own widgets and dialogs.

Printing is another area where things are complicated.  Under Unix
it's relatively straightforward: generate a PS or PPM file and pipe it
into 'lpr'.  On Windows things are much more complex.  For the app I
wrote in 2003, I managed a primitive form of graphic-only printing by
hacking out a standalone printing program from the guts of the GIMP
Windows printer driver (written in C, not OCaml).  I can let anyone
have this if they're interested.

Rich.
