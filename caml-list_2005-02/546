No, not at all.

Just this afternoon, a friend of mine suggested that I commercialise the OCaml 
port of my vector graphics engine:

  http://www.chem.pwf.cam.ac.uk/~jdh30/programming/opengl/smoke/

The OCaml implementation is much more evolved and vastly easier to use, of 
course. In particular, it makes cross-platform GUIs relatively trivial.

I didn't believe him though. I mean who would want to be able to write 
cross-platform GUIs easily? Especially smoothly animated ones with alpha 
blending, texture mapping and integrated 2D and 3D.

Seriously though, if I did this, would anyone be interested in buying it to 
develop commercial applications with for, say, 1,000UKP?

Yes, if you're already using OpenGL then there are a lot of advantages to 
having an OpenGL-based GUI. Even if you're not already using OpenGL, it is 
the most cross-platform GUI-capable API and runs on virtually any modern 
computer, typically with performance orders of magnitude better than anything 
you'll get with Qt, GTK, WxWindows or any other software renderer.

I develop for Linux and just had a go on another friend's Apple PowerBook. 
Once you've added <-cclib "-framework Foundation"> to the link line, the 
OCaml code compiles and runs beautifully.

If you want some examples of trivial OpenGL programs written in OCaml, have a 
look at the freebies from my book:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists/visualisation

There are Linux and Mac OS X executables you can just click on. Also, check 
out the examples which come with lablGL and lablglut.

The main omission for me is then the lack of native-looking drop-down menus 
and a save dialog. I tried to port my lablglut-based code to lablgtk but 
failed miserably - I couldn't even get a window with a menu bar and a 
full-size OpenGL widget.

Incidentally, would someone be so kind as to send me some Windows executables 
of my demos? Then we could have the full complement. :-)
