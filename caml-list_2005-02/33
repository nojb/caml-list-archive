AFAIK Barry Jay teaches Ocaml for FP at University of 
Technology, Sydney (in Oz).

The text book isn't Ocaml though .. I mean there isn't
one in English other than the online translation of
the French O'Reilly one.

I also had two Ocaml jobs in Australia, one with
Barry at UTS, where I learned it, and an industrial
one where I specified it myself, and then used it
(the company was a telco, the use was for a language
translator for telco service logic, which has
inspired my open source language Felix)

Two jobs in a row being paid to write Ocaml by
an employer is not bad.. I wish I could get
another one :)
