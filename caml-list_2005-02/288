Okay, so I realised I could just use a Stack to track a walk through the tree...

A couple more questions though:

1. For the Stack, when I put something in it, is it copied or what?
How does that work?

2. How do I make my tree like a hashtable, i.e. modifications are done
in-place? Some sort of nested Map or something? Using lists to build
up the tree would cause pain when wanting to modify it. It would also
seem inefficient to use lists for this particular use case.

Regards,

Jonathan.
