              Twenty First International Conference
                    on Logic Programming

                      October 2-5, 2005
                   Sitges (Barcelona) Spain

             URL: http://www.iiia.csic.es/iclp2005/


ICLP'05, the 21st International Conference on Logic Programming, will
be held in Sitges(Barcelona), Spain, from October 2 to October 5, 2005.
We plan to have several workshops in parallel with the conference.

Workshops have a key role in Logic Programming Conferences. They
provide an ideal platform for the presentation of preliminary work or
novel ideas in a less formal way than the conference itself. They also
are an opportunity to disseminate work in progress, particularly for
new researchers. Workshops also provide a venue for presenting more
specialized topics and opportunities for more intensive discussions,
exchange of ideas, and project collaboration. The topics of the
workshops can cover any areas related to logic programming, including
cross-disciplinary areas.  

To encourage active participation and exchange of ideas, the
workshops will be kept small, preferably under 40 participants.
The format of the workshop will be determined by the organizer(s)
proposing the workshop, but ample time must be allowed for general
discussion. Workshops can vary in length, but the optimal duration
will be half a day or a full day. Having two or three co-organizers
for a workshop is strongly advised.

Workshop Proposal:
==================

The persons intending to organize a workshop at ICLP'05 are invited
to submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and
about two pages in length. They should contain:

  * The title of the workshop.
  * A brief technical description of the topics covered by the workshop.
  * A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.
  * The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page, phone,
    fax) of the workshop organizing committee together with a
    designated contact person as the workshop coordinator.
  * A preliminary plan/schedule for organizing the workshop, including
    the required number of half-days allotted to the workshop.
  * A list of previously-organized related workshops by any of the
    workshop organizing committee. Although previous experience with
    organizing similar workshops is not required, this information will
    be helpful to the Workshop Chair.
  * An estimate of the number of expected attendees.

Proposals are expected in ASCII or LaTeX format. All proposals should be
submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by March 31, 2005.

Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
===========================

  * Producing a "Call for Papers" for the workshop and posting it
    on the net and/or other means. Please provide a web page URL which
    can be linked into the ICLP'05 home page by May 5, 2005.
  * Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference
    program.
  * Reviewing/accepting submitted papers.
  * Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the local
    organizers and the workshop chair.
  * Sending workshop proceedings in LaTeX format to the workshop
    chair for printing, by August 31, 2005 (if the proceedings are to be
    printed by the local organizers)

Reviewing Process:
==================

Each submitted proposal is reviewed by the Workshops Chair and the
Conference Program Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and
that fit the goals and scope of ICLP will be selected.  The decision
will be notified by email to the responsible organizer by April 13,
2005. 

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the
number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every
accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting
place and can print the workshop proceedings, whose LaTeX preparation
is however in charge to the workshop organizers. The workshop
registration fees will be handled together with the conference fees.

Workshop Date and Location:
===========================

All workshops will take place on October 5th, 2005 at the site of the
main conference. ICLP'05 will be held in Sitges (Barcelona), Spain. 
Sitges is a town 15 minutes away from the Barcelona international 
airport and 30 minutes from the center of Barcelona. The town of Sitges 
is situated in the Catalan region of Spain, and it is a well-established 
tourist resort and residential area thanks to its warm climate and fantastic 
natural panoramic views. The conference will be held at Melia Sitges Hotel, 
located on the sea-front facing the Mediterranean and is within five-minute 
walking distance from the city center.
