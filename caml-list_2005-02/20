Sorry for the confusion: I was interested in Unix.fstat and when
somebody told me it does not work on win32 (I do not use win32 myself
but try to write portable code whenever possible), I had a (too) quick
look at the manual which says that [lstat], [fstat] are not
implemented -- should not have put a star.

Maybe the manual could be updated to reflect that?  [IMHO, it would be
  nice if the windows peculiarities were in the ocamldoc comments -- I
  usually use ocamlbrowser...]

Windows gurus here?  (My goal with fstat was to know whether stdin was
connected to a socket or a pipe.)

Thanks for the explanation.  (Still there is
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/ishelllink/ishelllink.asp
but I do not know whether it fits the bill or whether it is worth the
trouble.)
