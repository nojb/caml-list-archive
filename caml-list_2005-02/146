I personally prefer using vi/vim and cli-tools.
But if there would be an IDE, that would be nice
for developers that like to use IDEs.

Well, I'm not sure if I really want to have grown the
OCaml-programmers significantly. It's enough, when I get a
job, where I can do things in OCaml.
If the other people write applications in Assembler,
I don't have a problem with that. ;-)

But what I'm looking for, is to have a COCOA-binding.

(and other GUI-bindings too... the graphics-Modlue is nice,
 but it does not work on OS-X (?!) and to have a true
 GUI-interface to the platform I'm developing on,
 that is what I'm looking for)


Ciao,
