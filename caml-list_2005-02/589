Well, i have written a kind of library called ocaml-ast-analyze. It use
camlp4 to register a printer of source code. You can inject function to
do code analysis using this module and you can be able to analyze
certain part of the code.

I don't have released this library. If you are intersted in it, i can
send you a copy. Can you take a look at the file, and then told me if
you want the source ?

URL : 
http://www.gallu.homelinux.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ocaml-ast-analyze/trunk/?root=svn

And look at :
http://www.gallu.homelinux.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ocaml-gettext/trunk/libgettext-ocaml/pr_gettext.ml?rev=359&root=svn&view=auto

for example.

Kind regard
Sylvain Le Gall

ps : it use camlp4, so it is limited to what camlp4 do, for example i
should use the same command line as camlp4 invocation...
