I use Ocaml at work for writing test harnesses for our 'real'
applications that are in C++/Java. Perhaps a special case, but our main
tools are distributed servers (based on middleware messaging) that perform 
various pricing calculations. Using the native C interface for
themessaging combined with the correctness guaranteed by doing things in
a purely functional manner, gives us a prototype, a test
harness and a correctly implemented 'real' app typically quicker than
writing the whole thing in C++ first and then finding out certain assumptions
are completely wrong!

Of course it helps me become more proficient at Ocaml too :)
