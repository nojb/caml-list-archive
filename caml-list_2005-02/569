On Linux, only Radeon and NVidia cards have even half-way decent OpenGL
support -- and even then you need proprietary drivers for the most recent
ones. I probably don't need to tell you that rendering OpenGL to a
framebuffer via software on a general-purpose CPU (ie. software
rendering) is spectacularly slow. Certainly slow enough to make a GUI
completely unusable.

Maybe you should try Eclipse and the OCaml-plugins:

- http://www.eclipse.org/
- http://eclipsefp.sourceforge.net/ocaml/

Now, I haven't tested the OCaml/C++ support, so I don't know how good
that is, but the Java support in Eclipse is incredible.
