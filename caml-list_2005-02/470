Safe... I think so.
But type safe?!
At least as typesafe as a C-system can be. ;-)

I will explore this in more detail in the next weeks.
I than may say something here in the list, if it matches
the needs of the discussions then (or when I may started
to write some code to marriage Objcetive-C and OCaml (for using
OCaml on Cocoa).

IMHO here are some other people on the list who has explored
ObjC in more detail. I will do that during the next few weeks.

Ciao,
