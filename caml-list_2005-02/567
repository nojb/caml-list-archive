OpenGL provides no buttons and no menues... and similar stuff....

... so you had to reinvent the wheel with OpenGL.

...and that means: if everyone writes his GUI in OpenGL,
the  there are - agaib - as many GUIs as there are programs around...
...and all are reinventing the wheel...

OpenGL is not a GUI-toolkit.

It only provides 3D-API.
