Having seen you start this very discussion on another mailing list,
would you *please* consider taking this question to a list that is
dedicated to C++, just for a change? Frankly, your only reason for
subscribing to this ML seems to be to extol the virtues of Lisp and to
bash C++, which is a nuisance for everyone who reads it in the hope of
learning about OCaml...

Thanks,
Daniel
