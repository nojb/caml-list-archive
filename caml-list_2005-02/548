I'm not in a position to pay that kind of money (just a student right 
now), but in general, it would depend on the licence terms and whether 
you were offering support as well as a license.

It also depends on the product... people have to evaluate it somehow 
before committing money to it.  To raise awareness people have to know 
it exists, which means apps have to use it.
