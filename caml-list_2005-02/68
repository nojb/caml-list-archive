For wrapping trivial or almost-trivial C library interfaces it's great.

I've also *tried* (seriously) to use it for quite a few wrapper libraries
I've created, but invariably it ends up being too much work to get it to
act right, and I just end up writing custom C code (usually with a few
macros to cut down on copy&paste code).

Now I just don't bother anymore and go straight to C.
