Absolutely! It gives a graphical depiction of compilation units and the 
hierarchies of modules they contain. Clicking on a member gives you its type 
and then clicking on "Impl" or "Intf" gives you the implementation (.ml) or 
interface (.mli), respectively. Functions in the core library are documented 
in their interface. You can add extra directories to the listing (I often add 
lablGL) and even your own code.

I'm underselling it too, as it contains a color syntax highlighting editor 
with type inference feedback and numerous other goodies. All in all an 
excellent program. My only gripe is the 3mm-high characters on my dangerously 
high-res monitor.

You'll find an illustrated description of how to use ocamlbrowser on page 
50... :-)
