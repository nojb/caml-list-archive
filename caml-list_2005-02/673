That is nice, but I ask for a different thing.

I looked for a library reference card, that documents
OCaml's libraries as they come in the distribution.

I want be faste in locating a function of the standard
library or of the added libraries like Unix and such stuff,
and I want it as a piece of paper that contains all information
on a piece of DIN A 4 paper, hoping that all stuff can be contained
on one or two pages.
Such a thing with 6 point letters... which can be laid on my desk
near by my computer and that helps me to find functions quicker.

It would be nice to add such thing to the OCaml documentation.


Ciao,
   Oliver
