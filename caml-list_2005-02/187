Mea culpa. I'm still very interested. I can't help but think that 
extending Jeff Henrikson's Forklift FFI to handle Objective-C and 
marrying that to an (improved? revised?) version of your bindings 
wouldn't be a big win, but I confess to having no real roadmap for how 
to get there, and my Copious Free Time(tm) is rather torn between 
wanting to get O'Caml going natively on OS X and wanting to plow 
through TAPL and now ATITAPL and master MetaPRL and concentrate on 
learning how to design modern programming languages.

But at the very least, I'd love to see the current state of your code. 
:-)
