OK. Right but you can not all the time used channels... For TCP/IP, that is
possible, but for low level libraries (as MPI, PVM, PUB etc...) you need
strings and you are blocked by this limitation (except if you read the
values from a file but in this case it is not a fast solution).

Sure it is a hard problem. But I thinks that in the futur (now my bench are
not bench of true applications but bench of the limits of the language,
values that exceed 16Mo are rare), true scientific applications will need to
serialize big values...(big graphs for example)
