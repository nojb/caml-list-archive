Well, but even on those computers will be restrictions in the size.
And I'm sure that with more powerful computers, there will be
more ressource-needing applications/calculations/computations
and so maybe there will be another problem then (maybe it needs
some decades to reach that limit?).

Is the 16MB string-length really a hardware-dependency?
Maybe changing string-representation could help even
on 32 Bit machines to have not such a problem.
But maybe a BigStrings/LongStrings-module would do that
better (because changing the string-representation in the OCaml-core
may be a harder problem...?!)

Ciao,
