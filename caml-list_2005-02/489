I don't think this mirrors the state of affairs in the LISP community 
pretty well. ;-) At least, if you look at the authors of all the cl-* 
packages in debian.

But of course, "fashion languages" that are pushed by companies primarily 
for market share purposes - and not out of a deeper need - are an issue. 
So to speak, every language tries to fix some problem. One barely can 
resist the impression that the primary "problem" that C# tries to fix is 
that Java is not controlled by Microsoft...
