That was a known issue, I had a (not so visible) page on my website 
about that. It was the "relative vs. incremental dilemn"... With a naive 
implementation, I couldn't base the indentation of line 2 on the 
beginning of line 1, so I based it on the keyword "function". Here is an 
idea of what you get if you base the indentation on the beginning of the 
line of the base keyword, without taking care:

let _ =
   something first_arg second_one (if a then
     foo bar
   else
     bar foo)

This week I was away from the network, but kept coding a bit... I tried 
to figure out what tuareg does (cannot read that amount of elisp), and 
did the same in OMLet. I will release it soon on vim.org. I also added 
customization. The current implementation base the indentation on the 
beginning of the line, or the last "(", "[" or "{" before the keyword, 
on the same line, if there's one. As far as I've tried, it's a good trick.

The 4 spaces proposed by S. Luther a nice compromise between the strict 
old indentation and the tricky and meaningless (but nice) new 
indentation. But I think it would require more work for me, and for the 
script, which is already so slow... And I don't think people want it so 
much.

Regarding integration of omlet with the official ocaml support, as far 
as I'm concerned I think it could be done within a few months, when 
OMLet will be considered stable. But Markus Mottl didn't give me his 
advice. There's only a very minor issue about code annotations, because 
I don't like being warned that my VIm is not compiled with python 
support everytime I open a OCaml file, and I'd like to find a good 
solution without Python. Also, I didn't work at all on .mll and .mly 
support.

Packaging omlet separately is OK. Samuel Mimram could do that. I would 
just suggest to wait a bit.

Hope you'll like release 0.7!
