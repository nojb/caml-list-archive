I've been trying to come up with some estimates on the size of the ocaml
community, and I'm wondering if others have come up with anything better.
Here's what I have so far:

- The mailing list is supposed to have about 500 subscribers[1].  Hard to know
  if this number is up-to-date.  I wonder if that number has changed over
  time, and what it is today.

- The OCaml Humps contributors page[2] has about 200 members.

- If you type OCaml into google, you get about 800k hits.  This compares with
  29 million for C++.  "python programming" (without the quotes) gets about 5
  million

- If you type "ocaml resume", you get about 5.5k hits.  If you type "python
  resume", you get about 270k hits.  If you type "C++ resume", you get almost
  1m hits.

- Some schools teach ocaml.  Brown and Caltech apparently have intro ocaml
  courses.  Any other places that teach the language?  Any ideas on how many
  students go through these courses?

- A few companies use ocaml, including Baretta DE&IT, Dassault Aviation,
  LexiFi, Artisan (which has been bought up by AMD?)  Anyone know of other
  such companies?  It would be interesting to get a list togther of companies
  that use ocaml significantly.

I'd be interested of any evidence people have of the size and vibrancy of the
ocaml community.  I'd be particularly interested in evidence of ocaml use in
the United States, since it seems like a majority of ocaml use is outside of
the US.
