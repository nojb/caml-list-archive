Because I don't know about what you all are talking here,
I hope that the intended Camlp4-Tutorial will explain
such things in more detail.

Not another "we know nearly all, and explain some nifty
details, that you also can see, when looking into the sources
and study them some months/years" documentation, please... :->

So, if the indended doc on Camlp4 would
explain in detail what it is good for, what it
provides and how to use it, I (and IMHO many others)
would gain a lot of such a documentation/tutorial.

Explaining the details to pwople who already knew
the most stuff, IMHO is not really needed. This can be
done in discussions on the list (or when people
know the tools, they really can look into the sources,
because they know something about what they are intended to do).

Hoping for a good intruductional tutorial...

Regards,
  Oliver
