Some months ago I googled for Ocaml ans lists (or something similar)
and found a paper on OCaml's list implementation, compared to
"vlists" (whatever a vlist may be).
I didn't read the paper completely, but at a glance - if I remember correctly -,
the vlists would be about 10 times faster than OCaml's current list-implementation...

... why not re-implementing the Lists as those vlists?

(Maybe as a module, if it is too much effort to change the OCaml-core)


Ciao,
