Or there is Ocs (http://will.iki.fi/software/ocs/) - from their page:

"Ocs is an implementation of Scheme, as defined by R5RS. It is
implemented entirely in OCaml and is suitable for embedding in OCaml
programs. It is free, open source software, distributed under a
permissive (two-clause) BSD-style license."
