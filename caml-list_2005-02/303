They are certainly quite powerful, but their garbage collection is 
reference-counted, which makes it rather painful.  The language is also 
extremely verbose, and has little support for higher-order functions.  
That's why I prefer to write in O'Caml, and largely why I wrote the 
O'Caml to Cocoa bridge in the first place.

Yes, OS X is essentially an improved NeXTSTEP, running on a Mach kernel 
with BSD bindings.  I've been quite impressed at what they managed to 
build on a UNIX, though... it blows KDE out of the water in most 
respects (in my opinion).

Agreed.  What the project would need would be people familiar with FFI 
tools such as Forklift, as the existing bindings are not type-checked 
and are slow.
