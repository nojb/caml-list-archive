Matthieu,

Cygwin uses something called "ptys", which are pseudo-terminals
implemented with pipes.  Some Windows applications don't understand those,
so think they're running without a console, and allocate their own.  There
was some work on fixing this -- see the Cygwin mailing list archives for
details, but I don't think there's a definitive resolution.

You most likely run Cygwin's emacs, which creates ptys.  You could try
using non-Cygwin xemacs (I don't know if it speaks X -- I don't use
emacs).

That said, why not use the Cygwin version of O'Caml that does understand
ptys?
