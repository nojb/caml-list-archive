I think licensing would be best done by following TrollTech's example with Qt. 
I'd provide some level of support, of course, but I couldn't be at a user's 
beck and call unless I was compensated appropriately.

My concern is whether or not anyone would be willing to pay me for a 
commercial license. If people only want to use the code for in-house projects 
and to develop open source Linux software then it would be silly for me to 
give it away when I could keep it closed source and sell it (or software 
derived from it).
