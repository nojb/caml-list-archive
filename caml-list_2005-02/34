Unfortunately, someone teaching a language in a course doesn't
always translate into the students using that language after 
the course is over :-(.

However, you, me and Barry, should make it at least 3 people
here in Sydney.au that use O'caml :-).

I'll let you have first shot at any o'caml jobs, but if you
need another hand, let me know :-).

"I believe C++ instills fear in programmers, fear that the interaction
of some details causes unpredictable results. Its unmanageable complexity
has spawned more fear-preventing tools than any other language, but the
solution _should_ have been to create and use a language that does not
overload the whole goddamn human brain with irrelevant details."
