You just have to install the X11 SDK package, which is included in the
developper tools you got with OSX (it is not installed by default).
You can also get it from the X11 download page at apple.
For tcl/tk, you can compile it yourself, or install it through fink or
darwinports. Be sure to install the X11 version.
It is also possible to use labltk/camltk with the aqua version of
tcl/tk, but unfortunately this has some strange side-effects with
ocamlbrowser.
