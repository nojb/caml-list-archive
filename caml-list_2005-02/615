Hi, and thanks a lot, this looks nice (especially the folding support :)

I have just tried it for a few seconds and I found the following identation a 
bit too wide:

let f = function
           |  [] -> foo
           | x::l -> bar

but I would prefer the following:

let f = function
   | [] -> foo
   | x::l -> bar

Anyway, thanks a lot. I will test it more extensively this WE and let you know 
if I find bugs.

Regards,

	Olivier
