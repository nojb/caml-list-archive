OCaml needs an IDE or atleast a (more) functioning Win32 toplevel.
Working with OCaml as a new language was a pain in the ass, which is
why I took to fixing the numerous bugs in the win32 toplevel. A nice
plugin for Eclipse or even sufficient fixes to the toplevel would make
learning OCaml, which to me was a highly interactive process, much
easier. Besides, having a solid IDE lowers the bar for gaining
corporate acceptance. (And yes I know not everyone uses Win32, just
what a lot of people use)
