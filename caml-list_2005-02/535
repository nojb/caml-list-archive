The code uses lablgtk2 for the interface.  If you look in the source
you'll see a ~10 line program called "hello.ml" which uses the
lablgtk2 API.  On Windows, widgets are rendered using Gtk with a
Windows theme applied, so they're not native widgets, although they
look like it.

To get true native widgets across all three major platforms you'd have
to use a different API completely.  WxWidgets is the obvious choice
(http://www.wxwindows.org/).  You'd probably want to start with
SooHyoung Oh's wxcaml
(http://pllab.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/wxcaml/doc/) which was built
using CamlIDL from the WxWidgets headers.

WxWindows isn't really suitable for what I want to do because it
doesn't support a rich canvas widget, nor a good rich text editor.
