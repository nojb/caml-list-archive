       International Conference on Logic Programming
                    Doctoral Consortium

                 Sitges (Barcelona), Spain
                     October 2-5, 2005
          http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~epontell/DC2005
                        -----------


The ICLP Doctoral Consortium (DC) is the first ever doctoral
consortium to be offered as part of the International Conference
on Logic Programming. The DC will take place during ICLP 2005 in
Sitges (Barcelona), Spain. The Doctoral Consortium is designed for
doctoral students working in areas related to logic programming,
who are planning to pursue a career in academia. The Doctoral
Consortium aims to provide students with an opportunity to present
and discuss their research directions and to obtain feedbacks from
peers as well as world-renown experts in the field. The Doctoral
Consortium will also offer invited speakers and panels discussions.

                      ------------

The Doctoral Consortium is held the during the regular activities
of the ICLP 2005 Conference. The aims of the Doctoral Consortium
are:
  * To provide doctoral students working in the field of
    logic programming with a friendly and open forum to
    present their research ideas, listen to ongoing work
    from peer students, and receive constructive feedback
  * To provide  students with relevant information about
    important issues for doctoral candidates and future
    academics
  * To develop a supportive community of scholars and a
    spirit of collaborative research.
  * To support a new generation of researchers with information
    and advice on academic, research, industrial, and non-
    traditional career paths.
The Consortium is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D.
program, though we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students
currently in a Masters program and interested in doctoral studies).
The Consortium is for students at any stage of their doctoral studies
are welcome to apply. Applicants are expected to be conducting research
in the field of Logic Programming; topics of interest include (but
are not limited to):
  * Theoretical Foundations of Logic and Constraint Logic
    Programming
  * Sequential and Parallel Implementation Technology
  * Static and Dynamic Analysis, Abstract Interpretation,
    Compilation Technology, Verification
  * Logic-based Paradigms (e.g., Answer Set Programming,
    Concurrent Logic Programming, Inductive Logic Programming)
  * Innovative Applications of Logic Programming
The Consortium allows participants to interact with established
researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-
answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations. The
Doctoral Consortium will provide the possibility to reflect - through
short activities, information sessions, and discussions - on the
process and lessons of research and life in academia. Each participant
will give a short, critiqued, research presentation.
The Doctoral Consortium will be held on a date to be determined, in
parallel with the regular activities of the ICLP 2005 conference; the
ICLP conference will run from October 2nd to October 5th, 2005. Doctoral
Consortium participants will be offered the opportunity to have their
abstracts published in the ICLP 2005 conference proceedings.

Discussants:
Several renown faculty members and researchers in the field of Logic
Programming will join in evaluating the submission packets and will
participate in the Doctoral Consortium, providing feedback to the
presenters. The list of the discussants will be published at a later
date.
