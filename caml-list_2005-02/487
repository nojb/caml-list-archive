Dear potential Speaker:

We are pleased to inform you that both IPSI Transactions journals are planing some special issues in late 2005 and early 2006, and you are welcome to submit your paper(s), until the deadlines listed below!

IPSI Transactions on Internet Research:

March 31, 2005 -
Special Issue on E-Education: Concepts and Infrastructure

June 30, 2005 -
Special Issue on E-Business: Concepts and Infrastructure


IPSI Transactions on Advanced Research:

March 31, 2005 -
Special Issue on the Research with Multidisciplinary Elements

June 30, 2005 -
Special Issue on the Research with Interdisciplinary Elements

Each submitted paper first undergoes the editor review, and those who pass this first stage are sent to 12 external experts for a rigorous review; decisions are made after at least 6 external reviewers respond! The review is free of charge, but the authors of the accepted papers ar expected to pay the publication fee of E400 per paper (if 4 or 5 or 6 pages of the TIR/TAR format), and the additional fee of E100 per page, for each extra page, till the maximum of 10 pages.

Rigorous reviewing is the major strength of IPSI journals, which is the major contributor to their high quality! Soft copies of the existing issues of TIR and TAR can be seen at the web, and hard copies can be obtained on a special request by email, as indicated on the web, where can find all information!

Sincerely yours,

Prof. Dr. Veljko Milutinovic, Editor-in-Chief
