Maybe i should say, can you do cross-plateform ocaml builds with it ?

Well, that would be obvious. But then again, the interest is to do
cross-plateform builds, which i previously failed to do with ocaml/gtk.

I know how to generate C windows/gtk applications, altough it has not the nice
installer wrapper you mention, with the debian cross-mingw packages.

Well, it was not entirely sure what exactly is included in it, since there is
not a single mention of the ocaml word in the whole body of the email, and
still it was sent to the ocaml mailing list, so ...
