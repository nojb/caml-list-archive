X-Spam-Level: 

Additionally, I developed a very rudimentary binding.  It allowed the 
user to call Cocoa methods from O'Caml, but it had an enormous 
overhead: each method invocation from O'Caml had the overhead of about 
5 method calls from the C glue.  There was a (somewhat more efficient) 
Cocoa-to-O'Caml call method, but I don't remember if I ever finished 
it.

Paul Snively, Nick Burlett and I were working on a more efficient 
bridge, by means of parsing Cocoa headers to automatically generate 
typed bindings which would look like objects to O'Caml, but the project 
fizzled without any real results.  Perhaps someone with more FrontC 
knowledge could resurrect it.  The existing code is not strongly typed: 
you can attempt to pass the wrong number or type of arguments to a 
method, and it will raise an O'Caml exception instead of rejecting it 
at compile time.

The O'Caml-to-Cocoa bridge is not online, but I can send you what code 
we have if you want.
