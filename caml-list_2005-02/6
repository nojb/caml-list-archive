Third International Workshop on

HIGH-LEVEL PARALLEL PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATIONS (HLPP 2005)=20

July 4-5, 2005, Warwick University, Coventry, United Kingdom=20

http://hlpp2005.free.fr
   =20
AIMS AND SCOPE

Parallel and distributed systems are now readily available as their
price/performance ratio continues to improve. But parallel and
distributed programming is still dominated by low-level techniques
such as send/receive message passing.

Sequential programming has long benefited from high-level programming
techniques and tools that have made today's immense range of software
economically viable. Two decades of research into high-level parallel
and distributed programming have produced methods and tools that
improve the price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden
the range of target applications.

Grid systems offer a tremendous computing power. Nevertheless, this
power is far from being effectively exploited. In addition to
technical problems related to portability and access, grid computing
needs new programming paradigms. Research on high level programming
for meta and grid computing is particularly relevant.

This workshop follows HLPP 2001 & HLPP 2003, and is aimed at:=20

computer science and scientific computing researchers, practitioners,
graduate students; high-performance application developers (e.g. in
DBMS, data-mining, parallel model checking, virtual reality)

TOPICS=20

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including (but not limited to) the following aspects of
parallel, distributed, meta and grid computing:

- high-level algorithmic methods for parallel, communication-efficient
  and external-memory computation

- high-level programming models (BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.) and tools=20

- performance models and performance evaluation=20

- high level resource-aware approaches=20

- algorithmic skeletons and constructive methods=20

- object, functional, logic, constraint programming=20

- applications using high-level languages and tools=20

- teaching experience with high-level tools and methods=20

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop and will be
published in a special issue of an international journal (provided
revisions suggested by the referees are made).
