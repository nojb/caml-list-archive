Hello,

is a Library-Quick-reference Guide for OCaml available,
so to have an overview on Names and Types and a *very short*
explanation on it's functionality for each function of each
lib that is part of the OCaml-distribution?

If yes, where can i find it?

If no, wouldn't it a good idea to create something like that?

For many other programs Quick-References/Short-references are
available, and that would shorten development times under
OCaml, especially for people who are not always using each function
and often do not know where to find a certain one (e.g. Sys-module?
Filename-module? Unix-module?, when looking for file_exists or
rename or so).

With such a quick-refcard on my table I would be much faster
than I'am now in OCaml-development.


This may be useful for other programmers to.

Could such a refcard be added to the official OCaml
documentation, please?!

Regards,
   Oliver Bandel
