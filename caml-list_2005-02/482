There is (at least) one construct which is not provided by the regular
syntax (because it is totally useless when writing code by hand) but
which is essential:

  declare <list of str_items> end

This just packs several definitions (str_items) as one single
str_item.
This is extremely useful when replacing one definition written in an
extended syntax by several successive definitions (or zero) written in
OCaml.
