I wonder if the SWIG parser (which is very dirty, but quite permissive)
might be useful in helping to buildup frontc.  I like the idea of frontc
but am using SWIG for bindings mainly because it works on a remarkable
variety of input.  Even though I'm nearly finished with the static types
fork I've promised (now written in ocaml), it still relies on SWIG -xml
to generate the input.  A purer solution would be preferrable if it could
be tuned to accept more input than frontc does now.

I'd be willing to work with you to try to convert the SWIG parser, if 
you're interested in collaborating.  Maybe we can choose some unlanguaged
representation that can be built into both SWIG and frontc ... then it'd 
be possible for both to share bug fixes too (SWIG regularly gets new
hairy template expansion test cases).
