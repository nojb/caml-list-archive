Although there are no courses that I know of at Harvard which set out to
teach OCaml, it has made appearances in a few classes that I have taken.
Specifically, a graduate-level Artificial Intelligence course on
Computational Game Theory that is offered periodically asks its students
to complete its problem sets using OCaml. Also, Prof.  Norman Ramsey's
course on Programming Languages last year included a lecture on "Classes
and Modules in Objective Caml", though I don't think that the students
were asked to write any code in OCaml for that course.
