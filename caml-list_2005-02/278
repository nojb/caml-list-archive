I'm mildly convinced that it works.

Imagine a graph where an arrow is drawn from A to B only if A appears
in the expression to be assigned to B. You can imagine the process of
introducing temporaries as marking a few edges in this graph so that
you break all cycles. One marked edge = one temporary. But since no
identifier appears more than once on the left side, in this graph the
in-degree is at most 1 and each node is part of at most one cycle.
>From this it follows that each marked edge breaks at most one cycle.
Since all your temporaries break at least one cycle the algorithm
should work.
