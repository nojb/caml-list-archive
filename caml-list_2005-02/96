Actually, I wouldn't want to change lists.  Those currently have a tag
= 0, and it would important to leave those untouched for exactly the
reason you described.

Of course, now you've pointed out the flaw in my argument, which is
that lists would be handled differently from constructs :-)

But then you'd need a special case to handle values-containing-
strings, vs. values-not-containing strings, because you'd always want
to have the size attribute of the header reflect the size of the data
in the value.
