The mainstream languages are that way for two reasons: 
(1) They filled a niche at a key moment.  This happens about once a decade, and
by no means selects the "best" language.
(2) They are entrenched (by #1).  When this happens to your language it freezes
and you have to look elsewhere for the cutting edge.

So it all depends on your goals.  Personally, I would prefer for something like
SML to become mainstream, because it is already a relic.  I'd like to see O'Caml
continue as it is - an enormous advantage for those small companies and
individuals who are nimble and adventurous enough to use it, and a reasonably
researchful language.
