Latest Debian Sarge. The commands should have been "M-x caml-types-show-type" 
and "push CTRL-c then CTRL-t". Having compiled with -dtypes, these work. 
However, I can't figure out how to display whole types (it only displays the 
first 70 chars or so).

I just took advantage of a fresh Debian install on my laptop and installed 
Tuareg. It is quite broken under emacs (in the same way as my desktop) but 
xemacs is better. That indentation bug is still there though.

Specifically, in the structure of a module, after a bunch of definitions, I 
have a comment. The first lines of all member definitions after that are all 
incorrectly indented by zero characters (instead of four). I haven't been 
able to boil the example down and I can't give anyone the code, 
unfortunately. :-(

Thanks for your help though!
