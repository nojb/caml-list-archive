Ah, thanks, it reduces to a known problem.

Your argument is fully convincing, thanks (I'm relieved,
since I've already implemented the algorithm :)

Indeed, thanks to everyone who contributed!

It probably wasn't in the first place, but this list has a lot
of friendly people with theoretical knowledge and analytical skills:
seemed like a good place to ask.

However, the algorithm could be applied in Ocaml in the circumstances
which lead me to the problem, namely tail rec-call optimisation.

Is Ocaml doing this already?

>From the ackermann tests I did it looks like stack
frame size is dominant in heavily recursive routines,
and the extra variables introduced by a non-optimal tail
call are only temporaries, so perhaps it isn't worthwhile,
as Marcin suggested, but then I don't know anything about 
how Ocaml works..
