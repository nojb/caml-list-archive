To clarify, here's an example of what I'm talking about:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/temp/smoke.png

This is a screenshot of a cross-platform vector graphics editor I've been 
writing. The GUI is done entirely in OpenGL, overlaid on the vector graphics 
being edited.

As it is based upon Smoke, the entire editor is only 2,166 lines of 
straightforward OCaml code. It features:

1. Vector graphics editing (the "cursor" and "line" tools).
2. An optionally-visible, snapable grid (the "hash" tool).
3. Smooth panning and zooming (the "eye" tool).
4. Native-format import and export.
5. EPS and SVG export.
6. Dynamically-loadable OCaml byte-code tools for the tool-bar (so users can 
create their own plug-in tools and sell them).

Of course, awesome performance, anti-aliasing, transparency, gradient and 
radial fills and many other features are inherited from Smoke.

I'd have thought that seasoned OCaml hackers would be able to knock out ass- 
kickingly good commercial applications in no time with a library like this...
