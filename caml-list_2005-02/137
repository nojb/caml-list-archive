  There is nothing wrong with a plain old editor, but for many projects an
IDE can improve development time significantly.

  Of course I wasted time! That is precisely the point: I shouldn't have
had to look for such tools. My point is not about my personal project.
That was just to illustrate the general point: to attract more
programmers, there is a need for more development tools, in particular
user-friendly, and dare I say, Windows-based tools. There is a need for
such tools, specially if one wants to attract two key players:
first-time programmers, and managers of software development projects.
Without them, there is not much chance to make the O'Caml community grow
significantly.
