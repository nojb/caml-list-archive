Indeed, the following twelve seem to be written in OCaml:

Unison, FFTW, MATHPLOT, WDialog, PXP, GeneWeb, SwiftSurf, FaCiLe, pxpvalidate, 
Camlserv, Lazy-L and JSON.

I just had a look at sourceforge, which has far more projects (14,325 C, 
14,813 C++ and 14,074 Java) by comparison, and the accredited language seems 
to be wrong much more often. Assuming that all of the 132 SML projects are 
actually in OCaml, this gives 155 projects OCaml, i.e. about two orders of 
magnitude less common that the most popular languages.

Also, I think that web searches for "resume" and "CV" are likely to be 
inaccurate. Searching for "written in *" seems more reasonable. This gives:

792,000 Java
636,000 C
424,000 Perl
312,000 C++
221,000 Python
92,900 C#
30,100 Ruby
20,300 Lisp
11,700 Scheme
5,240 ocaml
974 caml

Again, OCaml is about two orders of magnitude below the most popular 
languages.
