X-Spam-Level: 

A syntax colorer for the multi-platform (Win32 and GTK+/Linux) 
Scintilla editing component and SciTE text editor is available at 
http://www.rftp.com/Downloads.shtml.

Source, SciTE properties file and Windows DLL are included (not to 
mention installation instructions).  As the "caml.properties" file is 
easily edited, and especially because this is an *initial* release, 
feedback on anything besides my choice of colors is welcome! :)

Note that it does properly handle nested OCaml comments (but not 
mis-matched comment delimiters in strings in comments...), but does 
not currently implement the Scintilla "folding" operation - between 
the syntactic richness/complexity of OCaml itself and the variety of 
coding styles, it was not immediately obvious if any folding strategy 
would please anybody!  Again, comments *are* solicited.

The license is the same as Scintilla and SciTE - free usage for any 
type of project - see the included License.txt from the Scintilla and 
SciTE sites for details.
