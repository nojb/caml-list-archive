And like HOC (somebody wrote about this yesterday),
gtk seems also to be waste of ressources.

At least when using Gnome it seems to me as blaoted as qt/KDE is.

Well, it's some yeras ago, but I always was happy when I could use
fvwm2 or similar smart XFree-stuff, because it worked stable and
didn't used all ressources....

So when I hear from Qt/GTK I always get shuddered. This is a bit like
reiimplementing M$-Windows on Linux/Unix and I don't want to have stupid
GUIs!

Keep it small and simple.

Don't blow it up.

Ciao,
   Oliver
