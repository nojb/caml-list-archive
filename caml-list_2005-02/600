Thanks. I will have a look.

But what seems strange to me is that my own version of the toplevel 
works fine...

I use Ocaml at work (this explains my use of windows - but not all the 
time...). Usually, except little standalone utilities, I generate DLLs, 
which are called by other languages (Java, Labview, C++). I do not know 
how to do those DLLs with cygwin tools. And I would have to use mingw 
version because of licence problems.
