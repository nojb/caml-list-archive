A cooperation between Sun Microsystems and IBM&Co. in conjunction with
liberal & high evolutive communities would result in an nearly
unbeatable programming platform.

My evaluation has shown: this is a non achievable goal, as stubborness
and egoism rules - instead of reason and cooperation.

Thus I leave all those ridiculous folks behind, which will continue to
do an excellent job in keeping the very promising JAVA platform far
below the technological level it could be
"

Of course It's a sad day.

Censorship (NetBeans, Eclipse) has forced me to move.

No platform is _really_ open, thus I cannot build on them:

"I'm sure there is one community out there which will realize immediatly
the benefits of an high-evolutive system. "

During the 6 months evaluation i've extracted several constructs.

"How it should be to become high evolutive"

-

I don't know OCAML.

Basicly I would like to do everything in C++.

But development must go quicker.

-

Possibly it's time to structure OCAML projects in a way similar to
Sun's Java, NetBeans and especially IBM&Co's Eclipse (but of course more
efficient and evolutive):

http://lazaridis.com/case/ide/project/index.html

www.osgi.org and similar standards should (whenever possible) be used.

Companies in the Embedded World should be intrested in an OCAML osgi
implementation.

[Note: i've not verified technical and legal applicability]

-

osgi is just a detail.

The goal would be: to make a high competitive andhigh evolutive
programming platform / Rich Client Platform based on OCAML.

-

My question is essentially:

How many of those constructs are already supported by OCAML (and the
surrounding open-source-projects):

http://lazaridis.com/case/stack/index.html

Please notify the people within the relevant OCAML communities about
this thread.
