...well, I did not try to install gtk-stuff on Mac OS-X.

But even if I had do this... the question was, if there is a
native OS-X interface *without X11*, and gtk uses X11.

So this is not the direction to go...

P.S.: Any of these windowing stuff/GUIs needs windows and point/pixels,
      dialogs, colors, buttons, text, graphics,...

      ... and even if they are all distinct, they are also common.
      ... it may be necessary to provide a High-Level GUI-language/DSL
      to create GUIs.

      When using HTML for describing web-layout, this Weblanguage/DSL
      called HTML does not make any assumptions about implementation
      of webbrowsers or programming APIs.
    
      Maybe it is necessary to provide a high level language similar
      to HTML, but intended for creating GUIs in compiled programs.

      Or maybe it even makes sense to use HTML (or a subset) (or a
      superset (?!) (xml?)) to create native GUIs (e.g. with code generators).
