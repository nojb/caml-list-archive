Additionally, GTK provides file dialogs at the level of GTK widgets:
from GTK you can create a file dialog and pack in your own widgets (like
a preview when loading an image or a "file type" dropdown).  This is too
low of a level to allow an API that abstracts across the Windows file
dialogs.

[getting further off ocaml-list territory, but...]
Though it depends on your application's target audience, I think you
should use Wimp only as a last resort.  Programs atop GTK+ look and
behave subtly different from the way they behave in Windows, and I fear
that using Windows-native-looking widgets will only serve to
frustrate/annoy users further with the differences.  If you're making a
professional application the Proper Thing is to abstract away the common
parts and write the GUI twice.
