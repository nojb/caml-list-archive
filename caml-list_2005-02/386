Ok, then if you see it that way: the major difference then is that you do 
not have to go through the daunting process of implementing all of the 
runtime system so that it is (1) fast, (2) bugfree, (3) sufficiently 
complete to be useful. Furthermore, you gain the ability to use 
already existing libraries.

Anything else is in >95% of all cases an exercise in Greenspunning.

Well, yes, but this can be studied to great extent without the drawbacks 
of creating incompatibility boundaries, see above.

That's how it's supposed to be. Especially scheme tries to be nothing else 
but just the minimal "functional assembly language". So one can put other 
languages on top of it.

Judging from the .NET CLR specification, I'd say that conceptually, scheme 
does the far better job, as it does not treat such lots of non-fundamental 
ad-hoc concepts (in particular, everything related to OO) as fundamental.
