It would be wonderful to have one of those -- currently one doesn't 
exist, and I haven't seen any indications that anyone is working on 
one.  I tried to look into starting one up a while back, but I was 
never able to figure out where to start (I'm a little slow, eh...).

Huh?  It works just fine under OS X's X11 distribution.  And if you 
want to do graphics under Aqua, you can look at this package 
<http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~henry/ter/>.  Additionally, the labltk 
module (granted, it's not "graphics", but it can be used for not quite 
beautiful GUIs) can be used under Aqua using the directions found here 
<http://wiki.cocan.org/getting_started_with_ocaml_on_mac_os_x>.  
Finally, for a quick 'n' dirty cocoa-esque interface for scripting 
purposes, you might want to look into Pashua 
<http://www.bluem.net/downloads/pashua_en/> it's easy enough to get 
rolling with it on your own, but I've got a basic module lying around 
somewhere for interfacing with Pashua if anyone wants it.

None of these are as nice as a set of bindings to Cocoa would be, but 
they can come in handy
