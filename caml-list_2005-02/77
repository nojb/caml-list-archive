I think part of the problem is that those are domain-specific
notations, whereas S-expressions are used for general purpose (in the
domain of expressing programs = data).

Differently put, in that they are syntax they try to cover a "broader"
(not in the "there are xxx musicians and yyy coders" sense) domain
than in what they are useful (the domain of generically representing
expressions).

A naive and not quite matching example of what I mean is that musical
notation isn't used for encoding sample data.

Some ex-developer of the Dylan language makes some interesting points
about S expressions in a response to Arc (in the feedback on Arc text
file on paulgraham.com).
