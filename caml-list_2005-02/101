Some weeks ago I explored the Marshal-Module.
While doing some first-steps experiments form within the
toplevel, I got a crash with a SegFault.

IMHO Marshal-module should be removed from the Stdlib.
Or if it is intended to stay, it should be reimplemented,
so that it never can crash in this way!

It's too ugly to rely uon unreliable stuff...
