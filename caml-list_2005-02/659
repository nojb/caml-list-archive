Well, I have now seen that here is no ocamlbrowser installed.
The resason seems to be that here is no complete X11/XFree
development environment. I have OS-X here and there is a
X11 binary, but it seems, here are no headers and libs
to compile own X11-code...?!

On my old Linux box I had ocamlbrowser installed, but never used.

Now I have no possibility to use this tool. :(


Ciao,
