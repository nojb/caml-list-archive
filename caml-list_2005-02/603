Yes, Yves Bertot has come long ago with the same problem, and I remember 
having submitted a feature-wish to the Ocaml team.

Indeed, I've got such a camlp4 translator. I do not advertize it much, 
because it's not very robust. In particular, if you have defined your own 
customized "list" datatype or reused any of the Coq standard library 
names, that will lead to problems. Nevertheless, in normal situation, it 
will do what you expect. The script (containing instructions) is:

In particular, there is a portion to uncomment if you want the sumbool 
type (left|right) to be translated to boolean and hence take advantage
of "if ... then ... else" syntax.

Cheers,

Pierre
