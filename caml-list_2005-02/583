Mmm, i don't quite follow that. the lpd sits between the program output and
the system queues or something like that ? You use gsprint to generate the
printable files from .ps ones, and send it to the lpd queue, which sends it to
the disk, or the other way around, you send the .ps to the lpd, which sends it
to the gsprint and then to the disk.

Yes, i guess that would be interesting.
