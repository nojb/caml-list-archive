Hello,

I know that a lot of course of Ecole Polytechnique ( X ) in IT use OCaml
as a support ( maybe it comes from the fact that some OCaml developper are
teaching here : Didier Remy, Luc Maranget... ). I learn OCaml there, and
i still use it on a daily basis / but not at work.

Regard
Sylvain Le Gall

ps : i don't have any problems concerning OCaml, i think it is a great
programming language, i thank the INRIA for giving us such a good tool.
