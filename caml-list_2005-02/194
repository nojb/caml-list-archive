Hi,

I had looked shortly at the code... but it seems I have to learn a lot
more of OCaml-C-Binding-stuff as well as Objective-C.
So I started to learn again Objective-C in more detail.

As far as I can see, the Classes of the Cocoa-Lib are very
powerful!!!

I will start to write some small Applications in Objective-C under OS-X
as soon as possible. But bigger stuff I would prefer to write in OCaml.

If I maybe will have enough experience with ObjC and COCOA,
I will try to marriage it with the Ocaml-C-binding (but this
is new to me too).

If I may have some time to visit the code,  or to test it with
expermimental programs, I can look into it.
But now it seems to me, that I have to learn the basics of these
different worlds in more detail.

I came from ANSI-C and have done the most work on Linux. Then I have done
a lot of Perl-programming on Linux too.

But the Mac-OS-World is different (but very impressing, what they are doing
there... they seem to have a lot of that NeXt-Step-Stuff integrated into OS-X!)


I hope that there are some more people out there who are
interested to - maybe - start a project to integrate
COCOA and OCaml. It seems to me, that a powerful library for
OS-X-GUI (COCOA) for OCaml could be a nice thing for many people.

Are there more OS-X developers or are there more OCaml-developers?
And how many OCaml-developers are working at OS-X?
And if there woule be such a binding... ?!

Best regards....
       ... I hope to have enough time for doing more ObjC...


Ciao,
   Oliver

 had us learn ocaml for the class and we used it exclusively. I like it so
 much better than c++! Hope this helps." (Jeff Shaw on caml-list)
