Actually, not only is [LargeFile.]fstat implementable under Win32, but 
so are [LargeFile.]ftruncate... not to mention that pause and alarm 
*could* be done also, but possibly not as cleanly as the former four.

Details on the above:

ftruncate and LargeFile.ftruncate would work on ALL Win32 platforms, 
using ::SetFilePointer and ::SetEndOfFile (the "::" is what I use to 
distinguish API calls from app or C runtime calls).

fstat and LargeFile.fstat would (according the .NET 2003 C Run-Time 
Library Reference) work on all Win32 platforms EXCEPT Windows 95, 
using _fstati64.  Note that one needs to examine the actual sys/stat.h 
file to see that "_S_IFIFO" is used to denote pipes.

alarm could be done with ::SetTimer, and even be made to work in 
concert with pause, which could use (pick your favorite variant) some 
form of ::[Msg]WaitFor{Single,Multiple}Object[s]... but you would need 
to take some care WRT Windows event processing. :)

As for the ".lnk" files, they don't really correspond with *nix 
notions of either "hard" or "symbolic" links, so attempts at mapping 
them are bound to disappoint some (if not all).
