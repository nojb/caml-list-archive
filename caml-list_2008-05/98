                               CALL FOR PAPERS

                     Workshop on Generic Programming 2008

                    Victoria, Canada, 20th September 2008

     http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/wgp2008/cfp.{html,pdf,ps,txt}

     The Workshop on Generic Programming is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN
     and forms part of ICFP 2008.  Previous Workshops on Generic
     Programming have been held in Marstrand (affiliated with MPC),
     Ponte de Lima (affiliated with MPC), Nottingham (informal
     workshop), Dagstuhl (IFIP WG2.1 Working Conference), Oxford
     (informal workshop), Utrecht (informal workshop), and Portland
     (affiliated with ICFP).

Scope
-----

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general.  Generic programs often embody non-traditional
kinds of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by
suitably instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal
programs, the parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in
structure; for example they may be other programs, types or type
constructors, class hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

   Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both
to practitioners and to theoreticians, but only recently have generic
programming techniques become a specific focus of research in the
functional and object-oriented programming language communities. This
workshop will bring together leading researchers in generic
programming from around the world, and feature papers capturing the
state of the art in this important emerging area.

   We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

   o adaptive object-oriented programming,
   o aspect-oriented programming,
   o component-based programming,
   o generic programming,
   o meta-programming,
   o polytypic programming,
   o programming with modules, and so on.

Submission details
------------------

   Deadline for submission:        30th June 2008
   Notification of acceptance:     14th July 2008
   Final submission due:           28th July 2008
   Workshop:                       20th September 2008

Authors should submit papers, in PostScript or PDF format, formatted
