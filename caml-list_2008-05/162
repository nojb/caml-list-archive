Sorry, but it's not us who provoke. There is this F# fanboy who tries to
play his games, and doesn't say what his motivations are. You know when
there is money involved there are interests.

I'll try to write something. I have to be careful, however, because we
have competitors, and they are also after such information. Maybe I pick
one of our subsystems. That should be good enough for a case study while
not revealing too many details.
