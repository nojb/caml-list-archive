                                  LPAR'08
                 15th International Conference on Logic for
             Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning

                             November 23-27, 2008

                         Carnegie Mellon University
                                 Doha, Qatar

                      http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/lpar08



The series of International  Conferences on Logic for  Programming, Artificial
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR)  is a forum where,  year after year, some of
the most  renowned   researchers    in  the  areas  of  automated   reasoning,
computational  logic, programming  languages and  their  applications come  to
present  cutting-edge results,  to discuss advances   in these fields,  and to
exchange ideas in a  scientifically  emerging part   of  the world.  The  2008
edition will be held  in Doha, Qatar,  on the premises  of the Qatar campus of
Carnegie Mellon University.

Logic  is a fundamental organizing principle  in nearly  all areas in Computer
Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational to the applied. At
one extreme, it  underlies computability and  complexity theory and the formal
semantics of programming languages. At the other,  it drives billions of gates
every day in   the digital circuits of  processors  of all kinds. Logic  is in
itself  a  powerful programming  paradigm  but it   is also the quintessential
specification language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems to
networked infrastructures. It is logical  techniques that link  implementation
and specification through formal methods such as automated theorem proving and
model  checking.   Logic is  also  the stuff  of knowledge  representation and
artificial intelligence. Because of its ubiquity, logic has acquired a central
role in Computer Science education. 

New  results in  the   fields  of  computational  logic  and applications  are
welcome.  Also welcome are more  exploratory  presentations, which may examine
open  questions and raise  fundamental  concerns about  existing theories  and
practices. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

 * Automated reasoning                * Description logics
 * Interactive theorem proving        * Non-monotonic reasoning
 * Implementations of logic           * Specification using logics
 * Proof assistants                   * Logic in artificial intelligence
 * Program and system verification    * Lambda calculus
 * Model checking                     * Constructive logic and type theory
 * Rewriting and unification          * Computional interpretations of logic
 * Logic programming                  * Logical foundations of programming
 * Constraint programming             * Logical aspects of concurrency
 * Logic and databases                * Logic and computational complexity
 * Modal and temporal logics          * Knowledge representation and reasoning
 * Proof-carrying code                * Reasoning about actions
 * Translation validation             * Proof planning
 * Logic for the semantic web         * Effectively presented structures
 * Foundations of security            * Logic of distributed systems

                 
Invited Speakers
----------------

It  has been a   tradition  of LPAR to  invite   some of the most  influential
researchers in   the focus areas  to discuss  their work and  their vision for
their fields. We are honored that the following members  of the community have
accepted this invitation. 

 * Edmund Clarke, Carnegie Mellon University (USA)
 * Amir Pnueli, New York University (USA)
 * Michael Backes, Saarland University and MPI-SWS (Germany)
 * Thomas Eiter, Technical University of Vienna (Austria)


Submission Instructions
-----------------------

Submissions must not substantially overlap  papers that have been published or
that  are  simultaneously   submitted to   a journal   or  a conference   with
proceedings.  Papers  should be  submitted  in Postscript or Portable Document
Format (PDF); papers submitted in a proprietary  word processor format such as
Microsoft Word cannot be considered. Submissions can be of two types: 

 * Regular papers  are  meant to  describe  solid  new research  results. They
   can be up to  15 pages long in LNCS  style, including figures, bibliography
   and appendices. 
 * Experimental and tool papers are  intended  to describe implementations  of
   systems,   to report experiments with  implemented   systems, or to compare
   implemented systems. They can be at most 8 pages long in the LNCS style.

Both  types  of  papers  can     be electronically   submitted by     visiting
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar2008.  Prospective authors  are
required to   register  a title and    an abstract a  week  before   the paper
submission deadline (see below).

As with the previous editions, the proceedings of LPAR'08 will be published in
Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes   in Computer Science   series. They  will  be
available at the conference.

In   keeping with  the  tradition  of LPAR, researchers   and  practioners are
encouraged to  report on interesting  work in progress by submitting abstracts
of up  to 5 LNCS  pages, to  be   selected for  a short-paper  session.  These
abstracts will not be printed  in the proceedings of LPAR'08  and they have  a
separate submission deadline (see below).


Participation
-------------

Authors  of accepted papers  are required to ensure that  at least one of them
will  be present at the  conference. Papers that do not  adhere to this policy
will be removed from the proceedings.
