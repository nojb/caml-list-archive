Richard,

There is no need to get angry.

Ancient is a nice and useful module.  Thank you for writing and sharing
it.

You brought it forward as a solution for inter-process message-passing after
I proposed a faster Marshal designed for shared memory IPC.  Ancient could
fulfill that role, provided someone writes a way to copy a value out of the
ancient heap, otherwise we'll (a) miss the usual polymorphic operators and
(b) risk storing dangling references or inappropriately mutating ancient
values.  That's just a small function and would increase the usefulness of
your module.

PS.Maybe a 64-bit address space would be enough to generate a unique address
for every ancient value so that they could be deleted using munmap.
