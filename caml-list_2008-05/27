We are proud to announce the first public release of core, Jane
Street's own alternative to OCaml's standard library.  We use this
library as the base for our own development, and we hope people on the
outside will find some use for it as well.

People should be warned that core is still in flux: there are
interfaces that we have plans to change, so if you're not willing to
come along for the ride, you shouldn't use it.  Also, be warned that
conformance with the OCaml standard library is not a goal, and we have
already deviated from it in a number of ways.  It's also worth noting
that we have only used and tested this library on x86 and x86-64 on
Linux, and we make no claims about other platforms.

You can find the library here:

   http://ocaml.janestcapital.com/?q=node/13

along with three other libraries that you will need to use along with
it: type-conv, sexplib and bin-prot.  These three libraries
provide macros for generating functions for serializing and
deserializing types. sexplib uses a human-readable s-expression
format, and bin-prot uses a high-performance binary protocol, and
type-conv is the common base of the other two libraries.  This is
also the first public release of bin-prot, and like sexplib, that
library can be used independently of core.

If you have any comments or patches, we'd love to hear about it.  Our
blog is a great place for comments:

   http://ocaml.janestcapital.com/?q=node/27

and patches should be sent to opensource@janestcapital.com.

All of the released libraries are licensed under the
LGPL-plus-linking-exception that is used by the OCaml standard
library.
