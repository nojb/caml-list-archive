This is completely wrong.  A few machines have a simple model like
that, but they were all built in the last century.  Nowadays, writing
to memory is more like broadcasting a message and having no idea when
it will arrive at each destination.  And if you write to another piece
of memory, you don't know in what order the updates will become
visible to a given processor.

You are neglecting a very important parameter, which is called the
"memory model" of your multiprocessor.
