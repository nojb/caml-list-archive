Yes.  (depending on the functionality provided and the quality of
implementation of course.  And I don't think we'll accept any patches
without corresponding unit tests.)

We haven't gotten it to build yet, sadly.  There are some issues with
preprocessing and with packed libraries that we haven't gotten around to
fixing.  Once we (or anyone else) fixes it, we'll post the docs.
