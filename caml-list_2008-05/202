Lets not start a platform war on this thread.  I have *plenty* of gripes
with Linux as well.  I was merely digressing, and was sniping at the high
cost of platform specific development.  If you want to discuss Windows
programming gripes, Joel Spolsky's forum has plenty, even with regard to the
idea that things have been better lately.  ocaml+qt does not count.  If
you're using ocaml+qt, then you've basically sidestepped the issues with
writing code for Windows.
