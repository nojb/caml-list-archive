You cannot degrade memory consumption without also degrading performance. 
Moreover, there are hidden costs such as the added complexity in a lexer 
which potentially has 256x larger dispatch tables or an extra indirection for 
every byte read.

Sure. I don't mind unicode being available. I just don't want to have to use 
it myself because it is of no benefit to me (or many other people) but is a 
significant cost.
