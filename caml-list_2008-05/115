A friendly word of advice from a member of the Erlang
Community, which just suffered an endless thread with the
subject "Why Erlang sucks", triggered by a similar blog
article on Erlang:

Please change the subject Now!

The surely unintended consequence of such a blog article
(which was otherwise ok, btw) is that Google will now
find 336 hits on "ocaml sucks", threatening to exceed
Erlang's corresponding 337 hits any minute now.

But it's your party. I'll go back to lurking now. (:

BR,
Ulf W
