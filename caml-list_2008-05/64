I'm aware that it's the normal behaviour of ocamldoc. I'm just looking
for a work-around or a plug-in.

I wrote that in my first post :)
More seriously, it's ok if I have only one or two modules. But if I want
to comment both the creation of Sub and the actual contents of Sub, it's
not really a good method. Even more so since I have 70+ modules
developed separately, which I attempt to present with a consistent
Java-style package hierarchy. That would mean copying and pasting about
9000+ lines of code for the moment, with more coming, and nasty bugs
lurking whenever the source packages are updated.

I have a link to an empty Sub.SubSub page. Is that normal behaviour ?

Cheers,
 David
