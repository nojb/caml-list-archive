It is suggested in that bug report that turning off address space
randomization should make the problem go away.  But I have turned this
off, and there is no difference.

Also I checked the source to our caml_aligned_mmap function and it is
essentially the same as Markus Mottl's version in his comment in that
thread (this has been reported in 3.10.1 & 3.10.2).  It even includes
a reference to that bug, indicating that the version we are using
includes this patch.

I'd still like to know if anyone can reproduce this case.

Rich.
