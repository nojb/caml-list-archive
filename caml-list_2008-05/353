AFAIK, ocaml's marshalling doesn't depend on the version, and is
architecture independent (there is only a limitation with integer
overflow when passing more than 31-bit integer values from 64-bit to
32-bit). So marshalling should be sufficient for your needs.
It is however sensitive to the data format you use (the types for your
data), and there is currently no way to verify that the type has not
changed between two versions of a program.
