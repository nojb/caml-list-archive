If you (Florent) want to rely on the standard Hashtbl module, I would 
strongly advise against making assumptions such as "the implementation is 
unlikely to change". Think of the situation 5 years later, when the 
implementation actually changes, you've left the company 3 years before, 
and the maintainer has to figure why the program returns messed up 
results... 
I bet you wouldn't like to be this maintainer.

It's like drunk driving or forgetting the condom: just don't do it...
