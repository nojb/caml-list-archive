You need to make sure to use the ocaml package which has the fix in
it.  (It was only fixed on Thursday last week).  These are the
packages minimum versions which contain the fix:

  ocaml >= 3.10.1-3  (for F-9)
  ocaml >= 3.10.2-2  (for Rawhide)

Because the packages are so new, you may need to enable the
updates-testing repository temporarily to get the new version.  I
think the command is:

  yum --enablerepo=updates-testing install ocaml

or you can edit some file under /etc/yum.repos.d/ to enable the
repository permanently.

OMake (ocaml-omake) is included in Fedora 9 (and 8), but possibly you
need to enable the updates or updates-testing repository to get it,
since it was only added a couple of weeks ago:

  https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F9/FEDORA-2008-3725

Here's a complete list of packages in Fedora:

These don't fix the problem on Fedora.  The fix needs a patch to the
OCaml compiler.  The details are here, but as emphasized above, please
use the Fedora packages, don't build stuff by hand.
