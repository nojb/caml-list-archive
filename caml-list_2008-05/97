Yes, we came a similar conclusion.

However there is a MAP_32BIT flag that you can add to mmap which makes
it return low memory addresses.  There are two problems with this,
namely (a) the flag is only available on x86-64 (and we have the same
problem on ppc64), and (b) it limits the whole heap to 1 or 2 GB.
Nevertheless this is the solution we have gone with for now.

Hopefully OCaml 3.11 will arrive before Fedora 10 is released, in
which case we'll just upgrade.

Backporting all that hash table code into OCaml 3.10 didn't look like
fun to me :-(
