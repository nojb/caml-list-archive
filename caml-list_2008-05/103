The article is not about trashing Ocaml as a language. It's about
looking at it *as a user of the language* and seeing how it could be
improved. I agree that it's a healthy thing to do.

It's not necessary, and certainly not healthy, to create a community
that refuses to acknowledge flaws and room for growth in the language
we're trying to nurture. It hinders growth. An open dialogue and a
thoughtful discussion of the issues is the best thing we can do for
ourselves.

Cheers,
Matt
