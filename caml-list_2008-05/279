UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT

http://www.iist.unu.edu/www/job/pearl.html.


Two post-doctoral researcher positions are now open at International =
Institute for Software Technology, United Nations University (UNU-IIST, =
http://www.iist.unu.edu). UNU-IIST is a Research and Training Centre of =
the United Nations University. It serves developing countries to help =
them attain self-reliance in software technology by training their young =
scientists and engineers.=20

The positions are funded for three years by Macau Sci.&Tech. Development =
Fund and UNU-IIST through "PEARL --- Process expansion: action =
refinement in the large", a project in collaboration with University of =
Macau (UM, http://www.umac.mo/).=20

The project covers topics broadly in:

a) Developing `grainless' semantic theories for concurrent systems, =
where coarse grain actions can be refined into (subsystems of) fine =
grain actions or reversely fine grain actions atomised into coarse grain =
actions.

b) Exploiting the freedom of moving across levels of abstraction (i.e. =
grain size) to develop scalable verification techniques (model-checking) =
and incremental development methods (law-based).=20

c) Application of the theories, techniques and methods to the =
verification and development of concurrent non-blocking algorithms, =
multithreaded Java programs (with weak-ordering memory model) and =
web-based transaction systems.

These positions are ideal for young researchers who would like to =
develop their academic research careers by working in an excellent =
academic setting. They provide a unique opportunity to join an institute =
that has proven experience in, and dedication to, the training of young =
researchers, in formal methods and theoretical computer science.

Requirements
------------

We are seeking young research scientists with (or in the process of =
obtaining) PhDs in computer science. Good English speaking and writing =
skills are necessary. The successful applicants should have a profound =
knowledge of the semantics, specification and verification of concurrent =
systems. Experience in simulation and data refinement techniques, =
process algebra model-checking (esp. CSP) and action/atomicity =
refinement will be an advantage.=20

Besides research, the successful applicants will also be involved in =
helping to supervise postgraduate students from developing countries =
recruited to the project as UNU-IIST fellows.=20


Conditions
------------
The postdoctoral positions are contract appointments starting with one =
year and renewable for another two years, depending on performance. =
Salary will be in the range 2000-3000 USD per month paid without =
deduction of tax. UNU-IIST will provide medical insurance and a =
fully-furnished & rent-free two-bedroom apartment (exclusive of utility =
expenses).

The Research Group
-------------------

The successful applicants will be working in a joint research group at =
UNU-IIST and UM. The research group is led by Dr. Jeff Sanders, =
Principal Research Fellow of UNU-IIST. Other members of the group =
include Dr. Qiwen Xu of UM and Dr. Xu Wang of UNU-IIST.=20

Further information is available from:

Jeff Sanders
Jeff@iist.unu.edu


The City=20
---------

Macao is a Special Administrative Region of China, about 40km from Hong =
Kong, the other side of the Pearl River estuary. It is a small, safe =
city, predominantly Chinese in culture but with strong Portuguese =
influences and an active expatriate community of people from many =
countries. There are schools that teach in English, Chinese and =
Portuguese.=20


The Application
----------------

Potential applicants are suggested to send a CV, 2-3 recent publications =
(relevant to the project) and a covering letter with the contact details =
of three referees by email to vacancy@iist.unu.edu, quoting the job =
reference PEARL-1.


The Deadline
----------------
Application submission is now open and will remain so until suitable =
candidates are found. The selection procedure, however, will start on 31 =
July and the positions ideally start as soon as possible afterwards.=20
