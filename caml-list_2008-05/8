                             The CICM Workshop on 
        Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics (ESARM)

              Call for Papers - Submission Deadline - Monday 5th May
              ------------------------------------------------------

The CICM 2008 Workshop on Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for 
Mathematics (ESARM) will be held as part of the Conferences on Intelligent 
Computer Mathematics, in Birmingham, United Kingdom, 26th July - 2nd August, 
2008. See the WWW page ...
    http://www.cs.miami.edu/~geoff/Conferences/ESARM/
This workshop will bring together practioners and researchers who are 
concerned with the development and application of automated reasoning for 
mathematics. The workshop will discuss only "really running" systems and 
applications, and not theoretical ideas that have not yet been translated 
into working software. More details are on the WWW page.

Submission of papers for presentation at the workshop, and proposals for 
system and application demonstrations at the workshop, are now invited. 
Submissions will be refereed, and a balanced program of high-quality 
contributions will be selected. The selected contributions will be printed 
as workshop proceedings, and will also be published electronically. The 
submission deadline is 5th May, notification of acceptance is on 13th June, 
and final versions are due 7th July. Submission details are on the WWW page.

We hope that you will submit a paper, and be part of ESARM.
