Ok, I'll take your word on that.

Yes and no.

* Batteries Included = 
** take the legacy standard library, ExtLib, Camomile, SDFlow and other
libraries (list undecided so far, but pcre, ocamlnet, camlzip are strong
candidates), add some glue to get them all to work together, and build a
comprehensive external library
** do the same thing for macros
** distribute everything as a GODI package with lots of dependencies

* Community OCaml = use the same codebase but 
** completely replace the legacy standard library
** turn this into a full, community-maintained, OCaml distribution.

In either case, the objective is to achieve something JDK-like in its
reach.

Well, if you get to write a concurrent GC for the core of OCaml, feel
free to alert the community. People might be willing to help with
advanced features.

Cheers,
