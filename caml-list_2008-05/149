Figures to back up this extraordinary claim?  (And I don't mean the
unverifiable figures of a certain Cambridge-based consultancy).

These commercial enterprises better hope they don't need to modify the
F# compiler at all, and that MS keep releasing new versions and fixes
forever, because the terms of the F# license would prevent them from
fixing it themselves (unlike if they'd decided to go with an open
source solution).
