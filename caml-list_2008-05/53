Jane St. seem to be using CentOS, if some comments in the source are
correct.

There's also lots of #ifdef __linux__ in the code and it's obvious
there's a lot of Linux-specific work being done -- eg. bindings for
non-standard Linux system calls.

So there you go - it's open source, you can port it to Windows!
