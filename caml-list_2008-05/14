on one hand, it probably would be nice to have such a massive extend of
symbols.. on the other hand, it could be quite unproductive for
writing/reading code since there's so much symbols, and that some looks
like others; for example 'u' and '∪', '‧' and '.', '‶' and '"' etc..

plus, i don't really want to have my character table open when i want to
edit a program ...
