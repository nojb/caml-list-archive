Hi,

I am trying to install the latest release of OCaml 3.10.2 on a Fedora
Core 9 x86_64 machine. I am getting the same page table problems that
others were reporting, but was supposedly fixed in this release (?).

Anyway here are the relevant bits of information.

[shiv@sobolev ocaml-3.10.2]$ uname -a
Linux sobolev 2.6.25.3-18.fc9.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue May 13 04:54:47 EDT 2008
x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

[shiv@sobolev ocaml-3.10.2]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
0

make: *** [ocamldoc.opt] Error 2

As can be seen I did use
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

One other piece of information may or may not be relevant. I have 2GB
RAM installed but my swap partition is set to 8GB.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can proceed? I did try the binaries
shipped with Core 9 (and also Godi) and I had the same problems. Thanks,
