I will keep reminding you at Erlang is not competitively performance for 
CPU-bound computation like number crunching. The fact that it scales well on 
distributed clusters for massively concurrent applications is irrelevant: 
that has nothing to do with multicore computing.

If this were relevant to multicore computing, an "extreme load" would 
certainly be 100% CPU usage and not 90%.
