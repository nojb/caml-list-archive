Sounds like a reasonable solution indeed. Way better than not having
bin-prot on some archs (this is particularly annoying in Debian, where
we support several big endian machines; the status quo would mean no
Core on them and in turn no application using Core on them. Currently we
patched Core on that architecture to remove the bin-prot dependency, but
is a rather hackish solution I would like to get rid off).

Do you plan to implement such a solution in forthcoming releases?

Thanks,
Cheers.
