OK, I've opened a bug about this, since this a very vital issue if
things are still failing:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=446940

Please can you fill in more details in the above report.  In
particular, these would be very helpful:

rpm -qa | grep ocaml

The full error message(s) of any failures you see.

Run commands with 'export OCAMLRUNPARAM=v=0x1ff' and report
any messages.

'strace' any programs which fail and attach the strace.

This won't make any difference to the problem, if our current
understanding is correct.

Unfortunately I've got to go out now, but I can look at this tomorrow
morning.
