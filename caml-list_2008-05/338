Yep, on windows GetStdHandle doesn't always return the same kind of
handle depending on the context:
- if the output/input is console, it is console handle (i.e. need to be
  manipulated through console function)
- if the output/input is a pipe, it is a pipe handle (i.e. need to be
  manipulated through pipe function)

And since we are in the good old world of windows, the return type is an
HANDLE whatever it is ;-)

I think your issue is related to this difference. It can be fixed, but
you need a little bit of knowledge about windows pipe/standard handle.
