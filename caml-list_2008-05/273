ECOOP is the premier forum in Europe for bringing together 
practitioners, researchers, and students to share their ideas and
experiences in a broad range of disciplines woven with the common thread 
of object technology. It is a well-integrated collage of events, 
including outstanding invited speakers, carefully refereed technical 
papers, exciting tutorials, topic-focused workshops, and a summer school.


ECOOP 2008 has opened its doors for registration.

Early registration lasts until

NEW FOR 2008!

ECOOP 2008 presents the inaugural ECOOP SUMMER SCHOOL.
The school begins with three half-day tutorials (Data Parallelism in Ct,
Context-Oriented Programming, and X10) during the first two days
of the conference. Then five summer school sessions will run in
parallel with the main conference  (Newspeak, Multicore, SASyLF,
JastAdd, JavaCOP). You can book and pay for half-day tutorials
via the conference registration form.  Summer school sessions cannot
be booked in advance, but are included in the "Main Conference
