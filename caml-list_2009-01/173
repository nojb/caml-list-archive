Hi Folks,

I've just updated CamlPDF to version 0.4:

http://www.coherentpdf.com/ocaml-libraries.html


The biggest change is that this release now compiles with Microsoft F  
Sharp as well as with OCaml.

Some major non-compatible changes have been made to the low-level API,  
due to our experience of building large software with the library.  
These should be the last such changes, at least to the basic modules.

One of the changes is that many functions which used to take a  
Pdf.pdfdoc and return another one now modify the document in-place.  
This is rather un-idiomatic for a functional library, but threading  
all the documents through complicated functions in code using CamlPDF  
became wearying.

There are several new modules:

PDFSpace (Parsing Colourspaces)
PDFText module extended for more encodings and better text extraction
Cff (Parse Type 1 fonts and convert to Type 3)
PDFMarks (Bookmark handling - unfinished)
PDFAnnot (PDF Annotations - unfinished)
PDFGraphics (Structured graphics - unfinished - included only because  
Cff uses it

This release is about a third faster in general than the last one, due  
to profiling under .NET. Many bug fixes are included, and extra  
facilities for dealing with malformed PDF files.

CamlPDF is in commercial use in our Command Line PDF Toolkit and PDF  
Toolkit for .NET.
