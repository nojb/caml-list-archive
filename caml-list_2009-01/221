The 2009 International Conference on Software Engineering Research and
Practice (SERP'09)
 
Monte Carlo Resort, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (July 13-16, 2009)
http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp09/ws/conferences/conferenc
es/serp09

SERP'09 is an international conference held simultaneously (i.e., same
location and dates) with a number of other joint conferences as part Of
WORLDCOMP'09 (The 2009 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer
Engineering, and Applied Computing). WORLDCOMP'09 is the largest annual
gathering of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and
applied computing. Many of the joint conferences in WORLDCOMP are the
premier conferences for presentation of advances in their respective fields.
The motivation is to assemble a spectrum of affiliated research conferences
into a coordinated research meeting held in a common place at a common time.
The main goal is to provide a forum for exchange of ideas in a number of
research areas that interact. The model used to form these annual
conferences facilitates communication among researchers in different fields
of computer science, computer engineering and applied computing. Both inward
research (core areas of computer science and engineering) and outward
research (multi-disciplinary, Inter-disciplinary, and applications) will be
covered during the conferences.
 
The last set of conferences (research tracks in Software Engineering
Research and Practice together with affiliated events) had research
contributions from around the world and had successfully attracted
over 1,500 participants in past few years. It is anticipated to have over
2,100 participants for the 2009 event.
 
You are invited to submit a draft paper of about 6-8 pages (IEEE or ACM
Format). Please send your submission to Dr. Hassan Reza: reza@aero.und.edu.
All accepted papers will be published in the respective conference
proceedings.
 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
Survivable systems
Software architectures and Architectural description languages (ADLs)
Architectural analysis and verifications Methods
Quality Oriented Software Architecture, Design, and Supporting  Environment
Software Reliability, Safety and Security Methods
Software reuse and component engineering
Object-oriented technology (design and analysis)
Software metrics and cost estimations
Reverse and architectural recovery methods
Domain Specific software Engineering
Aerospace Software and system engineering
Software engineering methodologies
Engineering of safety/mission critical systems
Software testing, evaluation and analysis technologies
