Sure. However in my real case, I had an "ok" code like this :

let f x : 'a -> unit =3D ...
let g x =3D
  f x;
  x

I changed a little bit the specification of f :

let f x : 'a -> 'a =3D ...

I just expected that caml helps me to find all the instances where I had
to take care of this specification change. Such a thing is one of the
very good features of caml. Unfortunatly, in this case, caml did not
help me while the old implementation of "g" became wrong with the new
specification of "f" :-(.
