***********************************************
 NEW since 2nd CFP: RDP joint invited speaker.
***********************************************

The 20th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA 2009) is organized as part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting,
Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2009), together with the International
Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2009), and the
workshops HOR'09, LSFA'09, RULE'09, WFLP'09, and WRS'09. The conference
will be preceded by the 4th International School on Rewriting (ISR).

Brasilia, the federal capital of Brazil, is listed as a World Heritage
Site by UNESCO.  RDP 2009 will be held at Universidade de Brasilia,
one of the largest and one of the most prestigious universities in
Brazil, on a campus built by highly acclaimed architect Oscar
Niemeyer. Brasilia is easily reached by plane; air fares are moderate
at that time of the year.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract Submission:  January 19, 2009
Paper Submission:     January 26, 2009
Notification:         March 20, 2009
Final version:        April 10, 2009

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects of
rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

 * Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;
   rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and algebraic
   computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and verification; proof
   checking; reasoning about programming languages and logics; program
   transformation;

 * Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion techniques;
   strategies; rewriting calculi, constraint solving; tree automata;
   termination; combination;

 * Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
   higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical and
   infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures;

 * Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution; rewrite
   tools; termination checking;

 * Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of
   programs.

INVITED SPEAKERS 
Invited talks will be given by Vincent Danos (Edinburgh, UK), and
Johannes Waldmann (Leipzig, Germany). The joint invited talk of RTA
and TLCA will be given by Robert Harper (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

BEST PAPER AWARD:
A prize of 500 Euro will be given to the best paper as judged by the
program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award
or may split it among several papers.

 * Mauricio Ayala Rincon (Brasilia, Brazil)

PUBLICATION:
RTA'09 proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series.

SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submissions must fall into one of the following categories
(to be indicated at submission):

1. Regular Research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged
   on correctness and significance.

2. Papers describing the experience of applying rewriting techniques in
   other areas; they will be judged on relevance and comparison with
   other approaches.

3. Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in
   the field of rewriting.

4. System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system
   and will be judged on usefulness and design.

All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of
presentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to
15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings
pages. Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given
in an appendix which is not subject to the limitation of
pages. However, submissions must be self-contained within the
respective page limit; reading the appendix should not be necessary to
access the merits of a submission.

Submissions are accepted in either Postscript or PDF format.  Authors
are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class
file, available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the
EasyChair system at

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rta2009

Questions concerning submissions may be addressed to the PC chair,
Ralf Treinen <treinen "AT" pps.jussieu.fr>.
