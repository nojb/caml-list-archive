As you say this is kind of a bug.  You cannot solve it by assuming
some sort of one-to-one relationship between .cmi files and .cmo files
though.  You can have .cmi without .cmo, or .cmo without .cmi, or lots
of .cmi and a .cma, and probably other combinations.

Couple of practical points though: (1) Use ocamlfind in the toplevel
to solve all these problems:

  # #use "topfind";;
  - : unit = ()
  Findlib has been successfully loaded. Additional directives:
    #require "package";;      to load a package
    #list;;                   to list the available packages
    #camlp4o;;                to load camlp4 (standard syntax)
    #camlp4r;;                to load camlp4 (revised syntax)
    #predicates "p,q,...";;   to set these predicates
    Topfind.reset();;         to force that packages will be reloaded
    #thread;;                 to enable threads
  
  - : unit = ()
  # #require "netstring";;
