Hi Nicolas,

> However I can guess in your question that you don't really want to change=
 the
syntax of the binary operator "&", but rather to change it's meaning. In
camlp4 there is a much more sane and easier way to do this using filters.
By the way there is an example in the camlp4 sources that does exactly this=
.

Yes, this seems to work -- but it would be simpler, in fact, if I could jus=
t use
a rule in my grammar extension.

Do you know if there's a way to debug grammar extensions?  Maybe I need to
DELETE a rule from the original grammar, though it's not clear to me which
rule that is.

Thanks,

-- Paul
