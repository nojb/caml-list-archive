Stefano Zacchiroli and I are collecting autoconf macros related to
OCaml into a central project:

  http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/ocaml-autoconf/
  http://git.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=ocaml-autoconf/ocaml-autoconf.git;a=summary

We would like to relicense this project under a clear license so that
it can be widely used.  Personally I would prefer a simple BSD-
no-advertising license, since that ensures the widest possible use
(including commercial use) without restrictions.

So if you are one of the people listed below, and you would agree to
relicensing the macros under the 3-clause BSD license (see end of this
message), please follow-up to indicate your agreement or otherwise.
