Good morning. I have looked at ocamlopt and it looks very useful. 
Are there any plans to include macro expansion in ocamlopt?
I mean something like merging the functionality of ocamlopt and
pa_macro but without the restrictions that pa_macro places on 
where the macro can be used.

Besides conditional compilation - to try different variants of the
code or to have debugging messages which can be switched off without
any performance penalty - I would also like to use it for short pieces
of compile-time generated code (for speed up). Currently, I use a
Python-based templating system em.py
(http://www.alcyone.com/pyos/empy/) for this purpose. This works but
combining the way Python and Ocaml syntax is sometimes not very
intuitive.

It appears that a modern and universal tool for compile-time code
generation is MetaOcaml. However, is there a way in MetaOcaml to
generate the code just once and not every time the program is run? I
mean, can the code fragments be cached - saved into a file (a shared library?)
and later retrieved?

Thanks,

Jan
