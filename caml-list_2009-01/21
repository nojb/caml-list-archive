GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SFM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Formal methods are emerging in computer science as a prominent
approach to the rigorous design of computer, communication and
software systems.

The aim of the SFM series is to offer a good spectrum of
current research in foundations as well as applications of
formal methods, which can be of interest for graduate students
and young researchers who intend to approach the field.

This year SFM is devoted to web services and covers coreography,
orchestration, formal description techniques, session types,
contracts, synthesis, composition, and verification.


COURSES AND LECTURERS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The school features the following twelve lectures:

* "An Overview of Web Services, Coreographies, and WS-CDL"
     by Steve Ross-Talbot
     (Pi4 Technologies, UK)

* "An Overview of Web Service Orchestration and WS-BPEL"
     by Dieter K=F6nig
     (IBM, Germany)

* "Formal Modeling of Service-Oriented Systems"
     by Jose Fiadeiro
     (University of Leicester, UK)

* "Calculi for Service-Oriented Computing"

     (Queen Mary University London, UK)

* "Contract-Based Discovery and Composition of Web Services"
     by Luca Padovani and Gianluigi Zavattaro
     (University of Urbino and University of Bologna, Italy)

* "Security Aspects of Web Services"
     by Karthik Bhargavan
     (Microsoft Research, UK)

* "Verification of Web Services"
     by Jianwen Su
     (University of California, USA)

* "Quality of Service-Oriented Systems"
     by Stephen Gilmore
     (University of Edinburgh, UK)

All the participants will receive a copy of a tutorial book published by
Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


LOCATION
^^^^^^^^

SFM-09:WS will be held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro.

This town is in Emilia Romagna, about 70 km south-east of Bologna,
at an elevation of about 230 m. It can be reached in a couple of
hours from the international airport "G. Marconi" of Bologna by
shuttle (from the airport to the railway station) + train (from
Bologna to Forli`) + bus (from the railway station to Bertinoro)
or taxi. The closest airport is the "L. Ridolfi" airport of Forli`,
which is 13 km away.

Bertinoro is close to many splendid locations such as Urbino,
Gradara, San Leo, and the Republic of San Marino, as well as some
less well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme.

Bertinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known
Italian locations such as Bologna, Ravenna, Ferrara, Venezia,
Padova, Verona, Firenze, Pisa, and Siena.

Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with its narrow streets and
walkways winding around the central peak. The school will be held
at the Centro Residenziale Universitario (CRU), an ex-episcopal
fortress that has been converted by the University of Bologna into
a modern conference center with computing facilities and Internet
access. From the fortress it is possible to enjoy a beautiful vista
stretching from the Apennines to the Adriatic coast and the Alps
over the Po Valley.
