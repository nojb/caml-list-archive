Subject: Toplevel - loading dependencies
X-Spam: no; 0.00; toplevel:01 dependencies:01 toplevel:01 cmo:01 prepend:01 cmo:01 dependencies:01 ocaml:01 aggregates:01 recompile:01 undefined:01 undefined:01 cma:01 cma:01 modules:02 

Another problem with loading modules in the toplevel:
I need to use the module A. So I write:
#load "A.cmo"
to get a messsage "Reference to undefined global B"
So I prepend a line:
#load B.cmo
 and get another "undefined global". Then it repeats prohibitively many 
times.
This is resolving dependencies by hand, one by one.

The solution would be to have a special version of cmo that knows 
locations of all other cmo's it depends on.

In special cases I could use cma archives, but this is only applicable 
when there is well defined and stable set of modules I need.
But in practice the modules I use in ocaml scripts are constantly 
evolving. It leads to having multiple cma aggregates and maintaining 
their building description. Again, lots of work.

If I put everything into one big cma, then I have to recompile it every 
small change. It takes so long time, that it would make no sense to use 
the interpreter at all.

Could I ask ocamlbuild to produce proper loading preamble for my scripts?

What is the right solution?
