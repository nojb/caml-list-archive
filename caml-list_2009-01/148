Sure thing:

That reminds me, I need to update it for the latest release. Our Smoke Vector 
Graphics product for OCaml uses similar techniques but it is less evolved:

Parallel, not concurrent. By parallel GC, I mean stop the world and call into 
code that traverses the heap using a parallelized algorithm. That would just 
be a simple recursive function in Cilk that is, of course, just graph 
traversal.

You are quite right that Cilk is not useful for writing a concurrent GC, where 
the mutator and GC use fine-grained concurrency to avoid global stalls.
