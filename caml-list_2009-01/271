    The latter is mainly a matter of taste :)

    I believe that compiler for statically-typed languages has to take 
all the responsibility on type information it delivers to user. So when 
it says "this
expression has type X, but here is used as type unit" it must not mean 
"well, sometimes it hasn't" :)

    IMHO it definitely doesn't deserve such a long discussion :))))
