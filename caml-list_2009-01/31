It's because the toplevel doesn't have the "/home/dt2/..." in its paths, 
so it doesn't know where the enum.cmi is.

No, it doesn't find the enum.cmi

The enum.cmi was there, it was because the toplevel didn't know about 
this path. So it had the same effect as accessing a non-existed module 
or a module existed but not in the known paths (e.g. open NoSuchModule).

No. Basically, cmi and cmo are two different things. You using one 
doesn't mean you'll use the other.

Using the "directory" directive or launching toplevel with "-I" 
parameters can add extra paths to toplevel (for accessing both cmi and cmo).

HTH.
