OCaml Meeting 2009 will take place in Grenoble on 4th February 2009.

A subscription form can be found on the wiki page and a fee of 32â‚¬ will
be used for the lunch. Subscription is mandatory for participants to
this year meeting. 

As last year, participants are invited to give a talk on what they are
doing with OCaml.

The list of possible talks is actually:
- OCamlCore.org news and projects
- OCaml Batteries Included
- Cameleon/Chamo 
- Delimited overloading
- OCaml as fast as C!

Further information (list of talks, hostels and other details):

For people who need further information, you can contact either me or
Alan Schmitt (see wiki.cocan.org for contact details).

Hope to see a lot of you
Regards
Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of the OCaml Meeting organization team
