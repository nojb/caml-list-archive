Hello,
        when editing Ocaml sources in Emacs, I found fold-mode quite handy
to selectively and hierarchically hide parts of the code and make it
easier to concentrate on the part I am working on.

Now, with Emacs 22.3.1, tuareg-mode (1.45.6) and fold-mode no longer work
together, the folding just does not happen. With xemacs, it works
fine. 

I have also tried the "folding" mode which works if the markers "{{{"
are alone on the line but stops working as soon as they are enclosed
in comments, like "(* {{{ *)", despite my experiments with modifying
the markers with folding-add-to-marks-list.

Does anyone know if there is a chance that tuareg and fold-mode will
work again together in Emacs? Or would you have a working setup for
the folding-mode? Can you recommend yet another  alternative folding
package for Emacs that works? Or should I switch to XEmacs (a move I
was trying to avoid for some time since I rely on Emacs for most of my
work)?

As a bonus, I would also like the folding to work in tuareg+twt mode.

Thank you for your advice,

Jan
