Yes!

Sexplib is entirely an exercise in camlp4 metaprogramming, and it has saved
us countless hours of work and simplified our lives greatly.  Yes, if you
need lots of variations on your serialization and deserialization functions
then camlp4 is a painful way of going about it.  But things like sexplib act
as general language extensions which can provide broadly useful
functionality at a low cost.  I really think it's a very big win.
