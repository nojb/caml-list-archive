3.10.2.

Yes, it could be the simplest solution. I have this issue only under the
high load, on production server, with real client applications. At this
time, I have no idea how to reduce code from big commercial application
to something short. May be I'll create some stand-alone GC test later.

P.S. Interesting thing I found on other machine, where application works
with another load: after the same number of connections processed, only
5MB was allocated (feel the difference: 5MB and 40MB, both after
processing 250.000 connections). The only difference is the first
machine had processed 250.000 connections in 5 hours (up to ~20
concurrent threads), the second in 24 hours (up to ~10 concurrent
threads).
