Is that possible? I believe that flexlink is needed for all Windows ports
(Cygwin included - as in README.win32) as it's used internally to simplify
linking even when creating Cygwin executables.

So that could be related to the above?

Cygwin is 32 bit - so this is entirely correct. When you run Cygwin's bash,
you're in the WOW subsystem and will so the architecture will report itself
as 32-bit (if you look in task manager then you'll see that bash.exe is
starred).

I imagine that there's a reason that you're both building your own OCaml and
also using the Cygwin port specifically but just in case: the MinGW and
MSVC64 builds both definitely work on Vista64...
