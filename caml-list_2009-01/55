What version of OCaml is this?

I had a look at the source for ocaml-fd and it doesn't seem like it
should leak memory.  Certainly if there is a memory leak, it would be
a subtle one.

It does seem very unlikely that Unix.write would be a problem -- it's
a very commonly used function.

I'm afraid to say that you'll have to post a short reproducer here
before I can look at this further ...

I haven't used it.  Seems like you have to patch the compiler.

If you suspect a problem in a C binding somewhere, then a quicker
approach would probably be to run the program using valgrind.
