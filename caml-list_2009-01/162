OCaml Meeting 2009 will take place in Grenoble on 4th February 2009.

A subscription form can be found on the wiki page and a fee of 32â‚¬ will
be used for the lunch. Subscription is mandatory for participants to
this year meeting.

As last year, participants are invited to give a talk on what they are
doing with OCaml.

The list of possible talks is actually:
- OCamlCore.org news and projects
- OCaml Batteries Included
- Cameleon/Chamo
- Delimited overloading
- OCaml as fast as C!

There will be also a foreword by member(s) of the INRIA OCaml Team.

For those who care about OCaml, this is a really great meeting because
you can meet most of those who have made OCaml. Don't miss this event!

Further information (list of talks, hostels and other details):
http://wiki.cocan.org/events/europe/ocamlmeetinggrenoble2009

For people who need further information, you can contact either me or
Alan Schmitt (see wiki.cocan.org for contact details).

If you know some people that have not yet subscribed, invite them to do
it.

Hope to see a lot of you
Regards
Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of the OCaml Meeting organization team
