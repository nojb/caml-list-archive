Thanks, Matthieu and Jake, this is exactly what I had in mind.

At the end, Camlp4 was the right solution to my simple problem, as I
suspected from the beginning. Camlp4 is an extremely powerful tool and
it's a pity it couldn't be used by everyone for lack of documentation.
What is really needed, in my opinion, is a description of *what* one
can do with Camlp4 without being an expert. For example a list of all
syntax extension available out of the box might spread the use of
Camlp4 among common programmers.

Searching in the source code I can see things named:
Camlp4ExceptionTracer, Camlp4FoldGenerator, Camlp4MetaGenerator, and
so on. The names sounds great but... what is it? The source code is
cryptic to every "regular" OCaml programmer like me. The same
considerations apply to all the (many!) libraries available and
related to Camlp4.

What is needed to spread the use of this tool are some... recipes,
like those available for ocamlbuild in its wiki pages.
