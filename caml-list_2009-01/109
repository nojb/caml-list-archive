Honestly I don't think we need to fixate on the core compiler.  If the
compiler had a new release once a year it really wouldn't matter.
Perl 5.x releases new versions less often than once a year, and that
wasn't what killed Perl take-up (it was the Osborne Effect around Perl
6 which did that, combined with O'Reilly dropping financial support).

What's needed is activity in all the other areas around the compiler -
I listed a few in my other response.
