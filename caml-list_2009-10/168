Hello,

OCaml Meeting 2010 is the third meeting of OCaml enthusiasts in France.

This year OCaml Meeting in France is back in Paris. We choose to
organize it on 16th or 17th April to avoid any conflicts with JFLA and
other events (including French holiday).

We open a poll to know what attendants want:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/survey/survey.php?group_id=77&survey_id=1

You need to login to answer the poll. It will remain open for a week
(ending Wednesday 28th October). It will help us to choose the best date
for the the meeting.

Answering the poll will help organizers to choose the right option that
can meet everyone needs. This is the best way to make OCaml Meeting 2010
a great events. 

Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of OCaml Meeting 2010 organization team.
