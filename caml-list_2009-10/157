I'm not sure if there is a better way to do this, but you can add the
dependency in your myocamlbuild.ml file.  Add something along the
lines of this:

---
let xstrp4_includes =3D "data.txt"

...
| After_rules ->
...

dep ["compile"; "the_xstrp4_tag"] xstrp4_includes;
---

I use this to support external includes with camlidl + ocamlbuild.

Hope this helps,
