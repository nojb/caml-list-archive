This is only the case with int64 array in fact (I really have done test
and you don't need a C call in most case).

Moreover, as Xavier suggests, Array1.unsafe_get/set seems nice.

I would however try to find a way to avoid writing too many
set/get_{uint*} functions. This can be a nighmare to maintain.
