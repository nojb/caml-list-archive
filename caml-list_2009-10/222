Well, this is exactly the implementation of the POSIX aio functions in
glibc. They are mapped to a bunch of threads.

You can't implement barriers. When you have page-cache backed I/O (i.e.
non-direct I/O, no matter of aio or sync I/O) there is no control when
data is written. Ok, there is fsync but this is very coarse-grained
control.
