Damn. That seems so stupid. Then writing asynchronous will only be
possible with creating a pot full of worker thread, each one writing
one chunk. So you get all those chunks in random order submitted to
the kernel, the kernel has to reorder them, fit them back together,
write them and then wake up the right thread for each piece
completed. So much extra work while libaio has all the data already in
perfect structures for the kernel.

And how will you do barriers when writing with threads? Wait for all
threads to complete every time you hit a barrier and thereby stalling
the pipeline?
