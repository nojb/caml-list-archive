AiML-2010:  FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

8-TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN MODAL LOGIC
MOSCOW, AUGUST 25-29, 2010

 http://aiml10.mi.ras.ru/

Advances in Modal Logic is an initiative aimed at presenting
the state of the art in modal logic and its various applications. The
initiative consists of a conference series together with volumes based on
the conferences. Information about the AiML series can be obtained at
http://www.aiml.net <http://www.aiml.net> . AiML-2010 is the eighth
conference in the series.

TOPICS
We invite submission on all aspects of modal logics, including:

- history of modal logic
- philosophy of modal logic
- applications of modal logic
- computational aspects of modal logic
  + complexity and decidability of modal and temporal logics
  + modal and temporal logic programming
  + model checking
  + theorem proving for modal logics
- theoretical aspects of modal logic
  + algebraic  and categorical perspectives on modal logic
  + coalgebraic modal logic
  + completeness and canonicity
  + correspondence and duality theory
  + many-dimensional modal logics
  + modal fixed point logics
  + model theory of modal logic
  + proof theory of modal logic
- specific instances and variations of modal logic
  + description logics
  + dynamic logics and other process logics
  + epistemic and deontic logics
  + modal logics for agent-based systems
  + modal logic and game theory
  + modal logic and grammar formalisms
  + provability and interpretability logics
  + spatial and temporal logics
  + hybrid logic
  + intuitionistic logic
  + substructural logics

Papers on related subjects will also be considered.


INVITED SPEAKERS: TO BE ANNOUNCED

PAPER SUBMISSIONS:
There will be two types of submissions to AiML-2010:

(1) Full papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the
conference.

(2) Abstracts for short presentation only.

Both types of papers should be submitted electronically using the
EasyChair submission page at

 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2010


(1) FULL PAPERS:
Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference and
publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research
and not submitted elsewhere. The proceedings of AiML'2010 will be published
by College Publications

            http://www.collegepublications.co.uk

in a volume to be made available at the conference.

The submissions should be at most 15 pages, with an optional technical
appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200
words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTex, using a style file and
template that will be provided on the AiML'2010 website
http://aiml10.mi.ras.ru/ in due time.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for, and attend,
the conference to present the paper.

(2) ABSTRACTS:
These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary results, work
in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The accepted
abstracts will be made available at the conference, and the authors will
have the opportunity to make short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on
them.
