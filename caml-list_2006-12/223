Its aim is not to describe anything you can say about programming =20
languages. It describes the particular notion that Chad was implying =20
by "strong" typing.

That's _one_ of the bullet points listed in [1] as a _possible_ =20
meaning for weak/strong typing. Note that your reaction makes my =20
point : do not use the notion of weak/strong typing it always mean =20
something different to other persons and hence it doesn't mean anything.

A language that has the property you describe can simply be said to =20
have implicit type conversions.

Best,

Daniel
