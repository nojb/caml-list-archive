Dear OCaml users,

The Ocsigen Web server is now available for download in version 0.5.1.

See http://www.ocsigen.org for details, downloading and documentation.

Ocsigen is a Web server, with a programming framework providing a new way to 
create dynamic Web sites using Objective Caml. Its goal is to offer an 
alternative to Apache/PHP, based on cutting-edge technologies coming from 
research in programming languages.

It allows to program in a concise and modular way, using OCaml's type system 
in a thoroughgoing way in order to produce valid xhtml. The server handles 
sessions, URLs, and page parameters automatically. Pages are generated by 
OCaml functions (services) and you can dynamically create new services 
dedicated to a user of the Web site (continuation based Web programming).

The Web server is now full featured to handle static and dynamic pages. It 
supports HTTP, HTTPS, pipelining of requests, multipart forms, virtual hosts, 
etc. It is implemented using cooperative threads, making it very lightweight 
and providing a very convenient and safe style of programming (no need for 
mutexes).

Ocsigen is now fully usable and (hopefully) stable. Some features will be 
added before version 1 (in a few months). Next version (0.6.0) will allow the 
creation of extensions for the Web server (like Apache modules).

A debian package is available (unstable branch). Contribution would be 
appreciated for a Godi package.

Vincent Balat
