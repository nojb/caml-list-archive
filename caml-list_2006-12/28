Yes, the most common WAV files are easy to parse but there are
a gazzillion extensions and corner cases to take care of.

So *please* don't lead people down that path, bcause next thing
they will be writting WAV files as well and they will make
a mistake and not follow the spec (so called) correctly and their
software will become popular and I (as the author of libsndfile)
will have to add yet another hack to work around someone else's
broken WAV file (libsndfile is already full of these).

I'm busy ATM, but give me a couple of weeks and I will make an
ocaml-libsndfile.
