My opinion is that you are right when you say that ocaml programs are
often shorter than Java one. However, I have the feeling that you are
over-enthusiastic about manageability of ocaml programs.

I think that the only reason why ocaml programmers do no use refactoring
tools is that such tools do not exits of ocaml.

And if these tools do not exists it is not because nobody need nor want
them. It is because it requires a huge effort to have good ones. And
nobody has done is effort yet.
