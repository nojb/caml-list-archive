What I meant by "strict typing" was performing type checks *at runtime*, 
i.e. that there are no unsafe operations.

Say, as an example, doing type checks of function arguments at runtime:

let f = fun i when is_integer (i) -> i
           | x when is_float   (x) -> int_of_float x;;

(raising Bad_match of some sort if neither one of the two guards pass)

Direct application of this could be for making the Marshal/Unmarshal 
modules more safe when marshaling data over files/sockets between 
applications written in heterogeneous languages.
