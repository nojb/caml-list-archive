Hi,

Apologies if this is the wrong forum in which to ask this question.  Is 
there anywhere else more
suitable?

I've written some Ocaml code to solve the problem of placing 8 queens on a 
board so that none of them attack each-other.  I've also written a C++ 
equivalent which is running much more quickly than the Ocaml.  I assume I've 
made some basic errors with the Ocaml - does anyone have any suggestions as 
to what?

The code is available here:

http://curiousprogrammer.wordpress.com/2006/12/22/speed-comparison-plt-scheme-ocaml-and-c/

I compiled the Ocaml with the following command:

ocamlopt -noassert -unsafe -ccopt -O3 -ccopt -fomit-frame-pointer q.ml -o 
q.exe

This is running on Windows using the MinGW build of Ocaml.

Thanks very much,

Ian
