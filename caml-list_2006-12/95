Hello,

At
http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/apc/
http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/imt/
http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/icedock/

you can find new versions of (0.96, 1.00, 0.4 respectively):
CPU load monitor
Microsoft command line utilities helper
Window Maker like dock utility

APC was ported to Linux/PPC

IMT was adjusted to work better with path names with spaces in them

IceDock finally works correctly on systems with LSB images.
The bug was in excellent XLib by Fabrice Le Fessant and was there
forever as far as i can see. XLib was also slightly adjusted so
that newer OCaml compilers produce less warning messages.
