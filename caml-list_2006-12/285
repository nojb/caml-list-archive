I'm not convinced it is optimal either - I wrote the scheme version first
and then translated first into Ocaml and then to C++.  It is my first
piece of Ocaml (and hopefully not the last) which probably accounts for
the unusualness.

Excellent.  Thanks very much.  I'll have a look at both of them and
see what I can learn.

Yes, good catch - it is a bug.  I didn't do sufficient testing.

Thanks again.  I'll probably write a follow-up when I understand what
is going on.  Jon Harrop also uncovered an algorithmic difference between
the C++ and the Ocaml so I'll look into that too.

Cheers,

Ian
