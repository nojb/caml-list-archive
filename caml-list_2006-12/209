It's something that I'd love to have too. An implementation of a
simple subset of sh would be nice. The programming features would be
handled by ocaml, so we need a way to use ocaml variables as
shell variables (of type string, string list or command) in addition to
environment variables.

Should camlp4's quotations be used for this, or should the special syntax
be handled by another preprocessor? I don't know.
A quotation looks like << ls | wc -l >> or <:cmd< ls | wc -l >>.

If something like this already exists, please let us know.
If not, I'd be glad to help design the thing.
