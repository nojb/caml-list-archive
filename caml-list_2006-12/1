Thanks for your help.  But your solution only work for a function
which allocates
  memory of fixed size. Unfortunately, the atomic function, which
cannot be interrupted by GC, read input data from external channels
and the memory needed to store the input data is not determined ahead.
The official interface of GC doesn't not provide a  way to stop GC. Is
there a backdoor such that we can use to stop GC?

   Thanks again
Neal
