Every Debian install I've done since the new debian-installer was
adopted for Sarge while it was still in Testing has allowed custom
partitioning with any of a wide range of filesystems.  I suspect you are
either not using the default debian-installer or you are not configuring
the partitions with all the available tools if you are not aware of
other filesystems that are available at install time.

I can understand it, to some degree, if one's purpose in choosing a
distribution for a given install is to have the best possible OCaml
development environment.

. . . but I tend to agree that there are a number of other, more
important reasons for choosing a distribution, most of the time.  Such
reasons have, in fact, caused me to mostly give up Debian in favor of
FreeBSD recently -- which also provides excellent OCaml support in its
ports tree.
