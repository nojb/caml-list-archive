It's for OCaml 3.10, as mentioned, and while I look forward to it, the
fact that it is still a second class tool (compare to ocamldoc, ocamldebug,
or even ocamllex/ocamlyacc) causes me to view it a bit suspiciously. By
"second class" I don't mean to impugn the quality of the tool here.

OCaml is not mainstream, and I'm reluctant to make it even less so where
I work by using an alternative syntax enabled by a second class tool.
