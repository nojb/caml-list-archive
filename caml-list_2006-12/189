Second Call for Papers

--------------------------
C A L C U L E M U S   2007
--------------------------


June 27--30, 2007
RISC Institute
Castle of Hagenberg, Austria

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/

General 
------- 
Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of
computer algebra systems (CAS) and automated deduction systems (ADS)
towards the development of universal mathematical assistant systems
(MAS).

Currently, symbolic computation is divided into several (more or less)
independent branches, traditional ones (e.g. computer algebra and
theorem proving) as well as newly emerging ones (on user interfaces,
knowledge management, theory exploration, etc.). The main concern of
the Calculemus community is to bring these developments together in
order to facilitate the theory, design, and implementation of
integrated MAS that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer
scientists, and engineers in their every-day business.

For the upcoming Calculemus meeting, which will be held jointly with
MKM2007 in Hagenberg, Austria, we seek original research papers in
this context.

Scope
-----
The scope of Calculemus covers all aspects of developing mathematical
assistant systems, in particular, the interplay of automated reasoning
and computer algebra. Potential areas of interest are: 

o) Automated reasoning in computer algebra
o) Computer algebra in automated reasoning
o) Interdisciplinary systems
o) Infrastructure for mathematical services
o) Theory exploration techniques
o) Theory, design, and implementation of MAS
o) Case studies and applications of MAS
