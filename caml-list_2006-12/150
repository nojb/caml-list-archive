I prefer JFS because it's mainly faster than any other FS I've tried.

ext2 is not journalized
ext3 needs way too much time to be created (count in minutes for a big hdd)
xfs is a problem on your boot partition if you want to use grub
reiserfs is not maintained anymore by its creator, and needs way to much 
time to mount
reiserfs4 is not supported if you don't compile your own kernel
fat is obsolete
fat32 is widly used... still, it's not journalized, it doesn't handle 
rights on files, nor owners, etc...
ntfs is not well supported for writing on other systems than windows

JFS is fast to create, fast to mount, and it's journalized and has the 
features I need...

Well, that's for Linux, of course.

(I also use Mac OS X, and well, you don't have a lot of choice on that 
OS ;-)

Well, anyway, JFS is not widely officially supported... To be sure, the 
solution must be ext3, but I really can't stand waiting more than 10 
minutes just for a hdd to be formatted...
