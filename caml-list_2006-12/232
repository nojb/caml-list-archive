That's health-safety, or life-safety, or something like that.  It's not
the same as type-safety.

You're right, in a sense: safety means "cannot fail".  In the case of
type-safety, however, all that means is that the type system "cannot
fail".  The caveat is that, of course, if you evade the type system in
some way, its type-safety becomes to some extent immaterial.
