I'm pleased to announce that Jane Street Capital is yet again looking
to hire some top-notch functional programmers.  Of particular note is
that Jane Street Europe Ltd. now has an office in London, and we are
particularly interested in hiring someone for that office with strong
systems administration skills in addition to experience with
functional programming languages.

You can find out more about Jane Street here: 

   http://www.janestcapital.com/tech.html

I should also warn people that I will have spotty email access for the 
next couple of weeks, so it will take me some extra time to get back 
to people.

Here's the full job announcement.

-------------------------------------------------

Jane Street Capital is a proprietary trading firm that operates around
the clock and around the world. We bring a deep understanding of
trading, a scientific approach, and innovative technology to bear on
the problem of trading profitably on the world's highly-competitive
financial markets. We run a small, nimble operation where technology
and trading are tightly integrated.

At Jane Street, there is room to get deeply involved in a number of
areas at the same time. We are actively looking for people interested
in software development, system administration, and quantitative
research--potentially all on the same day.

We have offices in the New York, London and Tokyo.  Most of our hiring
is for the New York office, but we are looking for applicants in our
foreign offices as well.  In some circumstances we have hired foreign
applicants for the US office through the H1-B and the F1 visa
programs. In such cases, we support and fund the visa application
process.

We are looking for talented candidates across the range.  We are also
particularly interested in finding someone with skills and interest in
systems administration for Jane Street Europe Ltd.'s London office.

The ideal candidate has:

    * A commitment to the practical. One of the big attractions of our
      work is the opportunity to apply serious ideas to real-world
      problems.
    * Experience with functional programming languages (OCaml, SML,
      Scheme, Haskell, Lisp, F#, Erlang, etc) is important. Applicants
      should also have experience with UNIX and a deep understanding
      of computers and technology.
    * A strong mathematical background. This is a must for candidates
      interested in research, and includes a good understanding of
      probability and statistics, calculus, algorithms, etc. We draw
      on ideas from everywhere we can, so we value interest and
      experience in a range of scientific fields.
    * Good second-order knowledge. In trading, understanding the
      boundary between what you do and don't know is as (or more)
      important than how much you know.

The environment at Jane Street is open, informal, intellectual, and
fun. You can wear a t-shirt and jeans to the office, the kitchen is
stocked, and discussions are always lively. We encourage a focus on
learning, both through formal seminars and classes, as well as through
day-to-day conversations with colleagues.  Other perks include
competitive salaries, rapid advancement for people who do well,
excellent benefits, free lunch, and a gym on-site.

We are currently looking for full-time positions as well as summer
interns (internship positions are only avaliable in the US office, and
for people who already have the right to work in the USa). If you are
interested, send an application to Yaron Minsky
(yminsky@janestcapital.com) including a resume, cover letter, and
optionally some sample code you've written.

If you'd like to know a little bit more about how we came to use OCaml
as our primary development language, take a look at these slides from
a talk we gave at CUFP 2006:
