I fully agree.  Forcing the programmer to acknowledge the presence of
every possible exception is annoying to write and makes for fragile
code.  Hence I suggested exception inference... no extra effort is
required on the part of the programmer and the code is not made
fragile.  O'Caml provides the safety of checked types without the
hassle of type declarations; in the same way it could provide the
safety of checked exceptions without the hassle of exception
declarations.
