I was hoping to compare similar approaches in Scheme, Ocaml and C++ in much 
the same way as the language shootout does.  I don't really have a desperate 
need for a fast queens solver ;-)  Anyway, thanks for pointing out the 
algorithmic difference between the C++ and the Ocaml.  I'll see if I can 
track down what causes this.

Cheers,

Ian
