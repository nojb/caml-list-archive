You might want to have a look at cash:
http://pauillac.inria.fr/cash/
It aims at being an ocaml equivalent of scsh. I don't know if it is
still maintained.

chamo (one of cameleon's [http://pauillac.inria.fr/cash/] component)
is also ocaml scriptable. They included an enhanced toplevel. You
could reuse part of there work .

P.S. sorry john for spamming you...
