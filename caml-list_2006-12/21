Hi,

It would be nice to have a binding of libsndfile for that kind of
purpose. Unfortunately I don't think we have one yet.

For what it's worth, there is a Wav module at
<https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/savonet/trunk/liquidsoap/src/tools/>.
Simply remove the conversion of format to Mixer.format and there
shouldn't be any external dependency left.

I know that it doesn't handle some formats, but .. it's good enough
for us most of the time. If anybody does ocaml-libsndfile I'd be happy
to use it instead.

Cheers.
