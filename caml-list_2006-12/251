Normaly I allocate memory for c-structures with malloc or with "new" for 
c++ objects. Some time ago a read about a library which places external 
structures in strings of the interfacing languages (it was a scheme lib 
I think). So instead of using malloc or new I would allocate an 
ocaml-string and put the c-structure there. So it will be free by the gc.
That seems o.k. for me, any comments? I'm missing something?

cheers
 Michael
