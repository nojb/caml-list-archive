Not quite scripting in OCaml, but related - the OMake build system comes
with its own shell interpreter - osh. The language is not OCaml, but
it's a functional language that was _specifically_ designed as a
scripting language, so I would argue that writing scripts in osh is more
convenient that scripting in OCaml (although, of course, for somebody
already familiar with OCaml, learning osh might be a bit harder that
learning some hypothetical scripting extension of OCaml).

Note that if the goal is specifically "scripts to perform various build-
and development-related tasks" as you've mentioned, then I would
definitely suggest looking at OMake and osh - there the scripting
language is the same as the build specification language and you can
inline osh scriplets directly into "make-style" build rules of OMake.

See http://omake.metaprl.org/ for more information.
