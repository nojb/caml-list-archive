No.  It's not a bug in Ubuntu, so much as a problem that they seem to
have exported an incorrect mix of packages, probably during one of
Debian-ocaml-maint's "upgrade the whole world" exercises between
3.09.1 and 3.09.2.  In any case you can fix the issue by upgrading to
the current testing version (Feisty).  If you're apt-pinning, that's
not too intrusive.

Well, if you're worried about a bit of non-free firmware in Debian,
then I'm afraid you won't like Ubuntu too much.  There are whole
websites dedicated to "fixing" Ubuntu by installing huge amounts of
not merely non-free, but outright copyright-infringing software.
