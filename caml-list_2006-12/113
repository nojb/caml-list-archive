I don't think either that it is difficult to write a refactoring tools
for OCaml. But I still believe it is would be huge effort to have a
*good* tool to do it.

When I say a good tool, I think of something user-friendly, with nice
interface (graphical or not)... In a word something that would convince
you to use it instead of search/replace under emacs (or vi).

The hard part is not writing the lexer and the parser, the hard part is
 to make some environment to interact with the developer.
