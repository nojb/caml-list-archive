Actually, I find that static typing is the biggest problem I have with
administration script writing in OCaml.  It can be great for bigger
projects where dynamic typing doesn't always scale (as you mentioned),
but for something under thirty lines of code (to pick a number out of
thin air) the syntax requirements imposed by static typing and the
semantic gymnastics that must sometimes be done (string_of_int, et
cetera) can get in the way a bit.
