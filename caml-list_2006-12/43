It's not a bug -- you're relying on 32bit ints when OCaml has only
31bit ints (on 32-bit arch). In C (for example), if you use a plain
int (I believe it'll default to signed), you get the exact same
behaviour when the number overflows 2^31.

The only difference here is that unlike C and many other languages,
OCaml has no unsigned numeric type. However, even if it were unsigned,
you still can't avoid a hard limit on maximum integer value.

My recommendation would be to use the Nums library so you don't get
overflow errors, or do an overflow check and throw an exception.
