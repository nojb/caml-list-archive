I've been writing bash scripts to perform various build- and
development-related tasks, and I don't enjoy it. I won't bore you with
detailed reasons why. The upshot is that I'd like to script in OCaml.

I have considered writing a few camlp4 extensions to make it easier to
write scripts:

  1) create a syntax which grabs environment variables:

    e.g. $FOO would grab the value of the environment variable FOO

  2) some sort of more convenient process interaction, e.g., for piping.

(1) seems pretty straightforward, though I haven't found the time to
implement it yet. (2) is not as clear to me, but I'll think about it
and probably look at scsh.

I googled a bit but couldn't find anything related to this. Has
anything done, or started doing, anything like this?
