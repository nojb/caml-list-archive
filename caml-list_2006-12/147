I don't think you should choose your linux distrib just because of that...

Ubuntu and Debian don't aim the same kind of users.

On both, there are many OCaml users and there is no reason why one would 
be worse for OCaml.

However, maybe Ubuntu community is more active now as it is _the_ fast 
spreading linux distribution !

Make your choice for other reasons, like file systems (debian only 
supports ext2 ext3 and reiserfs when you install it, while ubuntu 
supports more FSs...)

Well, maybe this mailing list is not the right place to ask such a 
question ;-)
