After a more detailed look at this I don't see any advantage to
using the bigarray module. 

The C API for libsndfile allows reading data as short, int, float or
double. During reads, libsndfile automatically converts from the 
internal data format of the file to the data format requested by the
user.

The trouble interfacing with Ocaml is that Ocaml doesn't support 
16 bit shorts, 32 bit ints or 32 bit floats. The only data type that
makes any sense is the Ocaml float type (C double).

So, I'd like to ask, if I provide a bigarray interface, how would it
be used?
