I just analysed all the code written by Merjis, all 77,070 lines of
it.  (This is split across dozens of programs and libraries.)

Longest files:

   1905 ./freeware/weblogs/weblogs_charset.ml
   1149 ./freeware/pgocaml/pGOCaml.ml

The first wasn't written by me, but snarfed from mldonkey. The second
is mostly a series of translations between PostgreSQL types and OCaml
types, so it doesn't really count as complicated.

573 files, so average lines/file = 134 lines.

Median is 77 lines.

Refactoring is something we've certainly not worried about.

Rich.
