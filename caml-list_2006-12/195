I think it's a great idea - I'd love to push OCaml for scripting.
However I hope your camlp4-fu is up to snuff.  You'd want, as you say,
a syntax for pipelines and file redirection, but more importantly
you'd want a very simple syntax for running commands.  So you can
write some unholy OCaml/sh combination like:

  let nr_files = int_of_string ` ls | wc -l `

Actually, even Perl isn't a very usable alternative for shell
scripting because of the amount of code you have to write just to fork
off a command and capture the output.
