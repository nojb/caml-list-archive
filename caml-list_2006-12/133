Hi,

under "My view" the bug tracker does not show all issues that I
monitored or that I reported myself. For instance #4145 does not
show up, maybe because it is closed now. Where can I see _all_
monitored issues and _all_ issues reported by me?

I looked at the preferences, but the description there is mostly
cryptic (what does it mean to check "Advanced Report", for
instance?) and the preference page contains no documentation/help
pointer. Where can I find what "Advanced Report" means?

Bye,

Hendrik
