Well, it is certainly possible to write Ocaml programs that turn out to
be unmanageable. My experience (which is currently a 53 kloc commercial
project) is different, however. We are refactoring all the time, and it
is no big deal.

Ok, we are only refactoring from "good design A" to "good design B", and
not from a bad design to a hopefully better design.

I wouldn't use such a tool if it were more complicated than the status
quo.

Anyway, I think it is more the people who make a large program
manageable, not the availability of such tools.
