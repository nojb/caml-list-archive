May be I've been misunderstood in my quote of Kernighan & Pike.
I simply think that there is no need to use exceptions when
"exceptional" cases are as frequent as "normal" ones. As others
already said, using option types is a good alternative. And the
efficiency is similar (it happens that I recently made a benchmark on
this particular point and I found out equivalent timings).

The Coq proof assistant has been developed by many people and I only
contributed to a small part of it (mostly in the kernel). For this
part, at least, it is indeed true that exceptions are used only for
exceptional situations, mostly to signal typing errors. They are then
handled globally, at the top level of the system.
