Sure it does, but package management is more than just about building
a single base program once.  To install our CMS, we use at least 10
libraries (helpfully maintained by Debian-ocaml-maint), and we want
those libraries to be versioned, maintained and have upgrades and
security patches applied automatically.

Anyhow, this is really getting off-topic.
