As one of the authors of several major pieces of Python,
my comment is that whilst it provides great convenience
and good code structure .. dynamic typing just doesn't
scale.

The big problem using Ocaml (bytecode) for scripting
is probably the ugly dynamic loading support, and 
for long running systems, the lack of unloading support.
(plus the syntax which isn't really well suited to small
scale scripting applications).

As an alternative you might consider Neko and/or NekoML.
