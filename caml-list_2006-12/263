The above link only covers the "proper shell" parts of the OMake/osh
language (i.e. parts related to calling external commands).

Some features of the general language are outlined in
http://omake.metaprl.org/omake-language.html#chapter:language

The OMake/osh language is fairly different from OCaml. The language was
designed specifically to work nicely in build specifications and shell
scriplets,  which is a quite different set of constraints than the ones
OCaml is designed for. The result is a functional language with dynamic
typing and dynamic scoping.

OMake is implemented in OCaml (with a bit of C -
fam/gamin/kqueue/inotify bindings, Windows-specific code, etc). It can
be characterized as an interpreter (although before a file is executed,
there is a small compilation-like translation step) implemented using
ocamllex, ocamlyacc, etc. The parsed+translated version of each file is
cached to avoid the penalty of having to do it on every run.
