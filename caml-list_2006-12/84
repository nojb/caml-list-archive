This is close to one of the rules related to errors in 
Kernighan & Pike's excellent book "The practice of programming"
(http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/), which is

  # Detect errors at a low level, handle them at a high level.

I always try to follow this rule and it appears to be a very good one.
And regarding exceptions specifically, another of their rules is
this one:

  # Use exceptions only for exceptional situations.
