Hm... There is no way you could do that. If you do not know how much data
your function would allocate, you cannot allocate it in advance. While your
function is being executed, it might occur that the heap is full and that it
needs to be garbage collected before your function could allocate further
data. How do you think this would work if the GC would be disabled?

By the way, it is possible to have C functions that are not interrupted by
GC, but only when they allocate nothing - but whenever some new value is
made, or something is allocated, there might be a need for GC.
