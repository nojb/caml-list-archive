Hi, I'm considering switching Linux distributions to Debian or Ubuntu,
and I wanted to know what the community experience was regarding
Drscheme (and mzscheme) on either.  In particular, are there any known
functional or performance issues?  Also, is there any difficulty staying
current?

Many thanks,

 -- Bill Wood
