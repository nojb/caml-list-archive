Hello,

I was trying to find a good portable GUI library for my ocaml projects.
A natural choice seemed to be wxwindows/wxWidgets since I wanted
to have a native look'n feel and QT doesn't have any bindings in OCaml
(to my despair... anyone working on QT bindings?)

Unfortunately wxocaml depends on wxc (found in wxhaskell) which seems
to be outdated. I was wondering if anyone had any luck making it work
with wxWidgets 2.8.

I already fixed a couple of compilation warnings/errors, but it seems =20=

to be
a never ending process and I'm not familiar at all with these =20
libraries, so
I'm pretty much fixing the compilation errors randomly.

I guess I could use wxWidgets 2.5.4 as advised on wxhaskell's website =20=

for
Mac OS, but this version is almost 2 years old.

Any help appreciated,

--=20
Best Regards,
Qu=F4c
