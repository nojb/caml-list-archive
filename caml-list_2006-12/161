This is definitely true.  The Debian-ocaml-maint team does superb work
in bringing OCaml and a whole array of packages to Debian.  Ubuntu
"inherits" these packages, and sometimes they are broken, as for
instance they are right now in Ubuntu Edgy (incompatible versions of
various key libraries are installed, making building anything more
complex than a trivial program impossible).
