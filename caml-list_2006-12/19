Hello

is there a library available for reading wav files in ocaml and, say,
convert it to a bigarray or something equivalent ?

I had a look at sdl_mixer, which does read wav files, but it seems that
you don't have physical accesss to the audio if you wanted to modifiy it
in memory. (or I missed something). All you can do is play/mix it. I
guess it should not be too hard to look at the C code and come up with a
nice ocaml interface for converting the audio chunk into a bigarray, but
that's beyond my capabilities.

I looked at the list archive and back in 2003 some people had similar
whishes. Maybe this have evolved ?

Thanks for you help.


San
