Well, I didn't mean to say which one was actually better.
Because none can be really better than the other as they are just different.

I am not sure if the Ubuntu community is actually more active. But there 
is a chance it is... I mean some Debian users switch to Ubuntu while 
Ubuntu users switching to Debian are less frequent. (Well, I guess, 
maybe it's not true at all, but it seems sensefull to me)

I mean that when you take the default install CD, you don't have other 
choice but ext2, ext3 and reiserFS.
I really didn't mean one couldn't use another FS...

(but maybe I'm wrong... When I saw I could only use ext[2|3] and 
reiserFS at the prompt when I put the last debian CD (i don't know which 
version, but a 2006 version anyways) I just gave up the idea because I 
didn't want reiserFS and ext3 takes too much time to build)

Well, if you say so...

To me, it's quite weird to make the choice mainly because of OCaml 
support. I mean if Ubuntu and Debian have come to have the same score 
and OCaml support is goind to tell which one wins, it's really strange 
to me. But well, why not...
Still I believe the choice should be based on other distrib features.
