Since I (the main author of libsndfile) is also an Ocaml user
I really should get around to doing that.

However, the Ocaml version would not ba able to have functions
for reading shorts or ints, just a function for reading doubles
(as Ocaml floats). Same for the write side.

libsndfile would however do the conversion between the ocaml 
level floats at whatever the disk file format required.
