Subject: RE: [Caml-list] posting policy

Thank you. For anyone who is interested, it is worth noting that this
sympa-roc.inria.fr site also has a nice archive of the caml-list that goes
all the way back to Claude Fleurey's e-mail about Caml on AIX from 30th
September 1992!

I've also noticed that Google Groups is no longer archiving fa.caml... :-(

Cheers,
Jon.
