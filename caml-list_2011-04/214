That would be good.

I've just released an example of using Netmulticore for fine-grained
parallelism:

http://blog.camlcity.org/blog/multicore3.html

J.H. is certainly right that he demands shared memory. Certain
algorithms cannot be done without. But shm is possible, even with
current ocaml - and Netmulticore demonstrates it. AFAIK the other
multi-process environments lack it.
