I think motive is the only obstacle. Nobody is sufficiently motivated to do
this.

The OCaml team at INRIA are not motivated to do this because it does not
constitute research, would probably make Coq slower and would burden them
with maintaining irrelevant features.

OCaml users just migrate to other languages that are closer to what they
want rather than spending years learning how to build a parallel OCaml, then
doing it and then building a community around it. The only notable exception
might be Jane St. Capital because they have the resources and a vested
interest in performance. There are other large companies invested in OCaml,
like Citrix, but they aren't so interested in parallelism.

Cheers,
Jon.
