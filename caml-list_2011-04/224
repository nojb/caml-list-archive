There is certainly merit in your proposal but it is worth noting up front
that you cannot "prove" anything this way. We can only hope to test
falsifiable hypotheses. For example, if we observe better performance from
Cilk-style parallelism than from MPI then it might be because we suck at
writing MPI code rather than because the Cilk style is inherently more
efficient. A valuable result nonetheless but not technically a proof.

Cheers,
Jon.
