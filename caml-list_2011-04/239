Subject: Re: [Caml-list] f#/mono vs ocaml runtime system - open gl animation
 screen tearing.

Are you using double buffering?  I am certainly no expert, but if you are using double buffering then I am not sure how the GC would interfere.  The call to Sdlgl.swap_buffers (assuming you are using the ocamlsdl library) seems to call straight through to SDL_GL_SwapBuffers in the SDL library.  Once you have made this call, I don't think that the OCaml GC will get a chance to interfere until the buffer is completely swapped (therefore no stuttering effects).
