Subject: [Caml-list] Re: oasis & macosx

Hello,

I am offline until next tuesday (from time to time I need to take
vacation).

A very quick points about oasis:
- the documentation can be confusing, because I have written it and I
  probably know the system too much, ideally someone with no prior
  knowledge should review it to make it understandable by an oasis
  beginner (help are welcome on this point)
- oasis itself is a MakeMaker: it generates a standardize build system
  using existing tools (i.e. ocamlbuild or ocamlfind). This is not a
  replacement for findlib and it interact with it, so you can
  configure/build/install with non-oasis enabled package, using findlib.
- oasis-db is a place to upload packages that use oasis (and contain
  _oasis file). It provides a nice presentation and a central place to
  download dependencies (when they also use oasis, otherwise you have to
  do the job by hand)
- there should be a binary installer for easy install on MacOS X, but
  until recently I don't have a Mac at hand to do it. This is now fixed
  but I don't manage to have the time to learn how to make a package on
  MacOS X
- there is a debian package and a GODI package (for release line 3.11)
  available 
- my next task in oasis-db project is to create the subcommand "bundle"
  that will create self contained archive (i.e. oasis + its
  dependencies), but this is not done

I will answer any additional question next week. 

Cheers
Sylvain
