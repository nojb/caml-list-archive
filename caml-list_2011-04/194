I don't understand this last sentence. Message passing is just an
abstract concept (i.e. an interface) which can e.g. be implemented with
a shared buffer (or the illusion thereof) or other data structure that
decouples sender and receiver processes. Are you against using the right
interfaces when they are appropriate? We don't want to burden the
programmer with too low-level details, do we?
