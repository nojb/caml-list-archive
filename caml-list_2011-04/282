Subject: [Caml-list] Dynamic contract checking for OCaml

Dear All,

I have implemented a prototype that does dynamic contract checking
for OCaml code. The prototype is built upon the source code of 
ocamlc-3.11.2. Please see a tutorial for the details:

http://gallium.inria.fr/~naxu/research/camlcontract.pdf

This document also describes where to access the source code.

If you are interested in co-improving it or have any comments, please
feel free to drop me an email.

Best regards,
Dana.
