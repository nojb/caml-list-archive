This is one implementation for the normal CDF, in terms of the error
function provided in ocamlgsl:

let normal_cdf ~mu ~sigma x =3D
  (1.0 +. Gsl_sf.erf ((x -. mu) /. (sigma *. sqrt 2.0))) /. 2.0

As Christophe mentioned, this CDF gives you the probability that your random
variable is at most x (rather than greater than x). GSL and ocamlgsl also
provide many other functions related to the normal and other distributions.
