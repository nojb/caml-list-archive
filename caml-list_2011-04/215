I personally don't care that he states Ocaml is bad because of this  
lack,
what bothers me more is that he claims that 1. there are less and less
users of Ocaml and 2. this is due to the lack of parallelism. He  
pretends
to support claim 1 with the frequentation figures of the mailing lists,
but when I observe those figures by myself I surprinsingly do not find
the same figures as J.H. I probably made a mistake when collecting those
figures. Claim 2 is of course impossible to support in any objective
manner, unless a survey among all former Ocaml users was made. Which, to
my knowledge, has not been done.

Funnily enough, Lisp users have been complaining for years that J.H. was
advertising Ocaml against Lisp in a very unobjective manner on their
mailing list. It's our turn now... Why does he still bother
reading/writing on this mailing list since the same flamewars happen
again and again? My belief is that he is just trying to attract  
potential
customers & users to his new favourite language. See e.g. the discussion
"Is OCaml fast?" a few months ago where the original author of the
post told afterwards that J.H. had contacted him privately in order to
advertise F#... From a sales/marketing point of view, this is all the
most fair. But I am not sure that it is the purpose of this list.
