Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Ocamlnet-3.3.0test1 (multicore, GSS-API)

Hi,

finally I've managed to create a test version of the current Ocamlnet
development tree: version 3.3.0test1 (see
http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html for download etc).

This version contains two exciting new features:

- Netmulticore is a working implementation of the multi-process
  approach to get multicore capabilities
- GSS-API is an industry standard security framework. It is
  accompanied with an implementation of SCRAM, and an authentication
  module for SunRPC.

I blogged already about Netmulticore, and this text is also a good
introduction: http://blog.camlcity.org/blog/multicore1.html

If you want to know more about Netmulticore, please see the Ocamlnet
reference manual. It is extensively documented, and a good starting
point is probably
http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/ocamlnet-3.3.0test1/doc/html-main/Netmcore_tut.html

GSS-API is an interface for authentication, encryption, and signing. It
is especially well suited for message-based protocols like RPC. GSS-API
is usually described as a C interface, and many operating systems
implement it. With Netgssapi there is a port of this interface to Ocaml.
GSS-API decouples the provider of a security mechanism from the users,
so that users can select the right mechanism at runtime. The current
test release of Ocamlnet contains only one provider, namely SCRAM, which
is a relatively new password-based authentication protocol. Future
releases of Ocamlnet will also allow to link with the system-provided
security mechanisms (e.g. Kerberos or SPNEGO).

The inclusion of GSS-API is a big step towards making Ocamlnet
"enterprise-ready".
