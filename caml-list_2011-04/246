Ethan's summary is good. I'll elaborate a bit on glcaml...

I use glcaml, but don't recommend it in general. There are two reasons I
chose it: 1. It looks like OpenGL, so my familiarity with it directly
translates... the only differences are lowecase GL constants and no
parentheses around arguments. 2. It (kind-of) supports features like
shaders.

What I mean by "kind-of" is that the bindings are broken for a lot of
lesser-used features. I've been maintaining my own modifications to support
features I need (same with sdlcaml)... though I recently decided I should
follow OpenGL 4 (basically the same as OpenGL ES 2), which strips the
interface down to a minimal set heavily reliant on shaders. This is turning
into "yet another set of bindings".

I know I tried glMLite... but can't remember what problems I encountered,
and I did encounter problems which led me to settle on glcaml.

Also, there is one other binding I know, by Jeffrey Scofield, for OpenGL ES
1, and he uses this for iPhone development:
http://psellos.com/ocaml/lablgles-build.html


Summary:

If you don't need shaders: LablGL

If you want to do OpenGL ES 1.x (mobile device, for example): LablGLES

If you need shaders: glcaml or glMLite


Oh, if anyone knows of someone making OpenGL 4 / OpenGL ES 2 bindings...
please speak up! :)
