Subject: [Caml-list] 2011 GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop: Call for extended abstracts

    * * *   2011 GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop    * * *

              July 5, 2011 Braga, Portugal

The co-location of SLE and GTTSE provides us the opportunity to
combine their respective Doctoral Symposium and Participants' Workshop
to form the GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop.  The students' workshop
features presentations by the GTTSE and SLE participants: PhD
students, PostDocs, practitioners, and other members of the computer
science community.  All registered participants are asked to submit an
extended abstract in one of two forms:

1. Committed junior researchers may leverage the workshop as a means
to present their relevant research and to receive feedback from senior
researchers in the field.  Submissions of this form should be an
extended abstract of 2 pages in Springer LNCS style as a presentation
proposal for the workshop.  This may describe new ideas or early
results, but there are no formal specifications as to the abstracts
content.

2. In addition, doctoral students may use the workshop as a way to get
feedback on their proposed doctoral research plan.  Students should
submit a 4 page (LNCS style, excluding references) abstract based on
the following outline:
- Problem Description and Motivation.
- Brief Overview of Related Work, highlighting the gap the work aims
   to fill.
- Proposed Solution, a high-level overview and any hypotheses
   that you have formulated.
- Research Method, describing how you will validate or refute your
   hypotheses.
It is understood that students at different stages of their research
will be able to make more or less detailed and stabilized
contributions to each of these sections. Therefore, we provide this
outline as more of a guide than a strict requirement. Nonetheless, we
encourage even early-stage PhD students to consider using this
outline.


Selection process for the SLE/GTTSE Students' Workshop

The organizers will select proposals, with assistance as needed from
the GTTSE scientific committee and the SLE program committee, for an
interesting program.  There are always more presentation proposals
than there are slots in the workshop. There are likely to be 10-15
slots for presentations with 10-15 minutes each. The organizers will
select a compelling set of presentation topics. This selection process
is supposed to be informal and must not be confused with any sort of
peer review or selective review.  In particular, no formal feedback is
returned to the authors of the 2 page abstracts. Authors are merely
notified of the selection's outcome.  Authors of 4 page doctoral
research plans will receive informal feedback from reviewers chosen
from the GTTSE scientific committee and SLE program committee.
Authors who are not selected and who still wish to present some of
their material may exhibit (and present) a poster at GTTSE.

All reasonable submissions are distributed in printed form at the
workshop. The abstracts will not be published online. The titles of
selected presentations appear online though. Presenters may also
voluntarily submit their slides for inclusion on the website.

The GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop will feature an award sponsored by
SIG (The Software Improvement Group), to be given to the best
presentation at the workshop. The awardee will be determined by a
committee of senior attendees that is assembled by the organizers.


Why present at and participate in the workshop?

Each presenter benefits by means of the feedback from the renowned
tutorial speakers and other participants. Presentation at the workshop
may also spark off new collaborations. The school and conference, as a
whole, also benefits from the workshop because the presentations
constitute a blend of the current research interests in the GTTSE and
SLE communities.


Submission

The submission deadline is May 27, 2011.  This coincides with the end
of Early Registration for both GTTSE and SLE.  Abstracts must be
submitted via EasyChair.  See the event web pages (above) for
submission details.


Notes on the GTTSE post-proceedings

After the school, all GTTSE participants (i.e., presenters,
non-presenters, and non-submitters to the workshop) are encouraged to
submit a contribution for inclusion into the post-proceedings. These
contributions are properly reviewed and selection for the
post-proceedings is competitive. Successful contributions have to meet
high originality and quality standards. Compared to the usual
peer-reviewed venue, GTTSE is particularly prepared to provide gentle
and detailed feedback to PhD students. Submissions to the
post-proceedings can have up to 15 pages. A designated call for
contributions to the post-proceedings is distributed after the school.
