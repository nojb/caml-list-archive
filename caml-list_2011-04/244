This appears to be the 'default' OpenGL for OCaml.  It is suppose to work with lablgtk (I don't know if the others do) but it does not seem to have support for shaders and some later OpenGL funtionality.

Supports the newer OpenGL functionality (GLSL shaders and vertex buffers).  My friend had a difficult time getting it to compile/work on OSX but with some minor changes I believe that he eventually got it working.

glcaml seems to be a set of automatically generated stubs.  It seems to support some of the latest OpenGL but the interface is automatically generated so it doesn't have a very OCaml-ish feel to it.

Best,
