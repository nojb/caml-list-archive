I think you're focused on the wrong thing here; the important bit is the standard.
how they get installed is probably irrevelant, the only thing is that there's
no such standard package to get ATM. shall i get Core ? batteries ?
then which other libraries are considered standard ?

The haskell platform is a good example of that. It's not bundled with the
compiler, yet they managed to setup a standard effort, where you have high
quality and coherent libraries.
