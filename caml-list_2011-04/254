Sorry if I was unclear in my earlier message. The compiler will not be
limited to webgl; one could use the same shaders (perhaps after
stripping comments) in any OpenGL ES 2 or later implementation. Our
current interests are for typed tagless interpreters/emitters
targeting ESSL and Javascript. An emitter for desktop GL shaders (or
DirectX shaders) should not be difficult after this is done.
