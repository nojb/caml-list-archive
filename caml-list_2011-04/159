Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml commnity not selected for GSoC

Hi,

It seems that the news I posted some time ago on the forge did not go 
through so let me resend it to this list.  Unfortunately, we have not 
yet received the feedback from Google.

Best regards,
C.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the best efforts of the GSoC OCaml admin team as well as 
several members of the community, I am sorry to announce that the 
OCaml community was not selected as a mentor organization for the 
GSoC 2011. I have asked for some feedback so we can improve for next 
year.

On behalf of the admin team, I would like to thank everybody who has 
put their name on the mentor list and especially those who spend some 
time to write a draft on our ideas list. Do not hesitate to put more 
ideas on the wiki [1], they will be of use for next year or for other 
projects.
