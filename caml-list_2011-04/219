The problem with "implement in MPI and compare" is that you have to rearchitect a sequential program for a totally different model.  By contrast, using shared memory parallelism, it's often a question of using pmap.

I really recommend everybody interested in parallelism to learn and try Clojure on a small problem.  You can replace a single map by pmap in a suitable setting and observe a not-quite-linear, but proportional speedup.

I'd be really happy if OCaml gets the mechanisms from Clojure.
