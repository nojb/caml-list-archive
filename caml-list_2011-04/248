Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Pros and cons of different GL bindings ?

You could also compile your OCaml to Javascript and use WebGL. We've
not yet written the ocamljs bindings to mimic lablgles but the
javascript shim is fairly small, "native" (not autogen'ed bindings)
and simple. The business logic stays in OCaml. We will soon be
tightening the ocamljs/closure-compiler toolchain to get even smaller
and faster js files.

You can see some early results from this design at http://ashimagames.com/

We are actively investigating compiling a strict OCaml subset
(directly semantically translatable to recursion-less GLSL) to
GLSL/Javascript for numeric library portability and algebraic
simplification of shaders.

If you are interested in this architecture, let me know and I can
clean up and send you the closure-compiler externs files we use to
escape the minification of the WebGL interface. If you require ocamljs
assistance, I would also be happy to help with that.

Best,

David Sheets
