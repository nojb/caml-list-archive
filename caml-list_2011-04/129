Subject: [Caml-list] Gaussian probability

Hi all,

Maybe this is a long shot, but...

I have a gaussian (normal) distribution defined by its mean and std 
deviation and I want to know the probability of a given known point in 
the curve. I have followed the formula given in [1] but I realized that 
there are cases where P > 1. After struggling myself for a while I 
realized that that formula expresses the probability *density* 
distribution that happens that can be > 1. Are you aware of any module 
in ocaml to calculate the probability [0<P<1]?

(other kind of relevant references are also welcome)

Thanks in advance,

M;
