For the fourth time, I am proud to invite all OCaml enthusiasts to join
us at OCaml Meeting 2011 in Paris.

This year event takes place in Paris on Friday 15th April 2011.
Registration is opened now and will be closed today.

__ Only 10 places left __

The day after the meeting, an OCaml Hacking day will take place at
IRILL, more information will be given by Pierre Chambart during the
Meeting.

We are still looking for:
* someone to handle the camrecorder
* someone to welcome people and direct them to the cafeteria

Further information:

Hope to see a lot of you

Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of the OCaml Meeting organization team
