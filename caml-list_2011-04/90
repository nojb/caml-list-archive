The Haskell platform is a good comparison, because it's a community
effort. As far as I recall, INRIA's reasoning about the standard
library is that everything added to it must be maintained by them, and
they're not terribly interested in increasing the burden of OCaml
maintenance, being a research institution and all.

I think OCaml Batteries is the closest project we have in OCaml-land
to the Haskell Platform, and its goals include selecting and including
other libraries beyond what was called Extlib before.
