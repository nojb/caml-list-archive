This is exactly the kind of application I had in mind when I was developing
HLVM. Assuming OCaml doesn't get good support for parallelism, perhaps the
next best solution is to quote code in your OCaml source that will then be
compiled using LLVM down to efficient machine code for execution?

This looks like the most viable approach to me, not just because it would
satisfy your requirements but also because it would separate concerns
between a core OCaml language optimized for Coq and the run-time code gen
library that can be optimized completely independently for scientific
computing. Therefore, the OCaml team at INRIA can continue to develop OCaml
independently and the scientists that want this can fund development in
their own preferred direction. Everyone wins...

Cheers,
Jon.
