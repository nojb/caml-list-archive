CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

Tenth ACM SIGPLAN Erlang Workshop
---------------------------------

National Institute of Informatics (NII), Tokyo Japan  

Friday, September 23, 2011

<http://www.erlang.org/workshop/2011/>

A satellite event of the 16th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on
Functional Programming (ICFP)

Erlang is a concurrent, distributed functional programming language
aimed at systems with requirements on massive concurrency, soft real
time response, fault tolerance, and high availability. It has been
available as open source for over 10 years, creating a community that
actively contributes to its already existing rich set of libraries and
applications. Originally created for telecom applications, its usage
has spread to other domains including e-commerce, banking, databases,
and computer telephony and messaging.

Erlang programs are today among the largest applications written
in any functional programming language. These applications offer
new opportunities to evaluate functional programming and functional
programming methods on a very large scale and suggest new problems for
the research community to solve.

This workshop will bring together the open source, academic, and
industrial programming communities of Erlang. It will enable participants
to familiarize themselves with recent developments on new techniques and
tools tailored to Erlang, novel applications, draw lessons from users'
experiences and identify research problems and common areas relevant to
the practice of Erlang and functional programming.

We invite three sorts of submissions.

1. Technical papers describing language extensions, critical discussions
   of the status quo, formal semantics of language constructs, program
   analysis and transformation, virtual machine extensions and
   compilation techniques, implementations and interfaces of Erlang
   in/with other languages, and new tools (profilers, tracers,
   debuggers, testing frameworks, etc.).  The maximum length for
   technical papers is restricted to 12 pages.

2. Practice and application papers describing uses of Erlang in the
   "real-world", Erlang libraries for specific tasks, experiences from
   using Erlang in specific application domains, reusable programming
   idioms and elegant new ways of using Erlang to approach or solve a
   particular problem.  The maximum length for the practice and
   application papers is restricted to 6 pages.  Papers in this
   category may be allocated less time for their talk and instead be
   given the opportunity for the poster presentations during the workshop.

3. Poster presentations describing topics related to the workshop goals.
   Each of them includes max 2 pages of the abstract and summary.
   Presentations in this category will be given an hour of shared
   simultaneous demonstration time.

Instructions to authors
-----------------------

Papers must be submitted online via EasyChair (via the "Erlang2011" event).

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines.

Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy. Violation
risks summary rejection of the offending submission. Accepted papers
will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM Digital Library.

Paper submissions will be considered for poster submission in the case
that they are not accepted as full papers.
