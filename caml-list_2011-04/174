Lucas says "zero". You say "huge". Can we do a better job of quantifying this? Where do you believe the slowdown would come from? Given that GC intensive OCaml programs can spend 30% of their time in the GC, do you not think it might be possible to improve performance by exploiting more cores? Can you give example code that you would expect to be adversely affected the most by a multi-threaded runtime?

Cheers,
Jon.
