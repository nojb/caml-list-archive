Second CALL FOR PAPERS

WORKSHOP : Reasoning about other minds: Logical and cognitive=20=20
perspectives

Groningen, the Netherlands, Monday 11 July 2011
http://www.ai.rug.nl/conf/reasoningminds/

Workshop Goal:

This workshop aims to shed light on models of social reasoning that=20=20
take into account realistic resource bounds. People reason about other=20=
=20
people=92s mental states in order to understand and predict the others=92=
=20=20
behavior. This capability to reason about others=92 knowledge, beliefs=20=
=20
and intentions is often referred to as =91theory of mind=92. Idealized=20=
=20
rational agents are capable of recursion in their social reasoning,=20=20
and can reason about phenomena like common knowledge. Such idealized=20=20
social reasoning has been modeled by modal logics such as epistemic=20=20
logic and BDI (belief, goal, intention) logics and by epistemic game=20=20
theory. However, in real-world situations, many people seem to lose=20=20
track of such recursive social reasoning after only a few levels.
The workshop provides a forum for researchers that attempt to analyze,=20=
=20
understand and model how resource-bounded agents reason about other=20=20
minds.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

-Logics modeling human social cognition;
-Computational cognitive models of theory of mind;
-Behavioral game theory;
-Bounded rationality in epistemic game theory;
-Relations between language and social cognition;
-Models of the evolution of theory of mind;
-Models of the development of theory of mind in children;
-Bounded rationality in multi-agent systems;
-Formal models of team reasoning;
-Theory of mind in specific groups, e.g., persons with autism spectrum=20=
=20
disorder;
-Complexity measures for reasoning about other minds.

Invited Speakers:

-Chris Baker, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
-Barbara Dunin-Keplicz, Warsaw University and Polish Academy of Sciences
-Petra Hendriks, University of Groningen

Deadline CFP: Please send your submission in PDF format, not exceeding=20=
=20
10 double-spaced pages (4,000 words) by Wednesday May 4, 2011. If=20=20
needed due to space reasons, technical material such as proofs may be=20=20
added in an appendix of at most 5 pages. The PDF files have to be=20=20
uploaded online via the workshop's submission website:
https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?ReasoningMinds-2011

The author notification date is Friday May 27, 2011. Authors of=20=20
accepted papers will be expected to upload their paper in an online=20=20
workshop proceedings collection that we are currently setting up.=20=20
Further details about the proceedings will be made available soon.
After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit a=20=20
revised and extended version of their paper for a special issue of=20=20
Synthese / Knowledge, Rationality and Action, devoted to on Reasoning=20=20
about other minds, to appear in 2012.

Programme Committee:

-Rineke Verbrugge (University of Groningen, chair)
-Jan van Eijck (CWI Amsterdam, vice-chair)
-Johan van Benthem (University of Amsterdam and Stanford University)
-Robin Clark (University of Pennsylvania)
-Hans van Ditmarsch (University of Sevilla)
-Peter G=E4rdenfors (Lund University)
-Sujata Ghosh (University of Groningen)
-Noah Goodman (Stanford University)
-Bart Hollebrandse (University of Groningen)
-Eric Pacuit (Tilburg University and University of Maryland)
-Rohit Parikh (City University of New York)
-Jun Zhang (University of Michigan)

The workshop will be held on the day before TARK XIII,
The Thirteenth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and=20=20
Knowledge.
A workshop on Quantum physics meets TARK will be held on the day after=20=
=20
TARK, Friday 15 July.

It is already possible to register for the complete event, including=20=20
TARK and two workshops, Monday 11 July - Friday 15 July.
Early bird registration until May 31: euro 225,- (euro 125,- for MSc=20=20
and PhD students)
