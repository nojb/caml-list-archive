I've been maintaining my own modifications to support features I need (same with sdlcaml)... though I recently decided I should follow OpenGL 4 (basically the same as OpenGL ES 2), which strips the interface down to a minimal set heavily reliant on shaders. This is turning into "yet another set of bindings".

Actually, LablGL has some shader support, provided by Florent Monnier.
It has been in CVS for more than a year (file src/glShader.ml), but somehow
I never came around to make a new release.
I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.

If some people could test this code, this would be most helpful, and I could
make a release in a few weeks.
