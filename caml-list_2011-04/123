                     TIME 2011 Call for Papers
 
                 Eighteenth International Symposium on
                 Temporal Representation and Reasoning
 
                   Luebeck, Germany, September 12-14, 2011
 
                  http://www.isp.uni-luebeck.de/time11/
 
 
 The TIME symposium series is a well-established annual event that
 brings together researchers from all areas of computer science that
 involve temporal representation and reasoning. This includes, but is
 not limited to, artificial intelligence, temporal databases, and the
 verification of software and hardware systems. In addition to fostering
 interdisciplinarity, the TIME symposia emphasize bridging the gap
 between theoretical and applied research. This year, TIME will 
 feature a special track on interval temporal logics.
 
 The conference will span three days, and will be organized
 as a combination of technical paper presentations, keynote lectures,
 and tutorials.

(4) Special Track on Interval Temporal logics

Temporal Representation and Reasoning in AI includes, but is not limited to:
 
 - temporal aspects of agent- and policy-based systems
 - spatial and temporal reasoning
 - reasoning about actions and change
 - planning and planning languages
 - ontologies of time and space-time
 - belief and uncertainty in temporal knowledge
 - temporal learning and discovery
 - time in problem solving (e.g. diagnosis, scheduling)
 - time in human-machine interaction
 - temporal information extraction
 - time in natural language processing
 - spatio-temporal knowledge representation systems
 - spatio-temporal ontologies for the semantic web
 
Temporal Database Management includes, but is not limited to:
 
 - temporal data models and query languages
 - temporal query processing and indexing
 - temporal data mining
 - time series data management
 - stream data management
 - spatio-temporal data management, including moving objects
 - data currency and expiration
 - indeterminate and imprecise temporal data
 - temporal constraints
 - temporal aspects of workflow and ECA systems
 - real-time databases
 - time-dependent security policies
 - privacy in temporal and spatio-temporal data
 - temporal aspects of multimedia databases
 - temporal aspects of e-services and web applications
 - temporal aspects of distributed systems
 - novel applications of temporal database management
 - experiences with real applications
 
Temporal Logic and Verification in Computer Science includes, but is not limited to:

 - specification and verification of systems
 - verification of web applications
 - synthesis and execution
 - model checking algorithms
 - verification of infinite-state systems
 - reasoning about transition systems
 - temporal architectures
 - temporal logics for distributed systems
 - temporal logics of knowledge
 - hybrid systems and real-time logics
 - tools and practical systems
 - temporal issues in security
 
Special track on Interval Temporal logic
 This year, TIME has an additional special track on Interval Temporal
 Logics. This track is organized by Dimitar Guelev and Ben Moszkowski.  
 Submissions on ITL will be primarily managed by them, though the final
 decision on acceptance will be taken by the whole PC. Topics of interest 
 include, but are not limited to: 

 - expressiveness, decidability, proof systems, model- and validity-checking 
   for ITLs
 - modelling of system requirements in terms of time intervals
 - intervals versus time points in temporal modelling
 - Duration Calculus and other extensions and variants of ITLs
 - ITLs, DC, timed automata, timed regular languages and other models of real time
 - interval algebras and spatio-temporal reasoning 
 - case studies, applications and tool support for interval-based reasoning
 
 * PAPER SUBMISSION
 
 Submissions of high quality papers describing research results
 are solicited. Submitted papers should contain original,
 previously unpublished content, should be written in English, and must
 not be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.
 
 Submitted papers will be refereed by at least three reviewers for
 quality, correctness, originality, and relevance. Accepted papers will
 be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings, which
 will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. Acceptance of a
 paper is contingent on one author presenting the paper at the
 symposium.
 
 Submissions should be in PDF format (with the necessary fonts
 embedded). They must be formatted according to the IEEE guide-
 lines described at
 
   ftp://pubftp.computer.org/press/outgoing/
                      proceedings/8.5x11 - Formatting files/
 
 and must not exceed 8 pages; over-length submissions may be
 rejected without review.
 
 Papers are submitted electronically via Easychair:
