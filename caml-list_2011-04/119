Subject: [Caml-list] How to get a file offset

Dear List,

I would like to get the offset of a file opened in another process.

If I have the required rights, I can get this info from 
/proc/<pid>/fdinfo/<fd> but is there a another way ?
Second question, has this already been coded in O'Caml ?

Thanks in advance.
