Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Pros and cons of different GL bindings ?

There is also my own pet binding (glop project on gitorious) if you
need an abstraction layer above both OpenGL or GLES, but I don't
recommend it since you would be the only user :-)

The problem with shaders is that it seams a very unpleasant(*) language
is imposed on us. If good old OpenGL was a brilliant abstraction
between a program and an hypothetical hardware, recent OpenGL versions are
more like an API to access proprietary hardware, thus it is much less
exciting to bind ocaml with this thing.

(*): at least from the point of view of an ocaml programmer
