Subject: [Caml-list] Nicely written Caml/OCaml code to read.

Hi all,

I'll be taking exams at the end of the year (starting in a week, actually), which include programming / informatics 
tests. The language used in these exams is Caml Light (you guessed right: grandes écoles).

I've done a lot of programming in previous years, but I didn't know Caml/OCaml before high school -- I come from a mixed 
C++/C# world, with drops of Python here and there.

In developing my skill in other languages, I always found that reading good code at some point was a great boost to the 
beauty and cleanness of the programs I wrote. Usually, every language has it's own conventions, best practices, and I 
think you can usually learn a lot by reading well-written, nicely-crafted code.

So here's my question: **which code would you recommend to read?**

(As a side note, I'm not really interested (at least in the very short term) in anything on the object-oriented side of 
the language, since the notions used at the exam are limited to the elements available in Caml Light.)

I've tried batteries and Jane street core/ext-core libraries, but the former has extremely few comments, and the latter 
is too widely optimized to be enjoyable to read (Jane street's map function is 30 lines long due to loop unrolling).

Anything that deals with trees or finite state automata gets extra brownie points =) (and +2 if Gabriel Scherer answers)

Thanks for your help!
Clément.
