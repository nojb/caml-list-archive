Subject: Re: [Caml-list] f#/mono vs ocaml runtime system - open gl animation
 screen tearing.

Another difference between the two is not the GC but the way your GL
binding initialize opengl (for instance, double buffering like
previously mentioned, or failure to get the proper bit depth of pixel
format). These settings can make a big differnce as well.

Also, why don't you post a link to the offending program ?
If it's merely a rotating triangle you have hardly any intellectual
property in there :-)
Without this one can only speculate...
