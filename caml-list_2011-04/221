Yes. Symbolic programming is increasingly common in scientific computing as
scientists have come to realise that higher-level languages make it feasible
to attack problems that were considered intractable before. Thomas
Fischbacher did some good work on this using OCaml a few years ago that
attracted a lot of attention.
