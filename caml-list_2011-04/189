As Vincent said, OASIS is not a package manager. It is a tool to
generate portable packages. OASIS-DB is the package manager/database.

The thing is, a package generated by ocaml will build with only the
official OCaml tools as dependencies. However, to generate a package
you need to install OASIS and it has dependencies on other packages.
So package authors need OASIS, but package users don't. This is
probably why you thought OASIS itself could be installed just with the
standard OCaml tools.

After OASIS-DB is up and running, a user will be able to download and
install any OCaml package that was built with OASIS without needing
anything other than the OCaml distribution. But it is not done yet.
That's what I believe are the goals of and boundaries between the
projects, anyway. With OASIS-DB working, I think it'll be possible to
install OASIS itself just with the standard distribution.
