Currently yes - in order to use OASIS (the program) as a developer you need a handful of
dependencies. But Sylvain was working on oasis bundling - i.e. enabling
oasis-powered packages to be distributed in a single bundle with all the deps,
and once this goal is reached OASIS the program will be distributed as a bundle too.
Note that in order to use OASIS (the build system) as a consumer of an existing package no
dependencies (except those of the package itself) are required - ocaml setup.ml drives everything.

I for one want to see OASIS widely used primarily as a way to achieve portability of build systems
for ocaml libraries. It is rather ridiculous to see ocaml libraries (written in portable language)
not installable out of the box on windows or bsd just because the author used some dubious
bash tricks or relied on external binaries (with some specific cmdline flags handling). Also
simple C binding libs get build system right out of the box (and these proved to be a problem
for a newbies in the past).

OASIS uses findlib to install. So the path is `ocamlfind printconf destdir`
