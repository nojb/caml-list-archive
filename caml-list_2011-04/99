Before it was introduced, PolyML was single-threaded. We compared 
running on the single-thread version of PolyML against using a single 
thread in the multi-threaded version. It may be that some optimisations 
were also introduced that cancelled out a slowdown from the 
multi-threaded version, but I can't remember anyone mentioning this.
