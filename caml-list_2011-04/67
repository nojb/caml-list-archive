Well, true, but IMO the first-order limitation is a severe one. Also,  
you cannot abstract over signatures that way, but admittedly, there  
are very few practical uses of that in current OCaml. Not sure what  
"magic" you have in mind, though.

In practical terms, however, I don't think it is convenient enough to  
keep wrapping and unwrapping modules into first-class values just to  
emulate generative functors. Especially since this involves cumbersome  
type annotations.
