Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Pros and cons of different GL bindings ?

I worked a bit on this too, the newest version of glMLite from the SVN
repository should compile on OSX without trouble. It still does not
put the generated libraries in the right places if you use
GODI/findlib though.

My plan is to adapt glMLite to use OASIS with ocamlbuild and simplify
the process, but I haven't had the time lately to finish the work on a
OASIS build system for it.
