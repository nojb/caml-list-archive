Maybe you are right. I find the documentation around oasis and
oasis-db rather confusing.

I don't and won't, I don't like to lag behind compiler releases.

There's something I really don't understand here. oasis and oasis-db
are supposed to be able to manage ocaml packages. I don't wan't to
install another package manager to install the package manager. I also
don't understand why oasis needs findlib, since findlib manages
packages, or does ocaml-db use findlib to manage the packages ?

This is all rather confusing.

The experience I expected was, install the ocaml compilers, download
the oasis sources, compile them and that this would give me a system
to install ocaml packages and their dependencies.

Well I don't like to believe, how packages are installed should be
documented somewhere. When things break you want to understand these
things.

Best,

Daniel
