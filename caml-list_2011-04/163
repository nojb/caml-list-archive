Again we will teach an "Applied Functional Programming Summer in Haskell" s=
chool this year at Utrecht University. In the previous two occasions studen=
ts were all very happy with the school and we plan to repeat this success t=
his year.

The intended audience are prospective master students who have been in cont=
act with Functional Programming, e.g. by taking a general course on program=
ming languages, and want to learn more about Haskell and its typical progra=
mming patterns. In the previous two years we have taught an introductory pa=
rt (advanced bachelor level), an advanced part (beginning master level) and=
 a shared part for both groups. Topics covered are, besides some examples o=
f domain specific languages, also monads, monad transformers, arrows, parse=
r combinators and self-analysing programs, underlying principles, type infe=
rencing, etc. Half of the course time is spent on a larger programming exer=
cise; you can also come with a problem of your own if you want, and get hel=
p from the Utrecht University Software Technology group in finding the prop=
er Haskell idioms, tools and libraries, for solving it.

Furthermore we ask for your cooperation to bring this announcement under th=

 Best,
