  Sometimes the author don't know what exactly users
do not understand, since the author himself understands his
creature very well.  Sometimes the author's plans do not match
the code exactly (for example, "there is <something> that I will
implement soon, but now we will live without it, but it will be
here very soon", or "I've implemented <something>, but it's
a temporary solution that will be removed").  If the system is
complex enough, I found that using the method "ask the dumb
user" is very good for writing basic documentation and FAQs
about the system.  Also this method helps to list all prerequisites
required for understanding the system.

  btw, I am the dumb user of oasis -- I just know that oasis and oasis-db
exist (and I've seen the output of oasis!), and I've written TWO Makefiles
today for my new (but very local) ocaml libraries.
  Sylvain, can I help you if I will be the dumb oasis user?
