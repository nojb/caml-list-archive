Our intent is that you should be able to link with the OCaml libraries
and runtime system, and distribute the resulting executable without
any restrictions.  We chose the LGPL for these part of the systems
precisely to allow this.

Now, there is some fine print in the LGPL that makes a subtle
distinction between static linking and dynamic linking, which we did
not understand at first (and we now find this distinction silly and useless).

But even with the most pessimistic reading of the LGPL, there cannot
be any problems if your main program is itself under a free license
such as the GPL or LGPL.

This is more than the LGPL requires.  Feel free to add or not to add
this paragraph to the license of your software.
