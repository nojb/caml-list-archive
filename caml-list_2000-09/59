The only important thing to know was that a record with three float
fields is more efficient than a triple of floats.

Actually, all you needed to know (and much more) about the OCaml
performance model for the contest is documented in the OCaml
"Questions and answers" pages, especially
        http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/speed.html
and
