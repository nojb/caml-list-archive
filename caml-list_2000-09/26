Please forgive me if this has already has been discussed. I am confused
by the new LGPL/Q license of ocaml. The ocaml source distribution 
details the copyright of the different source files, however, I have some
doubts about the implications for the compiled tools. Here is my
problem:

I'm building a binary distribution of a program which is itself GPL
licensed. There are three different ways to build an "executable":

1.) compiled to native code
2.) compiled to byte code, packaged without the runtime system
    (in this case, the user would have to install an ocaml package
     which comes with it own license).
3.) compiled to byte code and with the runtime system (compiled with -custom)

I understand that in cases (1) and (2) the OCaml license does not impose
any new constraints on the copyright. In case (3), I plan to add the
following text to the existing (GPL) license of the software:

	The executable code contains a copy of the OCaml runtime system 
	which is licensed under the terms of the Gnu Library General
	Public License. [followed by a reference to the LGPL text].

I would appreciate if someone from INRIA could confirm my interpretation,
or correct me. Answers will be forwarded to the debian-ocaml-devel
mailing list.

Ralf.
