Too bad it cannot be a G3 or a G4; you'd be able to use the Unix
version of O'Caml under MacOS X.

O'Caml on MacOS works under MPW Shell in much the same way as it works
under Unix, but it is restricted to byte-code.  It can interface to C
code without problems, but I've given up on the Metrowerks C compiler
for various reasons.  One of these reasons was a bug in the compiler
when calling a function with floating-point arguments with Apple's
calling conventions, hence I couldn't use Apple's libraries with the
Metrowerks compiler.  And Metrowerks' libraries had bugs that
prevented O'Caml from working.  I'm not sure I have the latest version
of Codewarrior, so I don't know if these problems still exist.

There is no interpreter for O'Caml.  There is native-code compilation
and byte-code compilation.  Byte-code can be interfaced with foreign
code without problem.

Depending on your constraints, you might be able to use LinuxPPC on
your Mac.  Then you'll have the full-fledged Unix version of O'Caml.
