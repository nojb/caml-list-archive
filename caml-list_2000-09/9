For Haskell's IO monad, you don't have a function of type IO v -> v.
IO is carried up to main, the "action of the whole program".

Other monads may or may not provide a similar function.

In a pure language it is not possible to create a function which does
I/O when applied. If an operation may do I/O, it is reflected in its
type and usage. It may be considered a good thing, and is practically
a must in a lazy language.

In some Haskell implementations there is monad called ST (state
transformer) which provides mutable references and arrays, and can
be wrapped in a pure function. Not all stateful code requires IO.

Actually in some implementations there is unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
but it's, well, unsafe. It's sometimes very useful for real life
problems.
