I would like to use the LablTk library in Windows NT, but I'm having some
trouble. I can compile modules that use the library, but I can't link them.
For example, if I try to compile "hello.ml", which is one of the LablTk
demos, I get the following error message:

	ocamlc -I c:/ocaml/lib/labltk labltk.cma hello.ml

	The name specified is not recognized as an
	internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
	Error while building custom runtime system

Can anyone explain what this message means? My only guess is that Tcl/Tk
isn't working properly, but my copy of ocamlbrowser seems to work fine.

Thanks,

Kevin
