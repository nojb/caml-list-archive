Hi,

I am about to embark on benchmarking of ultra-fast embedded C flight-code
that must run on a bank of Power/PC's mixed with a bank of TigerSHARC's.
Hence the target platform for my tests will be a Macintosh/604.

Since this is a benchmark, there will be a lot of scaffolding and
administrative code surrounding the C code that needs to be measured, i.e.,
generating test datasets, tracking the performance of the core code, etc.
This will undoubtedly be easier in a HOL like OCaml.

Before I get too far along I want to ask any who might know, whether or not
the Mac version of OCaml can interface to foreign C code produced by the
Metrowerks C compiler. When I last used the Mac version (c.a., 2.02) it was
still interpreted instead of compiled, and I don't recall whether it could
be interfaced to foreign code.

Thanks for your help!
