Since we've entered the realm of marketing now, let me also suggest that
there are good reasons to identify your product as unique, and emphasize 
the distinctions with other (inferior :) products. It really depends on
the outsider who's view you want to influence; it is certainly easy to
hire an ML programmer to work on ML code, but maybe not so easy to port 
a large body of ML code to an ML compilation system.
