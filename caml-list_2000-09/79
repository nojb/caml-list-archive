Xavier, ...

why not clarify further this further and simply state in your licence that the
runtime is under the LGPL, with the added permission to distribute statically
linked code. I don't have it under my eyes right now, but i think you
understand the idea.

Anyway, the only problem that could arise would be if INRIA (or whoever hold
the copyright for the runtime) decide to begin suing people about it. I don't
think this will happen.

Also, what about the toplevel ?

I guess a program built with ocamlmktop would be under the QPL, since it
contains not only the runtime, but also some part of the compiler needed for
parsing ocaml sentences ?

But then i may be wron, didn't look at the files involved.

Friendly,
