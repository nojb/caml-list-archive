Thanks for kind words, and sorry for having been silent so far -- we
thought it would be more fun to keep silence until the official
announcement, especially when people weren't aware of us.;)

I heard the 3rd place entry was 100 times faster than the 4th, and the
2nd (Xavier's) was 5.5 times faster than the 3rd, but the 1st (ours)
wasn't so much faster than the 2nd.  Doesn't this mean Caml is a
_much_ better language than others---though the contest judge seemed
somewhat reluctant to say Caml is "a fine programming tool for many
applications" and "the programming tool of choice for discriminating
hackers"---or, at least, its developers are much better programmers
than others?:-)  (Jerome was the main programmer in our team, and his
coding was amazingly fast.)

By the way, we are going to make a web page to describe what we did in
detail.  We'll announce it in this list when it's ready.
