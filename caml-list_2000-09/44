> In your language summary, was OCaml included among the ML category?

Several members of this list were surprised that the language summary
only mentioned "ML" and not OCaml nor SML nor other ML variants.

This is how it appeared on the judge's presentation, but I take it
that in their minds (as well as in mine), "ML" stands for all ML
dialects: OCaml, Caml Light, SML, Moscow ML, etc.  (Similarly, they had
only one line for C and C++, although both languages are definitely
different.)

Actually, I like the use of "ML" as an umbrella for all these
dialects, since it helps reduce the fragmentation of the
F.P. community as viewed by outsiders.
