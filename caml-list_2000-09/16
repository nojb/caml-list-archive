I've been eagerly following the success of Bluetail and Erlang and wondering if
something similar might be possible with OCaml.  The model seems simple:
assemble a small team of first-class programmers and take advantage of the
productivty gains afforded by a good functional language to compete on quality,
performance, and time to market.  

For example, I see potential opportunities in the emerging ASP/hosted
application market, where most interfaces are simple network text or XML
protocols and fpl's advantages in dealing with complex logic could be critical.

Has anyone considered such a venture?  Perhaps the folks at INRIA?

(sorry, my French isn't up to the translation)
