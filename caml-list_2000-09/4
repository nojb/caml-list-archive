Actually, we used a post-3.00 development version.

I'm embarrassed to admit it, but the ray-tracer actually triggers a
rather unlikely bug in the ocamlopt 3.00 compiler.
(The development version we used still has the bug, but by sheer luck
doesn't trigger it.)

So, this programming contest actually has some technical value as a
bug finder, in addition to its amusement value :-)

I modified the source code available on the Web site so that it
doesn't run into the bug.  (The bug pops up in a function that is
not normally called, anyway.)

Enjoy,
