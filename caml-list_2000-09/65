Subject: Unison file synchronizer -- new stable release
Reply-to: bcpierce@cis.upenn.edu

Message-ID: <3432.969997662@saul.cis.upenn.edu>
From: "Benjamin C. Pierce" <bcpierce@saul.cis.upenn.edu>
Sender: weis@pauillac.inria.fr

We are pleased to announce a new release of Unison, a file
synchronization utility for Unix and Windows systems written entirely in
OCaml.  The Unison homepage, including extensive documentation,
pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Solaris, and Windows, and (GPL'd)
sources can be found here:

    http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison

Unison allows two copies of a collection of files and directories to be
stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in
each replica to the other. Unison can deal with updates to both replicas
of a distributed directory structure.  Updates that do not conflict are
propagated automatically; conflicting updates are detected and
displayed. Unison can communicate through a direct socket link or through
an rsh/ssh tunnel. 

The most important improvement since the last major release (last July)
is an implementation of the "rsync protocol" for diffs-only transmission
of small changes to large files.

Announcements of major new releases are posted _very occasionally_ in
public forums.  To stay up to date with all release announcements,
subscribe to our (moderated, low-volume) mailing list by visiting
http://www.egroups.com/subscribe/unison-announce.

Enjoy,

      The Unison team
