Hello all camlists,

1. Is the @ operator costly or is it implemented as a simple pointers
   manipulation? 

2. Somebody on this list told about a set-like data structure that was
   very efficient to give an answer when an element is NOT in the
   set. What is the name of this structure? Patricia tree? (I wasn't
   able to figure it out looking at the ml archives)


Thanks a lot,
d.
