I did not reply immediately to your message, because I hoped members
of this list with more experience in start-up companies would comment.

The main issue, in my opinion, is to have a suitable application area
to target.  You simply can't sell a new language alone, even with a
good implementation.  Several companies were created in the '80s and
'90s to sell functional or logic languages and implementations, and I
think all of them went down.

The remarkable success of Bluetail is mainly due to them being experts
in a hot domain (telecom software).  The additional productivity and
reliability brought by Erlang over more conventional languages helped
them a lot, of course, but Erlang by itself would not have allowed
them to make such a big hit.

That's one possibility -- although you should not disclose your
business plans on a mailing list :-)

We didn't, really, by lack of a hot application area.
