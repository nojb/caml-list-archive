Subject: Tuareg Mode and revised syntax

The current debate about revised syntaxes and programming styles leads
me to the following remark about Tuareg mode for Emacs. Tuareg is is
not intended to be customized along all possible programming styles
and Camlp4 hacks, but some support can still be provided in one
particular case: syntax constructs which can't be handled without deep
and technical patches to the Emacs-Lisp code and which do not
interfere with classical syntaxes and programming styles.

This happens to be the case of the following syntaxes/styles
( blah
; blah
; blah
)
and
match ... with
  [ blah
  | blah
  | blah
  ]
now handled by the Tuareg mode.

For the `match ... with' syntax, proper indentation also requires
setting variable `tuareg-|-extra-unindent' to 0, unless you'd like a 4
characters indentation of `[' after the `with' keyword.

Moreover, version 1.38.1 fixes a lot of minor bugs, brings a standard
customization interface and replaces most ad-hoc fontification faces
with standard Emacs faces (same as C, Java, Lisp...).
