Rather than hacking the OCaml runtime (the relevant code is {byte,asm}run/s=
ys.c, btw) personally I'd produce a separate module of my own with two impl=
ementations - one for Linux which just uses the built-in primitives and the=
n one for Windows using WinAPI functions directly. A cursory glance at the =
runtime code suggests that hacking wide support onto the runtime is not a "=
one-liner".

Shouldn't make it (too much) harder - I use the MinGW build of OCaml withou=
t issue for C stubs, after a slightly steep learning-curve. The w32api pack=
age in Cygwin provides all of the headers and link libraries for Windows li=
braries (it's installed by default with the gcc-mingw). If you ever have to=
 link with more exotic libraries, dlltool is (sort of) your friend (it with=
 a little bit of help allows you to generate the .a files needed for the DL=
L you're linking with - 3rd party libraries on Windows tend only to ship th=
e MSVC .lib files)

Can o' worms, I expect! Windows (by which I mean Windows NT) took the simpl=
est route of 16-bit wchars for Unicode but it's not necessarily the best wa=
y of programming in general... the problem with going Unicode is *how* you =
go Unicode.
