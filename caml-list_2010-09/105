Hi Vincent!

you can try camloo [1] which compiles (old-syntax) caml-light to bigloo,
which is a scheme to C compiler. I reckon it would be quite easy to
update it to parse the ocaml syntax if you don't use
functors/objects/variants/labels/thread (ie. if you use only what is
available in caml-light).

Cheers,
Thomas
