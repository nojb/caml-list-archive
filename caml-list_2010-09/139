Running Eliom over OCamlNet lets it integrate a bit more closely with a
third-party web server via FastCGI.  Standard functions such as absolute
URL construction and SSL checking that depend on the host, port, and
connection type have a knack for breaking when run behind a reverse
proxy.  So, if you're trying to integrate an Eliom web service into a
larger site running Apache/nginx/lighttpd/whatever, FastCGI can be a
huge benefit.

OTOH, if Ocsigen had a FastCGI extension, that could alleviate the need
for another web server in some cases.
