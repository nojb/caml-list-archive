Subject: [ANN] camera-rescue v0.0.1: Recover JPEG files from a crashed SD/MMC/CF camera memory card
Message-Id: <E1Ot57q-0007Qo-D6@giga>
X-Spam: no; 0.00; le-gall:01 recovers:01 mmc:98 data:02 eoi:02 consistent:02 crashed:04 crashed:04 generated:05 marker:05 marker:05 dump:06 scan:06 filesystem:06 memory:09 

This program searches for JPEG files into a dump of a memory card (a RAW
file). Once found, each files is saved in a different JPEG file.

This tool scans for JPEG markers inside the RAW. When a SOI (Start of Image)
marker is found, the tool scan the content to find a consistent EOI (End of
Image) marker.

It doesn't need to have a valid filesystem so it can handle most of the
crashed memory card. It recovers the image data and EXIF information.
