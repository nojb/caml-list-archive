That is a possible project:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=604&group_id=1&atid=102

The main problem is that we need to create this kind of function. Most
of the forge around doesn't provide an "easy coordination" with other
forges. But I think, it is feasible.

I would do it myself, but I am pretty busy with other (I hope) important
projects like OASIS-DB. If someone can provide me a solution for this, I
will be happy to put it on forge.ocamlcore.org.

A nice first step, could be to just mirror the git repository from
github.
