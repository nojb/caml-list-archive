There are two good options:
      * Ocsigen <http://ocsigen.org>, a web server and application
        framework in OCaml.  At this point, you must use its web server
        (which you could put behind Apache or whatever with a reverse
        proxy).  The setup would look like a lot of Rails deployments.
        I currently use Ocsigen alone on my web site.
      * OCamlNet <http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/ocamlnet.html>
        provides a CGI API with FastCGI and AJP adapters for building
        web applications.  You can run that behind most web servers.
