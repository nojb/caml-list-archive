Ocsigen can run with most other webservers via a reverse proxy. The 
Ocsigen process itself doesn't even need to have special privileges, and 
can be installed and run by a regular user. If you are allowed to use 
WSGI, FastCGI, AJP, etc., it shouldn't be more difficult to use Ocsigen. 
Process management might not be as handy, so you'll have to manage 
somehow the ocsigen process crashing / being killed, but there are other 
tools (e.g. monit) for that.

I'm not saying that WSGI, FastCGI, AJP, etc. support for Eliom has no 
benefit! But we can live (and we do) without it for now.
