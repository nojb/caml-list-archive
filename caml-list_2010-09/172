Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming
                                  RDP 2011
                  29/5/2011 - 3/6/2011, Novi Sad, Serbia

                        Call for Workshop Proposals

RDP 2011 is a federated event comprising two major conferences:
 - The 22nd International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
   Applications , RTA 2011
 - The 10th International Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and
   Applications, TLCA 2011.
 
Previous RDPs were held in 2003 in Valencia (Spain), 2004 in Aachen
(Germany), 2005 in Nara (Japan), 2007 in Paris (France) and 2009 in
Brasilia (Brasil).  RDP has a tradition of federating every two years
RTA and TLCA, and of hosting related workshops.
 
We solicit proposals for satellite workshops of RDP 2011 that are
related in topics to one or both of the RDP conferences.
 
Workshops should have a length of 1 or 2 days (possibilities for
longer workshops should be discussed with the organizers). It is
tradition at RDP that attendance to workshops is open to participants
of parallel events, similar to the way FLoC workshops are run. There
will be one day (Sunday, May 29, 2011) reserved for workshops,
however, it will also be possible to run workshops on the other days
in parallel to one of the main conferences.
 
RDP will provide the possibility to print workshop proceedings,
details of the procedure will be posted later by the local organizing
committee. RDP will not be able to reimburse invited workshop speakers
for travel or living expenses, though it may be possible to waive part
of the registration fees for invited speakers. The priority of RDP
will be to keep registration fees for the conferences and workshops
low.
 
Please submit your workshop proposal by email to
 
      rdp2011-workshop@uns.ac.rs
 
Proposals should be written in plain text. The proposal should cover
the following topics:
  
 1. Name of workshop
 2. A statement of the topics and goals of the workshop
 3. Names and addresses of the organizers
 4. Pointers to descriptions of previous editions of the workshop, if
    any
 5. A description of the submission selection process
 6. Plans for the publication of proceedings (informal proceedings
    distributed to participants, electronic journal, proceedings with
    separate selection process, ...)
 7. Plans for invited speakers or special sessions (round-table
    discussion, tutorials, ...)
 8. Expected length of the workshop
 9. Expected number of attendees
10. Any special needs (for system demonstrations ...)
 
Workshop Selection Committee:
 
Luke Ong (TLCA 2011 program chair)
Manfred Schmidt-Schauss (RTA 2011 program chair)
Silvia Ghilezan (RDP 2011 general chair).
