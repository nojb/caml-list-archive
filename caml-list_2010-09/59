                         2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

	        The Sixth ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
            Types in Language Design and Implementation

	               Austin, Texas, USA
                     Tuesday, January 25, 2011
                    (Co-located with POPL 2011)

	     http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/tldi2011/

               Submission Deadline: October 11, 2010

The role of types and proofs in all aspects of language design,
compiler construction, and software development has expanded greatly
in recent years.  Type systems, type-based analyses and type-theoretic
deductive systems have been central to advances in compilation
techniques for modern programming languages, verification of safety
and security properties of programs, program transformation and
optimization, and many other areas.  The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types
in Language Design and Implementation brings researchers together to
share new ideas and results concerning all aspects of types and
programming, and is now an annual event.  TLDI 2011 is the sixth
workshop in the series and will be co-located with POPL in Austin,
Texas in January 2011.

Submissions for TLDI 2011 are invited on all interactions of types
with language design, implementation, and programming methodology.
This includes both practical applications and theoretical aspects.
TLDI 2011 specifically encourages papers from a broad field of
programming language and compiler researchers, including those working
on object-oriented or dynamic languages, systems programming,
mobile-code or security, as well as traditional fully-static type
systems.  Topics of interest include:

    * Typed intermediate languages and type-directed compilation
    * Type-based language support for safety and security
    * Types for interoperability
    * Type systems for system programming languages
    * Type-based program analysis, transformation, and optimization
    * Dependent types and type-based proof assistants
    * Types for security protocols, concurrency, and distributed =20
computing
    * Type inference and type reconstruction
    * Type-based specifications of data structures and program =20
invariants
    * Type-based memory management
    * Proof-carrying code and certifying compilation
    * Types and objects

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list; papers on novel
utilizations of type information are welcome.  Authors concerned about
the suitability of a topic are encouraged to inquire via electronic
mail to the program chair prior to submission.

Submission Guidelines:

Authors should submit a full paper of no more than 12 pages (including
bibliography and appendices) by Monday, October 11, 2010.  The
submission deadline and length limitations are firm.  Submissions that
do not meet these guidelines will not be considered.

All submissions should be in standard ACM SIGPLAN conference format:
two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline.  Detailed
formatting guidelines are available on the SIGPLAN Author Information
page, along with a LaTeX class file and template.

Papers must be submitted electronically via the workshop website
(http://www.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/tldi2011/) in Adobe Portable Document
Format (PDF) and must be formatted for US Letter size (8.5"x11")
paper.  Authors for whom this is a hardship should contact the program
chair before the deadline.

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy.
Submissions should contain original research not published or
submitted for publication elsewhere.

Publication:

As in previous years, accepted papers will be published by the ACM and
appear in the ACM digital library.  A printed proceedings will be
available at the workshop.

Important Dates:

- Submission deadline: October 11, 2010 (Monday), 21:00 Samoa-Apia Time
- Notification:        November 8, 2010 (Monday)
- Final versions due:  November 22, 2010 (Monday)
- Workshop:            January 25, 2011 (Tuesday)
