Please consider organizing a workshop to be co-located with CAV 2011
in Snowbird Utah.  The details for the proposals are attached below in
the call for workshop proposals.  Previous CAV editions have had
successful workshops associated with them and we hope to carry forth
the tradition with CAV 2011.

  23rd International Conference on
    Computer Aided Verification
              CAV 2011
July 14-20, Cliff Lodge, Snowbird, Utah


Call for Workshop Proposals

The 2011 Computer-Aided Verification (CAV) Workshops provides an
oppurtunity for participants to discuss topics in the broader
verification related domains. CAV 2011 Workshops will be held
before the main conference on July 14 and 15.

Workshop proposals will be reviewed by the Workshop chair along with
the program chairs and members of the steering committee. Proposals
must consist of the following two parts:

-- Part I: Technical Information --

A short (about 1 page) scientific justification of the proposed
topic, its significance and relevance to CAV, and the particular
benefits of the workshop to the verification community, as well as a
list of previous or related workshops (if relevant).

-- Part II: Organizational Information --

- contact information of the workshop organizers.
- identifying a main contact for the workshop (i.e. a workshop chair).
- the desired length of the workshop, (one or two days).
- estimate of the audience size.
- proposed format and agenda  (for example, demo sessions, tutorials, etc.)
- potential invited speakers.
- procedures for selecting papers and participants.
- plans for dissemination, if any (for example, special issues of
  journals).
- special technical, AV, or USB stick needs.
- links to a preliminary website of the workshop and call for
  papers (if possible).
- information if workshop has been previously held.


Important Dates:

Proposals are due by Oct 15th, 2010 by email to the Workshop
chair. Organizers will be notified by Oct 31st, 2010.

The workshop proposals will be reviewed and evaluated on the following
criteria

* Potential to advance state of the art in verification technologies,
especially ability to break new ground.
* Relevance to CAV.
* Overlap of topics with other proposed workshops.
* Past-successes of the workshop and association with previous CAV
conferences.
* Organizers' ability and experience to lead a successful workshop.

All accepted workshops will be asked to provide a webpage, call for
papers, and list of invited speakers. The workshop participants will
be required to register for the workshop through the CAV main
registration page.

The registration rates for workshops will be set by CAV organizers in
consultation with the workshop organizers, following rate structures
similar to (but not the same as) those followed in the past. The
workshop organizers are strongly encouraged to seek external funding
and sponsorships.
