I agree with that the ultra-slickness of github is something nice. As
far as I am concerned, I don't see as a problem to use github for source
code and distribute release through the forge. You can benefit from
BTS/mailing list/aggregated news et al on the forge. I think release
distribution, bug tracking and news is something that should be enough
to "concentrate OCaml stuff in one place" and provide a good indexing of
your project (not to say, that it will also cross-link your github
project, thus enhance your PageRank). 

If you want to use github, just hide the "source" tab of the project and
leave a note on the project webpage. Ideally, if someone has the time to
code a "github" plugin for the forge, you can choose "github" as SCM and
been redirected to the github project.
