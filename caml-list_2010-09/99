   Very interesting ! Could you provide more information on the technical
   side : did you edit the manual by hand, or use an automatic diffing
   process ?
   
I diff the txt versions of the reference manual and change the
html version by hand. For the grammar rule index I use a tool and
manual editing.

   I find the "yellow background" style a bit hard on the eye for large
   changes. While it's useful for small changes (words or sentences),
   it's overkill and incomfortable for large paragraphs.

Yes, these yellow sections are an overkill. However, everybody
knows that 7.10-7.17 are new. So I only marked them for
consistency. Most people know about these changes already and
won't read them again in the enhanced manual.


   I would be happy to propose a better visual style, however this is
   made quite difficult by your use of non-semantic markup such as:
   
     <div style="background-color:yellow; color:red; border-style:none;
   border-width:0.5pt">
   
   Could you use CSS instead ? 

I'll keep this in mind for 3.13. If you have suggestions for
better color combinations I am very interested. However, I will
not change version 3.12 again, I already spent too much time on
it. 


Bye,

Hendrik
