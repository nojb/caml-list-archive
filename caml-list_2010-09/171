Nothing per se. I've tried so set something up with ocsigen, but I had
to give up. There seems to be a certain philosophy behind it how you
should writing web apps.

But I just wanted to do something:
-  small ( one page app )
-  quick and dirty ( no big setup upfront, no compilation)
-  deployment, by dropping a (ocaml script) into a webroot, not matter
what webserver is running
- permissive license ( mit, ...)

 ~~~~ from wikipedia ~~~~
require 'rack'
app = Rack::Builder.app do
  lambda do |env|
    body = "Hello, World!"
    [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain", "Content-Length" =>
body.length.to_s}, [body]]
  end
end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
