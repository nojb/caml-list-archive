The "0.9pre1" release of the LablScintilla OCaml binding for Scintilla 
is now available, fully supporting Linux and Windows builds and 
Scintilla versions 1.70 - 1.72 (current).

LablScintilla provides a complete binding for the Scintilla editing 
component, a widely used multi-platform open source package.  While 
billed as a "source code editing component", Scintilla is much more: 
providing control of complex layouts with multiple font faces and 
backgrounds, plus supplying numerous fine-grained events covering 
input and text modification tracking, it can easily provide the 
foundation for general-purpose text editors or programming IDEs.

The majority of this binding has been in use internally for well over 
a year, but as it has had little opportunity for external feedback, a 
little exposure seemed prudent prior to going for a "1.0" version.

This release has been built and tested using OCaml 3.09.3 on Fedora 
Core 6 and Windows XP, supports findlib and "hands-off" building and 
installing (no "configure" script or manual file editing required), 
and has pre-built binaries for [native] Windows XP.  The full package 
is licensed under the "new" BSD license, and may be downloaded here:
