All right.  After getting back to this, I

1. removed all yum packages and rpms that were caml-related
2. built ocaml 3.09.3 from source - NO weirdness or errors
3. built lablgtk2 (September snapshot) from source - NO errors
4. built lablscintilla-0.9pre1 from source - NO errors

I am STILL getting

"Error on dynamically loaded library: 
/usr/lib/ocaml/stublibs/dlllablscintilla.so: undefined symbol: 
caml_names_of_builtin_cprim"

if I use ocamlc.opt instead of ocamlc when I execute my compile

ocamlc -o bait -I +lablgtk2 -I +lablscintilla -thread threads.cma 
lablgtk.cma gtkInit.cmo scintilla.cma bait.ml

ocamlc functions flawlessly, ocamlc.opt yields the above error.

Given "Compatibility with the bytecode compiler is extremely high: the 
same source code should run identically when compiled with ocamlc and 
ocamlopt." in Chapter 11 of the OCaml manual, I am really not 
expecting ocamlc and ocamlc.opt to function any differently.  Choosing 
either of the commands from a cleanly built OCaml installation should 
be a matter of taste or personal preference, NOT correctness.

What could be (or is likely to) be going wrong?  Is it related to the 
gcc 4.11?  I will note that I had difficulties with doing a source 
build of lablgtk2 WITH Aleksey Nogin's RPM of OCaml for FC6 (funny 
errors about "deprecated -mcpu switches)... but all of these went away 
after doing a local full build of OCaml 3.09.3.
