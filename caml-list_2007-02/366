More the other way around, but yes, the NVIDIA driver binary install
even explicitly mentions that it overwrites some original X install
files.  Why don't you use the official Debian NVIDIA packages?  1.0-8776
is in testing and unstable, and 1.0.9746 is in experimental.  If you
want to run stable and are not familiar with mixing in bits from other
versions of Debian, you should read "man apt_preferences" for a start.
Adding (say) experimental to your sources.list, and something like

  Package: nvidia-*
  Pin: release o=Debian,a=experimental
  Pin-Priority: 991

to your /etc/apt/preferences should get you going.
