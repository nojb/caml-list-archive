That means that I will have to review carefully my code...

Yes. That's the solution I was planning.
It took me a long time to narrow the problem, because I have a lot of
calls of this kind and was never bitten by this problem.
But at first glance, i did not find one in my libraries with would have
returned a small float value.

The problem is not the solution, but the fact that I will have to review
my code to check all this.

At the first place, except the fact that I misused the macros, I still
do not understand why CAMLreturn(0.05) would return 0.?

Thanks for your replies.
