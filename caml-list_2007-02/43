Oh, cool.

I thought I had already tried it and it didn't worked.
But I just tried it at my Mac and it did work this way.

I will try this again on the Sun next week, where I
thought that I already tried it and it didn't worked...

( ...but maybe I was tired only ;-) and typed something stupid ;-) )


But why didn't worked the code with the two sprintf's?!
The outer sprintf should have do what I was looking for?!

Thanks,
