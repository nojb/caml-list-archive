The two options I see are:
1) noting a re-binding, and automatically testing against the value of 
that previous binding
2) extra syntax (maybe || instead of | before active match constructs)

In the first case, there's backwards compatibility issues.  Wouldn't it 
be useful to have the compiler warn on such uses, to make people aware 
of rebindings performed in their code?
