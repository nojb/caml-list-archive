More than "some work".  I talked with her at PEPM (right before POPL), 
and ESC/Haskell is very much alive, and very cool.  Details available at
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nx200/

ESC/Ocaml for the 'functional core' should be straightforward enough 
but, as usual, the imperative features make life considerably more complex.
