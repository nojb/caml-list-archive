It's possible that there was some problem with how it was compiled. Feel 
free to try my RPM from 
http://rpm.nogin.org/MetaPRL/fc6/ocaml-3.09.3-1.rhfc6.i386.html (you 
should be able to use http://rpmbin.nogin.org/MetaPRL/fedora-6/ in yum, 
with http://rpmbin.nogin.org/GPG-PUBKEY.txt key, if you prefer 
installing via yum).
