Thanks,
  shark does an excellent job of finding symbols in the executable, but 
it can only get a shallow view of the call graph. So you know which 
functions take most of the time, but you don't know what functions call 
them. For that you need compiler support.
Given that the processor is supported on other platforms, I was 
wondering whether someone has done the port?
