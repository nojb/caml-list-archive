> 6 months ago I was let go from a job I held for 26 years. I can't thank you enough for introducting  me in this business.
> You have given me a new lease on life.  Already earning twice as much as I earned in my old job.
> 
> I drive a 2005 Jaguar S Type. Taking home 6 digit level in 18 months. I am having a great time in this business.
> Its fun and I am a hero to the courts and to my clients. What an exciting profession to be in.
> 
> Doing exactly what your training tells me to do, is working beautifully.  I go to the court and locate all of the
> clients I can handle.
> 
> I use your advanced reporting services to find all assets and employment. 
> Using your fill in the blank forms I send them out to the appropriate firms. Then the funds arrive to my PO Box.
> Its like magic. I love it.
> 
> I can take a holiday when ever I have a whim to do so.  Hawaii and a 1050 footer to the Panama Canal etc. this year.
> 
> Please show this letter to others.  
> This profession is so big it needs many more of us assisting the courts and the  people who have been damaged

> Any friend of Dorothy, remarked the Cowardly Lion, must be our friend, as well.
> 
> So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and converse upon more pleasant subjects.
> Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse? Not yet, replied Jim.
