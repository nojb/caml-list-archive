It is hard to begin to move when you don't know where you are moving, how to move, or if you are going to get there.He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that.
A well-aimed spear is worth three.I do not pray for a lighter load, but for a stronger back.
It ain't sin if you crack a few laws now and then, just so long as you don't break any.
