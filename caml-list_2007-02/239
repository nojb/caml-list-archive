Well, on the "Caml Humps", you should be able to find something. :)

In particular, I released a *simple* version of an OCaml binding for 
the PCRE pattern-matching library: "LablPCRE 1.0".  While simple, it 
is also non-trivial (it utilizes "custom" blocks with finalization).

As it happens, the package was originally class-based, and then was 
switched to a module orientation after "input" from the list. ;)

I also have a much larger binding for the Scintilla editing component 
("LablScintilla 0.9pre1"), but it *is* quite a bit larger, *and* 
interfaces with LablGTK (representing a much more interesting can of 
worms).. so it would be better to digest LablPCRE first.
