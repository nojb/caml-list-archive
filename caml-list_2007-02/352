You should at least say which front-end you use for lablGL (Tcl/Tk,
Glut or LablGTK). This may be relevant.

Well, if there is a bug in the X server, a program may trigger it.
Personally I've never seen that for lablGL though. And the reports
I've seen were about the program itself segfaulting, not the server.

Sending me the complete source to try to reproduce the problem?

You could also look at the features you are using: does turning
double-buffering off change anything, are you using lots of display
lists...

It might work. But would it not be simpler to write most of your display
code in C, and just the logic in ocaml. This way, if the same problem
pops up again you would have some C code to show the developpers.
