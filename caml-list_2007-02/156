I performed further tests and gathered more data on this.  I verified 
that the cmo and cmi files produced by the two versions of ocamlc are 
identical - they are (well, at least their md5 hashes are).  So this 
would suggest that it is not the COMPILE portions of the two ocamlc 
versions that are causing this - which leaves how the BYTECODE-mode 
executable is produced.

Covering even more bases, I pulled the CVS version of the OCaml source 
tree and built it on the target FC6/gcc 4.1.1 box... NO change.

Again, what IS the difference in operation between the two versions of 
ocamlc, one built as a BYTECODE executable, the other built NATIVE?
