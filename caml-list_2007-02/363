X-Spam: no; 0.00; lablgl:01 ocaml:01 apt-get:01 overwrite:01 libs:01 recompile:01 ocaml:01 lablgl:01 1.0:98 compile:01 caml-list:01 incompatible:01 kernel:01 installer:01 opengl:02 

I'm talking about nvidia and opengl and debian. nothing ocaml specific.

Let me be more precise:

I install manually the nvidia driver with
./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-8756-pkg1.run

Then everything runs fine. (I compile and execute on the same machine)

when there is an upgrade of some xorg component in debian unstable,
then, after apt-get upgrade, glx is very often broken.
Just running glxgears crashes the x server. Sometimes also a more subtle 
effect of this is that glxgears display becomes very slow, or hectic.

I suspect that debian packages overwrite some libs that become 
incompatible with my nvidia kernel installation. I'm saying this because 
usually it is enough to copy again the files created by the nvidia 
installer and it works again. But sometimes I have to recompile the 
nvidia drivers.

Again, nothing ocaml specific here. For me lablgl works like a charm
(except that I had to patch it by hand in order to have the 
polygon_offset feature and (thanks to Jacques Garrigue), the feedback 
features)
