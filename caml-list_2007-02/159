You are a bit quick. Before discussing syntax it is more important to
define the semantics of such patterns. I mean we have already three
predefined kinds of equality in O'Caml:

- ( == )
- ( = )
- (fun x y -> compare x y = 0)

I admit I do not prefer any one of them. So which equality should be
used to test whether the variable is equal to the matched part of the
value?

I guess this simple question is one of the reasons why such a feature is
not in the language up to now.
