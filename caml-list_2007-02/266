It is also an error in Lisp - although there is a well defined way to 
avoid the error by explicitly specifying who shadows what.
http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/fun_shadow.html

I think there is a way to treat warnings as errors, so this is covered.

it should be possible to separate 4 situations:
1 cross-module shadowing (warning)
2 redefining a global value in the same file (warning)
3 shadow a global value with a local one (warning)
4 redefine a local value as in your example (no warning)
the warnings can be made optional; one may be able to enable them 
separately (one by one) etc.
