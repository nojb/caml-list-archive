         Structural Operational Semantics 2007

         An Affiliated Workshop of LICS 2007  and  ICALP 2007

         July 9, 2007, Wroclaw, Poland

         http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~rvg/SOS2007

Aim: Structural operational semantics (SOS) provides a framework
for giving operational semantics to programming and specification
languages. A growing number of programming languages from
commercial and academic spheres have been given usable semantic
descriptions by means of structural operational semantics. Because
of its intuitive appeal and flexibility, structural operational
semantics has found considerable application in the study of the
semantics of concurrent processes. Moreover, it is becoming a
viable alternative to denotational semantics in the static analysis
of programs, and in proving compiler correctness.

Recently, structural operational semantics has been successfully
applied as a formal tool to establish results that hold for classes
of process description languages. This has allowed for the
generalisation of well-known results in the field of process
algebra, and for the development of a meta-theory for process
calculi based on the realization that many of the results in this
field only depend upon general semantic properties of language
constructs.

This workshop aims at being a forum for researchers, students and
practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for
future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics.
One of the specific goals of the workshop is to establish synergies
between the concurrency and programming language communities working
on the theory and practice of SOS. Moreover, it aims at widening the
knowledge of SOS among postgraduate students and young researchers
worldwide.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

  * programming languages
  * process algebras
  * higher-order formalisms
  * rule formats for operational specifications
  * meaning of operational specifications
  * comparisons between denotational, axiomatic and SOS
  * compositionality of modal logics with respect to
    operational specifications
  * congruence with respect to behavioural equivalences
  * conservative extensions
  * derivation of proof rules from operational specifications
  * software tools that automate, or are based on, SOS.

Papers reporting on applications of SOS to software engineering and
other areas of computer science are welcome.

History: The first SOS Workshop took place on the 30th of August 2004
in London as one of the satellite workshops of CONCUR 2004.
Subsequently, SOS 2005 occurred on the 10th of July 2005 in
Lisbon as a satellite workshop of ICALP 2005, and SOS 2006 on the
26th of August 2006 in Bonn as a satellite workshop of CONCUR 2006.
A special issue of the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming on
Structural Operational Semantics appeared in 2004; a special issue of
Theoretical Computer Science dedicated to SOS 2005 is in press, and a
special issue of Information & Computation on Structural Operational
Semantics inspired by SOS 2006 is in preparation. 


INVITED SPEAKER:

   Pawel Sobocinski (Cambridge, UK)


PAPER SUBMISSION:

We solicit unpublished papers reporting on original research on the
general theme of SOS. Prospective authors should register their
intention to submit a paper by uploading a title and abstract via
the workshop web page by:

  *** Friday 6 April 2007. ***

Papers should take the form of a pdf file in ENTCS format
[http://www.entcs.org/], whose length should not exceed 15 pages (not
including an optional "Appendix for referees" containing proofs that
will not be included in the final paper). We will also consider 5-page
papers describing tools to be demonstrated at the workshop.

Proceedings: Preliminary proceedings will be available at the meeting.
The final proceedings of the workshop will appear as a volume in the
ENTCS series.  We may decide to arrange a special issue of an archival
journal devoted to full versions of selected papers from the workshop.


IMPORTANT DATES:

  * Submission of abstract: Friday 6 April 2007

  * Submission: Sunday 15 April 2007

  * Notification: Wednesday 9 May 2007

  * Final version: Friday 25 May 2007

  * Workshop: Monday 9 July 2007

  * Final ENTCS version: Friday 10 August 2007.
