I agree --- local shadowing is too useful a programming style to have
warnings issued. Though redefining a value at global level is possibly worth
having a warning about.

IMHO Pervasives is the only module that should be opened --- renaming a
module with "module Foo = SomeVeryLongModuleNameYouDontWantToTypeLots" is
better (makes clearer code) than "open ... ". But that's just another
opinion...
