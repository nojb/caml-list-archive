What version of X.org? I had a lot of trouble on the Edgy Eft
release of Ubuntu which had X.org 7.0. Those troubles disappeared
when I moved to Ubuntu Feisty which has X.org 7.2.

No, the xserver should not crash because of a user space
program.

Try strace/ltracing the executable to pinpoint which call
to the underlying X libs are causing the crash, then write
(in C if possible) a minimal test program to recreate the
problem and send it as a bug report to the X maintainers.

If you're not up to writing the minimal C program but can
write a minimal Ocaml program I'd be happy to translate it
for you.

Hope this helps,
Erik
