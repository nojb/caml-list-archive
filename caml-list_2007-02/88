Hey, I will read the full message just to see what someone is doing 
with 70K lines of OCaml code! :)

The usual comment - you don't mention any version and platform 
details... especially with something that took as long as this 
probably did, those might be of interest (particularly since some 
teams doing a project of this size might have not been keeping up with 
OCaml releases).

It is not crystal clear that you are using "finalize" routines - if 
so, they are an obvious (and easy) place to position check code.  If 
not, why not?  It sounds like you might *need* to wrap some of your 
values created in C-land in smart-but-thin OCaml objects, if for 
nothing else than to more delicately handle lifetime issues.

These "popped up" for me on my initial reading. ;)
