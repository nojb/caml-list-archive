Anyone heard about or used the GLCaml library that provides OpenGL to OCaml 
functions:

  http://glcaml.sourceforge.net/

I've used LablGL a lot and, while it is excellent, it is very out of date. 
GLCaml claims to be much more up to date so I'm surprised not to have heard 
of it before.

I really think this is a fantastically important piece of work (assuming it 
works!). I'd love to see unsafe, low-level bindings to the whole of a recent 
OpenGL (with extensions) available from OCaml. I don't know the author 
(Elliott Oti) but his example code could leverage OCaml a lot more. I suspect 
this project will gain a lot from more experienced programmers helping to 
write a safe high-level OCaml API on top of these low-level bindings.

I've been thinking about writing another planet renderer recently, using 
something like ROAM:

  http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/irg3/ws0405/cg/rcomp/29/x117.html

OCaml is ideal for this kind of work and should be able to match the 
performance of C++ whilst being many times more concise. I think this could 
be a great demo of OCaml!
