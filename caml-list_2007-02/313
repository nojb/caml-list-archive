      2nd Central-European Functional Programming School
                           CEFP 2007
                 Cluj-Napoca, June 23-30, 2007
                http://cs.ubbcluj.ro/cefp2007/


  First Announcement - Call for participation - Call for PhD
                     student presentation


Aims and Scopes:

The Central-European Functional Programming School (CEFP) is an
intensive summer school series in the field of functional
programming. The main goal is to bring together computer
scientists, researchers, graduate and especially PhD students.
The school would like to promote the research and the education
of the functional programming languages, software technologies
and programming methodologies.

The second CEFP school will be organized by the Babe=BA-Bolyai
University (Cluj-Napoca / Kolozsv=E1r  / Klausenburg) between=20
23-30 June, 2007. The previous  school was held in Budapest,
Hungary, July, 2005.

The invited lecturers are prominent researchers in the field,
and they will present state-of-the-art functional programming
techniques. Beside the lectures practical courses will be held.
The school includes a workshop for PhD students to present
their work and get feed-back from the lecturers.

Invited Lecturers:

Rinus Plasmeijer (Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands):=20
iTasks: Defining Interactive Workflows for the Web

Werner Kluge (Christian-Albrechts-Universit=E4t zu Kiel,
Germany): Abstract Lambda Calculus Machines

Marko van Eekelen (Radboud University Nijmegen, The
Netherlands): Proving Properties of Lazy Functional Programs

Tim Sheard (Portland State University, USA): The Omega
Programming Language

Ralf Hinze (Universit=E4t Bonn, Germany): Generics

Three additional short courses will be given:

Zolt=E1n Horv=E1th (E=F6tv=F6s Lor=E1nd University, Budapest, Hungary):
Refactoring Erlang Programs

Zolt=E1n Cs=F6rnyei (E=F6tv=F6s Lor=E1nd University, Budapest, Hungary):
Lambda-Calculus

Horia F. Pop (Babe=BA-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania):=20
A Tutorial on Object Orientedness in Functional Programming

Submissions:

PhD students are invited to submit the abstract of their
presentations to be included in the workshop programme. Each
presentation can be of max. 25 minutes. The full paper version
can be submitted after the summer school. It is under
negotiation to publish the revised lectures and the selected
and reviewed papers in LNCS Volume.

Venue:

Cluj-Napoca / Kolozsv=E1r / Klausenburg, formerly the capital of
Transylvania, is one of the most beautiful medieval cities with
a huge multicultural and historical inheritance. Surrounded by
marvelous hills and mountains, the city provides fascinating
environment for experiencing the unique ambience of a
diversified culture, society and nature.

Registration and costs:

The registration fee (260 Euro) includes the course materials
distributed during the school, the post-school volume, lunches,
the excursion and the summer school banquet. For further
information, accommodation possibilities and registration
please visit the web-page of the event:
http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/cefp2007. The deadline for
registration and submissions is 1 June 2007.
