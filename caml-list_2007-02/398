The widgets supported in camltk/labltk are those of tk8.0.
New widgets were not added to keep compatibility, but since Tcl/Tk
seems to have finally converged on 8.4, this might be a good idea to
add the new widgets now. This is easy to do: mainly editing the
Widgets.src file. But this is time consuming: one has to check by hand
the Tcl/Tk documentation to find all the missing functions and
parameters... So this will probably not be in 3.10.0, but could be
done in a reasonably close future.

Use the one that fits your needs. There are more widgets in gtk2, but
they can be harder to use.
