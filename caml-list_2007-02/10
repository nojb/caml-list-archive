There's a joke around in the formal methods community: ``would you
prefer to get on a plane whose software has been proved correct or
has been tested?''

formally verified the embedded code of an automatic subway line (using
the B method). They explained that, after the verification had been
completed, the unit phase was not suppressed, but greatly reduced.
