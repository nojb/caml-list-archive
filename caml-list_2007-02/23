I couldn't reproduce that on Debian Sarge (Stable is Sarge as of this
date) neither with

 - Objective Caml version 3.08.3 -- as distributed with Sarge.

nor with

 - Objective Caml version 3.09.2 -- as compiled by me from GODI 2
   months ago.

Are you running Testing or something like this? Since I assume that
exceptions are represented just by integer "tags" at the VM level:
Might there be a library mismatch in your case? (This is a question to
the experts here, since my understanding was that that is prevented by
checksums in the interfaces).

Whatever: If your ocaml comes from Debian (and not from GODI or
similar), I suggest you report a bug to the Debian BTS, too. It woul
be terrible, if we had to live with a buggy OCaml for the next 3 years
:-) after the Etch release.
