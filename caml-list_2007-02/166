Yes. that is what I meant.

No, there is not.  I was just (mistakenly) assuming that the "more 
pleasant" syntax for this ``worked''.

Explanation: when I was a language designer, I learned a lot from user 
'mistakes' like this.  Such mistakes told me of the mismatch between 
user expectations and current reality.  So I try to take the time to 
document my own 'mistakes'. 
Philosophy: if I don't take the time to give feedback, why should I 
expect users of my own work to be any different?

PS: there is no real functionality that I am looking for that Turing 
Machines don't provide (or C or Java or ...).  And yet I prefer 
languages like (Meta)OCaml and Haskell.  The "raw functionality" 
argument does not seem to be the optimal way to look at these issues, IMHO.
