Hello,

I'm trying to mix Ocaml and Delphi code in a project for some educational
purpose and I don't really want to have to recode mlvalues in Delphi...
I've tried many ways to do that, I tried to cross-compile them, I tried to
build a Delphi dll and use it from Ocaml but I still have the problem of
type...

My next move is to try to pass through a C program since Delphi and C are
compatible and Ocaml and C too, but I don't know how to deal with the
garbage collector and which compiler I should use...

More details : It must work on Windows and be fast because data exchanged
are heavy matrices.

Thanks.
