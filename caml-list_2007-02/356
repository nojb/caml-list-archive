Updated with a proper datafile.  The program should be
run as:

mrlplot -file datafile

On every system where I've seen it crash, it's
predictably crashed within about a minute of starting,
although it does not seem to be a a fixed interval.

As to the program in general, rotate with the mouse or
with WASDQ and E, use ESC to quit.

Hmm... seems to work either way, I'll use that one
going forward.
