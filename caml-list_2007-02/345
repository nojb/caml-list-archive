The Unix library uses both techniques -- using a single int for file
permissions but a list of flags in various other cases.

Personally, I think that as long as the bitfield fits in 31 bits then
it's better to keep it as a simple int.  Bitfields allow you to do
some things very simply that would be more painful with a list of
constructors.  For example, testing if flags a, b, and c are set can
be done very quickly and easily with a bitfield, but becomes somewhat
laborious and/or slow with lists.  You can easily provide an
additional "list of variants" interface on the ML side if you think
some users would prefer that.
