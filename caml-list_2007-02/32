Thanks - that is actually what I have been working on doing (I was 
trying to get this far so I had something to reply to Olivier's and 
now your suggestion)... ;)

Your package is the "gold standard" for Linux builds of OCaml, AFAICT.

But things are not quite as smooth as they could be - since Zod comes 
with all this Yum[my goodness], I was trying to stick with it... which 
is why I had it go ahead and install the "3.09.3" packages it said it 
had in its repo, along with the offered lablgtk (I removed both of these).

Next I had difficulties with the key file you suggest, when I tried to 
  do an "rpm --install" with the key file... rpm would just appear to 
hang with the key file as an argument after the --install.

So I just said (^*%^^%%^ and did an rpm -iv with your rpm sitting 
around locally, which worked fine.  Of course, Yum now shows it as 
being installed, but is unable to reinstall lablgtk because it says 
that it is unable to satisfy the "3.09.3" requirement.  Sigh.

So much for the brave new world of automated package management.  I 
will just go ahead now and do a source build of lablgtk, which I know 
to be easy (at least on Windows). ;)
