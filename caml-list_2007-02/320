you are not using it NOW, but you might in the future, at which point 
you will all of a sudden have to refactor your code to avoid the 
warning. I would rather see the shadowing warning the moment I add "open 
Foo" for the first time.

you should be able to say something like
shadow Foo.bar with Baz.bar

horrible.

silent shadowing is one of those "low probability -- high consequences" 
situations. the fact that you personally have never had to spend hours 
chasing a stupid bug that should have been uncovered by the compiler 
does not mean that silent shadowing is good practice.

bar.ml defines zot.
foo.ml contains this:
	open Bar
	let zot = 1
compiling foo.ml should warn me that foo shadows Bar.zot.
