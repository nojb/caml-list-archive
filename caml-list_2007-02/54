Whiteboard, mainly.  Sometimes pencil and paper.  If I'm really gung-ho,
I'll use LaTeX (generally ripped from the ocamldoc).

Unlike the imperative object-oriented world, where the relationships
between types are complicated systems with profound (and somewhat
mysterious) consequences, the 'function catalog' approach in OCaml most
libraries undercuts the value of any kind of modelling.

And this is from someone who is a fan of visual models for Java/C# apps.
