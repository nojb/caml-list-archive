It seems that the community where Ensemble originated is now going a
different direction. If you look at Ken Birman's page at
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ken/, it mentions that his group is working
on a fourth generation of middleware platform based on pubsub. From
where I sit, pubsub based approachs seems closer to current industry
practice.
