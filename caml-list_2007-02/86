Hello,

2007/2/7, michel levy <michel.levy@imag.fr>:

After some googling, it seems that this error appears when the linked
library (in your case Tk) is not built as a shared library[1].

Have you compiled Tk yourself? Is there any --shared or the like
option to configure script of Tk?

Another possible cause is that you don't always use GNU ld to build
your software. Check that both OCaml and Tk are configured to use GNU
ld.

I hope that helps,
Good luck,
d.
