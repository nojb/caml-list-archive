		     Preliminary Call for Papers


The 10th Italian Conference on Theoretical Computer Science (ICTCS'07)
will be held in Rome, Italy. Papers presenting original contributions
in any area of theoretical computer science are being sought.

Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:
Algebraic and categorical models;
Algorithmic aspects of networks;
Algorithmic game theory;
Algorithms and data structures;
Computability;
Computational complexity;
Computational biology;
Computational geometry;
Cryptography and security;
Databases, semi-structured data and finite model theory;
Emerging and non-standard models of compoutation;
Experimental analysis of algorithms;
formal languages and automata theory;
Internet algorithmics;
Logics, formal methods and model checking;
Models of concurrent, distributed and mobile systems;
Models of reactive, hybrid and stochastic systems;
Parallel, distributed and external memory computing;
Principles of programming languages;
Program analysis and transformation;
Quantum computing;
Specification, refinement and verification
Type systems and theory, typed calculi.

Submissions: Authors should submit an extended abstract
electronically, following the guidelines available on the ICTCS Web
Page. The extended abstract should start with a title page consisting
of the title of the paper; each author's name, affiliation, and email
address; and a brief summary of the results to be presented. This
should then be followed by a technical exposition of the main ideas
and techniques used to achieve the results, including motivation and a
clear comparison with related work. The full extended abstract should
not exceed 12 single-spaced pages. If more details are needed to
substantiate the main claims of the paper, the submission may include
a clearly marked appendix that will be read at the discretion of the
program committee. Submissions deviating significantly from these
guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  The
proceedings of the conference will be published by World Scientific,
and will be available for distribution at the conference.
