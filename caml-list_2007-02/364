In my experience, compiling and executing on the same machine is far more 
robust (>99%) than moving between machines (~90%). Also, we're not just 
talking about OpenGL versions (which change regularly) but also GLU, 
glut/freeglut, (potentially) SDL, the linker and compiler as well as platform 
issues (e.g. 32-bit chroots).

Problems often boil down to glut vs freeglut so I'd start there. I'm not sure 
what the solution is though. We really need just one decent glut-like 
library, complete bindings to it from OpenGL and safe high-level bindings. 
I'm a little disheartened that nobody replied to my post about GLCaml.

Anyway, I'm writing the equivalent for F# right now... :-)
