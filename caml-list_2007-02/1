As Markus says, it does implement the POSIX API for regular expression 
matching and extraction of sub-patterns... but note that that just 
[here] controls the "level" of the interface: there is a regcomp 
function for compiling the patterns and a regexec call for matching a 
compiled pattern against a specific string.

The full "language" of PCRE for matching and pattern specification is 
accepted.  Further, LablPCRE adds an even lighter-weight regmatch 
function when all that is desired is a boolean answer on a match, as 
well as a set of substring extraction and [error] status info accessor 
functions.

LablPCRE makes an effort to be a good GC-citizen by not holding 
references to anything it doesn't need to. :)

Finally, LablPCRE supports PCRE 7.0 (or any of the releases back to 6.1).
