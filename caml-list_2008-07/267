You can compile with the -unsafe flag. If you're using arrays a lot,
it can easily speed your program by 50%. If your program is array
based, the speedup can be even more important.

Don't assume it could magically make your program behave in a weird
way. When you're trying to access an element which is outside the
bounds of the array, ocaml rises an exception. With the -unsafe flag,
no exception will be risen and you will have no chance to catch it.
Consequently if you're out of bounds, your programm will die. That's
why it is called "unsafe". If you're sure you won't be out of bounds
(or are not trying to catch any exception), you can safely use
-unsafe.

If you don't want to affect globally your program, you can also use
Array.unsafe_get or Arra.unsafe_set. I don't know the full list
though.
