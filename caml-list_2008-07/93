OK, I agree, but parallel programming is not really new.
It's just new on or small PCs we ahve at home
It's used since 20 years on high-performance/high-end computers.

I'm not sure there were functional programming models
used, I rather doubt this, but I'm not very familiar with that area.
If there already would be some kind of know-how in parallel functional
programming, this might be adapted to the PCs.

Can you name it? I mean... the room for improvement.
