Subject: Heaps size problems with "caml_alloc_small" in foreign function interfaces
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.924)

Hi,

I'm having a problem where sometimes a call to "caml_alloc_small" from  
C results in a segmentation fault. If I increase the size of the stack  
using OCAMLRUNPARAM=s=1000k then I don't get the crash anymore. It  
seems strange that I have to increase the size of the heap manually  
like this. Is this because I'm calling this function from C?

If I want to increase the size of the heap in C how do I do this?  
Could I write a "safe" caml_alloc_small which first checks to see if  
there is enough memory and then increases the heap size if not?

Sean
