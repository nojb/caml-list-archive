Yes.

Is that for 32-bit Linux?

32-bit Windows XP has a 2Gb default process memory limit:

  http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx

32-bit Windows Server can be increased to 3Gb.

However, any serious power users will already be on 64-bit where these limits 
have been relegated to quaint stories your grandpa will tell you.
