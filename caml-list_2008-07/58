Camlp3l is a set of libraries and helper tools which are written in
OCaml.  It is not tied to a particular OCaml release.

JoCaml provides a separate compiler and runtime.  It is, at least to
some extent, tied to a specific OCaml release to help ensure binary
compatibility with libraries compiled by the matching official OCaml
compiler.

Both Camlp3l and JoCaml have facilities for distributed computing, and
both seem to be maintained currently.  I don't know how Camlp3l,
JoCaml and MPI for OCaml compare in performance scaling.  They each
certainly have an interesting approach though.
