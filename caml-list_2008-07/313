Hi list,

I am pleased to announce the availability of Micmatch for the new Camlp4.
The new package is called "Mikmatch", with a K. "Micmatch" with a C refers 
to the original implementation which now uses Camlp5.

     http://martin.jambon.free.fr/micmatch.html

or  GODI if you want to jump directly to the installation.


Micmatch is a Camlp4 syntax extension that allows to use regexps in 
match-with constructs. Compilation of the underlying PCRE or Str regexp is 
done transparently, just once. The syntax of the regexps is reminiscent of 
ocamllex. For those who are not familiar with ocamllex, this syntax is 
very OCaml-friendly and in particular avoids backslash headaches.


This is a double announcement:

micmatch-1.0.0 (stable except for possibly some packaging issues):
   Legacy implementation, slightly modified to work with
   Camlp5 (thanks to John Gregorski for the patch).

mikmatch-1.0.0 (beta quality):
   Partial reimplementation that supports Camlp4 3.10 aka the
   "new Camlp4". Currently there is no toplevel support.
   For details on the changes, see
   http://martin.jambon.free.fr/mikmatch-changes.txt


Have fun, program safely, and please report problems to

   micmatch@googlegroups.com
   (archive at http://groups.google.com/group/micmatch )


Thanks to the OCamlForge team for providing free and worry-free hosting.


Martin
