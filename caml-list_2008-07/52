Agreed.

I think Haskell's STM is way overhyped and while it may be a good
solution for small numbers of cores (ie < 8) I am not convinced
it will scale to thousands of cores.

The haskell community also seems to be working towards some other
solutions:

   http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell

but I don't know enough about these.

The life signs on this one are rather weak from what I have
seen.

Seriously? Being shackled to the .Net platform makes that one
a bit of a non-starter for me.

This doesn't help because there is still a global lock around
the garbage collector. However, I believe that a concurrent
GC is being worked on as part of Jane ST Capital's Ocaml 
Summer of Code.

Not exactly OpenMP, but see
