You miss the point that most Unix programmers already know emacs or vi
intimately.  I use emacs constantly -- even for writing this very
email, and I have been using emacs for nearly 20 years.  No
"mastering" is needed.

I've used IDEs a bit, but never particularly saw the point.  They seem
to just obscure the workings of the build process, and break the
editor, for no tangible gain.  Emacs can already print the type of an
expression when you hover over it, and can autocomplete symbols.  I've
to find an IDE that can edit email.

There are many problems with the Unix build process -- eg. the horrors
of autoconf/automake/libtool, and possibly better integration with
packaging.  Lack of an all-in-one graphical tool is not exactly high
on anyone's list.

Rich.
