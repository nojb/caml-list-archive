For example, if you have a non-profit research project,
you can use the BOINC infrastructure, which provides
about 580000 PCs to help you :)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Open_Infrastructure_for_Network_Computing

There is no Shared-Mem as we know it from our local PCs, there
is distributed calculation around the whole planet.

Threads will not help there ;-)
