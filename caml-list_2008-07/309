Agreed. That is precisely why I think it is a bad idea to build upon Eclipse.

However that is not an inherent property of an IDE. Surely one written in 
OCaml as I described could be extremely fast?

The Scala plugin for Eclipse is also almost unusable. AFAIK, Haskell has 
uniformly poor support in this respect as well. F# is the best of the 
functional languages but still leaves a lot to be desired, IMHO.

Have you used the F# mode in Visual Studio?

Actually, many OCaml programmers gave the F# team positive feedback over their 
Visual Studio mode precisely because it makes experienced users so much more 
productive.
