        Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop (CUFP) 2008

                 Functional Programming As a Means, Not an End

                            Call for Participation

                             Sponsored by SIGPLAN
                           Co-located with ICFP 2008
      __________________________________________________________________

                               26 September 2008
                               Victoria, Canada

                    Registration opens in late July through
                    http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/
      __________________________________________________________________

    Functional languages have been under academic development for over 25
    years, and remain fertile ground for programming language research.
    Recently, however, developers in industrial, governmental, and open
    source projects have begun to use functional programming successfully
    in practical applications. In these settings, functional programming
    has often provided dramatic leverage, including whole new ways of
    thinking about the original problem.

    The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these users of
    functional programming. The workshop supports the increasing
    viability of functional programming in the commercial, governmental,
    and open-source space by providing a forum for professionals to share
    their experiences and ideas, whether those ideas are related to
    business, management, or engineering. The workshop is also designed
    to enable the formation and reinforcement of relationships that
    further the commercial use of functional programming. Providing user
    feedback to language designers and implementors is not a primary goal
    of the workshop, though it will be welcome if it occurs.

    There will be no published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to
    be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange.

    presentation abstracts and the most recent schedule information.
