Xavier Leroy's lesson on monads [1] will certainly be too abstract for
you, but the accompanying Caml code [2] might help you to grasp the
concept. You will find there a lot of example of useful monads. You should
have read some tutorial before, though, not to get lost.

Another very concrete example is Lwt [3], a cooperative thread library
written in monadic style. Don't hesitate to follow the link, it's a
documentation targeted at programmers, without categorical issues and so
on. You will need to read a more general tutorial on monads then, to get
the general idea, but it could be a good starting point to "bind" and
"return" operators.
