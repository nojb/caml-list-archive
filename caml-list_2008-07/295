I'm sure you know why, but because (a) it's a huge amount of work and
(b) the sort of people who can do the work already use emacs so they
don't need it.

It'd be better to concentrate on OCaml for Eclipse (& other IDEs).
OCaml has the parts already to make an excellent Eclipse plugin -- eg.
camlp4, ocamldoc, cmigrep and '-dtypes/.annot'.  If Eclipse itself has
specific problems, then fix those.

Red Hat have done a bit of work packaging and fixing the OCaml Eclipse
plugin and we'll have something to release soon(~ish).
