Yes. So it would be a good idea to make the IDE as uninvasive as possible. 
Presumably it could even interact with findlib in order to let you choose 
library dependencies graphically.

Sure. So you continue to do all of those things conventionally. If you really 
wanted you could augment an IDE with functionality to upload to your website 
etc. but I'm not sure that would be particularly beneficial. My main interest
