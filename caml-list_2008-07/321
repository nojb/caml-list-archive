Actually, as a regular Emacs hacker myself, I checked out .NET's F# 
environment and I must confess that I was quite impressed. It is 
actually really neat. Instead of the usual edit, M-x compile, M-x 
next-error cycle, the code is compiled in the background creating 
"squigglies" under code that has errors. Using this and the 
Intelli-sense completion features is very nice and I wish we could have 
the equivalent under Emacs. (Of course, though those features still 
won't detract me from my everyday daily use of Emacs.) Perhaps some 
OCaml/Emacs hackers could work together on a system where emacs and the 
ocaml communicates better?

Thanks,

PKE.
