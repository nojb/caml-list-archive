                 CC 2009 
  International Conference on Compiler Construction
       March 22-29, York, United Kingdom 
 Invited Speaker: Vivek Sarkar (Rice University, US)
             Part of ETAPS 2009

http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/etaps09/Conf/conf.html#cc

CC is a premier forum for presenting research on compilers
in the broadest possible sense, including run-time techniques,
programming tools, domain-specific languages, novel language
constructs and so on. In recent years CC has seen a healthy
increase in the number of submissions, in line with its broad
outlook; its typical acceptance rate is 20-25%. CC is part of 
ETAPS, and this year it is held in York (UK), March 22-29 2009.

The program committee would particularly welcome
submissions from

researchers in functional programming  

on any topic relating to

compilation and analysis of caml, or via caml

Abstracts are due on October 2, and the deadline for
full paper submission is October 9.

Prospective authors are welcome to contact the program
chairs, Michael Schwartzbach (mis@brics.dk) and Oege de Moor 
(oege@comlab.ox.ac.uk) with any queries they might have.
