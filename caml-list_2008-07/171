It may not run on XP Home contrary to what I stated. Debian-interix
says the following in its INSTALL file :
  * On Windows XP make sure, you
     DON'T "Use simple file sharing"
XP Home can only "use simple file sharing" so sfu may not work on XP
Home (though you can get the required functionnality).
