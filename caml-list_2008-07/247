Hi Adonis28850,

I don't know if you are aware of this but IDE support for Ocaml already
exists and is quite mature. Support is in the form of an Eclipse IDE
plug-in. I don't know what your objectives are, but this may be what
you're looking for. Note that I use both Netbeans and Eclipse so an
Ocaml plug-in for Netbeans would also be welcome.

For everyone else: use, test and contribute to these efforts if you
can. A lot of effort has been put into them. Some previous attempts
have "died" due to lack of support.

Please note that I am a simple user and not in any other way associated
to OcaIDE, however please take a look at:

http://ocaml.eclipse.ortsa.com:8480/ocaide/

It includes among other things:
     * Source editor for ml, mli, mly mll files
     * Syntax coloring
     * Automatic indentation
     * An integrated code formatter, and an interface to the camlp4
formatter (through an AST printer)
     * Code Completion
     * Standard library browser
     * Integrated debugger
     * Highlighting of matching delimiters
     * Integrated toplevel
     * Building of O'Caml projects
     * Importation and exportation of O'Caml projects
     * Launching of O'Caml executables
     * A code outline
     * Displaying the inferred type of elements in the editor and outline
     * Descriptive popups on O'Caml definitions
     * Help on expected parameters for functions, exceptions and
constructors
     * Hyperlinks for jumping to the definition of an element (variable,
type constructor...)
     * Error markers in the editor, editor's margin, Navigator view and
Problems view

Regards,
Hugo F.
