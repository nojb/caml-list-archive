I did this a few monthes ago, I followed the NetBSD way, since SFU is 
supported by NetBSD's `pkgsrc'. This was really *easy*, thanks to the 
efforts of the `pkgsrc' maintainers. However, I did not play that much 
with the system, my point was to test SFU by running very Unix-oriented 
and complex proecdures in it.

See http://www.netbsd.org/docs/software/packages.html
for general information about NetBSD's pkgsrc; Microsoft SFU is refered 
to as Interix here, e.g. in the ``Supported Platforms'' section.

The `pkgsrc' software is a port infrastructure similar to what is found 
on *BSD and MacPorts, if you have used one of them, you certainly will 
feel comfortable with `pkgsrc'. Documentation for `pkgsrc' is available 
at http://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/, besides the introduction, see 
especially sections 3.2 (Bootstrapping) and 4.2 (Installing ports), it 
shall be enough to get started!
