Completions annoyed me immensely in visual studio and the Adobe's
products.

I find Make expressive enough. I don't use these others.

There are ways of getting this to work with nedit but I never
bothered because I don't like it.

If I need documentation I read the mli files. With bash command
line completion in an xterm I can find the one I want in a second
and I keep it open in a nedit window and then alt-tab between the
window I'm editing and the mli file I'm reading. Sometimes I stick
the two side by side.

You sound like someone who never mastered Unix, someone who never
realised that each user needs to mould Unix to their needs rather
than accepting what Unix provides as a default.
