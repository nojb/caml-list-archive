This is incorrect. You are describing some sort of a mutant between a
monad and an algebra for a functor T.

A monad T has a different \mu, namely a family of maps (one for each set X)

 \mu_X : T (T X) -> T X

One such \mu takes a "simple term of simple terms over X" and flattens
it to a "simple term over X".
