Yes, thats the way it would be done in VS. The way I work its
all in what I would consider a single project.

I find this last part quite common for things like ocamllex/
ocamlyacc and Flex/Bison for C or C++.

Personally I find Eclipse appalling. It takes forever to start
up and runs slow as a dog. It might support Java reasonably well
but I find its support for C rather poor. I haven't tried it
with other laguages.

I didn't mention having tried Eclipse before because I really
only used it for a couple of hours.

I spent 35+ hours/week for 6 months on VS2005. Is that not enough
time to learn it?

But the Adobe IDE was definitely different to the VS2005 one I 
was using a couple of months earlier. What I really wanted was
to be using my editor, with my personalised syntax highlighting
pattern and my macros.

> Granted. But I am defending lowering the barrier for Ocaml use.

If you are advocating IDE use for the purposes of making Ocaml
easier for newcomers then you are in a bit of a bind. The 
people who need the IDE are the newcomers who are not capable
of writing one and the ones with sufficient experience to write
an Ocaml IDE are happy with what they have and are therefore 
not interested in writing one (with the possible exception of
Jon Harrop).
