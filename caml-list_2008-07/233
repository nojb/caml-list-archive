* About DistriNet

The "Distributed systems and computer Networksâ" (DistriNet) research 
group was founded in 1984 as part of the Department of Computer Science 
at the K.U.Leuven. DistriNet's research focus and scope is twofold: 
distributed softwareâ and secure software. 
The group works on a wide range of topics including computer networks, 
middleware, internet architectures, network and software security, 
embedded systems and multi-agent systems. DistriNet's research is generally

partners.

Currently DistriNet counts 60 members (8 professors, 12 post-docs and 
45 junior researchers) and participates in about 30 national and 
international research projects. The annual budget amounts to approximately
5MEuro. More information on projects and publications can be found on the 
DistriNet web pages:
