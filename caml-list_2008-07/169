Hello Jean,

There is no 64-bit native OCaml compiler for Mac OS X intel.  I have a  
patch that works in Leopard, but did not compile opt.opt in Tiger,  
meaning that something is not OK,  so I did not offer it to the  
community. The bootstrap went fine, findlib and godi compiled OK too.  
I can post the patches somewhere if you want to give it a shot.

My memory intensive application runs fine in Leopard with this  
compiler. But the binaries do not execute in Tiger (I found that other  
people had the same trouble copying a 64 bit apps from Leopard to  
Tiger and the other way around, but didn't look into it).

If you want it ... I can post it, maybe someone can cleanup my job?  
All that would be needed after patching is:

./configure -host x86_64-apple-darwin -prefix /opt/ocaml/experimental

(The prefix I always add for my ocaml-modified comilers).

best,

Andres
