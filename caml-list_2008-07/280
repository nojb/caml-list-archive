                       Call For Participation
      Workshop on Approximate Behavioural Equivalences (ABE 08)
                  Toronto, Canada, August 18, 2008
                   http://www.cse.yorku.ca/abe08/

ABE 08, the Workshop on Approximate Behavioural Equivalences, will take 
place at the University of Toronto on Monday August 18, 2008.  The 
workshop is affiliated with the 19th International Conference on Concurrency 
Theory (CONCUR 08).

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and students 
interested in approximate behavioural equivalences.  The program of the 
workshop consist of talks by
  Salem Derisavi, IBM
  Shiva Nejati, University of Toronto
  Prakash Panangaden, McGill University
  Vishwanath Raman, University of California, Santa Clara
  Scott Smolka, State University of New York, Stony Brook
  David Thorsley, University of Washington
  Herbert Wiklicky, Imperial College
  Mingsheng Ying, Tsinghua University

In the last few years, quantitative generalizations of equivalence relations
have been developed for a variety of systems with quantitative features.
Furthermore, several algorithms have been developed and implemented to
approximate these quantitative notions.  These notions and their approximation
algorithms have been exploited in several areas, ranging from system biology
to model fusion.  The speakers will provide an overview of their work in the 
area and will provide their view on the future of this area.
