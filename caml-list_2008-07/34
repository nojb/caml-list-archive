Not precisely sure what you mean by 'committed', but the answer is no.
OCaml has no binary compatibility at all between compiler releases,
not even between point releases.  Lablgtk2 is even worse - there is no
_source_ compatibility either, and in practice it often breaks
requiring bothersome conditional compilation if you want your code to
compile with multiple versions of lablgtk2.

For this reason, Fedora freezes OCaml & lablgtk versions every six
months and avoids upgrading them in old releases.  We wouldn't upgrade
them unless there was some absolutely unavoidable security problem or
similar emergency.
