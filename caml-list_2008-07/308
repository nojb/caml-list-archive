The others are particularly useful when you have multiple stages of 
compilation that introduce new dependencies at compile time.

I find type throwback in Emacs invaluable and I miss documentation throwback 
enormously.

That is exactly what I do when writing OCaml at the moment and I find that it 
leaves a lot to be desired.

For example, I cannot even jump to the definition of an identifier reliably. I 
can look at the identifier and guess where it came from, potentially having 
to manually trawl through directories of source files exactly as you 
describe, hoping to find the correct location from many identifiers with the 
same name. But it would be much easier if I could simply jump directly to the 
location of the definition and then jump back. That could be done from plain 
text editors.
