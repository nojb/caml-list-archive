Graphical throwback of documentation is invaluable for interactive API 
exploration, particularly in the context of GUI programming (I currently 
trawl through ocamlbrowser's useful but very basic interface). A GUI to 
browse and visualize performance profiles is useful (I currently browse 
gprof's output as plain text files using KWrite). A GUI to visualize 
dependencies is useful (I currently lookup the use of "dot" every time I need 
it and the PostScript output is typically mangled by GhostScript).

I shall see if it is feasible to develop such an application within an OCaml 
Journal article or two. I think it would be both very useful and a very 
instructive educational exercise combining several of OCaml's strengths.

However, the resulting program would most likely be difficult to distribute 
due to licensing issues (e.g. if you want to reuse OCaml's typechecker or 
top-level) and could not be a viable commercial product due to the 
limitations of OCaml itself.
