Call for participation: Towards Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2008)
July 27th, 2008, Birmingham, UK c/o MKM 2008

Workshop webpage: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2008.xhtml
Registration: http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/registration.php
Travel: http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/travel.php
Accomodation: http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/accommodation.php

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects, 
asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM model])?

Proceedings:
(200+ pages) was published by Masaryk University and will be available on site.
