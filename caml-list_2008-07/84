Well, it is an open question whether this alternative holds. I mean
there is a market, and if the market says, "no we don't need that
multicore monsters", the chip companies cannot simply ignore it. Of
course, there are applications that would extremely benefit from them,
but it is the question whether this is only a niche, or something you
can make enough revenues to pay the development of such large
multicores.

In the past, it was very important for hardware vendors that existing
software runs quicker on new CPU generations. This is no longer true for
multicore. So unless there is a software revolution that makes it simple
to exploit multicore, we won't see 1024-cores for the masses.

Well, there is a another option for the chip industry. Instead of
keeping the die at some size and packing more and more cores on it, they
can also sell smaller chips for less. Basically, this alternate path
already exists (e.g. Intel's Atom). Of course, this makes this industry
more boring, and they would turn into more normal industrial component
suppliers.

At some point this will be unavoidable. The question is whether this
happens in the next years.
