hey! this thread its animated!!! i think its possitive to think about
develop an exclusive Ocaml IDE, why??:

- novice people on ocaml will found all easier.  ->  so more novice people
will be interested in ocamle  -> so more ocaml developers become active ->
ocaml community will grow up!

The intention of developing a NeTBeans plug-in is provide pupils of my
univesity a friendlier interface, 2 years ago myself cursed the subject
where ocaml was used, and i found difficult learn a new paradigm, 	
and if we add to this that in labs teacher say , "ei! you have Caml
installed, start programming!"...

I think this plug-in could be a starting point for future more friendly
interfaces for developing, so why not??
of course at this point, the plug-in its very simple, syntax highlighting,
auto completion of code, and link with external compiler,but...this is  only
the beginning....
