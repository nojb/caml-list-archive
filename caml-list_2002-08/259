I liked the "ocaml forever" bit :-).

My personal experience has been that all the <reasonable> modifications
I've requested from the Caml folk were carried out. On the other hand, I
can
easily think of some <non-reasonable> language modifications. As long
as the core developers are willing to listen to the community, I don't
think
there is a big problem.

By the way, I do think we need some kind of package/namespace approach.
My personal contribution was the "emrg" mini-tool, adapted from the
Ensemble
distribution. Also, the Caml team was convinced enough that namespaces were
an issue to add the "-pack" option to v3.05.

Just my two cents,
      Ohad.

The namespace proposal brings up a related issue.  Is there any interest in
having a more formal process for making requests for enhancements to the
ocaml language analogous to (e.g.) the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)
for python (http://www.python.org/peps) or similar processes for perl,
ruby, and java?  I can see advantages and disadvantages to this approach.
The advantage is that there is an organized record of proposals, commentary
on proposals, etc.  The disadvantage is that I suspect that a lot of
feature requests might be unimplementable or require a huge amount of
research to see if they're implementable (e.g. generically overloaded
operators), as opposed to PEPs, which are generally fairly trivial.  What
do people think?

Ocaml forever,

Mike
