Hi,

I would post this to the caml-beginners mailing list but I can't find it
:-(

I'm just getting started with ocaml modules and I've run into a
ridiculously trivial problem that I can't solve.  Consider this file:

(* test.ml *)
module Foo =
  struct
    type foo = int array array
    let make_foo () = Array.make_matrix 8 8 0
  end
(* end of test.ml *)

I compile this with "ocamlc -c test.ml".  No problems so far.  Then I open
an interactive toplevel:

# open Test;;
# Foo.make_foo ();;
Reference to undefined global `Test'
# 

What's going on?  What am I not doing that I should be doing?

Thanks in advance,

Mike
