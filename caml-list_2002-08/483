Patricia Trees are tries in dimension 2.

In fact, one could try tries in dimension 30 with the leafs being
integers (a kind of mix between bitvectors and tries).

I have been doing a few test, a very simple implementation should be
avaible in the pre-release of the data structure library. But I don't
know yet if it is faster than Patricia trees or not. At least it
should save some space
