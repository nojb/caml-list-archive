Well, you build with :

./configure -prefix /usr/local/ocaml/3.05 ...

and everything will go into the right place.

Then you can build with :

./configure -prefix /usr/local/ocaml/3.06 ...

for the next version, and :

ocamlc -where 

will show the right place, which most packages use to know where to
install stuff.

Then you only need to have s symlink like :

ln -s /usr/local/ocaml/3.05 /usr/local/ocaml/current

or something, and have /usr/local/ocaml/current/bin in your PATH, and
all will work as you want (unless i badly misunderstood you).

This has worked since the early times of caml-light (well no the prefix
option, but you could hand specify the libdir, bindir, etc ...).
