Cool!  I've been messing with Eric Raymond's "bogofilter", the first
"Bayesian spam filter" (meme of the week, it seems) implementation
that I could find, but I'm looking forward to studying your
implementation as an example of a practical OCaml application.

Raymond is providing patches to mutt that make it easy (supposedly) to
add messages to the database of good/bad messages in the course of
normal mail reading activity.  The same hooks might be useful for
adding to an OCaml database instead.
