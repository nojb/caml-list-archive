Are you sure that this option is passed? This option would actually
not make much sense so I'd be grateful if you could tell me the exact
command line.

When PCRE is statically linked, then it probably does not really matter,
you should only make sure that the path is mentioned in LIBDIRS before
compilation of PCRE-OCaml: then the compiler should automatically link
in the required functions statically.

In case you manage to build a dynamic version of PCRE, then you'll
probably have to put the library in some place where the system can
find it.

Sorry, I don't have the slightest idea, but suppose that it is
conceptually similar to other systems.
