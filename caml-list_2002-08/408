What you're after is traditionally called "instruction selection".
A Google search on "SIMD instruction selection" gives some relevant
papers.  (Follow the PDF links only :-)

Other sources of potential information:
- Recent proceedings for the conferences PLDI (Prog. Lang. Design
  and Implementation) and CC (Compiler Construction).
- The comp.compilers newsgroup.

Have fun,
