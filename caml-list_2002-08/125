I wonder if this is related to the difference between
lazy and strict evaluation.  It seems that pull code
falls naturally out of a lazy model, and push out of a
strict model.  Given no side effects that
transformation between the two is trivial.  Things get
funky if you allow side effects.  Maybe monads help
here?
