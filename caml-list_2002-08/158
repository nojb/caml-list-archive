This is mostly a question of taste: I view most of the let's as
assignment, so I prefer not to indent them, since they do no more than
changing a binding.  But lots of people would disagree.

By the way, you can customize this in ocaml-mode too:
  (setq caml-let-in-indent 2)
The default is 0, meaning no indent.

On the other hand, not everything is customizable, and even when
customizable it may be a pain. For instance, I never came around to
allow a global change in the size of indentation: this is 2, or you
have to change it individually for every construct...

Let's stop such blaring disinformation:
running the ocaml toplevel under emacs was the original goal of the caml
mode, and this already worked more than 10 years ago.
Thanks to Didier it is now pretty clever about errors, but then Tuareg
might be just as clever.
