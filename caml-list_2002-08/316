g++-3.2 removes abstraction penalty related to iterators, etc.

On my machine/OS (Linux 2.4), user and real time are usually the same for 
ocaml, but can differ somewhat for C++ (probably because malloc/free is done 
by the kernel or something, I wouldn't know). Had I used user time, it would 
have steered the results in favor of C++ a little more in some cases.

I'm not! Both tree_mutable_ml.ml and tree_cpp.cpp contain mutable binary 
trees. I think your C++ tree is slower than mine because of the old compiler
(Or maybe it's the OS: tree allocates a lot of small objects).

IANAAP (I am not an assembly programmer :)

P.S. It looks like List and Array iteration is somehow much faster on Athlon 
than P3 Xeon.
