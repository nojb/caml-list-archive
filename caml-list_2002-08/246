List,
   I have just spent several hours trying to convince ocamlc (and ocamlopt)
to
link together several cmo files and C libraries and objects. It turned out
that
I could only link them together if all the C files were compiled into
objects, and not
linked together into intermediate libraries.

For example, I could not do :
    ocamlc -custom -o test_prog   libX.a libY.a intf.o X.cmo Y.cmo

But if I opened libX.a and libY.a into their component object files, things
worked
great.

Has anybody had the same problems, or am I overlooking the obvious?

      Ohad.
