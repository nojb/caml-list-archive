:)))

That said, maybe strip has a list of things not to strip or something
such ?

Ok, you know a lot more than me about this, but couldn't it not be
possible to implement this only on ELF systems ?
Anyway, the resulting code is arch/system dependant, since you embed
it with ocamlrun anyway, is it not ?

Sure, a good reason for it i guess, but the result is that strip breaks
ocaml bytecode executables.
