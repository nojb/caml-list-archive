None of these are things the dev team needs to be working on...not that 
they're not important, but the community, if it got its act together, could 
solve all of these problems, or rather they could make as much headway on 
them as the dev team.  By contrast, the community cannot add massively 
subtle and complicated features to the compiler; only the dev team can do that.
