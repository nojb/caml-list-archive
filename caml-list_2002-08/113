Actually... not true.  You get the ability to override the methods by 
inheritance.  In exchange for this feature, you pay a not insignificant 
cost in initialization time and program codespace.  Whether this trade 
is a good one is open to interpretation.

It felt strange to me at first too.  The feeling eventually passed when 
I fully understood what is really easier to do with classes and class 
types than with modules, signatures and functors.

My advice: Use the most basic syntax the language provides to do the 
basics.  Use objects and methods only when functions (including 
higher-order functions) are insufficient.
