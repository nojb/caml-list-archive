What he means by backreference is a way to refer to a submatch.  For
instance, with the regular expression "^([^ ]*) *([^ ]*)", the
backreference "$1" will refer to the substring matched by the first
parenthesed subexpression "([^ ]*)".  As long as the references do not
occur in the regular expression itself, they can be handled perfectly
well with a DFA engine.  So, the numbers above do not prove anything.

I believe all these features but backreferences within a pattern can
be provided by a DFA engine (though my RE library only support one of
these features, non-greedy quantification, at the moment).

So, the real questions are:
- how often are backreferences used within a pattern?
- when they are used, is it just for convenience, or would it be hard
  to rewrite the pattern without using backreferences?
