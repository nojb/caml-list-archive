Hi

There is a concept of 'soft realtime', where one can't ignore the
concept of 'deadlines', but the latter may not be that crucial. For
example, if a database transaction is not completed before such a
deadline, it's just rolled back and a failure is reported. This
failure may not be as disastrous as in the case of a spacecraft, but
you have to face it and process properly at a higher level. This is
very different to an 'ordinary' situation where you don't care at all
how much time it takes to complete the transaction.

If there was a version of OCaml (or a runtime switch) to impose such a
'transaction deadline' on the workings of GC, OCaml would be quite
acceptable for soft realtime.
