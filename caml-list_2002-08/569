Tag URI may be a good choice.

http://www.taguri.org/

    The tag algorithm lets people create character strings which no
    one else using the same algorithm could ever create. It is simple
    enough to do in your head, and the resulting strings can be easy
    to read, write, and remember. You can use the strings wherever
    you need a unique identifier conforming to the URI (URL) Syntax 

They look like this:

    tag:sandro@world.std.org,2001-06-05:Taiko

Best,
Blair
