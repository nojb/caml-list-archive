True. For instance, I'd rather an indentation for every consecutive 
"let...", as in the Lisp style (I learned Scheme and Common Lisp before 
Ocaml). That is, I prefer indentation to graphically show the structure 
of the code, even at the risk of being stretched too much to the right. 
With higher resolution of graphic displays and more careful organization 
of the code, I guess the problem may be less imposing.

I'm using tuareg for it allows me to run ocaml toplevel in emacs. I'm 
not sure the ocaml-mode has such functionality.
