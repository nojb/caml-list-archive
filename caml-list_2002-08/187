Thanks. In tuareg there is an option "Force indentation after 'let'", 
but it seems not working as I expect it. Or I miss something here.

Sorry, I just didn't know how to do that with ocaml-mode when I last 
tried, but I see now. IIRC, I didn't find it out the first time because 
I used "apropos ocaml" instead of "apropos caml" and I didn't search the 
caml menu. On the other hand, "apropos tuareg" gave me what I was 
looking for.
