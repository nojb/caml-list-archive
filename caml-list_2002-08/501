Automatic split bars are not yet implemented.
They're on my todo-list

yes
try to work with the "#align" calls in order to align compents
 left/top/right/bottom/client & center are allowed ).
you can also use #span & #space on the containers ( windows, panels ).
This let Osiris handle all the resize / positionning of the components,
especially when resizing the window or adding new elements.

Labeled border are also not part of the API.
when you wanna have several " label : <edit> " lines you can simply create a
panel for each line ( setting #border to BdNone to hide the layout ) and
adding both the label & the edit with #align AlLeft.
