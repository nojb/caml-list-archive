Michael,

Generally I'd like to have organized proposal system for OCaml (I was Python 
fan and l remember advantages of the proposal system :-)

I think that if the proposal system will have argued voting system (so any 
OCaml users could submit their  *argued* votes for or against proposal) it 
will add serious advantage to OCaml. Most of work on judging on proposals 
will be done by volunteers and OCaml maintainers will have enough argues to 
decide whether to accept proposal or not. I think that this will help OCaml 
in spreading it among developers. More, theoretically, volunteers that are 
familiar with OCaml source code could propose ways to implement particular 
feature in order to help OCaml team.

And,  of course, it will be very interesting to hear OCaml maintainers' 
opinion.

Yurii
