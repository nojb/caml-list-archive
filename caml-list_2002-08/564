Uhm ... reporting the error message can help here, but anyway ...

The problem is that probably you installed pcre and thus the META file
that ocamlfind is looking for in a directory unknown to ocamlfind.
You can fix the problem changing the "path" setting in
/etc/ocamlfind.conf, just add to hit the directory _above_ the directory
where you installed pcre. (e.g. you have installed pcre in
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/pcre, then add /usr/local/lib/ocaml to the path
value in ocamlfind.conf; this value is a ":" separated list of dirs).

Usually is better to install them in a subdir of the ocaml library
directory (which you can get typing "ocamlc -where"). Don't know which
is your setup but on debian this directory is /usr/lib/ocaml and by
default from the ocaml sources I guess it can be /usr/local/lib/ocaml,
but I'm not sure.

Cheers.
