It is related to implicit data-flow synchronisation via futures (of
which lazy futures are one instance). See:

@article{Halstead:Multilisp,
  author = "Robert Halstead",
  title = "Multilisp: A Language For Concurrent Symbolic Computation",
  journal = "{ACM} Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems",
  volume = 7,
  number = 4,
  pages = "501--538",

  month = oct,
}

@inproceedings{Flanagan+Felleisen:SemanticsOfFuture,
    author = "Cormac Flanagan and Matthias Felleisen",
    title = "The Semantics of Future and Its Use in Program
Optimizations",

[I believe there is also a more recent journal version of this paper.]
