I'd say no part of a real-time interactive game is real-time.  To me,
real-time means something like the Ariane 5 rocket, where you have a
deadline every 36ms for the 12 hours of the mission.  And if you miss
even one deadline your 100M$ rocket will crash.

On the other hand, in something like Unreal Tournament, a half-second
freeze every 10 minutes is no big deal, and the users will not even
complain about it.

With Objective Caml on a fast machine, if you're not doing heap
compaction, GC pauses should be somewhere between 1 and 10
milliseconds.  Quite workable for an interactive game, I'd say, but
then again it's not the future of my company that is at stake.
