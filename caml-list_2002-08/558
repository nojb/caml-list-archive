There is a simple ftp client library in cdk, that I'm thinking of
pulling out and make independent (I wrote this library initially for
camlgrenouille, then integrated it with the cdk ... as camlgrenouille
might have a new release soon, and the cdk does not seem to be going
anywhere, that's why I'll des-integrate it ;-)

So I guess you could write a simple text interface on top of this
library (that let you do active and passive put and get, cd, delete, and
size).
