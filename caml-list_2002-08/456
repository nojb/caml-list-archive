Thx forreplying. I use Windows XP and I have been able to copy it to a
folder on my computer.
I think Windows XP does not allow anymore downloading directly *.exe files.
But I don't know for sure.

Thx

Scott

P.S. I have problems finding Tk8.4.3.dll . I have the impression that some
things have a price now. ut I am not sure.

Tix is free but AFAIK there are no bindings of Ocamel with Tix
