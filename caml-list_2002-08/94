A special issue of the Journal of Functional Programming will be
devoted to Functional Pearls. The submission deadline is 31 August
2002.

Scope
-----

Do you have a paper that is small, rounded and enjoyable to read?
Please consider submitting it to the Special Issue on Functional
Pearls, as we intend to string a shiny necklace. If you don't have a
pearl, write one today! Papers can be on any subject connected to
functional programming. A pearl is typically around 8 pages, though
there is no strict page limit. The special issue also welcomes
tutorial or educational papers in a broad sense.

Submission details
------------------

Manuscripts should be unpublished works and not submitted elsewhere.
Revised and polished versions of papers published in conference
proceedings that have not appeared in archival journals are eligible
for submission. All submissions will be reviewed according to the
usual standards of scholarship and judged by elegance of development
and clarity of expression. One of the main reviewers will be Richard
Bird, the editor of JFP's regular Functional Pearls column.

Deadline for submission:                   31 August 2002
Notification of acceptance or rejection:   30 November 2002
Revised version due:                       31 January 2003

Submissions should be sent to the Guest Editor (see address below),
with a copy to Nasreen Ahmad (nasreen@dcs.gla.ac.uk). Submitted
articles should be sent in PDF or Postscript format, preferably
gzipped and uuencoded. The use of the JFP style files is strongly
recommended. In addition, please send, as plain text, title, abstract
(if any), and contact information. The submission deadline is 31
August 2002.  Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by
30 November 2002. Revised versions are due on 31 January 2003. For
other submission details, please consult an issue of the Journal of
Functional Programming or see the Journal's web page at
