Errors mentioned have HOTHING with improper CoUnitialize call. I' have
already written they persist even if I _remove_ CoUnitialize totally. Errors
are because of COM interface is called _after_ being entirely Released.
Moreover, not only native olegen but also native excel1 works just fine with
my modifications. My static object destructor call of CoUninitialize does
not check 'uninit' flag and so 'do_not_close()' has no impact on
CoUninitialize call, but I see no any freezings or something like this.

I am too bad com or ocaml expert, but i'd prefer to unbind Release from
com_finalize, and to have an option to call Release explicitly.
