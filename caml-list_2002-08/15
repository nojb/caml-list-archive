Heh! I suppose I have to agree. My Real Time work involved phase control 
lighting systems,
where timing is even tighter than your Ariane's 36ms. Surprisingly, 
switching phase controlled
lighing circuits require precision measured in microseconds -- a single 
machine extra instruction
on a 2Mhz microcontroller can turn an acceptable performance into an 
unacceptable one.

Well, games like Diablo freeze for much longer than that: Baal's 
minions, 5-15 second lockup,
fighting Diablo with perspective on, on a 800Mhz machine: frame rate of 
1 frame per second
or worse with a lag of up to 5 seconds. ARGGG!!! Totally unacceptable: 
lag is responsible
for at least half the deaths on the internet servers.

As I commented in another post, Ocaml could only improve the quality of 
these games
by allowing the programmers to actually get the structure of the real time
operation right.
