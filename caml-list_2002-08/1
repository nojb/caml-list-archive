Ocaml is thaught in france to first year computer science university
student (and in strasbourg at least also to mathematic student, as the
first part of the cursus is common) and to student of preparatory course
to ingenieer schools.

I guess many of those don't download the ocaml manual or the oreilly
book, nor are subscribed to the caml list, but then i don't know exactly
what do you mean by 'knowing' ocaml.
