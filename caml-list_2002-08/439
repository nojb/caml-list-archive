Because it fails many points of the DFSG, in particular, you have no
right to modify it. That is how the authors want it, and so we can only
distribute it in non-free, which is okay (altough i guess other
documentation in debian also have this same problem and shouldbe moved
out of main into non-free, i have not checked though).

Also, anyway, we don't have the original source of the libs, only the
produced stuff, so this is another point making it non-free.

There are other stuff that are in the ocaml-doc package, or could be,
that are non-free also, like the examples and other such.

What is vrms ?

Anyway, much discution went into the move of ocaml-doc from main to
non-free, you can look at the archives of
debian-ocaml-maint@lists.debian.org to get an idea of some of them.
