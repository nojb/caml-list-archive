Actually, front end gui, persistence, and a lot of game logic and AI don't
have to be realtime (e.g. AI's don't have to do pathfinding instantly, they
can hesitate, amortize, etc.)

Hence the terms soft and hard realtime. Games are the first.

Many of them will. Lots of them will call the help line. Each time one does,
you've lost several dollars - typically the developer's profit per unit
profit margin or more.

Plus: if your product freezes, and the other guy's doesn't - you're toast.
Typically that means you've lost $1.4M-$3M of development money, but it
could be more. Then there's marketing, distribution, etc. And this is real,
not government, money. You need substantial advantage to make up for this
risk. Which is where this started.
