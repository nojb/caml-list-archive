Hello to everybody.

Following a recent posting on the ocaml-beginners ML, I would like to ask you: 


how can one load an external bitmap picture using the Graphics library?


(See for instance the picture "jussieu" at 
http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/html/book-ora048.html )

The book says: "A bitmap may be represented by either a color matrix (color 
array array) or a value of abstract type 1 image, which is declared in 
library Graphics. " but does not say anything about acquisition.

Any further hint about the image formats that can be used would be strongly 
appreciated.

Thank you
Ernesto Torresin
