Hmhhh

configure says, that findlib is not installed (this is correct)
and that pcre is not installed (this is wrong).

My pcre.cmi is in directory /usr/local/lib/ocaml/contrib/pcre/
but it seems that it is not found.

Did I anything wrong during installation of pcre?
Is this an uncommon directory for pcre?
Or does the ocamlnet's configure look not there?

Ciao,
