I was always curious about this. If I were to change Array module, but not 
its interface, ocamlopt would ask me to recompile (not just re-link) 
everything that depends on Array, which means that ocamlopt looks at Array 
_implementation_, while compiling (not linking) code that depends on it.
In view of this, what stopped O'Caml creators from letting ocamlopt inline 
functions across module boundaries (especially if it's true that this could 
be responsible for a 100x speed boost)?

Is there a tutorial for reading those *.s files ocamlopt produces?

Cheers
