 I knew it!!! I'm already using this feature to manage modules
in one not so big project (about 50 modules). Before -pack was introduced
I had a very bad headache with modules naming... But even this is not
a complete solution: some namespace info is defined completely in the
Makefiles, not in the source code. And, Makefiles becomes more and more
complex.

 I think that the best and the most natural solution is something
like Java or Python packages...
