Huh? Which parts of a real time interactive game aren't real time??
The whole thing, from gameplay interaction to graphics and sound,
must be done in 'real-time'.

Note that almost no game companies have the faintest idea how
to do real time programming. So it isn't clear worrying about
lag from garbage collection is even an issue. when they can't even
get basic real time operation right. Of course, it doesn't help
when you have to program for an OS not designed to support
real time operations other than basic IO.

Frankly, Ocaml would improve games enormously by allowing
programmers to concentrate on what really matters: algorithms
and programmer structure.
