But the Line ("text")-argument is only complete as a Line(),
if Line() has a higher priority than the function-call.
I have *one* argument, which is complete if given EMPTY,
and complete if given Line ("argument").

Shouldn't be types have a higher priority than calls
in this case?
Is Line() in this example handled like an ordinary function?

That is, what I think that it is a littlebid crazy.
I use the type-definition to put things together
nad use them as one type, but then it is handled
like a puzzle, before it is put together.
But I want here a complete picture, and I thought
the compiler would put the parts together: How to
put them together is clear: I have said it him in the
type-declaration.

Ciao,
