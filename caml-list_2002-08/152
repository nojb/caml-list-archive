Although the standard ocaml mode is fine for me when it works, there's one
thing about it that really annoys me: occasionally the indenting engine
gets confused and then totally refuses to do the right thing from then on.
I have to manually re-load the caml-mode emacs files to fix it.  Another
thing I don't like is that caml-mode doesn't treat nested comments
correctly as far as syntax coloring is concerned.  I guess I should give
tuareg a try.
