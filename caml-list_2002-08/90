True.
If you're using OCamole to manipulate COM objects and then passing them back
to C, your C code need to call AddRef on the retreived COM object since
OCamole GC'ed process does not respect the COM spec (caller is responsible
from Release, callee call AddRef )

Simply use the following function :

IUnknown *get_com_object( value v ) {
    IUnknown *o = IUnknown_val(v);
    o->AddRef();
    return o;
}
