There is no such checking in the Caml code for the toplevel.
However, the toplevel calls termcap or terminfo functions to try and
underline graphically the error.  Maybe these functions have a bug?
Try setting the TERM variable to "dumb" or "none" before starting the
toplevel, e.g. launch it with
        /bin/sh -c "TERM=dumb ocaml"
