I think a naming convention like this is definitely needed, but in order
not to be confused with sub-modules, a different character should be used.
For example:

Db/Core/Storage could be a legal module name (in Db/Core/storage.ml), and
Db.Core.Storage could be a module hierarchy defined in Db.ml, and
Db/Core/Storage.Medium could be a submodule defined in Db/Core/storage.ml,...

An added advantage of this syntax is that it is consistent with the overall
esthetics of the OCaml language (i.e., ugly). :-)
