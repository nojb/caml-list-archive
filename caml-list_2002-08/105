I've been planning to build an interactive application with OCaml that
will be deployed primarily on Windows, so I'd like to understand your
warning better.

1. Is the risk just in developing (compiling, packaging) on Windows,
   or also in deploying to Windows?

2. What do you mean by "piling port after port"?  Do you mean
   reworking the application to track changes as the various tools
   (GNU+OCaml+labltk+GTK) evolve in successive releases?  Has this
   been a big problem in applications such as Unison?  (Or any
   other broadly deployed OCaml app?  I don't know of others.)

3. Is there some other GUI framework that you expect will entail less
   suffering than lablgtk+GTK?

4. As the porting problem applies to the GNU compilers and OCaml
   itself, are you warning us against developing OCaml applications
   for use on Windows?
