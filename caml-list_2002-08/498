I'm pleased to announce a new release of Cash, the Caml Shell.

* Release 0.20

What's new:
- Cash now compiles on Cygwin and OS with no support for dynamic
  linking by Objective Caml;
- A complete tty/pty interface, covering Posix, SYSV and BSD;
- An emulation of string channels;
- Unbuffered I/O is fully working with Ocaml 3.05;
- Some bugs have been fixed, some examples added (in examples/).
Also added:
- write_string and its cousins;
- fork_with_pipe_plus (complex connections in pipes);
- call_with_input_file, call_with_output_file, call_with_fdes_fn
  (Scheme compatibility);
- run_with_out_channel, run_with_outchan_plus_proc, and
  run_with_chan_plus_proc becomes run_with_inchan_plus_proc.

* What is Cash ?

Cash is a Caml implementation of (an as large as possible subset of) the
API of Scsh (0.5.3), the Scheme Shell by Olin Shivers.	It's designed for
writing standalone Unix programs and shell scripts (but rather *not* for
interactive command use). It spans a wide range of application, from
"script" applications usually handled with perl or sh, to more standard
systems applications usually written in C.

* Bugs
