Ocamlnet "configure" script can use findlib or do a 'manual' search.

Seems to me that you doesn't have findlib, so configure script will look
for "pcre.cmi" in the standard ocaml directory (obtained with "ocamlc
-where") and fail because your pcre.cmi isn't there.

You can solve the configure problem adding your dir to the "incdirs"
variable in the configure script, but probably you will need to add some
more switches to reach the end of the compilation.

Obviously installing findlib seems to be easier :-)
Consider also that you can install findlib and not reinstall pcre, just
add your "/usr/local/lib/ocaml/contrib" to the findlib search path.

Cheers.
