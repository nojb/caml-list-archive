This is wrong. Neither ocamlnet nor netclient require gtk. (I really wonder
where you have found this; there is no published piece of code from me that
uses gtk.)

Of course, these libraries have requirements, mostly because of coding 
economy. I try to avoid to program functions twice, or to distribute the
same function twice under different names. (Nevertheless this happens, e.g.
there are parsers for mail (RFC822) messages in both ocamlnet and netclient.)
You are right that "bigger programming environments" profit more from this
approach, because code is shared. It makes it also simpler for me, the author,
because I need to maintain smaller amounts of code.

In particular, ocamlnet needs PCRE, and netclient needs (besides ocamlnet) 
equeue, and optionally xstr (for multi-threaded apps). A quite short 
dependency chain, IMHO. It might be possible that netclient and equeue are 
integrated into ocamlnet in the future, but a lot of consolidation is needed
first.
