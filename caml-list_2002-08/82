True.
The job of the GC is to release unreferenced objects.
But I don't see how this can cause a bug : it seems that your crash is due
to a call of a COM method on a object AFTER it has been released... if it
has been Release, then it is no longer referenced by Ocaml... so , how can u
ever call a method on it ???

This solution is not an acceptable one.
You still can choose to modify OCam'OLE on your own....
