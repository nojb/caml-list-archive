I was interested to read this, but was sad to see that they didn't
actually ship the app, or even beta test it, according to this quote:

"After performing code cleanup based on Lennart's suggestions, we
prepared for an initial test release of the system during the summer
of 2000. That release has been put on hold while we perform
integration work with another complex legacy application and improve
our monitoring system."
