I will try to do this, thanks. I just tried ocamlsdl (I get a weird
relocation error at exit) and ocamlsvga (my S3 card isn't fully
supported), so I have no other choice.

I don't like threads very much because they are hard to debug with
ocamldebug, and native threads are not supported under every OS (for
ex. OpenBSD).

Alarm has only a single-second resolution and is not implemented under
MS-Windows. Plus the Graphics module uses the alarm signal, I think.
