Yes, I think that's still the best method :
- get the descriptor with Unix.descr_of_in_channel or
  Unix.descr_of_out_channel 
- fdopen it on the C side
You might also want to call dup() on the fd so that your FILE* stream
is still working if the original caml channel is closed.

But maybe CamlIDL has improved, I don't know.
