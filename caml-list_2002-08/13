And would be versioned 3.05.1 or something such if we had three level
version numbers.

Ok, so this is the reason for the segfault during compile, while using
libraries built with 3.04 ?

I checked the .cm* magic number, and did not find them changed, so i
wondered.

Mmm, if the .cm* magic number is not changed (not because it was
forgotten), does this mean we don't need to rebuild the libraries ?

Well, no problem for us, debian ocaml packaging policy mandate that each
library be compiled with exactly the same version of the ocaml suite
that is currently used anyway, so we will never be bitten by this.
We use the dependencies to make sure that this never cause problem (for
debian packaged libraries).

BTW, after some discution, we feel that for distributions, a scheme with
two camllib directories would be best, the first being the standard
camllib directoty (/usr/lib/ocaml) where we will put distribution
related stuff (packaged libraries), and the second being
/usr/local/lib/ocaml, or even better /usr/local/lib/ocaml/3.05, where
user installed stuff goes.

I already support this somewhat by putting /usr/lib/ocaml/stublibs and
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/stublibs in ld.conf, but i guess more support from
ocaml would be needed to have this work transparently with the -I +dir
options and other.

What do you think about this ?

Well, the autobuilder handle that for us, but we have to bump the
version number and upgrade the dependencies (which could be automated
with something like the --version patch i sent to you).

Yes, i was root at my homebox when i wrote this mail, and the address
translation did not kick in.
