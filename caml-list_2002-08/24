> What is meant by first first-class polymorphism?

The ability to pass values with polymorphic types around.
This is mostly useful for objects, and lets you write type safe
visitor patterns for instance.

If you're happy with bytecode, you don't need any of these.
You can actually compile and link applications without a C compiler.
By the way, I've heard that a non-optimizing version of MSVC is
available for free in the .NET sdk. This may do if you really need to
do some custom linking or use native code.

> Can Olabl be used with windows?

O'Labl is now dead. All of its features (and more) have been included
in O'Caml. (But yes, olabl did work on windows)
