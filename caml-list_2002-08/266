 For me package is not a modules collection, but just
a way of multi-word module naming. It's not so easy to
give short and still adequate names to the modules, but
something like Db.Core.Storage looks much better then
Dbstorage, and Storage can still be accessed just as
"Storage" from modules of the same "package". Just a naming
way, nothing more.
