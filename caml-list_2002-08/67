Not really.  When debugging the problem of the compactor that would
not trigger, I stumbled on a bug in the way the GC determines its
speed (relative to the program).  In 3.04, when you ask for an
overhead of 42% (the default), the actual overhead is closer to 80%.
In 3.05 I fixed the formulas, but I didn't change the default 42%,
which results in a smaller memory footprint, but slower programs.

Of course, you can even try 100% or more.  Depending on the program,
you might gain a lot of time before you hit the point of diminishing
returns.

If you want to recover the previous behaviour, you should set
something like OCAMLRUNPARAM=o=80.  In 3.06, it will be the default.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
