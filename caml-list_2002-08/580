The only purpose of this release is to give some useful data
structures to those who are participating in the ICFP 2002 programming
contest : I just tared a copy of the working files. In fact, there are
some source files that are not even in the Makefile

There will be a better release soon

For those who wonder what I thought could be useful :
- heaps are very often used in graph algorithms (convex envelop)
- priority search trees can be used for Disjkstra's shortest path
algorith (see the paper from Ralf Hinze)
