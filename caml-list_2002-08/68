Hello!

Is it possible in a stream parser to parse again already
accepted token.

An example (a little incorrect) follows.

I'd like to make this in camlp:

A(B).c --> let module M = A(B) in M.c

To do that, i write (scematically):

expr:
[[ m = module_expr; "."; e = expr -> ... ]]

"Note" may be parsed as either module expression or a usual
one. But, expr cannot be followed by a period (that's wrong,
I know, but let's forget about it for a while). Then,
writing None, I've got the Stream.Error and parsing error.

So, can I write something like:
[[ TRY (m = module_expr); "."; ... and so on, do get parsing
failure insted of error, and push the successful head of failed
structute back into a stream, to parse it again (as an expr
now)?

Thanks for your attention.
Max.
