Hmhhhh.

Ok, I now had installed the findlib.
And then the ocamlnet-configure-script detected both:
findlib and pcre.

But when typing "make" the result was, that pcre was'nt found.

What is the best installing directory for stuff like pcre,
which normally will be searched by default?

When directly using pcre from within Ocaml-Programs, I had
the ssame problem, that the pcre-stuff was not in the
default-search-path of the compilers.

Are there installation-driectories, which can be recommended
for such packagaes?

I reinstall pcre then (nice, that it has a "make uninstall")
in the better directory.

Ciao,
   Oliver
