Hi,

I want to write a small echo program (for self amusement). It's like 
that everytime I press a character key, there's a hook function got 
called. Somewhat like a event loop.

I found Stream can't do this. Stream only begins to parse the input from 
keyboard after I press Ctrl-D. read_char from Pervasive can't do this 
either. It only begins to do stuff after I press the Return key. What I 
want is a read function that read instantly after a charcter key being 
pressed.

Can you give me some recommendations? Thanks in advance.
