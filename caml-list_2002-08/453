Alternatively, strip can be fixed to know about ocaml bytecode.

I was also told that if the ocaml team would have used another
label/tag/whatever it is called in the binary code than the one it is
using, then strip would know about it. But then, i am not expert on
that, and i guess the ocaml team don't think it is a good idea, since i
never got any response to the message i sent about it (back when i was
told that).
