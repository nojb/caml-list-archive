I had in mind ther ewas XPM format support in the `Graphics' library, but i
am afraid there is not. I have no direct answer to your question, i only now
you should install the `Camlimages' <http://pauillac.inria.fr/camlimages/> 
and check to the examples to see how to interface it with module Graphics,
and if you are interested, with lablgtk, both are possible.
