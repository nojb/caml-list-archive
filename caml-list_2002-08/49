I think you observe GC compaction. You can turn it off:
OCAMLRUNPARAM="O=1000000" (or Gc.set).

If XML validation is not needed, you could also rewrite your program
to use the new event-based parsing in PXP-1.1.90. That would completely
avoid to represent the XML tree in memory (and increase the speed, because
GC of large memory footprints is expensive).
