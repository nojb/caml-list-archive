For MP3, not at all.  Consider:
- GC pauses are well below 100ms (more like 10ms, actually)
  (provided the compactor is turned off)
- Sound drivers can usually buffer 0.5-1s of sound.
- MP3 decompression in real-time uses a small fraction of the CPU power.
Ergo, the sound buffer will easily mask the GC pauses.

MPEG video is another story: buffering is much more limited, and CPU
utilization is much higher.  But GC isn't the only source of potential
hiccups: disk accesses are as much of a problem, if not worse.
