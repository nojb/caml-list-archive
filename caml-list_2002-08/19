Hi!

I'm currently in the process of porting all of the OpenGL tutorials at=20
http://nehe.gamedev.net to lablgl/lablglut. I won't be done for a little=20
while, but I'll make an announcement once I've got something that's sort =
of=20
releasable. (If anyone is interested in a "prerelease" version, please le=
t me=20
know.)

For simple prototyping, lablgl with either Tk or Glut is pretty=20
straightforward. I am using the lablglut bindings=20
(http://www.issactrotts.net) for the tutorials, and they're working nicel=
y.=20
The lablgl toolkit contains some example programs that should give you a=20
general idea of how things work.

If these examples don't seem to work for you, or you'd like some further=20
explanation, please let me know.

Cheers,
