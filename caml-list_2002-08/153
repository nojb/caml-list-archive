This is a bit strange: when you load a file, ocaml-mode colorize the
whole buffer, just as when toggle on-and-off, or use font-lock-fontify
buffer. So the result should not differ.
However, as soon as you edit the text, colorization is done
individually on each modified line, and may come out incorect.

You're pretty much limited by font-lock's capabilities.
Which means no support for incremental multiline colorizing.
No surprise you encounter the same problems.

> I'm pretty sure the indentation will not be a big issue for me.

Then any mode should please you: in ocaml-mode colorizing is less than
100 lines (just regular expression, that you may twiddle yourself if
you want), while indentation is more than 1000 (most of caml.el).
There is a huge gap in complexity, because caml syntax is so
unstructured.
