Being a lucky Unix-user, I have never tried to build PCRE under Windows.
In case anybody has succeeded and wants to contribute his knowledge, I'd
appreciate a README.win32 file, which I'd put into the distribution then.
John Small had already contributed one a long time ago, but since the
C-library is not part of the distribution anymore, his README.win32 had
become obsolete.
