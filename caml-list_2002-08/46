But ocaml variable and COM reference are merely different things.

This does not work. Even not to call CoUninitialize does not work. There is
the same access violation (not segfault as i've early mentioned) error
everywhere: "The object invoked has disconnected from its clients". I am in
no way ocaml or COM expert, but it seems this is because ocaml not only GCs
_unneeded variable_ but also Releases _still needed_ interface.
