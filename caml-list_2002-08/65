I meant:

    fix f. fun x . e ==> fun x. fix z . e [f x -> z] (* z not occuring 
in e *)

ie. the fix and fun binders swap around with the substitution.
I should also have noted that obviously this only works if it is
done at the right time, eg in

    fix g. (fun x (fun f ( f x) g) x)

the inner redex must be reduced first.
