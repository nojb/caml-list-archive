Subject: [Caml-list] interactive graphics with Tcl/Tk

I'm trying to use tcl/tk for doing interactive graphics from the toplevel.
 And, lord help me, I'm trying to do it on cygwin.
My basic solution I came up with is this:  I have one thread doing all the
labltk calls.  That thread also polls a channel where it effectively picks
up RPC requests.  SO, when I want to draw something on the screen, I stuff
the appropriate function into the channel, the TclTk thread picks it up
and executes that function, and then sends back a response, at which point
the calling thread continues.
Anyway, it all seems well and good, but when I actually try to do it, for
some reason the i/o on the caml toplevel locks up.  So if I type:
# Graphing.init (); print_string "Hello World!\n";;
Hello World!
- : unit = ()
#

Graphing.init starts up the Tcl/Tk window as expected, and the print
works, also as expected.  But from that point on until I kill the Tcl/Tk
window, I can't get the toplevel to respond to keypresses.  It's as if the
Tcl/Tk thread has stolen stdin.  Does anyone know how to work around this?
