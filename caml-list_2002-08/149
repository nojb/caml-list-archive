I just tried out ocaml-mode-3.05, but it is difficult to perform a
comparison because the colorization of the two modes is quite
different and customization is not straightforward.  It would be
unfair to do a comparison without first minimizing the gratuitous
differences between the two.  I did notice that when I loaded a buffer
in ocaml-mode the comments were not colorized properly, though when I
toggled font-lock mode off and on they came out right.  This is also
my main problem with tuareg mode - mysterious colorization behavior.
I'm pretty sure the indentation will not be a big issue for me.
