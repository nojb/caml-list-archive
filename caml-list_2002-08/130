              The Fifth Annual

           ICFP PROGRAMMING CONTEST

        August 30 - September 2, 2002

        http://icfpcontest.cse.ogi.edu/

Convinced your favorite programming language provides unbeatable
productivity?  Convinced you and your friends are world-class programmers?

If so, we're providing you the opportunity to prove it! We are pleased
to announce the Fifth Annual ICFP Programming Contest to be held in
conjunction with the 2002 International Conference on Functional
Programming (ICFP 2002). All programmers are invited to enter the
contest, either individually or in teams; we especially encourage
students to enter.  You may use any programming language (or
combination of languages) to show your skill.

On Friday, August 30, 2002 at 12:00 Noon (PDT), we will publish a 
challenge task on the Web site and by e-mail to registered participants. 
  Teams will have until Monday, 02 September 2002, 12:00 Noon (PDT) (72 
hours) to implement a program to perform this task and submit it to the 
contest judges.  We've designed the contest for direct, head-to-head
comparison of language technology and programming skill.  We have a
range of prizes for the winners: cash awards, special student prizes,
and, of course, unlimited bragging rights.

For more information about the contest, prizes, and registration,
