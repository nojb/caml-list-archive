Hi all,

as a freebsd user, i have ported three libraries (ocamlnet, ocaml-classes
and pcre-ocaml) to freebsd. I was successful in using it on my computer,
but i did not released them yet:

* the porting was very poorly done, it lacks modularity and do not install
  documentation (not always), but i will still work on it

* it could be nice if some other FreeBSD users try them and report matters,
  comments, suggestions (and waw, improvements ?) : the ports have not been
  submitted yet to the FreeBSD maintainers, and testing them a bit before
  submitting will maybe let the things go faster when they will.

Ow, you know, if you try them you do it at your own risks, and so and so
blah blah, here are some cues:

- the libraries and the files are alle installed to
`/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib' in directories `pcre', `classes',
`ocamlnet', so if you have something you installed yourself here, you better
backup ! 

- the `stubs' directories is not used, but i will try to do so when
needed. 

- all of them do have META file, so ocamlfind should work well with

- i am not sure the ports do respect totally the PREFIX and WRKSRC
  variables.
