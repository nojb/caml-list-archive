It's actually a lot easier to skip video frames than it is to skip audio
samples.  With audio, nearly anything you miss will produce an audible
pop, but it's often possible to skip a video frame or two without it
being very noticable.  MPEG "B" frames are the best candidates, since no
other frames depend on them.  You do have to eat the bitstream, but you
don't need to do any other decode, so you get a chance to get back
ahead.
