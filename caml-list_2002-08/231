                 The Tenth International Workshop on
               Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages

                               FOOL 10

                      Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN

                          January 18, 2003
                        New Orleans, Louisiana
                         Following POPL '03

Deadlines

                Submissions: September 30, 2002=20
                Notifications: November 15, 2002=20
                Final versions: December 12, 2002

The search for sound principles for object-oriented languages has
given rise to much work on the theory of programming languages during
the past 15 years, leading to a better understanding of the key
concepts of object-oriented languages and to important developments in
type theory, semantics, and program verification. The FOOL workshops
bring together researchers to share new ideas and results in these
areas. The next workshop, FOOL 10, will be held in New Orleans,
Louisiana, on Saturday January 18, 2003, the day after POPL '03. =20

Submissions for this event are invited in the general area of
foundations of object-oriented languages; topics of interest include
language semantics, type systems, program analysis and verification,
programming calculi, concurrent and distributed languages, and
database languages. The main focus in selecting workshop contributions
will be the intrinsic interest and timeliness of the work, so authors
are encouraged to submit polished descriptions of work in progress as
well as papers describing completed projects. =20

A world-wide web page will be created and made available as an
informal electronic conference proceedings. =20

Submission procedure

We solicit submissions on original research not previously published
or currently submitted for publication elsewhere, in the form of
extended abstracts. These extended abstracts should not exceed 5000
words (approximately 10 pages).  Submissions should be e-mailed to
fool10@di.unipi.it by Monday, September 30, 2002, using US-letter page
size, Postscript or PDF. Each submission may be included inline in a
message or as a MIME attachment only. We may not be able to consider
late submissions, or submissions that do not have a working and
attended return e-mail address. (If electronic submission is
impossible, please contact the program chair in September.) Receipt of
the submissions will be acknowledged by e-mail. Authors should inquire
in case a prompt acknowledgment is not received. =20

Correspondence and questions should be sent to fool10@di.unipi.it.=20
