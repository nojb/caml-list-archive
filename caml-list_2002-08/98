The client must supply callbacks.

I'm intrigued by the relationship between these two parsers. In particular,
note that my Felix compiler takes 'pull' code, and automatically 
translates it
to the much more efficient 'push' model: ie. it switches the client/server
relationship around, a process I call control inversion.

I believe there is a deep theoretical relationship between push and pull
code -- some kind of categorical duality -- but I dont know precisely what
it is .... despite being able to actually translate one to the other 
using Felix :-)

I'd be very interested if anyone has any ideas on this.
