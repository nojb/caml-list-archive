Hi,

  I would like to share access to a file between a C function and an OCaml
function in an application put together with CamlIDL. If I have a C
function with prototype:

int manip_file(FILE* f, int x);

  Is there any support in CamlIDL for passing a file that was opened in
OCaml. I checked the archives, and found a message that described pulling
out the integer file descriptor, and passing that to fdopen on the C side,
but that was it -- the same message asked about better support from
CamlIDL (this was winter 2000), but I couldn't find a response. Has this
changed over the past year and a half, or is that the best method?

Thanks,
Mike
