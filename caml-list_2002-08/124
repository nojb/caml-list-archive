As an windows ocaml user for some time now, I'll try to answer your
questions

As Xavier answered, deploying under windows is easier than under Unix . You
can package binaries quite easily without even the need for the end-user to
install Ocaml ( DLL's since 3.04 simplified lots of things )

About developing, I'm currently compiling and running OCaml code from MSVC++
:)
It's quite confortable this way, even if an OCaml IDE would be better.

I've been developping Osiris, an OCaml class-based GUI system which is built
on top of the Win32 API OCaml Port (still partial, but complete enough to
work with). If you're willing to develop GUIs for windows-only, Osiris may
be a good choice. If you're willing to develop cross-platform applications,
I have been thinking for few month now to write a GTK port of Osiris... when
I'll have some free time :)

Don't worry, the ratio ( INRIA support ) / (number of window users) is quite
high :)
