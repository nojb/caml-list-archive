GTK is quite a big API, porting it using native Window components will
require some time...

> Or Osiris will be better, than gtk?

Osiris is OCaml , GTK is C.
Actually there is LablGTK which is a ocaml binding for GTK , there is also
the Ocaml Win32 API, which enable you to call most of the Win32 API
functions from ocaml ( mixing ocaml / C )

Osiris is built on-top of this API, so is entirely written in OCaml . The
port I was thinking of is to write a version of Osiris which use Lablgtk
instead of the Win32 API binding. Osiris will still remain ocaml-only but
then usable either under Linux or Windows ( with GTK or Native API under
Windows ). BTW, Osiris is class-based and doesn't enable such a control of
components as GTK do.

> ps: Where can we download Osiris?

I just put the last version on http://tech.motion-twin.com with some samples
included
