Hi!

Thx again for your answers.
Now the only thing I miss, is some documentation.
I read the examples, but I still have some questions.
Specially the meaning of the type border. (I wish I could have labelled
panes)
And I don't know much about geometry management.
It seems it has some border-layout like management, but it is not so
simple to use. I think a single wrapper, which behaves like HPanel and
VPanel in gtk will be nice. I also wonder if I can do split-panes.
Some sort of automatic placement will be fine. Configure, that all
elements in a container vill be top aligned. (=VPanel)
The last thing I miss is to enable auto-fill an element. (AlClient is
for that purpose?)

For example how can I achieve a simple layout like this: (rolodex
(sorry, don't know the correct spelling)
And, if it is possible, how to have a labelled border around each row,
like this

    +-borderlabel----------+
    |                      |
    |  Element in the pane |
    |                      |
    +----------------------+

<table>
 <tr>
  <td>Label</td>
  <td><input></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Label2</td>
  <td><input></td>
 </tr>
</table>

Sorry for the tons of questions, but I hope you welcome feedback. I was
so excited, that I can so easily create standalone GUI application for
windows. (and will be in the future for linux also with the help of gtk
bindings)
