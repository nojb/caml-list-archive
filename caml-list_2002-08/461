[ Spam filtering is rather off-topic for this list, but this tool is
  written in OCaml, and needs adventurous users of the kind found on
  this list to be tested... ]

Are you tired with spam messages cluttering your e-mail?  Are you
retentive enough to have meticulously archived all this spam,
separately from your regular e-mail, in the hope that someday some
program might learn by example how to recognize spam -- something that
any human does in a fraction of second?

If so, rejoice!  The time has come!

Introducing the Spam Oracle, a.k.a. "Saint Peter".  From the README:

  SpamOracle is a BiCapitalized tool to help detect and filter away "spam"
  (unsolicited commercial e-mail).  It proceeds by statistical analysis
  of the words that appear in the e-mail, comparing the frequencies of
  words with those found in a user-provided corpus of known spam and
  known legitimate e-mail.  The classification algorithm is based on
  Bayes' formula, and is described in Paul Graham's paper, "A plan for
  spam", http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html.  

  This program is designed to work in conjunction with procmail.
  The result of the analysis is output as an additional message header
  "X-Spam:", followed by "yes", "no" or "unknown", plus additional
  details.  A procmail rule can then test this "X-Spam:" header and
  deliver the e-mail to the appropriate mailbox.

  In addition, SpamOracle also also analyses MIME attachments,
  extracting relevant information such as MIME type, character encoding
  and attached file name, and summarizing them in an additional
  "X-Attachments:" header.  This allows procmail to easily reject
  e-mails containing suspicious attachments, e.g. Windows executables
  which often indicate a virus.

All for the incredibly low price of $0.00 !  But hurry -- it won't
last long!  Grab your copy from 
    http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/software.html#spamoracle

This AMAZING product, based on college-level statistical theory less
than one century old, will just REVOLUTIONIZE your life!  Or your
money back!  But don't take my words for it!  See the testimonials
from our happy customers!  Xavier L., from Versailles: "What with all
these e-mails about V**gra, p*nis enlargement, and hot teen*ge sl*ts,
I just couldn't concentrate on writing quality software and research
papers.  Your product just restored peace in my mailbox and in my
mind, too.  Now, I can spend whole days watching my procmail log
and bursting into hysterical laughter every time another spam bites
the dust!  Why, it feels so good, I think I'll subscribe to some of
these "one-time use" mailing lists JUST FOR FUN!"

Enjoy,
