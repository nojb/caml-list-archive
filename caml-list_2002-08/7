Note I said *default* name: i.e. make the default libraries install in 
different places.
It's not clear how to manage binaries. What Python does is have 
'python1.5' and
'python2.1' both in /usr/local/bin, and then use a symbolic link. Client
can also put symlinks in ~/bin. Not clear to me how to ensure all binaries
are switched around when changing versions. Same applies to man pages.

At present, I just reinstall the version I want to use..which takes 
considerable time.
Luckily, I only use optimising compiler, so once a binary is built, it 
matter not
which development system is active .. but this won't be so once shared 
libraries
are used ..

Anyhow, just a though.. version control is a non-trivial thing.
