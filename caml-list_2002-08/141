I'm not in a position to argue on either of these modes, but I use
tuareg and it satisfies all my needs. I only remember that I switched to
it from some other mode which was less satisfactory.

I'm not sure that this argument is decisive for us, plain users. Add to
this that there is no concensus on the merits of OCaml syntax itself...
There are some extremely experienced FP users among us (not me), who
don't like it. I can't dismiss this fact as something "subjective". I
have no intention to offend you by this, but... this is reality: we are
all different.
