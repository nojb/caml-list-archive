To answer my own questions:
Don't trust OcamlMakefile (at lest not the version from march 2001) to handle 
all the IDL stuff.

If I compile all my C stub code files (the libfoo library I want to interface 
to has several related, but technically independent subsets of its API which I 
want to put in different modules) and put them into a libfoostubs.a, I can then 
compile the Ocaml side of then stub code with
   -cclib foostubs -cclib foo -cclib camlidl
into a cm(x)a, and things work. Phew....

Yours, Florian.
