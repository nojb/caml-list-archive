I agree with the ugly part.  But it is consistent with
C not OCaml, IMHO. The difference between structures 
(ie first order modules) and packages as far as I can 
see is that you can abstract over modules and you can 
individually type check modules. If you have a language
where abstraction and type checking are non-existent
then packages might be a fine thing.  Separate compilation
for nested modules and a name mangling scheme for their
file names might be useful for OCaml.  -D
