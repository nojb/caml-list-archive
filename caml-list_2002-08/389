Hello

I had been trying to install some additional packages in my system.
My original intention was to install PXP.  I am getting closer now. I have
managed PCRE (with some hints and files from Yutaka OIWA).

I needed to build (I think) the wlex - runtime to get PXP built.
But while building wlex broke because there is no ocamlmklib in my system.

Is there a way around this problem ?

cheers
pj
