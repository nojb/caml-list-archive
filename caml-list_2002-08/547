It makes a big difference if you're running in a realtime system with a
shared memory model.

The meaning of "safe" is completely nebulous here. Type safety is
provided very well by OCaml. But then we have things like

# max_int;;
- : int = 1073741823
# max_int + 1;;
- : int = -1073741824

Obvious performance and practicality concerns preclude checking the
bounds on every addition operation. Nonetheless, this could without much
stretch of the imagination be called "unsafe".
