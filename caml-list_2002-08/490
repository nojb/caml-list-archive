Hello,

I'm pleased to announce the release of Cameleon 1.0.
A lot of Changes for this new release, see the ChangeLog below.
A big change is that now all my development tools will
be maintained inside Cameleon, including the last born Epeire.

You can find Cameleon here:
http://www.maxence-g.net/Tools/

I will release a binary rpm for intel in the next days.

Comments are welcome.

Enjoy !
