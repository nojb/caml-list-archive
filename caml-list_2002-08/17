Dear Nicolas!

Great job! Thanks.

I believe, OCam'OLE strikes a very important win32 real-world target: COM
Automation client.

But I must point out typical error (I saw exactly the same error in Haskell
HDirect/COM library): ocaml finalization and com release are _essentially
different_ entities! Sorry for not being sufficiently verbose - i have not
enough time right now. If You doubt this is an issue - I will definitely
clarify my point. Now only a few words: I've built native olegen version
(having replaced CoInitialize/CoUninitialize call in DllMain with a call in
a static dummy class instance constructor/destructor), and discovered this
olegen causes segmentaion fault! It turned out to be sufficient simply to
comment out "i->Release();" in "com_finalize" to make it work.

Regards,
Kyra
