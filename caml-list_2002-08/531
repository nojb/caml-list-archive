Indeed. The pretty printing in Camlp4 is not as developped as the
parsing. For the moment I don't have clear ideas to how to have good
pretty printing facilities with extensibility. This exists, but it is
experimental and incomplete and is likely to change. I prefer not
document that.

Remark: Jeff's question was actually about parsing, not pretty printing.
