Subject: [Caml-list] inconsistent assumptions over interface . . .
To: caml-list@inria.fr
MIME-Version: 1.0

How can I free myself of the "inconsistent assumptions" error?  My micro test
case has the following:

$ cat a/foo.ml
let foo x = x + x
$ cd a; ocamlc -pack -o apack.cmo foo.ml; cd ..

$ cat b/foo.ml
let foo x = x +. x
$ cd b; ocamlc -pack -o bpack.cmo foo.ml; cd ..

$ cat foo.ml
let foo a b = Apack.Foo.foo a, Bpack.Foo.foo b
$ ocamlc -c -I a -I b foo.ml
The compiled interfaces a/apack.cmi and b/bpack.cmi
make inconsistent assumptions over the interface Foo

I hope this is clear... I want to be able to reuse file names for different
components of my system. I was hoping that -pack would allow me to do this, but
it seems that it's not enough... is there a solution?
