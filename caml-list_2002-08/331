Hi,

I have a question on the manage of modules files. I use the toplevel
system to make some algorithms and then I compile them to get efficient
executable file.
Is it possible to have exactly the same files for the two stage. For
example, in the ocaml toplevel, I load the two following files a.ml and
b.ml with the #use command.

In a file named a.ml, I have :
module A =3D struct
=09let f =3D function _ -> 0
end

In a second file named b.ml, I have :
module B =3D struct
=09open A

=09let g =3D f
end

Everything works well.
But when I want to compile them, I have to put in comments the "(*module ?
=3D struct*)" and the "(* end *)" to make it works.
Is there another way to proceed ?

Thanks

Vincent
