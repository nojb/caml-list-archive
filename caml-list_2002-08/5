It's a type-checking bug, not a parsing bug.  You're correct that
fixing it is likely not to break binary compatibility.  

However, I have bad news for you: it turns out that the .cmi files for
3.05 have a different format than those for 3.04, and we forgot to
change the magic number in .cmi files whose purpose is precisely to
guard against using a .cmi file in an old format.  (The segfault
reported by Alexander Voinov on this list was tracked down to such an
undetected use of an old .cmi file.)  Hence, the magic number will be
bumped in 3.06, causing 3.05-compiled files to be rejected.

I know you will hate me for this, but I really don't see any better
solution.
