Hi !

I was thinking that the following should be possible :

match e with
| Any
| Int x when x > 0 ->
        .... (* here we don't use x *)
| ....

But the typechecker reject it because of the unbound 'x' in the "Any"
matching.
I don't know what kind of difficulty this modification require, but it would
be nice if the compiler was able to resolve such cases.
