Thanks for the report.
OCamole haven't yet been tested under the toplevel.

Note that ocamole can't really answer to theses questions. You should try to
figure out how you would to that in VB and then translate into OCaml ( if
find somewhere the PowerPoint VBScript Help )

True.
a GUID is an unique identifier ( something like this :
{DA936B63-AC8B-11D1-B6E5-00A0C90F2744} ) which can represent a COM class
or... something else... There is a also way to retreive the guid from an
name ( such as "Excel.Application" ) : "guid_of_progid"

Seems like it does not come from the the generated interface but from the
type checking of returned values.
I'll invistigate this point.
