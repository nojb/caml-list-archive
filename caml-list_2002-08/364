Thank you Jacques.  I didn't know that you could name < and > types in
type declarations.  Perfect :)
Now, can anyone point me at docs about polymorphic records?  I can't find
a thing :(  They were mentioned in the 3.05 release notes as'- Support for polymorphic methods and record fields.'
which could be an extension of the object-based polymorphic records or a
really useful extension like the polymorphic variants.
Cheers,
Nick
