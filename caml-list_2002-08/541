I would say yes, and it definitely needs a strict type system (I guess
there is no language without a type system at all). Strict means: every
value has a precise type - which does not mean that there are no
polymorphic types, or type conversions.

In that respect Lisp is a safe language - or at least Scheme; I don't
know that much about Lisp. But "safe" can be interpreted in a lot of
other ways of course.

This shows that Lisp is safe, because it results in an error, and does
not return some value from out of nowhere (or does it).
