Either that, or:

#!/bin/sh

elfsize=`readelf -h $1 | awk '
/Start of section headers:/ {secoff=$5}
/Size of section headers:/ {seclen=$5}
/Number of section headers:/ {seccnt=$5}
END { print seccnt*seclen+secoff; }
'`
filesize=`ls -l $1 | awk '{print $5}'`

strip -o $1.elf.striped $1
tail -c $[filesize-elfsize] $1 > $1.caml.striped
cat $1.elf.striped $1.caml.striped > $1.striped
chmod +x $1.striped

rm -f $1.elf.striped $1.caml.striped
