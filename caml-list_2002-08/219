The new pre-release of OCam'OLE is now available at :
http://tech.motion-twin.com/ocamole

Makefile have been rewritten and some bugs have been corrected in order to
support both bytecode and native code compilation mode.
...but compiling excel.ml with ocamlopt is causing a Stack Overflow ( a bug
report have been submited at the ocaml team ).

------

OCam'OLE enable you to control remote COM objects with OCaml and is provided
with OLEGen, a program that generate ML/MLI static type interface from the
OLE Type Libraries.

The current distribution include a sample that demonstrate the combined
usage of OCam'OLE and OLEGen to enable the creation and the control of an MS
Excel sheet in a few lines of OCaml code.
