If I may respectfully disagree ... ;0) I've developed a graphical app
for my wife that had to run under windows. I started using C and gtk,
and it was ok until I needed to free a list of widgets ... and was
hoping for a good old List.iter applied on an anonymous function. So I
switched to ocaml and lablgtk, and my program shrank by half (in LOC)
and the transition was not too painful. I must say I've never used
visual basic or other M$ tools, so I cannot compare the ease of
installation or development.
