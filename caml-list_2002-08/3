Hello,

You are a bit pessimistic. In France many people use Caml Light, and his
brother Ocaml, because it is taught in many school. 

So you have to add the number of people who are taught in college and
school about Ocaml.

Sylvain LE GALL
ps : just for Caml Light it is around 5000 per year ( number of people in 
MP/Informatique )
