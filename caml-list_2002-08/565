Eeek!

Please, let's not entertain any of the rampant stupidity that the W3C see=
ms so=20
mired in. I've always thought that the concept of using URIs for namespac=
es,=20
parameter settings, etc., was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I=
=20
mean, let's be honest here - HTTP is a network _protocol_, and it has not=
hing=20
to do with anything namespace or parameter related. The thing that really=
=20
irks me about the whole scheme is that most of the time these aren't even=
=20
_valid_ URIs (i.e., inaccessible).

I'm all for a hierarchical namespace that's not related to the filesystem=
 (In=20
Java it always ended up causing headaches for large projects - compilers =
that=20
"intelligently" put your compiled code in the correct package directory,=20
etc.). It seems that the question of segmenting libraries according to=20
directory should be a decision that's left up to the implementor, as it i=
s=20
currently.

All of this is, of course, my own opinion, so take it with the correspond=
ing=20
pinch of salt.
