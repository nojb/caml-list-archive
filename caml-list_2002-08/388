>From the FFTW web page <<http://www.fftw.org/download.html>>:

fftwgel
fftwgel <<http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/skral/fftwgel.html>> is an
experimental version of fftw with support for the SIMD instructions of
the AMD K6-2 and K7 processors as well as the Intel Pentium IV, written
by our colleague Stefan Kral at the Vienna University of Technology. We
hope to incorporate a generalization of this work into a future version
of FFTW. 

fftwgel has ocaml code for generating SIMD code for x86 machines.  Other
key words
are SWAR and Atlas.  Plus the intel and amd web pages have lots of info.
