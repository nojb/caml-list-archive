The issue isn't what is done in the real world, by companies that don't 
really know
how to develop a game, but what *ought* to be done.

It would be nice, for example, if a military game had some small 
resemblance to
actual warfare. Military units have intelligence. They operate with 
stranding orders
with some reason to believe the orders are effective. They move from 
point A to
point B with some kind of common sense.

Now look at the utterly abysmal routing in most military games,
the totally absurd actions units take, etc.

Sorry. The real world isn't a very good model: it's driven by greed,
not by a desire for quality.
