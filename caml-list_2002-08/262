Hi,
     I saw that this function has just been added to ocaml,
I think this is a good idea, but I am wondering why
the continuation function should return a string.
I wrote once, for my programs, a "kprintf-like" function
with _exactly_ the same code (there is not much difference between
sprintf and kprintf ;-), but I forced the type :

 mykprintf : (string -> 'b) -> ('a, string -> 'b, 'b) format -> 'a

and (as far as I know) there were no problems,

 mykprintf f fmt a1 .. an

seems to do the same thing (and have the same type) as

 f (mykprintf fmt a1 .. an)

whatever the return type of f is.

I saw a post in the list about "technical reasons",
could somebody be more precise ?

-Christophe
