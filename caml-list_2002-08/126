I'd want to remind that original subject was 'olegen' application. Being
compiled natively it _does not work_. The error is access violation, caused
by "The object invoked has disconnected from its clients". I believe this is
because of Released COM object is invoked from _another COM object_. In my
first post on this topic I had conjectured this was design flaw - binding
Release with finalize. The main reason was:  _one cannot guarantee_ that
there are not other references to COM object from another COM objects. May
be one can suppose, but cannot guarantee. If I'm wrong, we must follow X.
Leroy and try to find the error in ocamole.cpp. If I'm wrong again, why does
olegen not work???
