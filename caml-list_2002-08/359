 We have released a stable version of CIL. It consists of a complete C
parser (both for ANSI C and also the GCC and Microsoft Visual C extensions),
pretty-printer and an intermediate language that hides most of the dark
corners of the C language. This allows you for example to implement a
Stackguard instrumentation for your programs in about 80 lines of code and
apply it to ugly code such as the Linux kernel modules. CIL can impersonate
both the GCC and MSVC compilers allowing you to use your existing Makefiles
and can also merge your entire program into one source file for a quick
whole-program analysis. 

 CIL has been tested on many millions of lines of code, including the Linux
kernel and GIMP. 

 More information, a manual, ocamldoc API documentation and the distribution
can be found at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~necula/cil.
