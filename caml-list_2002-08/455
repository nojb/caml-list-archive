I wouldn't recommend that -- if I were the maintainer of "strip", I'd
scream at such a kludge :-)

Yes, a cleaner solution would be to embed the OCaml bytecode in a
special ELF section.  But there are two problems with this: 1- the ELF
file format is quite complex, and 2- this solution would break utterly
on non-ELF systems, e.g. Windows.

The current solution (just stick the bytecode at the end of the native
executable) is a hack, but it's a hack that works on *every single
platform* I've tested in the last 12 years...
