The source distribution (ocaml-3.05.tar.gz) is identical to the ocaml/
CVS subdirectory of camlcvs.inria.fr.  (Well, the CVS archive contains
some additional test files, but these are not part of the normal build
process.)

The user manual is not available via CVS, but you can get it from the
Caml Web site.

In summary: synchronizing your CVS copy (with cvs update -r ocaml305)
and building it is exactly equivalent to downloading and building
ocaml-3.05.tar.gz.
