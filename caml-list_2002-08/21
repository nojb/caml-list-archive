(My previous statement was prefixed by IMHO, as is the following.)

I agree with Damien that games are not real time.  As
for 'real-time' in quotes, games and real-time programs have 
initialization, finialization, and reconfiguration code that is
not 'real-time'.  This code can easily be more complex than 
the 'real-time' section.  Also, if you know that your 'real-time'
code will only allocate a finite amount of memory between these
sections, you can allocate in the 'real-time' section, but 
when you get back to a non-'real-time' section force a garbage 
collection, check to see that there is enough free memory to 
get you through to the next non-'real-time' section
and continue (or fail).  In short, pretty much what I would
do when doing it in C.

I think you are correct.  If I were faced with writting a game
I would certainly give it a go.
