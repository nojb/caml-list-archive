Code points: Note that PXP defaults to ISO-8859-1 as character set. Use
it in UTF-8 mode to get rid of these warnings.

Well, the inner entities are again expanded when an entity is expanded.
The correct way to define &amp; is

<!ENTITY amp "&#x26;#x26;">

i.e. no second &. At _definition_ time this gives "&#x26;" (the first
&#x26; is expanded), and at _use_ time you get finally &. With the wrong
definition you get && at definition time, and this is simply an illegal
character sequence.

PXP defines by default &amp; as "&#38;#38;" which is just the same in
decimal notation, and also recommended by the XML spec.

That W3C docs are erroneous is nothing new, although it is a bit
surprising that they cannot even stick to the basics of their own
formalism. I suppose they used a hacked SGML parser for developing
MathML, since SGML is more liberal about lexical details.
