For extra points, make sure they have to ensure that every error is
checked and every error path out of the function must free up all
resources that have been allocated ...

[I'm going to diss Ubuntu here ... you know where I'm coming from]

Ubuntu's OCaml support is very flaky.  They don't have developers
committed to it and take a random snapshot of what's in Debian.  This
has in the past led to serious brokenness where they've taken a
snaphot in the middle of a rebuild-the-world compiler upgrade.
Instead go with Debian (or Fedora) where there are developers making
sure you get a consistent, working OCaml.
