This is enough only if you assume that Ubuntu people just want to
"inherit" the Debian work. Sure this will be an improvement over the
current situation, but I frankly want more.

The needed steps IMO are:

0) identify who among the Ubuntu developers (core developers or MOTU, I
  don't care) is willing to maintain OCaml-related stuff

1) decide upon a collaboration infrastructure and use it for *both*
  Debian and Ubuntu
  
  My proposal on this is of course to reuse Debian's, as we already have
  a version control system and a mailing list, and we have already
  reached a critical mass. By experience, other mixed Debian/Ubuntu
  maintenance teams are using the Debian infrastructure and is working
  quite well for all of the involved people

2) coordinate releases, so that the OCaml toolchain is in shape when
  either of the distribution makes a release

3) total world domination


AFAIK we are still missing step 0.
