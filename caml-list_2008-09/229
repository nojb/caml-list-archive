My teaching asistant showed the students how to do this, but it was only 
partially successful, not to mention that this required extra 
configuration. _Any_ initial configuration is a big pain, even just 
putting a line in .emacs is a challenge ("Where is this file?", "How can 
it have just an extension and no name?", "Why is the extension longer 
than three letters", etc.)

I just spent 20 minutes trying to compile Cameleon and failed. I then 
installed the Ubuntu version which is completely broken (this is Ubuntu 
8.04), and even if it worked, I would not want to use it because it 
clearly suffers from the "the user will configure me" syndrome.
