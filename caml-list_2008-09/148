Hi,

First of all, thanks to all for your input -- it was much appreciated.

I second many people's opinion that XML -- though conceptually a good and
well-intentioned idea --- has devolved into a festering plague whose tentac=
les
have unfortunately spread all around the IT landscape.  I'm finding that th=
e
lispy alternative offered by Sexplib is much saner for most serialisation
and data exchange purposes, and that if you need human-readability than a
format like JSON is much friendlier.

Unfortunately, I have to deal with MathML because I am building a web
application (with Ocsigen) that allows users to enter mathematical expressi=
ons
in either TeX or MathML format.  To prevent cross-site scripting attacks,
I need to make sure the MathML provided by the user is valid and does not
contain any "funny stuff".

As for Xml-light, thanks for confirming that the problem I was having is
most likely do bugs in the library itself.  I was hoping Xml-light would be
able to do the job because it's a library you can grok and start using righ=
t
away, whereas PXP will require a more significant investment of time.  Btw,
Gerd, the problem I have is fairly boilerplate:  "here's a DTD and here's a
string with an XML document -- is the document valid according to the DTD?"=
,
perhaps you can add it as an example to the documentation?

Well, off to read the PXP manual!

Thanks for your time,
Dario Teixeira
