Subject: XML library for validating MathML

Hi,

Given a string containing a mathematical expression in the MathML
markup, I need to verify that the expression is indeed valid MathML.
I am therefore looking for an XML library that can verify an expression
against a given DTD.

Now, I have tried Xml-light, and the code I used is listed below.
Unfortunately, it fails when trying to parse MathML's DTD (it's the
standard DTD from the W3C).  I have tried simpler DTDs, and it does work
with them; am I therefore correct in assuming that Xml-light can only
handle a particular version/subset of DTD features?

let () =3D
        try
                let x =3D Xml.parse_file "file.xml" in
                let dtd =3D Dtd.parse_file "mathml.dtd" in
                let checked =3D Dtd.check dtd in
                let proven =3D Dtd.prove checked "math" x in
                print_endline (Xml.to_string proven)
        with
                Dtd.Parse_error exc -> print_endline (Dtd.parse_error exc)


There are of course other XML libraries for Ocaml and let's not forget Cduc=
e.
Can someone recommend one solution that is guaranteed to work with the
MathML DTD?  Note that I don't need to do much with the XML tree; pretty
much all I need is a boilerplate function that returns a boolean on whether
a string is valid or not.

Thanks in advance for your input!
Best regards,
Dario Teixeira
