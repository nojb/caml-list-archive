    ==========================================================
     JOURNAL OF ALGORITHMS IN COGNITION, INFORMATICS AND LOGIC
                    Special Issue on Unification
	
    http://www.score.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~mmarin/unif.html
    ==========================================================

SCOPE
-----
Unification is a fundamental process that occurs in several fields of computer science, including theorem proving, logic programming, natural language processing, computational complexity, and computability theory. It is also at the core of several type inference algorithms, and recent works in XML-oriented programming introduced new aspects of the unification process in the theory of regular expression and regular tree languages. Unification theory emerged from the abstraction of the specific applications of this process, and is concerned with general notions like instantiation, most general unifier, etc., their main properties, and with the identification and analysis of unification algorithms that can be used in several contexts.

This special issue of the Journal of Algorithms in Cognition, Information and Logic is devoted to the dissemination of the latest developments and results in unification. 

We are looking for contributions describing original and new ideas and results in unification and closely related fields. Topics of interest include:

* Unification
	E-unification 
	Unification Algorithms 
	Higher-Order Unification 
	String Unification 
	Context Unification 
	Combination problems 
	Disunification 
	Typed Unification
* Related Topics
	Constraint Solving 
	Matching 
	Narrowing
* Applications
	Type Checking and Type Inference 
	Automated Deduction 
	Rewriting 
	Functional and Logic Programming 
	Grammars 
	Computational Linguistics

Both participants of the UNIF 2008 workshop and other authors are invited to submit contributions. Submissions should be mature journal articles.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------
We expect full high-quality papers (typically, 20-30 pages) to describe original and previously unpublished contributions. Papers should be written in English, and not be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere (previous publication of partial results at workshops and conferences is acceptable). The normal reviewing process for journals will be used and papers should conform to usual journal standards.

Authors are strongly encouraged to use the LaTeX template files available at 
http://www.elsevier.com/framework_products/promis_misc/latexguidelinesonline.pdf
for manuscript preparation, and to use the EasyChair submission system 
    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jacilunif2009

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
* Paper submission: February 2, 2009
* Notification of acceptance/rejection: May 20, 2009
* Final version: September 14, 2009

GUEST EDITOR

ABOUT THE JOURNAL
-----------------
The Journal of Algorithms in Cognition, Informatics and Logic is a prestigious international journal published by Elsevier which aims at promoting the algorithmic research from all relevant sciences and fields of human endeavor. The subtitle "Cognition, Informatics, and Logic" emphasizes the intended breadth and interdisciplinary nature of the journal.
