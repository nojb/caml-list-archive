Thanks. Initially, I thought XML is an easy format - because it looks
easy. But the specs are really challenging - full of bad compromises,
and I would expect that a widely adopted standard has to undergo some
evaluation of its practicability before it is published. For instance,
there are very strict rules where whitespace has to be in XML, and where
it must not occur. E.g. <tag x="a"y="b"> is considered as illegal
because of the missing space between the attributes. The whitespace
rules make it practically impossible to use a yacc-generated parser (my
first attempt was ocamlyacc-based, and it sort of worked after
implementing lots of parsing tricks, but it was impossible to fix all
errors, although the XML grammar is quite short after all). There are
further complications in the XML standard, and after all, it is very
difficult to implement it even on the most basic level. So there are
many parsers now out there that do not do that, but rather implement a
subset because this is easier and parsing is faster.

There is much more to say about shortcomings in XML, or the XML
standardization process. It is now an unnecessary complicated
technology. I would advise everybody to use it only when there is no way
around it, e.g. for exchange of structured data between organizations.

I've got now a few hours of sponsorship for PXP. I'll try to improve the
documentation, because there are some parts that need more explanation
(where people feel it is over-engineered, but as Vincent pointed out,
it's the standard that demands it).
