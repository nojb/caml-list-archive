FWIW, Omnis has had this since the early 90's.

http://www.omnis.net/products/studio/index.html?detail=whyomnis

(I think that's the successor of the Omnis 5 and 7 that I used
back then.)

I can certainly vouch for the amazing utility of such debugging.
It is priceless! I didn't know Ocaml could do that.
