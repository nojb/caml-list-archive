My guess is that it would try to open mystdlib/Pervasives.cmo...

In other word it's as if you changed your "official" 
stdlib/Pervasives.cmo except that it's cleanier as you don't actually 
override it (which would change your Pervasives for all your projects).

I didn't try it though, so maybe I'm missing something.

Another way to automatically open your module would be to do a weird 
Makefile such as:

%.cmo: %.ml
     echo "open Myperv;;\n" > $*.temp.ml
     cat $*.ml >> $*.temp.ml
     ocamlc -c $*.temp.ml -o $*.cmo
     rm $*.temp.ml

Or you could do this using some Ocamlbuild plug-in, or just by using the 
-ocamlc option of Ocamlbuild...

Basically, just use any hack which can replace your ocamlc by a script 
which adds "open Myperv;;\n" before calling ocamlc ^^
