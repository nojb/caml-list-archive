For the record, in the working sources that will be released as 3.11,
I added the "no exec note" in assembly files for Linux/x86 and
Linux/AMD64, but no other platforms so far because I can't test on
them.  If someone with access to other Linux platforms is willing to
experiment and confirm that it works, let me know.  This said, the
configure trick above might do the job just as well.
