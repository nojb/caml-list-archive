After teaching OCaml for two years, I personally suggest
* Ubuntu + GODI
* Emacs + Emacs-goodies (slightly customised to obtain tabs, I can send
you my .emacs) + Tuareg -- (Emacs is much better than XEmacs, at least
for this -- and the tabs are a tremendous help)
* OcamlBuild with a myocamlbuild.ml written by you.

Cheers,
 David
