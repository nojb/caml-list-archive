Hi,

Ah, thanks, I'll look into that.  By the way, is there an
API reference for PXP?  I noticed you are not using Ocamldoc,
and I'm guessing the PXP manual is built from some sort of
literate programming tool.  Unfortunately, the manual is
quite large, and it can be difficult to navigate.

I'm sure floggings will be administered.  Anyway, thanks for
making the diagnostic on the problem!  I am happy to report
that once the isonum.ent file is fixed, PXP is able to validate
MathML documents against the official DTD.

Fixing the isonum.ent was simply a matter of applying Gerd's
correction to two lines, 28 and 66.  Here is the diff:

28c28

---
> <!ENTITY amp              "&#x26;#x00026;" ><!--=3Dampersand -->
