That's great, and thanks for your help!  However, it was not only what I
meant. Surely we, Debian-side, have a lot of work to be done and help is
always needed. Still, we need someone Ubuntu-side which coordinate with
us for their releases.

We are doing an excellent job in sharing patches with Fedora (thanks
mainly to Richard of course), it's kind of astonishing that we cannot
coordinate with Ubuntu. The main reason is of course that there is
currently no "Ubuntu OCaml Maintainers" group or something similar,
would you like to start organizing one?

You can start looking up all the bug reports against packages maintained
by debian-ocaml-maint@lists.debian.org, or other individual maintainers
of OCaml-related packages. Moreover, we have several pieces of great
OCaml softwares which are not packages while they should. We also have
some infrastructure pieces missing, if you are following the mailing
list I'm sure you are aware of some of them.

Cheers.
