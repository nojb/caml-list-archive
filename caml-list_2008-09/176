Jon,

The OSP Delimited Overloading project has an example which does a very
simple version of something similar to F# measures.  The relevant
example files can be viewed here:

https://forge.ocamlcore.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/trunk/examples/length/?root=pa-do

The underlying Length library code is based on a post by Richard
Jones' (http://camltastic.blogspot.com/2008/05/phantom-types.html) and
the syntactic sugar comes from the work done by the Delimited
Overloading folks.  It does not provide the very cool "x meters per
second times y seconds gives z meters" that the F# feature seems to
provide, but it does provide a start - meters + feet will throw a
compile-time error, for example.
