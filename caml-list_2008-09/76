Why would you want to unzip more than one .annot file during
interactive use?  If I query the type of some token foo in bar.ml I
only need to read from bar.annot.gz, not all the files in the project.
 The biggest .annot file I have lying around is from a 40KB source
file.  It's about 270KB before gzip, 30KB after.  According to "time"
it takes 0.009 seconds to gunzip on my MacBook Pro.  I'd say that's
plenty fast enough to be useful, even if your machine isn't quite as
snappy as mine.

I don't dispute that a more efficient encoding than gzip can be found,
but good luck convincing anybody at INRIA to work on it.  ;^)
