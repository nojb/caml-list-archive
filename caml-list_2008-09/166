This is true while your are concerned with matrix over the real or
complex numbers, but if you want to use arbitrary precision arithmetic,
finite fields, quaternions or any ring you like, then you are stuck.
Linear algebra is useful in every mathematical field, not just numerical
computing.

It is not ridiculous at all to code matrix routines in OCaml, since you
can use functors to use your routines with any kind of scalar, not just
complex numbers. And I already had to code dense matrix operations for
these reasons.

BTW, if anybody here knows presentations about matrix implementation(s),
I would be very glad to know about it.
