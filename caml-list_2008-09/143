X-Spam: no; 0.00; pxp:01 parsers:01 ocaml:01 pxp:01 gerd:01 parser:01 dtds:01 subset:01 beginner's:01 ocaml:01 bug:01 expat:98 engineered:98 1.0:98 ffff:98 

PXP is tough to work with and feels a bit crazy but it is good with
standards (It can sort out any DTD's I have ever thrown at it).
xml-light is, well, very broken (it doesn't even support charcode
switching). There are several XML parsers in OCaml and I've had a
stint with a few of them; the only two I would consider using are
expat and Pxp with a marked preference for the later. PXP can be very
confusing and feels over engineered at times but it does the job. And
remember parsing XML is a hard job, much harder than we often give it
credit for....

Hats off to Gerd for providing us with a proper parser.
