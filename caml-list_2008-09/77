Hello all,

It is my pleasure to announce a new release of Menhir, with the following
main improvements over previous versions:

  --table       Menhir now supports producing table-based LR automata, in
                the tradition of yacc, bison, and ocamlyacc. This makes
		the generated parsers up to 5x smaller, and somewhat slower.

  --interpret   Menhir can now be used not just as a compiler, but also as
                an interpreter. It will read sentences off the standard
		input channel, parse them as per your grammar, and report
		an outcome. This should help debug grammars.

These new features were implemented by Guillaume Bau, Raja Boujbel, and
François Pottier. We would like to gratefully acknowledge the generous support
of Jane Street Capital LLC, who funded this endeavor through an ocaml summer
project.

As usual, the new release is available either through GODI, or as source code
at the following URL.

Enjoy! Comments and bug reports are welcome.
