Why you need to have the legacy Pervasives around? You can remove it
and/or include what you need of it in your customized Pervasives, can't
you? That wouldn't violate your requirement of messing around with
ocamlc code, you would only do that with the standard library source
files.

You can use a shell script (or a real program) of your which first
invokes camlp4 as a filter and first feeds into it myprefix.ml and after
that the real file. More generally your custom program can combine
together a pipeline of any number of preprocessors.

Cheers.
