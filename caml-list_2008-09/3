Now I'm seeing this on the bottom of the first page: "This website is a 
wiki. This means you can edit any page to correct mistakes or improve the 
tutorial. Because of spammers signing up endless fake accounts, I have 
disabled new account creation. Please email rich on-the-annexia.org 
server for a new account."

I think it would be great if you could make this info visible on
http://ocaml-tutorial.org/_login

Thanks. It was primarily for someone (Gregoire Seux, cc'ed) who made a 
French translation of 2 pages and was asking me to put this into the 
wiki.

Cool. I very much appreciate the non-bloated design.
