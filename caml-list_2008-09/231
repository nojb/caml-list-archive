Depending on how flexible you are, nedit + shell might be a workable  
choice.  It is a clean, intuitive, but sufficiently powerful editor.   
Emacs always left me annoyed.

I use, on a daily basis, a small script which acts as a front-end to  
`make' and automatically points you to the error in the code in  
nedit, highlighting the characters that the ocaml compiler complains  
about.  It uses the existing nedit window if you have the file open  
already, or else opens it for you.  The script also works with gcc  
instead of ocaml, and (though I can't vouch for it much) gvim instead  
of nedit.  So my typical development environment consists of nedit  
and a shell in which I compile via the script.

If anyone is interested, I'd be happy to share this.

I guess the main question would be integrating the toplevel with  
nedit.  I imagine there are a number of ways to do this, depending on  
your needs.  You might be able to put something together using  
nedit's scripting language, or just do something entirely external to  
the editor.
