All identifiers have not a fully qualified path (think of y in
  let x =3D let y =3D ... in ...) and two identifiers may have the same
fully-qualified path. (e.g.: let x =3D 1;; let x =3D 2;;)

Would it be possible to have the location of the definition of all
identifiers, including the ones defined in another module (if there is
a .annot file for this module, of course) ?

A module containing the functions to read .annot files, so that
all developers using these files do not develop their own module.
