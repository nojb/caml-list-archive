X-Spam: no; 0.00; andrej:01 andrej:01 ocaml:01 ocaml:01 cygwin:01 toplevel:01 toplevel:01 emacs:01 ubuntu:98 experimental:01 xemacs:02 xemacs:02 confusing:02 face:97 languages:03 

Once again I am teaching a course on theory of programming languages in 
which we will use ocaml to implement mini-languages. And once again I 
face the question: which programming environment should we use?

I have so far tried to use (under Windows)
1. cygwin + ocaml + XEmacs
2. Eclipse + OcaIDE

The second solution worked better than the first, for the simple reason 
that XEmacs is a complete mystery to students. They really, really hate 
it. But even with the second soltion we had a lot of trouble, because 
Eclipse is really complicated, and OcaIDE is sort of experimental and 
not so good under Windows, so the whole setup was confusing and fragile.

The requirements are very simple:
1. easy access to toplevel (with line-editing)
2. editor which can send stuff to toplevel, points to errors in source 
code, and is not Emacs.

Any ideas what to do? We have dual-boot machines (Windows + Ubuntu).

Best regards,

Andrej
