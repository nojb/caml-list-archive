Hi,

Of course, I've already expressed my hope of incorporating it into the
official compiler to the dev team.

But I think it is not the right moment. I am sure it has some bugs and
many things to be improved. Hopefully in future, when things become
more stable and if the dev team is convinced.

Cheers,
Jun
