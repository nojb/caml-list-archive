Yup. I didn't write the details in the announcement; maybe I should have.

When a parser is produced using --table, it is not quite stand-alone: it
must be linked with a new library, called MenhirLib. (This is analogous
to ocaml's Parsing module, which is part of the standard library.)

If you are using ocamlfind, this is quite easy: just add "-package menhirLib"
to your ocamlc/ocamlopt flags (for compiling and for linking), and add
"-linkpkg" to your ocamlc/ocamlopt flags (for linking).

If you do not wish to rely on ocamlfind, then things become slightly more
complicated, since you must tell ocamlc/ocamlopt where MenhirLib is installed.
Fortunately, Menhir itself can help you: it has three new command-line
switches, of the form --suggest-*, which cause it to print suggested flags.
The details are in Menhir's reference manual. The sample Makefile
(demos/Makefile.shared) offers an illustration.

Hope this helps,
