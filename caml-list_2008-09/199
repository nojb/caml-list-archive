.cma files also contain extra linking directives like references to C 
libraries.

... or compiling other modules.

This is true.

.cmx files are needed when they contain modules compiled with -for-pack. 
Otherwise, they are optional. Hiding them to the compiler is a way to 
get fewer dependencies (more separate compilation).

Note that the .o extension is actually .obj for the MSVC ports under 
Windows.

(.lib for MSVC ports)

dlllibrary.so is also used by the bytecode interpreter, by Dynlink and 
by ocamlc (to check for the availability of C primitives at compile time).
