I think we should think outside the box here.

Make sure your OCaml has prerequisites that involve some shittier language
like C, which is taught in a Unix environment with xemacs.  Once the
students have seen how awful it can get and they associate the terrible
learning experience with C (what's with the lack of love for emacs anyway?
=/), then you come to the rescue.  :-D

Btw, I wouldn't try to use OCaml with Ubuntu, or *any* recent language that
has been in development.  Support is generally flaky.  The mainline OCaml
that comes with Ubuntu is fine, but the gl+gtk support is broken.  The
version of Eclipse that ships with Ubuntu is freaking ancient and won't
support the Scala plugin.  From what I remember, 8.0.4 also shipped with
some fossilized version of Scala itself.

Yes, we do all of this, but unfortunately ocamlbuild under Windows sucks because the trick with symbolic links to executables does not work. Has this been fixed yet? (Also, ocamlbuild assumes bash is in the path, also under Windows.)<br>
