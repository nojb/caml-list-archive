The OCaml compiler uses gcc in various stages (linking IIRC).  Also
needs an assembler.

You certainly need to read the license very carefully.

However is it necessary to embed the compiler?  Can you not just call
out to the compiler as a separate process?  It's surely easier to do
Sys.command, rather than working out the licensing and technical
issues involved in linking your program to the compiler.

ocamlopt -fPIC ... should be able to do it.

Or compile the code with ocamlc and use Dynlink.

Or wait for OCaml 3.11 which can use Dynlink on native code.
