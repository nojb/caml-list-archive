Well, I did :)
Technically, it fails because you have to name your new module
Pervasives and thus cause a conflict with the original Pervasives.

Yes, that's the kind of things I have in mind.
Unfortunately, it seems that ocamlc only supports one "-pp" tag. So if I
use a simple "-pp 'cat myprefix.ml'", I become incompatible with
Camlp4 :/

Any other idea?

Cheers,
 David
