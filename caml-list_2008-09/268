At work we only use the LTS releases, but on my laptop I switch to
every new Ubuntu release in the early beta stages.

I have had issues with with other software in some releases. My
favourite text editor was horribly broken in Gutsy and Edgy Eft
had so many problems I only stayed with it for a week.

Well I'm not an official Ubuntu developer, just someone who develops
on Ubuntu, but I have joined the Debian Ocaml Maintainers mailing list
and I'm even thinking of becoming an official Debian maintainer.
