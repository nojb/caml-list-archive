Yes it is possible, and yes I still do have admin rights (I should
hope, since I run the domain & servers :-)  Because of a huge amount of
spam I was forced to disable free account creation a few months ago.

I've sent an email invite to your current email address.  Anyone else
who has problems, please send me an email and include 'ocaml'
prominently in the subject line.

Also I hope this is of interest: I've picked up mod_caml & cocanwiki
development again for Fedora & RHEL, so I should have F10 packages for
them shortly, plus an active upstream.

Rich.
