=09=09=09  CALL FOR PAPERS!!!

=09=09 Eleventh International Symposium on
=09   Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages 2009
=09=09=09      (PADL '09)

=09=09    http://cs.utdallas.edu/padl09/

=09=09=09Savannah Georgia, USA
=09=09=09 January 19-20, 2008

=09=09     Co-located with ACM POPL'09

Declarative languages build on sound theoretical bases to provide
attractive frameworks for application development. These languages
have been successfully applied to vastly different real-world
situations, ranging from data base management to active networks to
software engineering to decision support systems.

New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new
application areas.  At the same time, applications of declarative
languages to novel problems raise numerous interesting research
issues. Well-known questions include designing for scalability,
language extensions for application deployment, and programming
environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and
implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress
as well.

PADL is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present original
work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for
all forms of declarative concepts, including, functional, logic,
constraints, etc. Topics of interest include:

 * innovative applications of declarative languages;
 * declarative domain-specific languages and applications;
 * practical applications of theoretical results;
 * new language developments & their impact on applications;
 * evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications;
 * novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom; and
 * practical experiences

PADL 09 welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to applications
and implementation of declarative languages.  PADL 09 will be
co-located with the ACM POPL.

IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

      Paper Submission:=09September 11 2008
      Notification:=09October 10, 2008
      Camera-ready:=09November 5, 2008
      Symposium:=09January 19-20, 2009

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper (written in
English) in Postscript (Level 2) or PDF, in the Springer LNCS format
(see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs/ ).

In addition to the technical papers of previous PADL conferences, PADL
09 will contain a streamk for application papers.

TECHNICAL PAPERS

Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished
results, and must not be simultaneously submitted for publication
elsewhere.  Each submission must be written in English, and include
three to four keywords, which will be used to assist us in selecting
appropriate reviewers for the paper.  Submissions must not exceed 15
pages in Springer LNCS format.

APPLICATION PAPERS

Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical
applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or
in areas of research other than computer science.  Application
papers will be published in the Springer-Verlag conference
proceedings, and will be presented in a separate poster session.

Application papers, are expected to describe complex and/or real-world
applications that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages.
Application descriptions, engineering solutions and real-world
experiences (both positive and negative) are solicited.

The limit for application papers is 3 pages in Springer LNCS format.

MOST PRACTICAL PAPER AWARD

The Most Practical Paper award will be given to the technical
submission that is judged by the program committee to be the best in
terms of practicality, originality, and clarity of presentation. The
program committee may choose not to make an award, or to make multiple
awards.
