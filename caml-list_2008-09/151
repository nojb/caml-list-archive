>From what I've heard, there's also an OCaml summer of code project
that enriched the info found in .annot files.  So, it's certainly time
to discuss extensions to .annot files, but let's do that globally, not
one at a time.  It is probably too late for inclusion in 3.11, but as
long as these extensions are backward compatible, inclusion in bugfix
releases can be considered.
