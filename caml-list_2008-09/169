Few things that hurt the eye:

Int32.of_string "[number]" is unnecessary, OCaml(not sure which version
this was introduced in though) can read various specific size ints
natively:

# 0n, 0l, 0L;;
- : nativeint * int32 * int64 = (0n, 0l, 0L)

Secondly `Printf.fprintf chnl "string"' looks rather expensive compared
to `output_string chnl "string"'.
