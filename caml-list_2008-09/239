I think I may have suggested this the last time, but is some sort of
bootable live CD / live USB key an option?  Our livecd-creator tool is
especially flexible: you could build a live CD / key which has all the
right packages installed and all the configuration files in the right
place and starts up the editor of your choice when they log in.

Persistence (of files in the project) is a problem but maybe they can
be encouraged to save project files to a network share or on to a USB
key.
