I have to apologize : i'm responsible for the problem here. I
originally uploaded the documentation on my website, wich is fine,
then preferred a "forge" location.
Seems ftp was not a choice that clever after all. I just modified the
link to put the external http link back.

(It is actually the plain ocamldoc-generated documentation, that you
can generate from the project sources using 'make doc')

Sorry for the disturbance.
