Hi Stéphane,

Thanks a lot for your information. And we'd like to know more about the 
OCaml library architectures, like on what situation dynamic libraries 
are used, and when static libraries are used, and so on.. Really 
appreciate if you could point me to a document that can help on this topic.

Regards,
Bill
