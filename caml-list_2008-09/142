I don't know about validation (i'll probably suggest looking at PXP tho),
but xml-light is very bad for XML compliance. the library is (happily) parsing
XML files that it shouldn't, which tell a lots concerning its validation
abilities ...

for example, the XML supported character range is not even checked:

Xml 1.0 specification -- 2.2 Characters

Char	   ::=   	#x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] |
		[#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF]

others problems include (uncomplete list):
- complete unicode un-awareness
- funny & wrong entities handling
