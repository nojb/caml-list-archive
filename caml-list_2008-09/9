The problem comes from the forge. I finish the configuration for the
homepage of projects. Now each projects has its own DNS name and
homepage.

Take a look at http://pa-do.forge.ocamlcore.org

You can do the same for batteries
http;//batteries.forge.ocamlcore.org 

You just have to upload the documentation file into 

/home/groups/batteries/htdocs/

and fix the homepage redirection (ask a batteries project
administrator). 

You should use "scp" to upload file into /home/groups/batteries/htdocs.
You could also build a whole website ;-)

This way you will have a real website (no more ftp around).
