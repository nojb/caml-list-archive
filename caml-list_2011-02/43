================================================================================


ABOUT SCOPES 2011

The influence of embedded systems is constantly growing. Increasingly powerful
and versatile devices are developed and put on the market at a fast pace. The
number of features is increasing, and so are the constraints on the systems
concerning size, performance, energy dissipation and timing predictability.
Since most systems today use a processor to execute an application program
rather than using dedicated hardware, the requirements can not be fulfilled by
hardware architects alone: Hardware and software have to work together to meet
the tight constraints put on modern devices.

One of the key characteristics of embedded software is that it heavily depends
on the underlying hardware. The reason of the dependency is that embedded
software needs to be designed in an application specific way. To reduce the
system design cost, e.g. code size, energy consumption etc., embedded software
needs to be optimized exploiting the characteristics of the underlying hardware.

SCOPES focuses on the software generation process for modern embedded systems.
Topics of interest include all aspects of the compilation process, starting with
suitable modeling and specification techniques and programming languages for
embedded systems. The emphasis of the workshop lies on code generation
techniques for embedded processors. The exploitation of specialized instruction
set characteristics is as important as the development of new optimizations for
embedded application domains. Cost criteria for the entire code generation
and optimization process include runtime, timing predictability, energy
dissipation, code size and others. Since today's embedded devices increasingly
consist of a multi-processor system-on-chip, the scope of this workshop
particularly covers compilation techniques for MPSoC architectures.

In addition, this workshop intends to put a spotlight on the interactions
between compilers and other components in the embedded system design process.
This includes compiler support for e.g. architecture exploration during HW/SW
codesign or interactions between operating systems and compilation techniques.
Finally, techniques for compiler aided profiling, measurement, debugging and
validation of embedded software are also covered by this workshop, because
stability of embedded software is mandatory.

SCOPES 2011 is the 14th workshop in a series of workshops initially called
"International Workshop on Code Generation for Embedded Processors". The
name SCOPES has been used since the 4th workshop. The scope of the workshop
remains software for embedded systems with emphasis on code generation
(compilers) for embedded processors. SCOPES will be held in cooperation with
ACM SIGBED and EDAA and is sponsored by ArtistDesign European NoE. SCOPES 2011
is co-located with the Map2MPSoC workshop.
