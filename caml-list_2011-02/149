It was produced using ocamlmklib:

ocamlmklib  -o  GL  GL.cmx  -framework OpenGL -lgl_stubs

The "gl_stubs" library is available in the glMLite directory, and does not seem to be the problem.

(I just read your other message, and it helped a bit.)

The strange thing is that, if I now compile by doing a "-noautolink" and re-adding the exact same library (-cclib "-framework OpenGL"), I get further (with other errors). So it seems that doing "ocamlmklib" with a framework doesn't work, but also prevents specifying the same framework later on on the command line.

Thanks for your help!

Alan
