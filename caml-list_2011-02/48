Subject: [Caml-list] Scoped Bound Resource Management just for C++?

One of the benefits, in my opinion, of C++ is SBRM.  You can reason  
about the lifetime of an object and have an give yourself guarantees  
about its clean up.  The method of initialization and clean up are  
also consistent for every object in the language.

My questions are:
1) Do other people in the FP world consider this to be a good strategy?
2) Can this be done in a sane way in a GCd language?
3) What are the alternatives in a language like Ocaml?

Thanks!
