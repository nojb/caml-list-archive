Subject: [Caml-list] Changing toplevel options from the toplevel

Hello!

The toplevel uses a bool reference named recursive_types from the
Clflags module. I'd like to know how I could set this flag to true
from within the toplevel instead of the command line (because I'd like
to force this option on so that my custom toplevel could work even if
not run with the proper command line).
