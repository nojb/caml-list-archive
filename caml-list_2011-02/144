Subject: [Caml-list] Call for participation: HotSWUp III

[Many functional languages support some form of dynamic upgrade, e.g., Erlang,
and researchers have used OCaml as a testbed for this sort of work.  We have
a couple of papers that consider semantic issues using functional language
techniques.

HotSWUp 2011: Third Workshop on Hot Topics in Software Upgrades

                        Hannover, Germany
                         April 16, 2011

                    http://www.hotswup.org/2011

                    co-located with ICDE 2011

OBJECTIVES

Actively-used software systems are upgraded regularly to incorporate
bug fixes and security patches or to keep up with the evolving
requirements. Whether upgrades are applied offline or online, they
significantly impact the system's performance and reliability.
Commercial products aiming to address some of these issues are 
starting to appear; however, recent studies and a large body of anecdotal
evidence suggest that upgrades remain failure-prone, tedious, and
expensive.

The goal of the HotSWUp Workshop is to identify, promote, and
disseminate cutting-edge research for supporting software system
upgrades that are flexible, efficient, robust, and easy to specify and
apply.  Many diverse research areas are concerned with building large,
evolving, highly-available systems.  By seeking contributions from
both academic researchers and industry practitioners, HotSWUp aims to
combine novel ideas with experience from upgrading real systems.


PROGRAM

Invited Talk:

Phil Bernstein, Microsoft Research. Schema and Mapping Evolution in an
Object-Relational Mapper

ABSTRACT: Schema evolution is an unavoidable consequence of the
application development lifecycle. In a database application, the
conceptual model, the persistent database model, and the mapping
specification between them must co-evolve so they are always mutually
consistent and can compile into executable code. We study scenarios
where the conceptual model changes and the database and mapping must
evolve in kind, in the context of Microsoft's ADO.NET Entity
Framework. We present two new techniques that, in most cases, allow
those evolutions to progress automatically. The first technique treats
the mapping as data, mines it for mapping patterns such as
table-per-hierarchy or table-per-type, and automatically derives
proper store and mapping changes that are consistent with the
pattern. The second technique incrementally compiles the mapping
specification into executable views, thereby avoiding the expense of a
recompiling the entire mapping specification. Together, the techniques
enable a developer to modify the conceptual model and let the system
do the rest.
