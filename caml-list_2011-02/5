Subject: [Caml-list] Example iPhone apps in OCaml

For anyone interested in writing iPhone apps in OCaml, I've
written up two examples.  You can get the sources and build
instructions here:

   http://psellos.com/ocaml/example-app-portland.html
   http://psellos.com/ocaml/example-app-slide24.html

The first is very simple, just to test the basic compiling,
linking and packaging.  When you run it, it shows you which side
of your iPhone is facing up.

The second implements the 5 x 5 sliding tile puzzle.  If you're
pressed for time it will solve the puzzle for you using the A*
heuristic search algorithm, then animate the solution.

Hopefully they'll be useful to some fellow OCaml/iPhone coders.
I'm very happy to receive comments, questions, and corrections.

Regards,

Jeffrey Scofield
