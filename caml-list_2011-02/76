True, but I think Lauri complains about a slightly different issue, namely
sharing inconsistencies between a _single_ marshalled value and the program
environment. Or in other words, that the language does not actually define
what it means to be "_within_ a serialized values", nor implements it
consistently.

There are obvious ways in which this could be made coherent, but they are
likely to be difficult to implement as an afterthought.

He he. That sounds like an entirely un-MLish kind of argument. The language
has undefined and incoherent semantics? Of course, it's the programmer's
mistake to expect otherwise! ;)
