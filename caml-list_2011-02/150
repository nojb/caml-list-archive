Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Specifying a framework to link with using ocamlopt?

Try including -verbose in your ocamlopt switches - this will display the calls to all external programs and you'll be able to verify that "-framework OpenGL" is indeed being passed to the linker (it should be, though).

The "-verbose" option is very interesting indeed! It tells me the "-framework OpenGL" and "-framework GLUT" specified in the ocamlmklib are indeed taken into account. But for some reason, there are extra (spurious) -lGL, -lGlut, and -lGlu.

These libraries are generated this way:
ocamlmklib  -o  GL  GL.cmx  -framework OpenGL -lgl_stubs
ocamlmklib -o Glu  Glu.cmx  -framework OpenGL
ocamlmklib  -o  Glut  Glut.cmx  -framework GLUT

which do not contain such linking primitives.

Could this be related to this warning:
ld: warning: -read_only_relocs cannot be used with x86_64
?

Thanks,

Alan
