                        COORDINATION 2011

 13th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope

COORDINATION is the premier forum for publishing research results and
experience reports on software technologies for collaboration and
coordination in concurrent and distributed systems. Its distinctive
feature is the emphasis on high-level abstractions that capture
interaction patterns manifest at all levels of the software
architecture and extending into the realm of the end-user
domain. Social networking, Internet technologies, wireless
communication, and inexpensive multicore processors altered
fundamentally the computing milieu and the way one thinks about the
development of modern software systems. Coordination techniques seek
to enhance our ability to develop software that is responsive to
emerging societal demands and changing application needs and exploits
effectively recent advances in computing and communication technology.

Coordination 2011 seeks high-quality contributions on the usage,
study, design and implementation of languages, models and techniques
for coordination in distributed, concurrent, and multicore software
systems. The focus is on languages, formalisms, models, middleware,
patterns, and algorithms that conceptually separate behavior from
interaction. Research results should demonstrate an ability to
increase modularity, simplify reasoning, and ultimately enhance the
software development process. The conference is concerned with the
design and implementation of models that allow compositional
construction of large-scale concurrent and distributed systems. Both
practical and foundational perspectives are of interest.

Given the increasing importance of concurrency and distribution in
almost every domain of our existence, the organizers of Coordination
2011 are keen to provide a forum for studies that address practical
concerns and industrial grade solutions, e.g., the introduction of
concurrency and distribution concepts to novel domains, comparative
evaluations of programming models on important problems, and the
adoption of domain-specific languages. Experience reports should
describe lessons learned from the application of proposed models and
techniques to problems in the real world. Coordination 2011 also seeks
proposals for discussion panels. Proposed topics are expected to
address new and exciting subjects that challenge fundamental
assumptions or open new directions for creative and high-impact
research.

                            DAIS 2011

               11th IFIP International Conference on
         Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Scope

Distributed application technology has become a foundation of the
information society. Novel computing and communication technologies
have brought a multitude of challenging application areas, including
mobile computing, ubiquitous services, service-oriented architectures,
autonomous and self-adapting systems, cloud computing, peer-to-peer
systems, or social networks, just to name a few. New challenges
include the need for novel abstractions supporting the development,
deployment, management and interoperability of evolutionary and
complex applications and services. Therefore, middleware technology
that bridges applications, platforms and users through
multi-disciplinary user requirements (like security, privacy,
usability, efficiency, safety, semantic and pragmatic interoperability
of data and services, dependability, trust and self-adaptivity) also
become of special interest. It is envisaged that future complex
applications will far exceed those of today in terms of such
requirements.

The DAIS conference series addresses all aspects of distributed
applications, including their design, implementation and operation,
supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering methodologies
and tools, as well as experimental studies and practice reports. This
time we particularly welcome in contributions on architectures,
platforms, and infrastructures for large scale distributed
applications and services.

DAIS'11 is the 11th event in a series of successful international
conferences started in 1997. It will provide a forum for researchers,
application and platform service vendors, and users, to discuss and
learn about new approaches, trends, concepts and experiences in the
fields of distributed computing.
