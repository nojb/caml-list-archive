Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml standard library license - LGPLv2+?

I am working on updating Batteries Included to be more compatible with
the standard library changes in OCaml 3.12, and was looking to copy a
bit of standard library code (from the Map module) into Batteries to aid
with this process. So, prior to doing so, I double-checked licensing to
make sure copying looked OK, and discovered a little issue.

The OCaml standard library is licensed Version 2 of the LGPL. Batteries,
and the code inherited from Extlib, are under Version 2.1 or Later
(LGPLv2.1+). Would it be possible to get the OCaml standard library
license updated to explicitly allow relicensing under at least 2.1
(which only changed the name from Library GPL to Lesser GPL) and
possibly all later versions? In general, it's just a matter of stating
that it's licensed under "Version 2 (or, at your option, any later
version)", but the link exception might need a bit of work to make sure
that it holds up when code is relicensed under version 3. No revision
should be necessary if the version is just changed to 2.1.

Thanks,
- Michael
