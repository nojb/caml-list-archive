             3rd IEEE International Workshop on
                Component-Based Design of
              Resource-Constrained Systems
                      CORCS 2011

     http://compsac.cs.iastate.edu/workshop_details.php?id=34&y


         Munich, Germany, July 18th – July 22nd, 2011
              in conjunction with COMPSAC 2011

              http://compsac.cs.iastate.edu/

..........................................................

Aims and Scope
--------------
The aim of this workshop is to discuss but also advance the
state-of-the-art, research and development in the area of resource
aware systems, and to promote the study of both fundamental
and practical aspects of component based design of such systems.
Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings of
COMPSAC 2011, by the IEEE Computer Society Press.

Any submission whose content is relevant to the area of resource
aware system design will be considered, but submission
whose subject matter is related to one of the following topics will
be particularly welcome:

* Modeling and Specifying Resource-aware Systems
   - models for software components and component interaction: 
real-time, safety-critical, embedded, or mobile systems
   - specification of extra-functional properties of components
resource models
   - service-oriented architectures

* Analysis Techniques
   - formal techniques for verification and validation of component 
software: model-checking, abstraction, refinement, code synthesis, 
testing, monitoring, debugging, model extraction
   - compositional theories
   - componentization of legacy code
   - certification of components and software architectures
   - resource-usage impact on quality of service (QoS) attributes

* Platform-aware Design
   - run-time mechanisms and middleware
   - scheduling and resource management
   - component-driven hardware-software co-design

* Tools and Case-studies
   - applications, experience reports and case studies in component software
   - tools for resource-constrained system development

Important Dates:
----------------
* March 15th, 2011  : EXTENDED Deadline for paper submission
* April 15th, 2011 : Notification of acceptance/rejection
* April 30th, 2011 : Camera-ready due

Paper Submission:
-----------------
Papers must be submitted electronically via the CORCS 2011 Submission 
Page (http://rs-1.cs.iastate.edu/CORCS2011/). The format of submitted 
papers should follow the guidelines for the IEEE conference proceedings. 
All papers will be carefully reviewed by at least three reviewers. 
Papers should be no more than 6 pages. Accepted papers will be published 
by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
