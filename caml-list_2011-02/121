Which sources?

What command have you run to get this error?

Are you compiling OCaml from sources or using a pre-packaged version (and if so, which version of OCaml and which port). It's odd that you're referring to Windows 7 + MinGW - if you're building for the MS toolchain, then you should be using Cygwin but I wonder if that's just that you've called it by the wrong name (equally, I've got a feeling that building with MSYS now works, but I think that compiling under Cygwin is still the "official" method).

I haven't done an MS toolchain build of OCaml for a while, but I'm reasonably sure that when I last used it, the Windows Server 2008 SDK contains both the 32 and 64 bit assembler (no need to download masm separately any more for 32 bit builds).
