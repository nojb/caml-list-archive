Yes, I tried this initially, having found this into the lwt top level.
Actually, there is many way to replace stdin by something else. My
main concern is for stdout, which appears explicitly in the code for the
toplevel directives.

Calling the evaluator is the only way I've found to prevent the toplevel from
writing into stdout (apart from manipulations of the file descriptors themself,
which are error prone since ncurses also insist on writing on file descriptor
1).

The application is not loaded as a cmo nor as a cma, but linked into
a custom toplevel with mktoplevel, so I'm unsure if this remark applies.

I will have a look to this one, thank you!
