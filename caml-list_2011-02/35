Subject: [Caml-list] SLE 2011: 2nd Call for papers

============================================================

              2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

                      SLE 2011
4th International Conference on Software Language Engineering

            Braga, Portugal, 3-6 July 2011

            http://planet-sl.org/sle2011/

      Co-located with the 4th Summer School on Generative and
  Transformational Techniques in Software Engineering
                      (GTTSE 2011)

=============================================================

IMPORTANT DATES

* 2011:
Paper submission: April 08 (midnight Apia Samoa time)
Author notification: May 13
Paper submission for online proceedings: June 17
Conference: July 03-06
Camera-ready copy submission for post-proceedings: August 29

---------------------------------------------------------

Software language engineering is devoted to topics related
to artificial languages in software engineering. The foremost
mission of the International Conference on Software Language
Engineering (SLE) is to encourage and organize communication
between communities that traditionally have looked at soft-
ware languages from different, more specialized, and yet
complementary perspectives. Thus, technologies, methods,
experiments and case studies from modelware, grammarware,
and ontologyware serving the objectives of software languages
are of particular relevance to SLE.

We invite high-quality submissions to all conference tracks.
Submissions must be PDF files following the Springer LNCS
style and will be managed using the EasyChair submission system.
Please check the conference web site for further information.

SLE 2011 will include a Doctoral Symposium that will provide a
supportive yet questioning setting in which PhD students can
present their work, including goals, methods, and preliminary
results. The Symposium aims to provide students with useful
guidance and feedback on various aspects of their research from
established researchers and the other student attendees.

Please forward this call to anyone who might be interested.

---------------------------------------------------------
PAPER SUBMISSION

Submitted papers must be original work and must not be
previously published in, currently submitted to, or currently
in consideration for any journal, book, conference, or
workshop. Each submitted paper will be reviewed closely by
at least three members of the program committee. Accepted
papers will be distributed at the conference via the online
proceedings as well as published in the post-proceedings,
which will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) series. Authors will have the opportunity
to revise their accepted paper(s) for the pre- and post-
proceedings. For an accepted paper to appear in the proceedings,
at least one author must attend the event and present the work.

---------------------------------------------------------
RESEARCH PAPERS

Research papers should report a substantial research contribution
to SLE and/or a successful application of SLE techniques.  We
solicit high-quality contributions in the area of SLE ranging
from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques,
and frameworks that support the aforementioned lifecycle activities.
We list examples of tools, techniques, applications, and problems of
interest to clarify the types of contributes that we seek:

* Formalisms used in designing and specifying languages and
tools that analyze such language descriptions
* Language implementation techniques
* Program and model transformation tools
* Composition, integration, and mapping tools for managing
different aspects of software languages or different
manifestations of a given language
* Transformations and transformation languages between
languages and models
* Language evolution
* Approaches to elicitation, specification, or verification
of requirements for software languages
* Language development frameworks, methodologies, techniques,
best practices, and tools for the broader language lifecycle
covering phases such as analysis, testing , and documentation.
* Design challenges in SLE
* Applications of languages including innovative domain-specific
languages or "little" languages

The preceding list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.  Visit
the conference web site for more information about the scope
and topics of interest of SLE, or contact the program co-chairs
with questions.

Page limit: 20

---------------------------------------------------------
SHORT PAPERS

Short papers may describe interesting or thought-provoking
concepts that are not yet fully developed or evaluated, make
an initial contribution to challenging research issues in SLE,
or discuss and analyze controversial issues in the field.

Page limit: 10

---------------------------------------------------------
TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS

Because of SLE's ample interest in tools, we seek papers
that present software tools related to the field of SLE.
These papers will accompany a tool demonstration to be given
at the conference. The selection criteria include the
originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, the relevance
of the tool to SLE, and the maturity of the tool. Submissions
may also include an appendix (that will not be published)
containing additional screen-shots and discussion of
the proposed demonstration.

Page limit: 10

---------------------------------------------------------
MINI-TUTORIAL PAPERS

SLE is composed of various research areas, such as grammarware,
modelware, language schemas, and semantic technologies. The
cross product of attendees at SLE creates a situation where
the contribution from one session may be difficult to
understand by those not initiated to the area. To help unite
the various communities of SLE 2011, we solicit mini-tutorials
that provide discussion points for mapping common ideas between
related and complementary research topics of SLE.

A mini-tutorial submission should be between 15 and 20 pages.

---------------------------------------------------------
DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM

The Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for both early and late-stage
PhD students to present their research and get detailed feedback and
advice from researchers both in and out of their particular research
area.  Submissions are invited from PhD students working on any topic
that falls within the SLE conference remit. Submissions consist of two
parts, a research abstract and a letter of recommendation from the
student's supervisor.  See the upcoming Doctoral Symposium call for
submissions for full details. Participants will also be invited to
present a poster on their research as part of the conference poster
session.
