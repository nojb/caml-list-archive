If this project is undertaken, then IMO the prospective student should
also consult the Batteries and Extlib UTF8 modules, mostly based on
Camomile's UTF8, so that new UTF8-specific functions are not needlessly
incompatible with code written against Batteries, Extlib, or Camomile. 
This shouldn't be very difficult - Extlib and Batteries basically
simplify and extend Camomile for UTF-8 handling - but should still be
considered.
