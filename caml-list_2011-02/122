Sorry I wasn't being precise.
The error is code independent, I tested ocamlopt on a "helloworld program".
I am not using cygwin because I am trying to produce binaries which do not
require cygwin to launch and I understand that there is a particular dll
that is required to execute cygwin based compilation (correct?).

I am using ocaml-3.11.0-win-msvc.exe that I downloaded from the web site
(the gui and byte code generator work just fine).

Stuff I did (probably wrongly):

- install ocaml-3.11 using the installer
- install MinGW Shell
- MASM32 editor (for ml.exe)
- flexdll (for flexlib)
- and microsoft SDK (for uuid.lib)

The result is a code that compiles just fine until the linking step where I
get this weird error.

These steps I got from an old thread (2004) here:
http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/fddaa68b3f497ec2

I was not able to find more recent instructions.
