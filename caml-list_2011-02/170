Actually you can, you just have to make sure that .cmi files are
available in the search paths of the toplevel when you run your
application.

Why not use Topdirs.dir_load with a custom formatter ?

If you are interested, i started some time ago an emacs-like editor
which can run in both curses and gtk mode and which integrates a
toplevel. I add to face the same problems. I solved them by using
Toploop.execute_phrase directly and redefining all directives.

The code is available here:

  http://solaria.dimino.org/cgi-bin/darcsweb.cgi?r=peps;a=summary

The file that may interest you is src/core/peps_top.ml

Also another problem i had is that Toploop.execute_phrase does not
prints errors on the given formatter but raises an exception instead,
and the printer used in Toploop.loop (Errors.report_error) is in the
module Errors for which the cmi is not available. I used a hack which
consists on parsing the output of Toploop.use_silently (file
peps_top.ml, function eval_command).
