Subject: [Caml-list] Specifying a framework to link with using ocamlopt?

Hello,

I'm trying to compile a simple program using glMLite, and I cannot seem to find a way to tell ocamlopt to use the OS X framework I specify.

If I don't say anything, I get (an expected) error:

[:)][top] % ocamlopt -I +glMLite GL.cmxa Glut.cmxa triangle.ml  -o triangle.exe
ld: library not found for -lGL
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
File "caml_startup", line 1, characters 0-1:
Error: Error during linking

If I try to tell the linker where the library is, I still get the same error:

[:(][top] % ocamlopt -cclib "-framework OpenGL" -I +glMLite GL.cmxa Glut.cmxa triangle.ml  -o triangle.exe
ld: library not found for -lGL
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
File "caml_startup", line 1, characters 0-1:
Error: Error during linking

In fact, it seems the "-framework" option is simply ignored:

[:(][top] % ocamlopt -cclib "-framework FOOBAR" -I +glMLite GL.cmxa Glut.cmxa triangle.ml  -o triangle.exe
ld: library not found for -lGL
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
File "caml_startup", line 1, characters 0-1:
Error: Error during linking
 
(and no, there is no FOOBAR framework on my system, I checked ;-) ).

I feel like I'm missing something obvious here ... Is there a way to specify a Framework to link against using ocamlopt?

Thanks,

Alan
