Native dynlink of 32-bit is unsupported in Snow Leopard.
Apple simply removed the support for the necessary option
in the linker when transitioning from Leopard to Snow Leopard.

As far as I know, and I have played with these options quite

but you are likely to get a compiler that silently produces
binaries that don't work.
