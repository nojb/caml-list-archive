Subject: [Caml-list] LablGLES for Android

For those interested in using OpenGL ES from OCaml, I've just made a
small update to my LablGLES patches so that they compile and link under
the NDK on Android.  Thanks to Paul Snively for contributing the Android
modifications.

Instructions for downloading and building LablGLES are here:

    http://psellos.com/ocaml/lablgles-build.html

Glossary:

LablGL is an OCaml interface to OpenGL, created by Jacques Garrigue and
others.

LablGLES is a set of patches that change LablGL into an interface to
OpenGLES rather than OpenGL.

OpenGLES is a subset of OpenGL intended for embedded use (in cell phones
and the like).  Notably, it is supported by iPhone, iPad, and Android
devices.
