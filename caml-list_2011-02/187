I am not a GSoC insider, but projects for GSoC can perfectly be about
extending an already existing projects. We even decided to focus on
ideas that extend existing project for OCaml's GSoC. The point is that
it is more likely that a new project started during GSoC stop being
developped right after GSoC, whereas an already existing project has a
chance to live further...
