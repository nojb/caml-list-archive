THE REGISTRATION IS OPEN!
=====================================


SCOPE OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL

The Central-European Functional Programming School is an
intensive summer school in the field of functional programming.
The invited lecturers are the most prominent researchers in the
field in Europe, and they will present state-of-the-art functional
programming techniques:

* Andrew Butterfield (University of Dublin, Ireland): Reasoning about
I/O in functional programs
* Clemens Grelck (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands): Multicore
SAC
* Johan Jeuring (Utrecht University, The Netherlands): Strategies for
learning functional programming
* Rita Loogen (Philipps University Marburg, Germany): Eden
* Simon Marlow (Microsoft Research, United Kingdom): Distributed Haskell
* Greg Michaelson (Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh, Scotland): Box
Calculus
* Rinus Plasmeijer (Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands):
Defining distributed GUI applications with iTasks
* Kostis Sagonas (University of Athens, Greece): Multicore Erlang
* Mary Sheeran (Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden): Feldspar:
Implementation and Application

AIMS OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL

The main goal of the summer school is to bring together computer
scientists, researchers, graduate and PhD students.

The programme of the summer school includes:

* In depth lectures about a selected number of recently emerged
advanced functional programming techniques, taught by experts in
the field.

* Practical exercises accompanying the lectures to be solved by the
students at the school. These exercises guide the students'
learning to a great extent. A high quality lab is available at the
school site.

* Team work is stimulated, such that the students can also learn
from each other.

* Forum for PhD students.

The CEFP school provides a forum for PhD students to present their
research results as part of the workshop programme. Abstract
submission is before the summer school, full paper version
after the summer school. Selected and reviewed papers will be
published in the LNCS Volume of the revised lectures.

*** IMPORTANT: THE DEADLINE FOR THE ABSTRACTS IS APRIL 30, 2011 ***

LOCATION

The event is organized and hosted by the Department of Programming
Languages and Compilers, Faculty of Informatics, Eötvös Loránd
University, Budapest, Hungary.
Budapest is the capital of Hungary with nearly 2.000.000
inhabitants. It is divided into two parts by the river Danube. There
are nine bridges over the river which connect the two sides. The
most beautiful ones are Chain Bridge (Lánchíd), Elisabeth Bridge
(Erzsébet híd) and Liberty Bridge (Szabadság híd).
One of the best places to walk around is the Castle District. There
is a breath-taking view of the city from the Fisherman's
Bastion. Across from the Fisherman's Bastion is Matthias Church
named after the Hungarian King Matthias. In the Castle District you
can find the Sándor Palace, the residence and workplace of the
Head of the State.
Budapest is richly endowed with natural springs of thermal waters
possessing various medicinal properties (Gellért Baths and Hotel,
Széchenyi Baths, Lukács Medicinal Baths etc.).
The largest building in the country is the building of the Hungarian
Parliament, which is situated on the bank of the Danube. The
Neo-Gothic building complex was built between 1884 and 1904
according to the plans of Imre Steindl.
There are many other sights in Budapest, just like Heroes’ Square,
St. Stephen’s Basilica, Andrássy Avenue, Margaret-island, Gellért
Hill and the Citadell etc.
