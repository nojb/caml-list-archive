Subject: [Caml-list] [Announce] Marionnet 0.90.6

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

After an intense development period, today we are happy to officially
announce Marionnet 0.90.6, the first public release in the stable
0.90.x series.

Marionnet is a virtual network laboratory: it allows users to define,
configure and run complex computer networks without any need for
physical setup.  Only a single, possibly even non-networked GNU/Linux
host machine is required to simulate a whole Ethernet network complete
with computers, routers, hubs, switches, cables, and more.  Support is
also provided for integrating the virtual network with the physical
host network.

Highlights from this new release series include internationalization
support, improved interface, the new 'gateway' component to connect to
the host network, VLAN support, better security, greatly simplified
installation and configuration, improved performance, and many bug
fixes.

Marionnet has been developed as an e-learning project with the
contribution of the Paris 13 University and the University Institute
for Technology of Villetaneuse.
Marionnet is already being employed with success for teaching networks
and system administration by the higher education institutions above
plus others all around the world.  The friendly, internationalized Gtk
interface makes Marionnet suitable to inexperienced students, but the
application is also useful for network administrators testing complex
deployments.

We are proud of the international scope of our effort, so nicely
symbolized by the contribution of translations we have already
received from users; we hope that this work will become even more
global in the future.

The Marionnet engine is a heavily concurrent OCaml application using
CamlP4 and C bindings, written in an experimental style slowly
converging to functional reactive programming in OCaml.

Marionnet works on GNU/Linux x86 and x86_64 machines, and relies on

User-Mode Linux by Jeff Dike and Virtual Distributed Ethernet by Renzo
Davoli.

Marionnet is free software, released under the GNU GPL: you are
welcome to share and change it under certain conditions.  See the
license text for details.

You can download Marionnet from our website http://www.marionnet.org .

Thanks,
