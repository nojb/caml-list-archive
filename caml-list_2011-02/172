Subject: [Caml-list] GSoC: better UTF-8 support

Hi,

Starting from an idea on the Ocsigen mailing list, it was suggested
that better support for UTF-8 in the tools would be of interest to
several people.  In particular, the following points were identified:

- A flag (-utf8 ?) to the compilers should be added so that errors
  locations are correct in presence of UTF-8 strings [the programmer
  restricting himself to ASCII identifiers].

- ocamldoc: while an UTF-8 aware doc-generator is very easy to write,
  it would be nice to be able to parametrize any of them with the
  correct charset (using again the -utf8 flag ?)

- UTF8.Char and UTF8.String modules should be written with the same
  interface as Char and String.  [Camomile should be adapted
  consequently.]

- Printf/Scanf: %U of %cu for UTF8.Char.t

- Graphics: UTF-8 text printing

- Str: (character ranges)

The questions are: would such changes be beneficial to you?  Are there
other issues to address?  Is this enough for a GSoc proposal (seems a
little light to me)?  If it is done, is there a chance to have this
work included in the standard distribution?

Best,
C.
