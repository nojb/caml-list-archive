Hello Paolo,

I always fear "templates page compiler", because most of the time
people tend to re-invent their own language rather than using existing
one, like OCaml. Is OCaml used as template language for Ex-nunc?

Could you show us the source code of the demo page?

Do you plan to use existing code on SQL frameworks?

I don't want to join the development team but I'm certainly interested
to see if Ex-nunc fits my needs.

Best wishes,
david
