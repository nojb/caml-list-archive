It seems interesting, but ...  I downloaded the tarball and looked at
the examples and I can't tell: can XStream transform an XML file into
something else?

In particular we have a requirement to convert a huge XML file into
tabular CSV data on the fly (while the XML is being downloaded).  The
XML file just consists of a very large number of <row>...</row>
records.
