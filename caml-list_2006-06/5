Much like 3.09.01, 3.09.02 does not build properly for me... the build 
instructionss from README.win32 are followed, no errors seem to be 
issued, but at the end of all four makes, there are NO *.opt.exe files 
present in OCaml's bin subdirectory - everything else that is supposed 
to be there seems to be.

I am using the full Cygwin install with MSVC .NET 2003 (C/C++ 7.1), 
and so am following the instructions for building given in "The native 
Win32 port built with Microsoft Visual C" - and THAT is where the 
problem is.

Purely by chance, I happened to notice that at the end of the "The 
native Win32 port built with Mingw" section there is an additional 
build step listed: "make -f Makefile.nt opt.opt".  Note that without 
being particularly attuned to the team's use of the "opt.opt" 
nomenclature, one *might* expect that a target called "opt" would do 
the job.

And so, there are NOT *four* makes, but *five*, which explains the 
problem... note that this doc error only [finally] came to light 
because of the ongoing absence of Windows binary builds. ;)
