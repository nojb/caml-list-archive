[ On behalf of Martin Jambon which has some issues with caml-list@. ]

Dear caml-list,

We are pleased to announce a pre-release of the future ocamlscript 2.
Ocamlscript allows to write single-file programs that include their own
compilation options and run fast thanks to ocamlopt.

Ocamlscript is simply a command-line tool which takes a single input
file, compiles it and runs it.

1) Key concepts:
- one source file contains everything (no more tar.gz or makefiles);
- programs run fast (unlike scripts using the "ocaml" command);
- programs are recompiled when needed (based on last modification
dates).


2) Novelties

A script is now composed of two parts:
- a short header which is written in OCaml and that is used to set
   compilation options (packages to use, compiler options, a special
   preprocessing, or even a completely different compiler to use
   instead of ocamlopt);
- the program itself.

By default, the program is compiled with ocamlopt and camlp4o as
preprocessor, but this can be changed.

This new version is not 100% compatible with the last release of
ocamlscript (1.1). It only concerns specific cases, i.e. scripts that requi=
re
exactly one cmx or cmxa file with no other option.


3) A complete example

Real example: a CGI script which uses the PCRE-OCaml,
Ocamlnet (cgi package) and Micmatch_pcre libraries.

The syntax extension provided by Micmatch_pcre is automatically loaded.
PCRE-OCaml (pcre package) is automatically loaded as a dependency of
Ocamlnet and Micmatch_pcre. So the script simply needs to start like
this:

#!/usr/bin/env ocamlscript
Ocaml.packs :=3D ["micmatch_pcre"; "cgi"]
--
...

The full source code is there:
   http://martin.jambon.free.fr/examples/domains.ml.html

The resulting CGI executable is running as:
   http://wikiomics.org/cgi-bin/cgi/domains



4) Development status

This is the pre-release 1.99.0 of the future ocamlscript 2. It is
provided without a true documentation, and some aspects of the interface co=
uld
change until the 2.0 release.

User input will be greatly appreciated (see wiki below).


5) Distribution

OCamlscript was written by David Mentr=E9 (original version) and Martin
Jambon (latest features). It is distributed under the terms of the Boost
software license.
