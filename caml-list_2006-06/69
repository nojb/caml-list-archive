Hello,

For my demexp server, I'm considering the development of a web
interface, accessible from a simple web browser. I have standard
requirements (html forms) as well as "advanced" ones (would like to
support AJAX-like things, navigation in tree data structures, etc.).
Which development frameworks are available to do such things in OCaml?
I'm looking for frameworks under a license compatible with GNU GPL.

Right now, I know about:
 - WDialog
 - XCaml

For low level stuff (basic CGI interface), there is also OCamlNet.

I've made some experiments with WDialog but I'm not entirely convinced
by its approach of separating interface description from event
handling code. Moreover it lacks some features that would be useful
for us : i18n support (even if, thanks to Gerd, a preliminary code is
available in CVS tree), advanced widgets (tree structures), AJAX
support, etc.

What other people are using to do web stuff? Is everybody using PHP? ;-)

Any recommandation on building such complex web interface with
available OCaml software?

Best regards,
david

PS : My current demexp server is an autonomous Unix daemon, written in
OCaml, accessible through ONC RPC calls over a TCP socket. Until know,
I have made a simple CGI that access the demexp server. But I'm
considering merging the server part with the web part. Has somebody
some knowledge on the design of web architecture and recommendation or
pointer to relevant litterature?
