Thank you for the pointer, even if, right now, I have some issue to
understand how an XML toolkit could help me design a dynamic web site.

BTW, the ECDuce pages lack a little description on the aim of the project.

I'm already using CDuce to read/write XML files in my server. So I'm
suppose to already know it. ;-)

Well... I've looked at OpenLazlo and I'm quite skeptical on such a
framework. Non-withstanding that OpenLazlo is aimed at Flash
environment and that DHTML support is apparently still under
development, I'm not really fond of technology targetting only
Javascript-only web browser. I would like to develop my web site for
both new and old browsers. Moreover, OpenLazlo servers are in Java,
and using XML has a programming language seems a bit silly to me.

Regarding my own (quite foggy) requirements, I would like to develop a
web site using a efficient language that I like (OCaml), but without
re-inventing the wheel, thus my search for an OCaml friendly web
framework. Until now, I've found technologies for developing such a
framework, but no real read-to-use framework (except maybe WDialog
which lacks support beyond basic HTML) like those[1] that can be found
for other languages (Java, PHP and Python).

Best wishes,
david
