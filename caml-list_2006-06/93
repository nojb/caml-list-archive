Hello David,

Currently, XStream generates only a fully functional executable
transformaion which reads its input from an XML file and send its output
to the standard output.

It would be quite simple to have it generate an OCaml module which
exports a ``filter'' function (a transformer of XML event streams) if
there is some demand for such a feature.

> How XStream compares to OCamlDuce?

OCamlDuce is intended to write large OCaml applications which need to
manipulate XML data. XStream is really meant as an XML transformation
tool. In particular, to achieve efficient streaming, XStream keeps
control over the evaluation of the transformation as a whole. OCamlDuce,
instead, relies on the regular OCaml evaluation mechanism.

Yes it is.
