Hi all,

There's something in Ocaml that allows me to have a struct
defined as:

    type struct_t = { a : int ; b : int ; c : int }

and an instance of that say:

    let x = { a = 1 ; b = 2 ; c = 3 }

and then have:

    let y = { a = 2 ; (* b and c filled in from x *) }

but I can't for the life of me remember the syntax. Anyone care
to give me a gentle tap with the clue bat?

Thanks,
Erik
