Maybe you can convert the data into a marshal-optimized format before 
marshalling, where you put your shared data into an array, and substitute the 
pointers by array indices, e.g.
   type t = string list
becomes:
   type marshalled_t = (string array * int list)

["a"; "b"; "a"; "a"] -> ([| "a"; "b" |], [0; 1; 0; 0])

That seems like a lot of work, but it shouldn't be too hard to maintain.

By the way, floats don't compress very well. Rounding them as much as possible 
used to save me about 50% of space.
