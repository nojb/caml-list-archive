Another attempt of self promotion: Ex Nunc
(http://ex-nunc.sourceforge.net) is an application framework written
in pure OCaml that provides strongly-typed page parameters, automatic
session and form validation. Although a live demo is available here:

http://ex-nunc.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/ex-nunc/demo.cgi

the framework is still young and not usable for commercial purposes
and the templates page compiler is still under construction. In any
case our plan is to complete the core project features and to arrive
to a usable release of Ex Nunc in November 2006. Our first goal is to
obtain a "better PHP", usable in everyday jobs; in the future
interesting features like strongly typed embedded SQL and a better
application server engine (based on the equeue library) are planned.

Since an official announcement is probably a bit premature in this
moment, if you have any question about Ex Nunc or, better, if you want
to join the development team or to subscribe the "free human beings
from PHP slavery" club, contact me.

Best regards,
