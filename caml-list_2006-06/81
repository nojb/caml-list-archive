I agree that this is one of those highly desired features for OCaml that
we've been waiting for for a long time. If it were part of the mainstream
distribution, I'd use it.

I'm curious as to what happened to GCaml now. A while ago it appeared that
GCaml would bring overloading, dynamic types, and type safe marshalling to
Caml. Have the main Caml team concluded that folding GCaml into Caml proper is
not a desireable goal?
