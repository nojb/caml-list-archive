Hello,

2006/6/30, Vincent Balat <Vincent.Balat@pps.jussieu.fr>:

Ok, thank you for the information. BTW, the font for code example on
the Tutorial page is very small, so small that it is hardly readable
(with Firefox 1.5 on Windows).

Or because they want to use another web server (lighttpd) or beacuse
they want to integrate Ocsigen web site with another web site or
framework. People rarely start a web site from scratch.

> but I am not convinced that it has a lot of advantages ...

Apache is a very complex piece of software but with a lot of
capabilities, peer review and security updates. DIY-web-server just
can't match.

For me, being tied to your web server (or even Apache) is a very
strong disadvantage.

Best wishes,
d.
