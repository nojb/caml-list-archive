Not that I know of. Since I am actually an Ocaml user *and*
the main author of libsndfile I really should get around to 
doing this :-).

Unfortunately, I'm currently rather short of time so Stefan,
I you put something together I would be more than happy to
to ship it with libsndfile and maintain it.

Cheers,
Erik
