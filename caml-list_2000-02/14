User-defined printing functions run in the memory space of the
debugger, which is distinct from that of the debugged program.
Structued I/O (output_value/input_value) is used to communicate the
value being printed between the two.  Unfotunately, structured I/O is
currently unable to deal with objects and functions, hence the error
you've observed.

The only solution I can see right now is put a breakpoint in one of
the methods of my_p's class; then, "x" is in scope and "print x"
should show its value.
