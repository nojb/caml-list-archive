I have certainly heard about partial evaluation, and the link you have
found here is a good starting point.  I do recommend the first book listed
on that page, and would also like to emphasise that there has been a
long standing symposium/workship on partial evaluation, called PEPM.

If you would be more specific about which aspects of partial evaluation
you are interested in, I maybe able to help.

Walid.
