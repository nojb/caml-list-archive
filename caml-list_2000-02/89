Answering my own question...

  I've been told that statically linking Tk applications is not
  possible.  If you can tell me how to do it (ideally on both Unix and
  Windows) I'd be delighted to know: this is one of our biggest problems
  with distributing Unison at the moment.

>From talking to some more experts, the situation appears to be this:
Tk can be statically linked, but this doesn't help with portability
because when it starts the first thing it does is reads some Tcl
scripts.  So in any case you can't distribute a complete all-in-one
executable: users will have to install (the right version of) Tk to
run your program.
