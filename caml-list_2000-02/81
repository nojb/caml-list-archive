I would beg to differ with this analysis: Tk has some nice widgets,
like the text widget, which are _much_ better than GTK's rather woeful
offering. However, GTK has a tree widget, and while GTK is under
development
-- which is a disadvantage -- it is also under development -- which is
an advantage :-)

Tk is reasonably stable .. but dead. It is also sssllllloooowwwww under
Windows.

IMHO: use Tk if it is enough, and GTK for projects with a serious
future.
