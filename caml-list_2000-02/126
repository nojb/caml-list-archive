See my previous email. I have no end of problems installing
things (in general) as source. Ocaml is a pleasant exception,
it is very easy to build.

BTW: please think about configuration management and installation for
a second: it is well known to be a nightmare on all systems.
Specialists are employed by most companies with more than few boxes
just to keep them running and maintain the software configuration.
I think it's obvious on reflection that this is a really difficult
problem, and there really has to be something a lot better than
make and friends.
