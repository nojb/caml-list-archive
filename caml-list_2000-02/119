Sounds good.

You'll need to cross-compile.  That is, install a regular OCaml on
your Linux development machine and use it to generate bytecode
executables.  Then, hopefully, you should be able to transfer those
bytecode executables to the OSkit memory and execute them from there
using your modified ocamlrun.
