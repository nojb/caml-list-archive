I have seen some big projects (> 100 MB code) and several smaller ones. In each of
them people had to fight with the configuration. They all settled for what seems to
be the least pain: built and distribute (!) in small blocks; keep each block in its
own directory; use the same general frame for each block if possible (yes: use the
name config.h over and over again).
Even if its leading away from OCaml: I think that your real problem is with "make"
and its way of building project. Look for "configuration management" and "make replacement"
on the net.
