I have an application that _requires_ thousands of 
threads of control. It has nothing to do with the 'design'.
Of course, the threads spend most of the time doing nothing,
and the current implementation uses callbacks not hardware
threads. However, programming in this environment directly
is bad; the programmer wants to write threads.

I was thinking of using the bytecode interpreter threads to
implement this. Is this not feasible? [Hardware threads are
too slow, I need to create 500 threads per second, with
a life of about 5 mins, which means about 20000 active threads:
the overhead of 4K is per thread is small, only ~80Meg]
