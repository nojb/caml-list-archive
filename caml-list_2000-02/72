I had a simple question about Camlidl.  I notice that there has not
been a release since the change to the LGPL and the other license.
The LICENSE file in Camlidl gives rights to distribute the files
generated by Camlidl, but no mention is given to the runtime library
files required.

What is the intended distribution terms of these files?

Thanks,
Dave Brown
