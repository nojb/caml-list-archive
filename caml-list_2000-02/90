I have a problem using some third partyC codes with ocaml,
this includes pcre (defintely) and possibly mlgtk.
Some work needs to be done figuring out the right way to do this.
Here's the problem:

I am distributing an ocaml/C tool which uses third party
components like mlgtk and pcre which require C code.

The way these packages are distributed is a 'build in separate
directory and install' model. This is NOT acceptable for my
package. I require all components to be built and usable
WITHOUT installing them (with one exception: the standard ocaml (and
python)
distributions). 

What I do is copy relevant source files
from distributed packages, and, if necessary, edit them,
then I build them as part of my system, directly from these
sources.

[In other words I must distribute IN MY PACKAGE everything
which is not stock standard in the official ocaml distribution,
and a single command must build the whole system]

This is a pain. I would like to ask suppliers of third party
packages please

	1. DO NOT USE A FILE CALLED 'config.h'
	  
	Such a file will clobber someone elses config.h
	Pleae call these files 'pcre_config.h' or 'gdk_config.h'
	or whatever.

	PLEASE use filenames that are specialised to your package,
	do NOT use generic names on the assumption your code will
	be built with your Makefile in a separate directory.

	2. Do NOT require you package be 'main'.
	Only ONE main is allowed, and it is MINE.
	Do NOT supply 'main' in ANY C libraries.
	(you can supply a sample 'main.c', but is must be that: a sample)

	[This also seems to affect 'numerix']


Some of these problems will be alieviated when Ocaml gets a proper
mechanism to add components to the system. This is non-trivial,
but it is handled much better in Python than Ocaml at present.

I have made quite extensive additions to mlgtk, but I cannot
supply a 'patch' to the original authors because I have been
forced to rename files, and make edits which break that packages
build model.
