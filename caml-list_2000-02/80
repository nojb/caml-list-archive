The best way to interpret those mysterious error codes is to use the
Unix.error_message function to get a readable error message.  Let's do
that as a generic error reporting function:

# let show_unix_error fn =
    try
      fn ()
    with Unix_error(err, ctx1, ctx2) as exn -> 
      Printf.printf "Unix error: %s, %s, %s" (error_message err) ctx1 ctx2;
      print_newline();
      raise exn;;

Now, the errors you get are nearly self-explanatory:

# show_unix_error (fun () ->  socket PF_INET SOCK_RAW 0);;
Unix error: Operation not permitted, socket, 
Uncaught exception: Unix.Unix_error(30, "socket", "")
# show_unix_error (fun () ->  socket PF_INET SOCK_SEQPACKET 0);;
Unix error: Socket type not supported, socket, 
Uncaught exception: Unix.Unix_error(46, "socket", "")

In other terms, the SEQPACKET socket type is not supported by your
Unix kernel, and you need to be superuser to create a socket in RAW
mode.

This question, as well as your other questions, is a question about
Unix network programming, not about Caml.  The "Unix" library in Caml
is a direct translation of the basic Unix systems programming concepts.
Please refer to any good book on Unix systems programming, such as
the books by W. Richard Stevens ("Advanced Programming in the Unix
Environment", "Unix Network Programming", etc).

Again, using the show_unix_error above, you'd see that the error is
"No route to host", and it means that the machine with the specified
IP address is not accessible from your machine.

The books I mentioned above are an excellent starting point.  Once
you're familiar with Unix systems programming in general, you should
have no problems using the "Unix" library.
