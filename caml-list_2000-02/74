huh ???

what do you mean by

"is it ported to everything but the kitchen sink?" ?

it worked fine on my solaris box before, and also under debian gnu/linux ppc
and i386, as well as redhat/sparc. there are reports of it working under
windows also, but i didn't bother to try this broken OS. should work under
beos also, but i don't know if caml works for beos.

Friendly,
