Even with the raw functions and a perfect understanding of the system,
I found it extremely difficult to write bug-free code, and very
time-consuming to fish out the inevitable bugs.  That's why the macros
exist.  For most people, it is more economical to write slightly less
efficient code if that means less debugging time and fewer bugs in the
released version.

If only we knew how to do that, we could get rid of the GC
altogether.  (tongue in cheek)
