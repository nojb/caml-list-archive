I have never compiled ocaml under windows, but I thought there was
some kind of nmake to do it.

And some day, it should be possible to compile it using cygwin, which
is slightly cheaper than some m$ compilers ;-) and which makes
available many nice command line tools.

I must say I am ignorant. I've only compiled software under Linux, and
installed it under Linux and Windows.

The only way to get really rid of software under windows is to
reinstall the whole system from scratch (the garbage collecting of
dlls is not that good ;-). Most of the time, when I uninstall
something that decided to go live in common directories, uninstall
fails. Under Linux, I think makefiles work well, and it is possible to
specify an install directory during the configuration process (and
when I say that, I mean there will be nothing that will go in another
directory, as it can happen for some other os).

Now if you would be so kind as to explain what better solution you
have compared to makefiles, I'm all ears.
