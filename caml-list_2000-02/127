 Hello,

 I have had the same problem and I was about to write the
 new function when I stopped: the time taken by the hash
 function was not worth the extra coding.

 But I think that it's really a great pity that the
 standard library lacks such a function. Moreover, it
 should be really easy to implement it. Could we expect
 it implemented?

					Cheers,
					C.S.C.
