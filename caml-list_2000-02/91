Hi,

I'm not sure QT would be so nice to use, since the first problem would
consist of writing the bindings for caml (unless I'm mistaken and they
already exist). I think the best target is definitely gtk, since it
runs under linux and win32, a port on BeOS is in the works, and it is
fairly widely used.
