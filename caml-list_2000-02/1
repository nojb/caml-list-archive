Subject: inlining functions called through functor parameters?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello list,

While searching the Caml mailing list archive, I found
a message from Xavier Leroy, posted on Tue Jun 23 1998,
in which he describes the fact that:
"... it is true that functions taken from the
 functor parameter are always called via their closures".

I was wondering if this is still true (since 1998 is a long
time ago, in internet time at least), and if there are any plans
to implement more inlining for such functions.
The reason I ask is because I'm writing a couple of modules where
lots of small funtions are called via a functor parameter, and
I'm wondering if it's worth the trouble to inline them "by hand".

Greetings,

Stephan Houben
