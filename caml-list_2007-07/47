This is complete nonsense. In any language you try to get most from =20
your gpu, someone writing in C would do the same.
Your sentence translates to I will program badly on purpose to test =20
ocaml's speed. I'm sure you wouldnt't do that.

And by the way _if_ your bottleneck is on the gpu or in cpu to gpu =20
transfers this attitude will in no way test ocaml's performance.

Best,
