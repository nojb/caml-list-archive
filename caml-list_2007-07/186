The last one (http://ocaml.eclipse.free.fr/) is the same as OcaIDE. It
was only a temporary page to test plug-in installation. I updated the
page to redirect to the new site.

> Did anybody test some of them ?

I tested ocamldt, and the basic features (syntax coloring, compiling,
error markers) work well, but it doesn't have as many features as
OcaIDE. I also found that the outline doesn't work on big source
files.

ocaml-eclipse seems to have been aborted right after it started (by
the looks of the cvs source tree)

The O'Caml part of eclipsefp hasn't seen much development in the last
several years, but I have seen that a student is working on improving
it, as a google summer of code project.
