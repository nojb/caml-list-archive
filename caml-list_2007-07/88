That's more like it. :-)

The memoization technique I used is a good way to avoid that problem because 
the display lists are lazily allocated. So you can't get premature allocation 
bugs (a problem if you try allocating global OpenGL entities before the GL is 
initialized).

Probably a bug in ATi's OpenGL implementation. IIRC, John Carmack used display 
lists to cache adaptive tesselations of Bezier surfaces in Quake III and had 
similar problems. nVidia's drivers are much better... :-)

System memory or graphics card memory? Does it take up much memory?

Maybe.
