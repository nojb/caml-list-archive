I have had great success recently in writing new programs and converting old 
programs to use the fantastic parsing capabilities provided by the awesome 
new camlp4 (in v3.10). However, I notice that my programs are now pulling in 
dynlink.cmxa which works beautifully here but, I believe, is only available 
because I'm using Alain's experimental branch (with ocamlnat).

Am I correct in thinking that users running mainstream OCaml will not be able 
to compile my programs to native code?
