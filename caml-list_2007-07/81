I did read all the other posts in this thread, but just wanted to follow up
quickly.  I've got a no-thrills ATI Radeon X550.  I was originally getting
about 10 fps, and then down to 6.6 after the display lists.  Updating the
driver helped.  It went from 10 fps before to 70 fps with the display lists.
But:

 (1) There were a few hangs in the display while display lists were intially
being created.  The code should probably be run at startup.
 (2) The textures got screwy after text got displayed.  For example, working
through a fools' mate, when I take the pawn the textures break.

I didn't get around to all of the other optimizations.  I'm a little too
busy right now to go through all of that, but I'll give it a try eventually.
I'm wondering what impact meomizing the 'draw_frame_triangles' will have on
memory usage.  I'm guessing that's one of the reasons the files were stored
in their given format to begin with.
