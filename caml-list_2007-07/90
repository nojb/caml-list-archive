I haven't followed this discussion, but assuming that you only want to
do remote procedure calls between programs written in ocaml, you will
soon be able to use my eConcurrency library.  I'm writing this library
as part of the OCaml Summer Project, it (will) provide means to write
concurrent and distributed programs in style similar to erlang.
Concurrency is based on separate processes communicating over unix
domain sockets (that part is done), distribution will be based tcp/ip
and a first version should be done by the end of this weekend/middle
of next week.

Cheers,

Bene
