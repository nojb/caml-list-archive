Interesting question, thank you for asking :-)

Well, since my camlp4 is in the continuity of the previous official
one (what the "new" camlp4 is not), I did not change the names of
the commands, nor library files.

I may do, since I don't have the "official" version. I may change it
into "camlp5", "camlp42", or other without "camlp".

It does not help me, since I should also change the Makefiles of my
other programs, which are no more compilable with the "new" camlp4, to
call my camlp4 commands.

It is the reason why I kept the name, and I still hesitate to change.

In practice:

  While running "configure" without parameters, the binaries will be
  installed (after compilation) at the same place than the camlp4
  binaries installed by ocaml, overwriting them. The library files
  are installed in the directory "ocaml library +camlp4", the official
  one being moved to "ocaml library +ocamlp4".

  Otherwise, you can "configure" by using the parameters "-bindir",
  "-libdir", "-mandir", or, globally, "-prefix", to specify another
  installation place. In that case, the option "-I +camlp4" does not
  work in ocamlc, you have to use "-I $(camlp4 -where)" instead.

If I change the name, there will be no more problem of installing.
