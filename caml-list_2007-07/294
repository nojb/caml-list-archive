Thank you for your reply!

This has to be done manually, I cannot use anything besides simple caml
light code... no library use possible.
 
It's not a homework (Is anyone having school works at this time of the year?
That wouldn't be good).

It's for me to understand the language. I'm learning it for a while, but
still need a lot more work. Any resource you can advise with many exercises
specifically about trees in caml light?

Thank you once again!
