Yep.
Anyway I looked into the source of the plug in and I found the exact 
point where the makefile is named in lowercase (I found 2 points, one in 
with capital and one in lower case).

As soon as I find how to install the modified plugin into Eclipse, I'll 
check if there are no side effects and I will submit the patch to the 
development team.
Then they will consider or drop my patch.

I'm not dicussing it here, because that's Java, not OCaml. :-)
