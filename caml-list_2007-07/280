Dear OCaml hackers,

I'm pleased to announce the first release of fiblib, an efficient,
imperative Fibonacci heap library, based on the pseudocode of Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein:

http://code.google.com/p/fiblib/

This implementation provides a base of operations you'd expect from a
heap (with more to come):

  - insert
  - extract min
  - delete
  - decrease key

Other operations, such as union, are slated for another release.

Though a relatively obscure data structure, they are the best known
solution for certain algorithms requiring a heap. In particular, a
fibonacci heap is a win if the number of extract-min and delete
operations is small compared to the number of other operations.

Fiblib is released under a BSD-style license, so, if you need a heap,
try it out, and let me know how it goes!
