Ok, thanks for the explanation.

Now, I really hope you will go for this solution. I'm maintaining a huge
deal of OCaml related packages in Debian. As you can imagine some of
them will break with the new OCaml 3.10.0 due to CamlP4
incompatibilities. While I guess some of them are going to be fixed by
the respective authors, some aren't, for example ledit (I doubt you will
migrate it to the new CamlP4 :-P).

So we need in Debian a package of camlp4s, and I'm working on it.
However, given the current situation, camlp4s is a package which will
conflict with the official camlp4, that means that users can't install
both of them, and will also probably mean that no one will have camlp4s
installed.  That still helps, since I (as a package maintainer) can
build-depend on camlp4s and be able to compile ledit, but it's
suboptimal, since OCaml developers needing the old camlp4 will need to
choose among the two camlp4 available aut-aut.

If you choose to rename camlp4s executables and libraries however, users
will be able to install both camlp4s and the official camlp4. Can you
please consider this option?

Many thanks in advance,
Cheers.
