This was sounding quite nice and I've been meaning to try Eclipse and Scala. 
However, I just managed to get the necessary software installed under Debian 
Linux and am finding it to be extremely unstable. I'm seeing null pointer 
exceptions and lots of hanging.

One point of particular concern is the startup message:

searching for compatible vm...
  testing /usr/lib/jvm/java-gcj...found

which implies that Eclipse has chosen to run using the GNU Java clone rather 
than the real thing (which is installed).

Has anyone else here found Eclipse to be usable?
