I just tested it on a small toy project and it is by far the best I have
seen, it is actually very usable. One thing in particular that I like is
that it does not necessarily rely on a builtin engine  within the plugin to
compile your projects but can use a simple makefile instead. This way of
cleanly  separating the building process allows you to use another great
development tool: ocamlbuild for building (provided you don't mind managing
the ocamlbuild files to configure your project instead of using the plugin
managed ocaml projects).

I have a few remark though:

- i could not find a way to configure the ocaml debugger: i use it a lot and
some of my code requires deactivating checkpoints, or it would just eats up
memory. Otherwise debugging through ocaide works very well.

- OcaIDE does not look in ocamlbuild _build directory for .annot files, it's
ok since i can put commands in the Makefile to copy the files in their
expected locations after a build, but it would be nice to have this.

- I am not sure what Project references are for, i understand it would
automatically ask you if you want to open the referred projects when opening
the main project, but can it also issue a build for the referred projects
when necessary (like projects in a Visual Studio solution) ? AFAIK this
configurations is not mentioned in the documentation.

- I could not make it work with eclipse 3.2 but it works fine with 3.3 + Sun
JVM 1.6

Anyway, great work!

Gregory
