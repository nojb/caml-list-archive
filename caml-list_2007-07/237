I am interested in parsing Wiki markup language that has a few tags, like
<pre>...</pre>, <math>...,</math>.
These tags are sparse, meaning that the ratio of number of tags / number of
bytes is low.
I would like, given a string (or a stream) with such tags, to parse it as
fast as possible.  Efficiency is a primary consideration, and so is
simplicity of the implementation.
Do you have any advice about the library I should be using?
Thanks,

Luca
