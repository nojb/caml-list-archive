Hello!

I'm working on an XML-RPC client library for OCaml called XmlRpc-Light. 
It's very small and simple, and it only depends on Xml-Light and 
Ocamlnet so it's easy to compile and install. It's still under early 
development, and currently is only a client, though the pieces are there 
to build a server as well. Any suggestions, contributions, or criticism 
are gladly accepted.

Project page:
http://code.google.com/p/xmlrpc-light/

Main module:
http://xmlrpc-light.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/XmlRpc.ml
http://xmlrpc-light.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/XmlRpc.mli

Simple example:
     let rpc = new XmlRpc.client "http://localhost:8000" in
     let result = rpc#call "echo" [`String "hello!"] in
     print_endline (XmlRpc.dump result)

Complex example (wrapper for WordPress blog API):
http://xmlrpc-light.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/wordpress/WordPress.ml

PDF documentation:
http://xmlrpc-light.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/xmlrpc-light/latex/doc.pdf

The license is LGPL with the special exception for linking, same as 
Xml-Light. Thanks to Nicolas Cannasse for writing Xml-Light and for 
letting me use an adapted version of his Base64 codec from ExtLib. 
Thanks also to Gerd Stolpmann for the amazingly capable Ocamlnet 
library, of which I'm barely beginning to scratch the surface.

Just another OCaml hacker,
Dave
