                    CALL FOR POSTER PRESENTATIONS

    The Fifth ASIAN Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
                             (APLAS 2007)

                    November 29 - December 1, 2007
                              Singapore

                 http://flint.cs.yale.edu/aplas2007/

APLAS 2007 will include a poster session during the conference.  The
session aims to give students and researchers an opportunity to
present their research to the community, and to get responses from
other researchers.

SCOPE:

Poster presentations are sought in all areas of programming languages
and systems, including (but not limited to):

- semantics, logics, foundational theory
- type systems, language design
- program analysis, optimization, transformation
- software security, safety, verification
- compiler systems, interpreters, abstract machines
- domain-specific languages and systems
- programming tools and environments

FORMAT:

A space of A1 paper size (594 mm wide and 841 mm high) will be
provided for each presentation.  If you need more space, contact the
poster chair (sumii AT ecei DOT tohoku DOT ac DOT jp).  To prepare a
good poster, search the Web for "poster presentation" and you will
find many useful resources.

REGISTRATION:

Each presenter should e-mail a 1-2 page abstract in PDF or PostScript
(including the title, authors, affiliations, and a summary of the
work) to the poster chair (sumii AT ecei DOT tohoku DOT ac DOT jp) by
September 14th, 2007.  The program of the poster session will be
announced by September 21st, 2007.  We hope to accommodate every
poster, but may restrict presentations (based on relevance and
interest to the community) due to space constraints.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  1-2 page abstract    September 14, 2007
  notification         September 21, 2007
  conference           November 29 - December 1, 2007

CONTACT:

For questions or requests, please contact the APLAS 2007 poster chair,
Eijiro Sumii (sumii AT ecei DOT tohoku DOT ac DOT jp).
