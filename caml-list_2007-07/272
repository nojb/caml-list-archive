Dear All,

thanks for the pointer to the excellent paper.  First, let me say that my
Vec data structure was born to fill a need I had while working on a project=
:
while it has been useful to me, I certainly do not claim it is the best tha=
t
can be done, so I am very grateful for these suggestions!

My Vec data structure is different from persistent arrays.  It is likely to
be less efficient for get/set use.
However, it offers at logarithmic cost insertion/removal operations that ar=
e
not present in the standard persistent arrays.
Consider a Vec a of size 10.

   - Vec.insert 3 d a inserts value d in position 3 of a, shifting
   elements 3..9 of a to positions 4..10.
   - Vec.remove 3 a removes the element in position 3 of a, shifting
   elements 4..9 to positions 3..8.  Vec.pop is similar and returns the
   removed element as well.
   - Vec.concat works in log-time.

These operations are necessary if you want to use a Vec as a FIFO, for
example (you append elements at the end, and you get the first element via
Vec.pop 0 a).  In many algorithms, it is often handy to be able to
remove/insert elements in the middle of a list.

In summary, I don't think the Vec data structure is a replacement for array=
s
or persistent arrays in numerically-intensive work.  But if you want a
flexible data structure for the 90% of the code that is not peformance
critical, they can be useful.
Now the question is: can one get better get/set efficiency while retaining
the ability to insert/remove elements?  (I am sure that there is something
better to be done...).
