You could take the same approach than proof general for eclipse, writte 
a parser with anything (this includes camlp4)
whose output is a copy of the original file with xml annotation. Such a 
parser should allow camlp4 extension ...

The main problem, is that appart from the xml annotation the text should 
not be changed, so a camlp4 pretty-printer will not workd. However, the 
parser could simply produce the position where to add xml annotation 
that are inserter in a second phase into the original
input ...

So what needs to be written is a camlp4 parser that produce pairs with 
positions and xml annotation ... and that also perform a little error 
recovery ...

Yes, probably, but what is a "linked URL" and what is their use in 
OCaIDE ? If it is the link to the ocaml library, then
it is strange that darcs think linked URL matters ?
