For importing projects, you can use the "OCaml Empty Makefile Project"
project creation wizard. It creates a makefile project without any files
inside. Whereas the other kind of makefile project wizard, "OCaml Makefile
Project" is meant to be used as a starting point for a new project.

The name is determined by the "make" command, since it is called to build
the project.

Anyway it is a very nice project.


Thank you
