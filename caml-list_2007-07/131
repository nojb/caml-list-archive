          http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~garrigue/FLOPS2008/

  FLOPS is a forum for research on all issues concerning declarative
  programming, including functional programming and logic programming,
  and aims to promote cross-fertilization and integration between the
  two paradigms.  Previous FLOPS meetings were held in Fuji Susono
  (1995), Shonan Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo
  (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara (2004), and Fuji Susono (2006).

TOPICS

  FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of functional and logic
  programming, including (but not limited to):

    Declarative Pearls: new and excellent declarative programs with
    illustrative applications;

    Language issues: language design and constructs, programming
    methodology, integration of paradigms, interfacing with other
    languages, type systems, constraints, concurrency and distributed
    computing;

    Foundations: logic and semantics, rewrite systems and narrowing,
    type theory, proof systems;

    Implementation issues: compilation techniques, memory management,
    program analysis and transformation, partial evaluation,
    parallelism;

    Applications: case studies, real-world applications, graphical
    user interfaces, Internet applications, XML, databases, formal
    methods and model checking.

  The proceedings are expected to be published as an LNCS volume.  The
  proceedings of the previous meeting (FLOPS2006) were published as
  LNCS 3945.

SUBMISSION

  Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
  elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
  published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Submissions should
  fall into one of the following categories:

    Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will
    be judged on originality, correctness, and significance.

    System descriptions: they should contain a link to a working
    system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.

  All submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15
  proceedings pages long. Authors are strongly encouraged to use
  LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class file, available at
  http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

  Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or
  experimental results.  In case of lack of space, this supporting
  information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g. a link to a
  web page, or an appendix).  Submission is Web-based.  Please visit
  the conference site.

  Author notification: December 21, 2007
  Camera-ready copy: January 21, 2008
