Ouch,

I beg to differ, if you want speed and can work stream (linear
top-down left-right exploration of the graph), you want an event based
xml parser. expat is probably one of the fastest (the c library is
known to be a speed demon). PXP does everything including talking
klingon and controlling the kitchen sink. It provides an event based
layer.
I have found Xml-light to be the simplest parser. Alas, it is so
simple it is far from implementing the full XML 1.1 specification.
This often isn't an issue since most XML files are written in a very
small subset of what the language.

Ultimately if you are parsing very simple files and are aiming for
pure speed you could write a simple lexer with ocamllex and use that
as base layer.
