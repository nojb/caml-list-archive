Don't know if this will help but the last issue looks a bit like
something I have experienced with SVN (Subversion). I don't think it has
anything to do with the OcalIDE plug-in. Did you create a local or
remote repository (don't know if this makes sense in darcs). It seems
like the darcs plug-in does not allow for remote access to remote
repositories.

Just to test this, create a Java project and see if you have the same
problem.

HTHs,
Hugo F.
