I certainly wouldn't recommend xml-light for *every* project where an
XML parser is needed, but look at the OP's requirements :

On such a simple case, xml-light (which is basically a simple ocamllex
file + a few things to build the syntax tree) should perform quite
well. I know it doesn't handle DTD, etc. but in *that* case, who cares ?

That could be a solution, and (provided the licence you chose for your
project is compatible) you could even use xml-light as an example to
begin with (stripping things you don't need).

Kind regards,
