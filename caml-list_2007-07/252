Hello everybody !
About ocamlbuild : unfortunately, this (wonderfull) tool came out when the
development of the plug-in was almost finished, so we can only plan to
incorporate it in a future version (maybe...). I think we can do something
about the _build directory.

For project references, I don't know also what it is for, and we don't use
it in the plug-in.

About the debugger,  I thought there was no problem to desactivate
checkpoints but if you say it... We will have to wait a few days until the
person who developed it came back..

Thanks!

Rafael
