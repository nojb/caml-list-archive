Don't forget the OpenGL driver. This is a very complicated and often highly 
optimized piece of software. In the case of display lists, it is essentially 
acting as an optimizing compiler. The small function that I gave posted 
offloads the prioritization of texture and vertex data to the OpenGL driver 
and good drivers (e.g. any nVidia driver) will do an excellent job of 
optimizing for you.

When you are rendering static geometry (as you are), display lists are an 
excellent way to get huge performance improvements without leaving the 
comfort of idiomatic OCaml code.

What hardware and drivers are you using?
