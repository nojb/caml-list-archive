My point was offloading the work to another subsystem doesn't give me a =
very
good idea of the general-case performance of the language.  For most
programs the GPU is not a factor one way or the other.  And yes I =
realize
I=92m still using the GPU to some extent so I'm already cheating.  This =
was a
learning exercise, not an attempt to write high-performance production =
code.
Standard pre-mature optimization mantras come to mind as well.

Incidentally, Jon's code seemed to run slower on my graphics card =
anyway.

Off to see if us Americans can reclaim the hot-dog eating world title,
