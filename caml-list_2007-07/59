Yes but as I said in my previous message in that particular case not =20
doing it doesn't give you a good idea of the general-case performance =20=

of the language either. And if you render is too slow you may end up =20
blame the language while the problem may be that you are misusing the =20=

gpu.

This is possible. Iirc on some platforms using vertex buffer objects =20
is faster and there are some gl commands that, for the sake of =20
performance, should not be put in a display list (e.g. glTexImage2d) =20
-- even though they are allowed to be.

Best,
