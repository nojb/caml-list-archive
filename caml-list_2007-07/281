What about an OCaml library that provides the same functionality as 
Adobe Flash Player, without relying on Flash bytecode?
There would be an additional layer to interpret Flash bytecode.
But the plugin would be essentially ocamlrun, loaded with the rendering 
library and the Flash bytecode interpreter.
It would support OCaml bytecode that uses your rendering library directly 
without relying on the Flash bytecode.


Just an idea... I have never tried anything even remotely like this.
