Personnally, I think that we should have more subtyping than in OCaml. 
Then, "void" is the smallest type (and quite equivalent to 'a.'a) 
and "unit" is the bigest type. This looks natural for "void" and more 
surprising for "unit", but you can see that you can do nothing with a 
value of type unit (except matching it, which is not much), which mean 
that is you do not match unit (you use "_" everywhere you would use "()" 
in pattern), then any value can be safely cast to the unit type ... So 
"void" is really the dual of "unit" and they are very distinct.

PS: In PML it works like that (our server is down, so please wait 
tomorrow if you want to try PML)
