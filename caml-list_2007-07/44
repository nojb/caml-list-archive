ROTFLMAO. Wow! That is absolutely amazing! Love the name. =8-)

Here's a quick patch, if you put this right after your definition of draw_md3 
in md3.ml then the whole program runs an order of magnitude faster:

let draw_md3 =
  let m = Hashtbl.create 1 in
  fun x y ->
    try GlList.call(Hashtbl.find m (x, y)) with Not_found ->
      let list = GlList.create `compile in
      draw_md3 x y;
      GlList.ends();
      GlList.call list;
      Hashtbl.add m (x, y) list

This simply memoizes the rendering of each frame of animation for each model 
in a display list. The result is that your geometry is stored on the graphics 
card and rendered directly, hence the gratuitous speedup.

This is a wonderful idea for a first project in OCaml. I've taken a quick look 
at your code to give you some constructive criticism but your coding style is 
already excellent. Keep posting!
