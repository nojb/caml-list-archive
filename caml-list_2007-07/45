Thanks.  I'll give it a try.  I'm wondering if it will have any performance
impact for the software rendering on my linux box.  You know I think I saw
you post something similar before, and ignored it because I didn't want to
trick myself into thinking the GPU's speed was actually Ocaml's speed.  Now
that I have a better feel for that though, might as well let the frame-rates
fly!
