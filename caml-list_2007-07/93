It means they did a very bad job. Richard Jones cited some fun articles 
describing the problems, at the bottom of this page:

  http://merjis.com/developers/oc-soap

If I had the choice I would certainly choose something more robust like 
XML-RPC but, for some unknown reason, the world seems to have ditched all of 
the preferable options in favour of the insane ones. Just another case of 
industry taking a simple problem and making it incredibly complicated for no 
reason. Anyway, I'm going to watch a betamax video whilst listening to some 
OGG music. ;-)
