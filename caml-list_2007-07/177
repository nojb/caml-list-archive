I tried to use it on my Debian Lenny (with packed eclipse 3.2) and it 
seems work.
Very nice project.
Usually I don't like eclipse (it's too heavy and slow, but if it works 
it can be fine).

I have imported one big project of mine and it took it without any 
problem but the creation of another makefile named "makefile" (mine is 
"Makefile")
With luck, make considers first "Makefile" name and then "makefile", but 
adding a little check should not be a big challenge.
If it should also be possible to use the capital name instead of the 
lower case one as default or at least letting the programmer to choose 
which name use (only in Windows this is not important)
