Something is certainly wrong and I don't think its my code. :-)

There's no way this optimization should slow the program down unless its=20
software rendered, and even then I'd be surprised because it avoids tens of=
=20
thousands of OCaml->C calls by keeping the vertex and texture data with the=
=20
driver.

=46or me, the extra 9 lines of code improve performance from 9 to 600fps!

Yes but the performance difference between texture objects and display list=
s=20
should be tiny compared to the difference with immediate mode, which is wha=
t=20
we're comparing here.
