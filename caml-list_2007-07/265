There's some code in COCANWIKI which does exactly this:

http://sandbox.merjis.com/release

Look at the file scripts/lib/wikilib.ml.

It's not a particularly clever implementation, but it has a great deal
of testing in the real world.

As well as <xml>-like syntax it also does a lot of standard wiki
syntax like '* ' for bullet points, paragraphs, indents for
preformatted sections and so on.  And it outputs pure unadulterated
XHTML.
