This is indeed logical but, even if Nicolas and Xavier would agree to
rename their camlp4, you would have to wait a release of OCaml.

Since I can make my releases independantly and fastly, I am ready to
change my camlp4 into camlp5, if everybody agrees, even if I have to
make also a release of all my sofwares, but it is not a big deal, and
things would be probably clearer like that.

On a too narrow street, when two vehicles arrive from opposite directions,
the lighter has to reverse. They are the lorry, I am the car, I can reverse.
