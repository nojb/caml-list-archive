I'm getting ready to release a little open source app I wrote in Ocaml.
This is a standalone app compiled with Ocaml.  I tried to read the license,
and between the "Q License" and the LGPL I'm not really sure what applies to
me.  I'm assuming the resulting binary links against LPGL code, so I need to
include at least that.

Can anyone tell me what I should put in my license file? Or should I just
paste in everything from the LICENSE document?
