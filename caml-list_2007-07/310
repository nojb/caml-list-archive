> How can I tell eclipse parser about my own camlp4 extension ?

For now, you can't. OcaIDE uses a custom parser written in Java,
copied from the rules of the original Ocaml parser. So, it only parses
standard syntax.
To parse a modified syntax, the file would first have to be processed
by camlp4.
But then, how would OcaIDE get the positions of the elements in the
original unprocessed file?

Custom makefile targets will be supported in a future version.

I think you know a lot more about camlp4 than I, so I guess you're right.

I don't use unison, so I can't help you.

I think this is more of a problem with darcs than with OcaIDE.

Usually, this happens the other way around: the Eclipse workspace does
not reflect changes on the file system until you refresh your
workspace in Eclipse.
