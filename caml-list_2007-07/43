Chess III Arena 0.5 is my first (allegedly) non-trivial app in OCaml.  It is
a fully functional chess game, although it lacks some desirable features
such as a computer opponent and network play at this point in time.  It uses
Quake III player models as the pieces.

Binaries for windows and source for other platforms are available at:

http://members.verizon.net/~olsongt/c3a/

I've also detailed some of the things I like about OCaml on that page, since
I don't write enough to have a blog, but I imagine I'm preaching to the
choir on this list.
