Subject: [Caml-list] TABLEAUX 2017 - 2nd Call for Papers


           SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

               TABLEAUX 2017
     26th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with
           Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods
          University of Brasilia, Brazil
               September 25-28, 2017

         Submission Deadline: 25 Apr 2017

          http://tableaux2017.cic.unb.br/


GENERAL INFORMATION
  TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research
  on all aspects, theoretical foundations, implementation techniques,
  systems development and applications, of the mechanization of
  tableau-based reasoning and related methods is presented. As
  the first TABLEAUX workshop was held in Lautenbach in 1992, this
  year's conference will include special events celebrating 25 years
  of TABLEAUX.

  The conference will be held in Brasilia from 25-28 September 2017.
  It will be co-located with both the 11th International Symposium
  on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2017) and the 8th
  International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP
  2017).

TOPICS
  Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for
  automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical
  logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large groups
  of logics, tableau methods can be generated automatically. Areas
  of application include verification of software and computer
  systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its
  required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.

  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

    * tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics
      (including first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal,
      description, hybrid, intuitionistic, substructural,
      relevance, non-monotonic logics) and their proof-theoretic
      foundations;
    * related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking,
      connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);
    * sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for classical
      and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and proof
      representation;
    * flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem
      proving;
    * novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification
      in classical and non-classical logics;
    * systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and
      applications (provers, logical frameworks, model checkers, ...);
    * implementation techniques (data structures, efficient
      algorithms, performance measurement, extensibility, ...);
    * extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven
      learning, generation of proofs; compact (or humanly readable)
      representation of proofs;
    * decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures;
    * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software
      development, verification, deductive and temporal
      databases, knowledge representation, ontologies, fault
      diagnosis or teaching.

  We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau
  procedures to real world examples. Such papers should be tailored
  to the tableau community and should focus on the role of
  reasoning, and logical aspects of the solution.

CELEBRATING 25 YEARS
  To celebrate 25 years TABLEAUX the conference will include a
  special session of invited talks by:

  Reiner Haehnle   Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Germany

  Details will be published in separate calls and on the conference
  website.

PUBLICATION DETAILS
  The conference proceedings will published in the Springer
  LNAI/LNCS series, as in previous editions.

SUBMISSIONS
  Submissions are invited in two categories:

    A  Research papers, which describe original theoretical
       research, original algorithms, or applications, with length
       up to 15 pages.
    B  System descriptions, with length up to 9 pages.

  Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of
  external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance
  and originality.

  For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be
  original, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions
  will be reviewed taking into account correctness, theoretical
  elegance, and possible implementability.

  For category B submissions, a working implementation must be
  accessible via the internet, which includes sources. The aim of a
  system description is to make the system available in such a way
  that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.

  Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the
  conference proceedings. Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the
  llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via
  the EasyChair system:
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtableaux2017.

  For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend
  the conference and present the paper. A paper title and a short
  abstract of about 100 words must be submitted before the paper
  submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions
  will be made available at the conference website. Be aware that
  neither plagiarism, nor self-plagiarism, nor duplicate publication
  is acceptable. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files
  can be obtained via

http://www.springer.com/br/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-gui=
delines

BEST PAPER AWARD
  The TABLEAUX 2017 Best Paper Award will be presented to the best
  submission nominated and chosen by the Program Committee among
  the accepted papers. The eligibility criteria will place emphasis
  on the originality and significance of the contribution, but
  readability and the overall technical quality, including correctness
  and completeness of results, will also be considered. The TABLEAUX
  Best Paper Award was established in 2015 and is a permanent
  initiative of TABLEAUX.
