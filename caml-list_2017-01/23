Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ppx_deriving question: deferring code generation?


Dear Christoph,

Interesting -- thanks for your reply. Although I did search for related ppx
plugins, I did not find yours.

At a glance, my plugin seems broadly analogous to yours; it also generates
"iter" (= "fold") and "map" visitors. It differs superficially in that 
it uses
OCaml objects instead of OCaml records. It differs perhaps more deeply 
in that
the generated code can have more varied types, beyond your "map_routine" and
"fold_routine". But I need to experiment more, and write more documentation,
before making a public release.
