GENERAL INFORMATION
   The 11th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
   (FroCoS 2017) will be held in Brasilia, Brazil, between September 25 to
   September 29, 2017. Its main goal is to disseminate and promote
   progress in research areas related to the development of techniques
   for the integration, combination, and modularization of formal
   systems together with their analysis.

   FroCoS 2017 will be co-located with the 26th International
   Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related
   Methods (TABLEAUX 2017) and the 8th International Conference on
   Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2017). The local organization of
   all events will be organised  by Claudia Nalon (USB, Brazil),
   Daniele Nantes (UnB, Brazil), Elaine Pimentel (UFRN, Brazil) and
   Joao Marcos (UFRN, Brazil).

SCOPE OF CONFERENCE
   In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,
   program development and verification, artificial intelligence,
   knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an
   obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems
   for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized
   systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general
   purpose systems. This has led---in many research areas---to the
   development of techniques and methods for the combination and
   integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their
   modularization and analysis.

   The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
   (FroCoS) traditionally focusses on these types of research questions
   and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2017 seeks to offer a
   common forum for research in the general area of combination,
   modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on
   logic-based ones, and of their practical use.

   Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
     * combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order,
       temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics);
     * combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving;
     * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability
       procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical
       frameworks;
     * combinations and modularity in ontologies;
     * integration of equational and other theories into deductive
       systems;
     * hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint
       propagation;
     * hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural
       language semantics;
     * combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems;
     * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and
       specifications;
     * integration of data structures into constraint logic
       programming and deduction;
     * combinations and modularity in term rewriting;
     * applications of methods and techniques to the verification and
       analysis of information systems.

INVITED SPEAKERS
     - Katalin Bimbo (University of Alberta, Canada) (joint with TABLEAUX 
and ITP)
     - Jasmin Blanchette (Inria and LORIA, Nancy, France) (joint with 
TABLEAUX and ITP)
     - Cezary Kaliszyk (University of Innsbruck, Austria) (joint with 
TABLEAUX and ITP)
     - Cesare Tinelli (University of Iowa, USA)
     - Renata Wassermann (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil)

PUBLICATION DETAILS
   The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the
   Springer LNAI/LNCS series.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
   The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing
   original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or
   simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with
   archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and
   originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and
   quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 16
   pages.

   Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be
   submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system at
   the following address:

         https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2017

   For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to
   attend the symposium and present the work. Prospective authors must
   register a title and an abstract five days before the paper
   submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions is
   available at the conference website that can be found at the
   beginning of this call for papers.

WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS
   Proposals for Workshops and Tutorial sessions have been solicited
   in a separate call, which can be found at
   http://frocos2017.cic.unb.br/#cfw.
