Subject: Re: [Caml-list] A question about Ocaml logging

I don't know if OCaml developers recommend a deprecation of camlp4,
but as far as camlp5 is concerned, I don't believe there is an
intention from his current main developer (who actually works in the
office next door to mine) to deprecate camlp5. My understanding is
even the opposite, that he would be happy that campl5 continues to
exist after him. What is not exclusive at all of using ppx of course!
There is a room for different approaches and different objectives!

Best,

Hugo
