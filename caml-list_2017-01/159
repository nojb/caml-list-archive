Subject: [Caml-list] cppo, ocamlbuild, and dependencies


Dear OCaml users,

I am trying to use cppo and ocamlbuild together.

Suppose the file a.cppo.ml contains the line:
   #include "b.cppo.ml".

Then, the build fails. As far as I understand, ocamlbuild is not aware 
of the
dependency a.cppo.ml -> b.cppo.ml, so the source file b.cppo.ml is not even
copied to the _build directory.

I am using the build rules bundled with cppo (in the module 
Ocamlbuild_cppo).

Shouldn't these build rules be improved so as to perform a genuine 
dependency
computation? Has anyone run into this issue?

Thanks,
