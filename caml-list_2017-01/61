Final Call for Papers - DEADLINE EXTENDED:

                             Workshop on
              Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems
                             (MARS 2017)

                       Affiliated With ETAPS 2017

                     April 29, 2017 Uppsala, Sweden

AIM:=20
Logics and techniques for automated reasoning have often been=20
developed with formal analysis and formal verification in mind.=20
To show applicability, toy examples or tiny case studies are=20
typically presented in research papers. Since the theory needs=20
to be developed first, this approach is reasonable.=20
   However, to show that a developed approach actually scales to=20
real systems, large case studies are essential. The development=20
of formal models of real systems usually requires a perfect=20
understanding of informal descriptions of the system - sometimes=20
found in RFCs or other standard documents - which are usually just=20
written in English. Based on the type of system, an adequate=20
specification formalism needs to be chosen, and the informal=20
specification translated into it. Examples for such formalisms=20
include process and program algebra, Petri nets, variations of=20
automata, as well as timed, stochastic and probabilistic=20
extensions of these formalisms. Abstraction from unimportant=20
details then yields an accurate, formal model of the real system.
   The process of developing a detailed and accurate model usually=20
takes a large amount of time, often months or years; without even=20
starting a formal analysis. When publishing the results on a formal=20
analysis in a scientific paper, details of the model have to be skipped=20
due to lack of space, and often the lessons learnt from modelling are=20
not discussed since they are not the main focus of the paper.
   The workshop aims at discussing exactly these unmentioned lessons.=20
Examples are:
  * Which formalism is chosen, and why?
  * Which abstractions have to be made and why?
  * How are important characteristics of the system modelled?
  * Were there any complications while modelling the system?
  * Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?

The workshop emphasises modelling over verification. In particular,=20
we invite papers that present full Models of Real Systems, which may=20
lay the basis for future formal analysis. The workshop will bring=20
together researchers from different communities that all aim at verifying=20
real systems and are developing formal models for such systems. Areas where=
=20
large models often occur are within networks, (trustworthy) systems and=20
software verification (from byte code up to programming- and specification=
=20
languages). An aim of the workshop is to present different modelling=20
approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them.


SUBMISSION:

Submissions must be unpublished and not be submitted for publication elsewh=
ere.=20
Contributions are limited to 12 pages EPTCS style (not counting the appendi=
ces),=20
but shorter extended abstracts are welcome. Appendices (of arbitrary length=
) can=20
be used to present all details of a formalised model; the appendices will b=
e part=20
of the proceedings. In case a formal model is presented that is modelled in=
 some=20
formalism or tool, such as timed automata for Uppaal or formal proofs for I=
sabelle/HOL,=20
these models have to be submitted as well. They will be published as part o=
f the=20
proceedings, and will be made available in our Repository of Models for For=
mal=20
Analysis of Real Systems (http://mars-workshop.org/repository.html).
Submissions must be in English and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair
(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dmars2017).=20
   All submissions will be peer reviewed by at least three referees based o=
n their=20
novelty, relevance and technical merit. The proceedings (including the elec=
tronic=20
models) will be published as part of the open access series Electronic Proc=
eedings=20
in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS).


IMPORTANT DATES (AoE):

 * Submission: Friday 20 January 2017 (extended deadline)
 * Notification: Monday 13 February 2017
 * Final version: Monday 27 February 2017
 * Workshop: Saturday 29 April 2017=20
