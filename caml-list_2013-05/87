Subject: [Caml-list] DBPL 2013 - Second Call for Papers

                    The 14th International Symposium
                   on Database Programming Languages
                        http://dbpl2013.inria.fr
                     Riva del Garda, Trento, Italy
                            August 30, 2013
                       co-located with VLDB 2013
                                    
                            Call for Papers

For over 25 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue
for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of
databases and programming languages. Many key contributions in query
languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested
relational data, and semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas
in types for query languages, were first announced at DBPL. Today, the
emergence of new data management applications such as cloud computing
and “big data,” social network analysis, bidirectional programming,
and data privacy has lead to a new flurry of creative research in this
area, as well as a tremendous amount of activity in industry. DBPL is
an established destination for such new ideas.


Scope
-----

  DBPL solicits practical and theoretical papers in all topics at the
  intersection of databases and programming languages. Papers
  emphasizing new topics or emerging areas are especially welcome.
  Suggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest for submissions
  include:

  - Bidirectional programming languages
  - Data exchange and data integration
  - Data privacy
  - Data provenance
  - Databases and the semantic web
  - Databases and social networking
  - Databases and cloud computing
  - Databases in electronic commerce
  - Deductive databases and logic programming
  - Information-flow type systems
  - Language-integrated query mechanisms
  - Managing uncertain and imprecise information
  - Programming language support for databases
  - Streaming data processing
  - Schema mappings and metadata management
  - Security in data management
  - Semi-structured data and XML
  - Validation and type-checking
  - Web services


Author Guidelines
-----------------

  Prospective authors are invited to submit papers in English presenting
  original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not
  submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions should be no more
  than 10 pages long in the [ACM SIGPLAN] format.

  Each submission should begin with a succinct statement of the problem
  and a summary of the main results. If the authors believe more details
  are necessary to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may
  include a clearly marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the
  committee. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the
  symposium to present their work.

  Papers must be submitted online at the following URL:
