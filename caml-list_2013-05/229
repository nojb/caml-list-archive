There is the scheme shell for sysadmin tasks: scsh.
Packages are available on most distros.
There is also a partial OCaml clone: http://pauillac.inria.fr/cash/

I never used any of them, just know they exist.
As a student, I was amazed by the scsh paper.
I think it was an ICFP one.

I will come back to the book.

I wish I would have started with it.
