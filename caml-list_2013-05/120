4.00.1 (released) is not the same as 4.01.  Try:

$ opam switch 4.01.0dev+trunk

...which will give you a trunk compiler with all of the ARM fixes included.
Benedikt has committed several more fixes since the original one, so trunk
is generally in much better shape.  These changes will be in OCaml-4.1 when
it's released.
