I think each of them serve different purpose (e.g. computational trade-offs=
 on embedded platforms) that's the reason why these things are best left ou=
tside gg for now.=20=20

I don't plan to integrate these things, no pull requests please. At a certa=
in point I was planning to but it was becoming unwieldy -- remnant of these=
 ideas can be seen in the tmp/ directory of the first commit. Gg provides y=
ou with the essentials to do 2D or 3D computer graphics. Sizes and rectangl=
es are ubiquitous: viewports, image extents, etc. and that's the reason the=
y are in. More general computational geometry tools are best left to anothe=
r dedicated library.

Regarding the internal representation I still have to think about what I wi=
ll do. Gg is designed to interoperate with C so that means that the represe=
ntation will be cast in stone anyways.

Well, no=E2=80=A6 it's horrible to read, hard to remember and inconsistent:=
 if you look at all the other vector types in Gg their coordinate accessors=
 all have a single letter V2.{x,y}, P2.{x,y}, V3.{x,y,z}, P3.{x,y,z}, V4.{x=
,y,z,w}, Color.{r,g,b,a}, Quat.{x,y,z,w}. Having Size2.{w,h} and Size3.{w,h=
,d} feels natural.=20=20

I certainly don't assume that. I do however program and design to my taste,=
 not by consensus or compromise.

Best,

Daniel
