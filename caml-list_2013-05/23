::: ECSCW 2013 ::: Call for Work-in-Progress

The 13th European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (ECSCW =
2013)

21-25 September 2013, Paphos, Cyprus

http://www.ecscw2013.org/

Work In Progress is a new peer reviewed submission category for ECSCW 2013.

The purpose of Work-in-Progress is to allow the community to participate in=
 an
interactive event at ECSCW, where participants have an opportunity to prese=
nt
and discuss their current work and early results. Work-in-Progress sessions
provide a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, for getting early
feedback on current work and preliminary results, and fostering discussions
and collaborations among colleagues.

Work in progress papers will be published in ECSCW 2013 Proceedings Volume 2
(previously known as the conference supplement), printed in the Aarhus
University, Department of Computer Science Report Series and available for
the conference participants as well as on the EUSSET online library.


IMPORTANT DATES

=B7	Submission Deadline: 15 June 2013 (5:00pm PDT) using EasyChair
=B7	Notification Date: 26 July 2013
=B7	Camera-Ready Deadline: 09 August 2013


FORMAT

A Work-in-Progress submission is a six-page extended abstract prepared in
the ECSCW format (author kits and paper templates available for Word, PDF,
and LaTeX) and submitted as a PDF file, via the EasyChair submission system.

Your extended abstract should be camera-ready and thoroughly copy-edited.
Work-in-Progress submissions are not anonymous and should therefore include
all author names, affiliations and contact information.

Due to the short review cycle, there should be nearly no changes between
your submissions and the camera-ready final documents, except in rare
circumstances.


SELECTION PROCESS

Work-in-Progress submissions will be selected by the ECSCW Program Committe=
e.
The process has been designed to acknowledge the early-stage nature of the =
work.
Work-in-Progress authors will be notified of acceptance. If a submission is
accepted to appear at the conference, the contact person will receive furth=
er
instructions regarding the inclusion of their extended abstract in the
Vol. 2 Proceedings, as well as instructions for the presentation at the con=
ference.
Copyright is retained by the authors, and the material from them can be use=
d as
the basis for future publications.


WHAT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS?

A Work-in-Progress is a concise report of recent findings or other types of
innovative or thought-provoking work relevant to the ECSCW community.  A
significant benefit of a Work-in-Progress derives from the discussion betwe=
en
the author and conference attendees that will be fostered by the face-to-fa=
ce
presentation of the work.

This submission category aims to attract participation from a broad range of
disciplines covering a spectrum of topics and methodologies. Submissions may
include, but are not limited to, the following types of work: description of
original CSCW systems, descriptions of new concepts, methods or techniques,
for use in CSCW, studies on collective practices, systems in use ...


AT THE CONFERENCE

Authors will be expected to attend the conference and will be assigned a ti=
me
and location in the program to present their work to conference attendees d=
uring
Interactive Sessions. Work-in-progress submissions whose authors are not at=
 the
conference to present will be withdrawn from the EUSSET online library.
