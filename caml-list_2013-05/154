This reasonable critique has lead to a lot of modern forms of development
which means to a programmer, to change the overall direction of a project
from week to week.
"Oh, we have not taken into account the following", because no planning
or market research or customer inquiry was done in advance. Instead of
this minimal planning, in the middle of the project anything will be changed...
...more than once... and the project will take a multiple of the
time that was first talked about.

So, it's not always the bad specifications.
It also can be missing of specifications, or missing of the
overall goal of a project.

So, there are many causes, why a project can be handled ugly...

To follow a specification is not eveil in itself.
