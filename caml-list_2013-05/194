I find other media not quite as good for discussions as the usenet, and a good news
reader, and I am reading this list on gmane.org. There is comp.lang.ml on usenet,
this would fit Ocaml.

Where is it? I did not find that yet, I only get "why is scilab not written in ocaml"
when searching...

hint, hint! Yes, sure. I was looking for tools that would insert the example code
into the document, run it, and insert the result as well, some sort of advanced
literate programming.
