Subject: Re: Problems to get larger user base ... (Re: [Caml-list] OCaml's
 variables)

By the way, is there some plan to support binary packages
at some point in time with OPAM?

I don't mean OCamlPro distributing them but for an OPAM
user to be able to create them locally.

That would speedup the process of installing software (given they
have at least been compiled once).

Regards,
F.
