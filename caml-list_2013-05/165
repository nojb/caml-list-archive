If you think of functions as equations, non-constant values are variables.

Imperative languages don't get to claim the term just because they misused =
it
for a long time ;)

Think of the word "hacker" - it was hijacked and misused for a while, but I
feel like it has mostly been recovered these days. Perhaps we can recover t=
he
accepted meaning of variables if we consistently contrast them with referen=
ce
cells.
