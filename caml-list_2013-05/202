Honestly, I think "Part I An introduction to OCaml"
from "The OCaml system release 4.00
Documentation and userâ€™s manual"
at
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/
is enough for a start.

I think you can even skip the Objects chapter in there.
And that's only pages 9 to 33 in the PDF version of the document.
