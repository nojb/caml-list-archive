::: ECSCW 2013 ::: Call for Demonstrations & Videos

The 13th European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work (ECSCW =
2013)

21-25 September 2013, Paphos, Cyprus

http://www.ecscw2013.org/


Live demonstrations and videos form an important part of the technical conf=
erence
programme. Demonstrations of both research prototypes and commercial produc=
ts by
those directly involved in developing the systems are welcomed. The purpose=
 of
this track is to provide the authors with the ability to demonstrate their =
creative
designs and novel groupware developments, to describe more about their rese=
arch and
results to interested delegates, and to involve them in discussions about t=
heir work,
exchanging ideas, providing feedback, as well as sharing work-in-progress.

Authors submitting a paper to ECSCW 2013 conference may consider submitting=
 the same
work to Demos & Videos, for example if they want to provide a demonstration=
 for an
accepted paper. Please note that a separate submission must be made.

The submissions for Demos & Videos must be related to the topics of interes=
t of the
ECSCW 2013 main research tracks (http://ecscw2013.cs.ucy.ac.cy/index.php?p=
=3DCallForPapers).
Submissions should include a short two page paper, including all figures, r=
eferences and
a 50 word max. abstract.  It should explicitly state the contribution and o=
riginality of
the work, making it clear how it differs from significant prior work. A ful=
l literature
review is not required.

All submissions should be formatted according to the ECSCW formatting instr=
uctions:
(http://ecscw2013.cs.ucy.ac.cy/templates.zip) and submitted via EasyChair
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Decscw2013).

All submissions should be accompanied by an Exhibition Plan (in MSWord form=
at),
describing technical requirements (e.g. exceptional power (V), dimensions a=
nd footprint
of exhibit (cm), lighting conditions, internet connectivity). A power strip=
 (230V),
a poster board (A1), and an ordinary table will be provided. Additional equ=
ipment must
be supplied by the demonstrator unless explicitly confirmed otherwise by th=
e organisers.

The Demos & Videos papers will be published in ECSCW 2013 Proceedings Volum=
e 2
(previously known as the conference supplement). Volume 2 will be printed i=
n the
Aarhus University, Department of Computer Science Report Series and will be=
 available
in printed form for the conference participants as well as online.
