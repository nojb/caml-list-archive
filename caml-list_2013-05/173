I agree with everyone else, this is a completely legitimate use of the
word "variable."

As a native english speaker who learned OCaml at a younger age, I
don't think the manual should be changed because a beginner might
confuse the term "variable" with the name of the thing in C.

By the way, when you say:

The person saying this will be incorrect for a number of reasons:
 1. OCaml *does* have mutable values,
 2. The type of FP you emphasize would be more correctly (to
disambiguate from OCaml) as purely functional programming
 3. The term variable doesn't make sense here anyway, in FP there are
tons of variables just as there are in all of mathematics.  What
purely functional programming lacks is a notion of mutable state in
its operational semantics: you can still add them via monads (of
course).
