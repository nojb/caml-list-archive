Subject: [Caml-list] CICLOPS 2013 - Second Call For Papers


                   CICLOPS 2013 - Call for Papers
                   ==============================

                  13th International Colloquium on
     Implementation of Constraint and LOgic Programming Systems

                 http://akira.ruc.dk/~cth/ciclops13

                Istanbul, Turkey, August 24/25, 2013
                      Co-located with ICLP 2013



Important Dates
===============

Abstract Submission: June 1, 2013
Paper Submission:    June 8, 2013
Notification:        July 1, 2013
Camera-ready:       July 13, 2013
Workshop:      August 24/25, 2013



Topics of Interest
==================

CICLOPS is a well established line of workshops. This will be the 13th
edition in a successful series of workshops which is traditionally
co-located with ICLP. The CICLOPS workshop aims at discussing and
exchanging experience on the design, implementation, and optimization
of constraint and logic programming systems, and other systems based
on logic as a means of expressing computations. Preference will be
given to the description and analysis of real implementations and
their evaluation, problems found in their design, steps taken towards
the solutions, as well as descriptions of work in progress in that
direction. The workshop topics include, but are not limited to:

* Design and implementation of sequential, concurrent and distributed
  constraint and logic programming systems.
* Compile-time analysis and balance between compile-time effort and
  run-time machinery, dynamic compilation.
* Interaction between high-level optimizations / transformations /
  specialization and low-level issues.
* Memory management, garbage collection, indexing techniques and
  optimizations for large size programs.
* Implementation of logic engines in functional and object oriented
  languages.
* Embedding of constraint and logic programming engines in
  multi-paradigm systems.
* Implementation techniques for alternative logic engines and
  inference mechanisms (ASP, SAT, QSAT, DL etc.).
* Implementation of theorem provers, proof assistants and logic based
  natural language processing systems.
* Object and module systems.
* Design and implementation of declarative I/O concepts for constraint
  and logic programming languages.
* Documenting, debugging, testing, and profiling tools for constraint
  and logic programming systems.



Submission Information
======================

Authors are invited to submit papers in PDF using the Springer LNCS
LaTeX format. Submissions must be written in English, not exceed 15
pages, and describe new, original and unpublished research results or
work in progress. Submissions will be handled by the EasyChair
conference system at:

   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciclops2013

We plan for the informal workshop proceedings to be available on-line
at the Computing Research Repository (CoRR) after the workshop. An
electronic copy will also be distributed during the conference.
