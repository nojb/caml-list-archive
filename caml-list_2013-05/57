I do understand.
But what I was trying to explain is that I usually have 2 or 3 or even
more modules/components/libs each using 3D coordinates.
Then it is easy to exchange values that are (float * float * float).
Anything else makes things difficult for exchanges and needs to be converte=
d.

Indeed, your page is the first one I see with transparent background.
It is not recommended to define text color without background color.
If the default browser background color is black one would see nothing.

I know, this is the same for me.

I was thinking to group html api-docs of many libs together (and maybe
even keep all recent versions of the libs) with a css switcher
(probably hosted on the ocaml forge). I even thought about a name like
"ocamldoc-zen-garden" (inspired from "css-zen-garden"). What would you
think about such an idea?

I would enjoy to know which of these you are considering.

A very good link, thanks a lot!
There's a huge amount of content, could you share which you think
would be the more interesting for reuse in OCaml?

It seems logic to me to do it the way you've made it.
I would only comment that if you add Sizes, BBoxes, then why not also
bounding-cirlces / bounding-spheres, complete math for geometry with
points, lines, planes, etc. (distances, intersections, projections,
etc.)

The internal representations for vectors and points are not public,
which would imply to integrate these inside your module. Would you
accept pull requests for these, or you want to keep the current
minimalism?

Maybe a compromise could be found,
between one letter function names:

Size3.w
Size3.h
Size3.d

and complete names:

Size3.width
Size3.height
Size3.depth

could be 3 letters abbreviations:

Size3.wid
Size3.hei
Size3.dep

I would recommend not to assume that everyone share the same cognition
and tastes than you.
