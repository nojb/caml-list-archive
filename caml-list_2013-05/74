Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Papers: Workshop on Functional Art, Music,
 Modeling, and Design (colocated with ICFP)

======================================================================
		      FARM 2013: Call for Papers

  ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design
		      Boston, Massachusetts, USA
	      28th September, 2013 (directly after ICFP)

	      http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/farm13/
======================================================================

Scope
-----

The functional programming community is largely interested in writing
beautiful programs. This workshop is intended to gather researchers and
practitioners interested in writing beautiful programs that generate
beautiful artifacts. Such artifacts may include visual art, music, 3D
sculptures, animations, GUIs, video games, physical models,
architectural models, choreographies for dance, poetry, and even
physical objects such as VLSI layouts, GPU configurations, or mechanical
engineering designs. The framework used need not be purely functional
(“mostly functional” is fine); may be based on abstractions such as
higher-order functions, monads, arrows, or streams; and may be
manifested as a domain specific language or tool. Theoretical
foundations, language design, implementation issues, and applications
are all within the scope of the workshop.

Important dates
---------------

  - Submissions due: Friday, 14 June 2013, 23:59 UTC-11 (American Samoa
    time [1])

  - Author notification: Thursday, 11 July 2013

  - Final papers due: Thursday, 25 July 2013

  - Workshop: Saturday, 28 September 2013 (the day after ICFP)

[1] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=FARM+submissions+due&iso=20130614T2355&p1=1033

Proceedings
-----------

There will be a formal proceedings published by ACM Press. Accepted
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library; see
http://authors.acm.org/main.cfm for information on the options available
to authors. Authors are also encouraged to submit auxiliary material for
publication along with their paper (source code, data, videos, images,
etc.); authors retain all rights to the auxiliary material.

Submission details
------------------

We solicit submissions in two categories:

  - Full papers. A full paper is limited to 12 pages, and will be
    evaluated according to its relevance, correctness, significance,
    originality, and clarity. It should explain its contributions,
    identify what has been accomplished, explain why it is significant,
    and compare it with previous work.

  - "Aesthetic applications". An aesthetic application paper is limited
    to 6 pages, and will be judged primarily on the effective and
    elegant use of FP to generate aesthetic artifacts (though the
    criteria for full papers are still relevant).

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. The text should be in a 9-point
font in two columns.

Submissions can be made via EasyChair at

  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=farm2013
