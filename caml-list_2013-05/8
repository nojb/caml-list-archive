                               Call For Papers

                                 - SSS 2013 -

                       15th International Symposium on
          Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems
                   http://www-masu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/sss2013/

                 November 13-16, 2013, Osaka, Japan
******************************************************************************

SSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the design
and development of distributed systems with self-* properties such as self-
stabilizing, self-configuring, self-organizing, self-managing, self-repairing,
self-healing, self-optimizing, self-adaptive, and self-protecting. Research in
distributed systems is now at a crucial point in its evolution, marked by the
importance of dynamic systems such as peer-to-peer networks,
large-scale wireless
sensor networks, mobile ad hoc networks, robotic networks,
opportunistic networks
etc. Moreover, new applications such as grid and web services, banking and
e-commerce, e-health and robotics, aerospace and avionics, automotive,
industrial
process control, etc. have joined the traditional applications of distributed
systems. We particularly encourage the submissions spanning these areas of
applications.

The conference provides a wide spectrum of topics, covered in the following
tracks:
 * Self-stabilization
 * Fault-tolerance and Dependability
 * Formal Methods and Distributed Systems
 * Ad-hoc, Sensors, Mobile Agents and Robot Networks
 * P2P, Social, Self-organizing, Autonomic and Opportunistic Networks

IMPORTANT DATES
 * Abstract Submission: July 10, 2013
 * Paper Submission: July 15, 2013
 * Notification: August 25, 2013
 * Camera Ready Submission: August 31, 2013


PAPER SUBMISSION
 Papers must be prepared using the LNCS style and be electronically submitted in
 PDF format using EasyChair
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2013).
 Two types of papers can be submitted: Regular Papers and Brief Announcements.
 Submissions for regular papers should be no longer than 15 pages (including the
 title, authors, abstract, figures, and references) in LNCS style; a submission
 may have an appendix of at most two pages beyond the 15 page limit. Brief
 announcements are restricted to two pages using the LNCS style, with
no appendix.
 Submissions deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without
consideration
 of their merits. If requested by the authors, a regular submission that is not
 selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for a
brief announcement.
 This request must be clearly indicated in the first page of the paper.
 Such a request will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular paper.
 A paper submitted at this forum is expected to be original research
not previously
 published. A submission may not be concurrently submitted to another
conference,
 workshop, or journal.


PUBLICATION
 The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer
Verlag Lecture
 Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.Selected papers will be
published in the
 Journal of Self-Computing (http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/jsc).

BEST PAPER AND BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARDS
 The program committee will select two papers for best paper and best
student paper
 awards. A paper is eligible for the best student paper award if at least one of
 its authors is a full-time student at the time of submission. This
must be clearly
 indicated in the first page of the paper.

CONFERENCE VENUE
 SSS 2013 will take place at Osaka Univesity Convention Center.
