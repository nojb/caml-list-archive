Let's step back and decompose your email:

"easier for starters": OPAM doesn't require root, and installs in $HOME/.op=
am.  All state is in here, so it's easy to reset.  It's hard to get easier =
than this out-of-the-box.

Yet you object earlier that ease of use is not a goal by somehow thinking t=
hat "Linux is a server".  Note that OPAM is a *source* package manager inte=
nded for day-to-day development, and does not replace the excellent binary =
Debs and RPMs maintained by OS packagers.  OPAM fits the needs of a develop=
er who needs to pin and recompile libraries and packages frequently.

If you 'man opam' and read the resulting page, notice that there is a "-r R=
OOT" option to override the default `~/.opam` directory, or an equivalent O=
PAMROOT environment variable.  Both of these are sufficient to enable a sys=
tem-wide install, assuming appropriate UNIX permissions.

Linux server administration does require you to read manual pages and hunt =
around a little for most things, and perhaps write a few shell scripts to g=
lue stuff together. Should I conclude that you're a toy developer from your=
 inability to read the man page?
