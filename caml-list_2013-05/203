Very good indeed; it sufficed for me to write several useful programs

Agreed again; I am not sure of fundamental advantages of objects that you c=
an't get from GADTs.
But that brings me to the following text in ( http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs=
/manual-ocaml/language.html ):

=85 the typing rules have been left out, by lack of the mathematical framew=
ork required to express them, while they are definitely part of a full form=
al definition of the language ...

Someone contemplating investing the attention of a programming team will wo=
nder where the rest of the manual is.
A pointer would suffice; if there is nothing on the web to point to we may =
have part of an answer to the question about the larger user base.
Such a team needs at least one "language lawyer" I have found.
Must the typing rules be expressed formally?

Even a specification of a powerful subset of OCaml would be possible even i=
f it did not encompass every possible correct program.
A step up would specify the meaning of every program that the compiler acce=
pted.
