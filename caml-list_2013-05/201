As language introduction it is too much text.
It is meant as introduction to computer science.
AFAIK scheme was developed for this task.

The scheme standard is not so hard to read, and it has only 50 pages.
Thats IMHO better if someone looks for a introduction to the language
only.

For comparison: OCaml ref-man: 554 pages and IMHO not a good starting
point. IMHO better are some of the introductional books out there,
e.g. OCaml-Ora-book and jason Hickeys book.
After that then the Refman.
