FOCLASA 2013: The 13th International Workshop on
Foundations of Coordination Languages and Self Adaptive Systems

http://foclasa.lcc.uma.es/

September 11, 2013, Malaga (Spain)
In conjunction with ESOCC 2013 -- http://esocc2013.lcc.uma.es/
=================================================================

FOCLASA 2013 is a workshop co-located with the European Conference on
Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing (ESOCC 2013). The goal of the FOCLASA
workshop is to put together researchers and practitioners to identify common
problems, and to devise general solutions in the context of coordination
languages and self-adaptive systems.

== IMPORTANT DATES ==

Abstract submission: June  9th, 2013
   Paper submission: June 14th, 2013
       Notification: July 16th, 2013
      Final version: July 25th, 2013

== TOPICS OF INTEREST ==

  * Theoretical models and frameworks for component and service coordination,
    service composition, service adaptation and concurrent system modeling.
  * Applications and usability studies for the aforementioned theoretical
    models, interaction and coordination challenges in various application
    domains.
  * Languages and specification protocols for component and service
    interaction, their semantics, expressiveness, validation and verification,
    type checking, static and dynamic analysis.
  * "Software as a service" models (e.g., cloud computing) and dynamic
    software architectures, such as self-adaptive and self-organizing systems.
  * Tools and environments for the development of concurrent and customizable
    self- monitoring, self-adaptive and self-organizing applications.
  * Algorithms, mathematical models and realization frameworks for
    quality-of-service observation, storage, history-based analysis in
    self-adaptive systems (queuing models, load balancing, fault-tolerance
    analysis, machine learning systems).

In particular, practice, experience and methodologies from the following areas
are solicited as well:

  * Business process modeling Cloud computing Service-oriented computing
  * Component-based systems Grid computing Large-scale distributed systems
  * Multi-agent systems Peer-to-peer systems

Survey works analysing and comparing literature on the topics of FOCLASA are
also welcome.

== PAPER SUBMISSION ==

Submissions must describe authors' original research work and their results.
Description of work-in- progress with concrete results is also encouraged. The
contributions should not exceed 15 pages and should be submitted as Portable
Document Format (PDF) files using the EasyChair submission site:

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=foclasa2013

Accepted papers will be published in joint postproceedings of ESOCC workshops
in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS)
series.  For more details on the series and publication process please refer to
Springer's CCIS series webpage (http://www.springer.com/series/7899). Springer
conference paper templates can be found at the author's instruction page
(http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).

Submitting an abstract does not put any obligation on the authors to submit a
full paper. Abstracts without an accompanying full paper by the paper
submission deadline are automatically considered withdrawn. The authors are,
however, encouraged to explicitly withdraw their abstract, if they decide not
to submit a full paper.

All submissions will be reviewed by an international program committee who
will make a selection among the submissions based on the novelty, soundness
and applicability of the presented ideas and results. Concurrent submission to
other venues (conferences, workshops or journal) and submission of papers
under consideration elsewhere are not allowed. A printed version of the
proceedings will be distributed among participants during the workshop. The
proceedings of the workshop will be published as a separate volume or as part
of joint ESSOC workshop proceedings. Participants will give a presentation of
their papers in twenty minutes, followed by a ten-minute round of questions
and discussion on participants' work. Following the tradition of the past
editions, we plan to have a special issue of an international scientific
journal devoted to FOCLASA 2013. Selected participants will be invited to
submit an extended version of their papers after the workshop. These extended
versions will be reviewed by an international program committee, which will
decide on their final publication on the special issue. In the last few
editions of FOCLASA, a special issue of Science of Computer Programming has
been dedicated to this workshop.
