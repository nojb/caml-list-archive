We are indeed in the process of experimenting with that idea (see [1]). Not=
hing is ready yet, but that's definitely something we are interested in.

The hard part is (as always) to keep track of the correct external dependen=
cies (such as the available shared C libraries available at the time of bui=
ld). A good first approximation is to say that the external dependencies ne=
ver change, but that's obviously not very safe to rely on that assumption t=
oo much, so we are thinking of keeping track of the result given by ldd as =
well.

Best,
Thomas
