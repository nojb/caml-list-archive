Thanks for pointing the issue. I answerd on the mailing list without 
consulting the project site.

Each application has a good reason for beiing installed directly in the 
~ directory. But in a deskop usage (server is different), this finaly 
create a big polution in the user directory. The xdg try to define a 
general usage for preventing this.

This is a more general problem : exporting the configuration from one 
site to another one, or versionning the opam conf in a production server 
is greatly facilitated if the configuration is located in a dedicated 
path.

The main advantage I can see with the xdg path is that the 
configuration path is declared before installing anything, and can be 
configured once for a whole system. This allow to configure differents 
workspace just by sourcing a bash file ; as I can do with findlib and 
${OCAMLFIND_CONF}

I think you can get as many pros as cons, but today, the xdg path is a 
standard in a desktop…
