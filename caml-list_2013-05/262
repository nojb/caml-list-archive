Here is the early result of playing with this:
http://www.linux-nantes.org/%7Efmonnier/ocaml/opam/wrap-rpm/
you can see it's only the opam package wrapped inside a .spec file.

A more clean solution would of course to make an opam2spec script to
really create a .spec file that would look very close to a human made
.spec file. But I think that this second solution would need more
human work thant the dirty one. This second would maybe even take as
many time as if it's completely made by hand because there would be
more details to edit I think.

And the dirty wrap method has also the advantage to stay very close to
the original one.

> Will this procedure be automated?

This one seems to give an acceptable result.
(only README LICENSE and api-doc are missing)
I guess this one could be used as a template by a script for the others.

need to add the homepages and licenses fields in opam files if we want
this script to be able to fill the equivalent fields of the .spec
files.
Also the C lib dependency needs to be found to add the BuildRequires fields.
Otherwise it seems that most of it can be automated.
