You really seem to like it ;-)

Possibly yes, not sure.
At least it makes it easier to start.
I was very happy about the books I mentioned, when starting with OCaml.
(Don't rmember, if the introduction in the reference manual was there in early
days also, or if it was added after I first looked at OCaml.
But the concepts were explained good in the OCaml-ora book, which was the first(?)
I read on OCaml, I think.)

The point I liked in Jason Hickeys book was, that it covers
printing of data, even only in a later chapter.
And for me input/output was more clearly explained there than in e.g. the OCaml-Ora-book.

For academics input/output might be not necessary ;-) because it's enough to
see the functionality is proven by the toplevel; but for people who want to see
results early and do some real-world programming for exploration and
self-motivation ("it works!"), it's necessary to have input/output soon.
E.g. doing some stuff in OCaml, that already is done in bash or Perl
is a good way of self selected examples to learn a new language.

  "How would it look like in OCaml?"

  "Does it really bring advantages to switch to OCaml?"

  "OCaml seems to be good for big projects, but for scripting small tools maybe
   too much effort to get something that works."

Were some questions I had.

And the answer for the third question was for a long time: "No, OCaml is only good for big projects."
It took a while to also use it for smaller tasks.
One reason was, to become used to the language, another was, to find
libraries like ocaml-pcre, that also would allow to do perlish tasks...

If the goal is to attract more people to OCaml, it should be done easy to
solve real-world tasks even as beginner.
So, input/output must be mentioned early and libs like Str and pcre-ocaml
should be mentioned early also, and examples should be shown.

I also had the goal to attract people to OCaml, years ago.
Today it's not necessary to me to have more OCaml-prorammers around me.
I use OCaml for my own stuff, and if the jobs affords C, Perl, Python,
I possibly will mention OCaml, but don't dream about decision makers
really to adopt it.
I stopped dreaming about this issue.

Ciao,
   Oliver
