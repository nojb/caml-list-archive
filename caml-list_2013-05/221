As I said, I did not find "-r ROOT", and asked about it. And is "-r ROOT" a=
 good
choice (only for root? root dir?), or could it read system wide install or =
so, and
where is the dialog to choose the installation style?

Did you forget the use of Ocaml as scripting language?

Sorry for the word "toy", I knew it is a bit strong, but fits my experience=
. The
subject I am talking about is usability.
