Subject: [Caml-list] RR2013 conference: TRAVEL GRANTS for US students
 available

We are happy to inform that this year the NSF provides support to U.S. 
students for attending RR2013.

In order to apply for a grant, students need to send an email to 
pascal@pascal-hitzler.de with subject "NSF GRANT RR2013" and attach a 
single PDF form with the following information:

Section A: Applicant details, included name and affiliation, 
(preliminary) title of the PhD Thesis, year of PhD, title and authors 
(in the correct order) of paper accepted to RR2012 (if any), whether the 
applicant is attending the Reasoning Web Summer School as well.

Section B: Minimum amount of support requested, with a brief 
justification. This amount indicates the minimum amount of support 
needed to attend the conference. We intend to give awards of at least 
$1,500 each.

Section C: Short motivation statement (max 250 words) for applying.

The deadline for applying to the student grants is June 5, 2013.

Students applying for the grant can wait for a response and register 
when they know the result. The early registration period will be 
extended for all applicants.

Notice that grants are not limited to students that have a paper or 
doctoral consortium poster accepted at the conference. Also, we 
encourage students from adjacent fields to apply for a grant to take 
part to RR, to foster interdisciplinary dialogue.

We would appreciate it a lot, if you could forward the info on grant 
applications to those among your contacts who might be interested.

Best regards,

RR-13 chairs
