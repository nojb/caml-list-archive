Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml's variables

The name "variable" has been used for centuries by the mathematicians
to denote exactly names that refer to values (of course immutable
values, we're talking about mathematical objects her). There is no
point in trying to change it because some people conflate this notion
with mutability.

(When you write (x + 1), the value denoted by "x" is an unknown that
depends on the context/environment; in particular it may vary when
used in different contexts.)

The name "variable" is also used in the expression "type variable",
which denotes for example the 'a in
  val id : 'a -> 'a
and which is clearly not associated to any form of mutation.
