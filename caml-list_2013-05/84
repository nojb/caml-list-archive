CiE serves as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects
of computability and foundations of computer science, as well as the
interplay of these theoretical areas with practical issues in computer
science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics,
philosophy, or physics.

Women in Computability Workshop,  July 2, 2013:

We continue the programme "Women in Computability" supported by the
journal "Annals of Pure and Applied Logic" (Elsevier).

Speakers: Irene Finocchi,  Laxmi Parida, Liesbeth De Mol

The Women in Computability workshop aims to bring together women in
Computing and Mathematical research to present and exchange their academic
and scientific experience with young researchers. The meeting will offer
the CIE scientific community the opportunity to encourage young students,
especially young female researchers, to have active careers in the
mathematical and computational sciences.

INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:
Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, this year's CiE
conference endeavours to get the best of both worlds. In addition to 
the formal presentations based on our LNCS proceedings volume, we invite 
researchers to present informal presentations. For this, please send us a 
brief description of your talk (between one paragraph and one page) by the 
DEADLINE:

MAY 31, 2013

Please submit your abstract electronically, via EasyChair
<https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=cie2013>, selecting the category
"Informal Presentation".

You will be notified whether your talk has been accepted for informal
presentation usually within a week after your submission.

**** Also authors of abstracts accepted for presentation are invited to
submit a paper extending the abstract to the journal Computability ****
