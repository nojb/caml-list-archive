Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml's variables

Hello,

but the that argument also holds true for other lists.
They are finite, but every element of the posisble holds a new value.
But the name for a list binds to that list, not to individual values.
That they are recursive in the case of page 136 does not change this.

Finite lists hold finite number of posisbly different values.
Infinite lists hold infinite number of possible different values.

I see no reason, why the finite list must be seen as key-value binding,
but the infinite list can be seen as variable.
Once the name is bound to both these kinds of lists,
they don't change.

Compared to this, a reference would have more entitlement to be seen as
"variable".

Ciao,
   Oliver
