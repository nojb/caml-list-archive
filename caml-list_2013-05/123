The GPL, with all of its static linking verbiage, and OCaml are
not a good fit.  All of the Mirage libraries now prefer the ISC
license where possible, and the LGPL+linking exception is considered
deprecated for new code.  The last time I spoke to a lawyer about
the LGPL+exception (back in 2008 in Xensource), there were alarm
bells raised about the shoddy legal wording involved.  A BSD-style
license is significantly simpler, as long as it doesn't include the
advertising clause.
