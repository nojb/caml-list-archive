This is also my guess, although I was expecting an error message to be
printed by the shell (but then it's perhaps system() itself that
fails).  I'll fix this length limit issue soon in the CVS version.
Too bad objcopy cannot take its symbol redefinitions from a file...

Coming back to your initial desire to "pack" Baire (if I may say so),
I would very strong advise Diego to name his "List" module something
else, to avoid conflict with the standard library module of the same
name.  The hypothesis that compilation units are identified by unique
names is really essential to the way the OCaml compilers work.  I know
it's sometimes an annoyance (all cool names are already taken by the
standard lib :-), but you're really going to run into trouble with
name conflicts.
