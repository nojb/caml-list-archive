I don't think any of your explanations explain it:  the lines weren't
particularly long and I was using ocaml 3.06 on both linux and windows. 
And I did the test multiple times, in different orders, so the caching
is not the issue.

And, of course, the weirdest thing is that this appears to be a
windows-specific problem.  On Linux, there speed difference between wc
and my program was quite small.  The x70 difference was only found on
the mingw builds I tried.  (I didn't try a straight cygwin version,
since I don't have that build system set up at present.)

So, any other ideas, or suggestion as to how to narrow down the problem?

Thanks,
Yaron
