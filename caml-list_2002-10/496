They were not, but ok, since I made recently a new section in the
tutorial, I installed the tarball of the DVI and HTML versions of the
current version: Camlp4 ftp distribution, directory NEW.

It was changed in version 3.05. Now the good syntax is:
         <:class_type< object $opt:cst$ $list:csf$ end >>

But, to remain compatible, I just added some code to allow the old
syntax to be accepted: it works but displays a warning. Just upgrade
your Camlp4 version.

Oops, I have difficulties to understand your fix. And I don't
understand: if the fix applies to the function refill_lexbuff of the
Toplevel, it should work with Camlp4 since the toplevel of Camlp4 just
uses the lex buffer that OCaml provides.

But, ok, if you need to know where it speaks about the lex buffer, go
to the subdirectory "top" of the Camlp4 distribution, file "camlp4_top.ml".
If you find something which would fix your problem, please let me know
where and I can update the file.
