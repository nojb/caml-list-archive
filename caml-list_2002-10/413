According to my experience, if your OCaml program runs too slow, that's 
an indicator of bad algorithm or implementation (for instance, you 
intend to use a good-enough algorithm, but your implementation is faulty 
due to oversight), rather than bad compiler implementation, unless you 
can narrow the problem down and provide a reproducible case for the rest 
of list to review.

As said above.
