Xavier, ...

I am packaging spamoracle for debian right now. It still lacks a manpage,
would you care to provide one, or should i do it ?

That said, what i really wanted to know, is if you have some idea of how
spamoracle would scale in case of heavy load, if you use it to filter
mailing lists input for example ? For example, do you use it to filter
the ocaml mailing lists or something such ? Or do you think it would be
possible to filter the debian mailing lists and not have the mailserver
overload or something such ?

Friendly,

Sven Luther
