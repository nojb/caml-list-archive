Daniel, the one problem i have with separating camlp4 from ocaml, is
that, if i remember well, the standalone camlp4 needed access to the
ocaml sources to build. As a debian maintainer of ocaml package if find
this to be very messy, and was hapy when it was solved by including
camlp4 in ocaml.

If we separate again, what will be the situation on this same topic ?
will you again depend on the ocaml source ? Is there not a cleaner
solution for this ?

And also i am curious, what is so difficult with continuing to release
camlp4 as part of ocaml, but have a separate CVS tree for developpment,
that you sync with ocaml from time to time (and probably before each new
release), in the same way as DRI for example maintains a separate
development tree from XFree86 ?

Friendly,
