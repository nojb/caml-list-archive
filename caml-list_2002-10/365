I reply to myself, since it seems I was too prompt to post on the list. 
In fact after an ultimate try and few hundred megabytes of memory later,
ocamlc.opt was able to produce the code.
Sorry for the previous post. Is there any plan to improve the behaviour
of the compiler in the future ? (if possible of course).


Frederic.
