I disagree with moderation: it adds a lot of work for the moderator and
a possible lot of additional delay for readers.
Spam isn't a problem for this list and flamable/useless/off_topic
messages are really rare.

The hugeness reached by threads is another question and is related to
the actual size of the ocaml community, in such sense even a moderator
can hardly solve the question, expecially because I don't want a
moderator to cut off a thread because it is getting too big!

Cheers.
