Well, sure. So you have 2 choices :

  o require signed uploads from people you trust (and can visit
    consequence upon if they misbehave)

  o doing it so it will not be installed as root.

Mmm, i did not see that it would erase the home directory. Well, this is
only possible if the packages include scripts to be run before or after
the install. This is what debian uses right now, but then we use
solution 1 above.
