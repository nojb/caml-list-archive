This is not a good strategy. The rules say that it is averabe time for
moves that counts. So it doesn't matter when you do the calculation.
If you need something precaculated then you should do it at the
beginning, if you don't need it imeadiately, then you should delay
calculating until you need it. This saves CPU time.
