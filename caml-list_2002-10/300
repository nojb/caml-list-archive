This seems to be not what I mean. OK, that is what I asked :(.

All the comments will be removed. That is not desirable, for the mli 
file is meant to be read by both machine and humans. The humans need the 
comments to make sense of the interface file, without reference to the 
implementation code.

I guess an extension to the ocamlweb is what I mean.

Best!
