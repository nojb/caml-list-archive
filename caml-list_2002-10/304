Well, in general, you write the .ml, and once you are satisfied, you can
generate the .mli, and adapt it to your need : add comments, remove
uneeded info, etc.

Later one, you have to maintain both files separatedly. The idea being
that the .mli is the contract that the .ml has with its users, so
basically you can improve on the .ml, without changing much its
interface.

Another way of programming, is writting the .mli first, so it correspond
to what you want, and then write the implementation of it.

But any way you do it, normally you don't change the .mli very much
after the first writing, so it is ok to maintain it by hand.
