Just a few phenomenons that are hard to tackle :

- Sometimes a Makefile is not enough, you need a configure script. Sometimes
  the configure script takes arguments (Where can certain C libraries be found?
  Which build variant is chosen?). These arguments cannot be found out
  automatically, they are beyond the intelligence of the configure script.

  So an automatic package fetcher would have to deal with this complication.
  Maybe it has to ask interactively.

- Sometimes a single distribution tarball creates several libraries.

- Sometimes there are alternative dependencies (you can choose whether you
  like package X or X' as antecendent)

- Sometimes there are files to install that are neither libraries nor
  documentation. You need interaction with the operating system's idea
  of installing files, and if possible, with its package manager.

- Authors usually cannot test source packages on lots of platforms. Problems
  range from /bin/sh incompatibilities to the Unix/Windows nightmare. Especially
  for the latter I really don't know how to cope with it, because porting
  Makefiles and scripts to Windows is time-intensive, and as a Unix fan
  I have the attitude "let the Windows users do it".

These are not exoctic complications that are rarely found, they are normal.
A reasonable source distribution format must deal with them, and there must
be people willing to create such enhanced source packages. I don't say
this is all impossible, but sure it is an ambitious project.
