looking at the make output I saw that there are *.cmx? files missing. The 
readme of lablgtk says, I only have to type "make" and setting USE_OPT...=1. 
But this does not create the cmxo files, which cameleon is looking for. So 
after reading the lablgtk Makefile, I startet "make opt;make install" in 
lablgtk, afterwards "make" in cameleon and the errors are gone :-)

i don't know, if it was my fault or if it's a feature of the build process :-)
