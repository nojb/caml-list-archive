The main issue I see with the caml-list is not lack of moderation: like
everyone, I'd prefer to have the spam and trolls filtered a bit better,
but there's really not that much of that stuff.  The more serious problem
is the ever-increasing volume of *interesting* messages!

OCaml is a central tool in my work (right up there with Emacs and TeX
:-), and I feel it's quite important for me to stay on top of what's
happening in the community, participate in discussions of new features,
learn about dark corners and subtle gochas, find out about plans for the
future, etc.  But lately it's been getting to be a significant burden
even to scan message headers -- on some days, caml-list accounts for a
third of all the (non-spam) mail I receive.

Since the problem is essentially too much of a good thing, it's hard to
see what could be a complete solution.  But I think there are several
little steps that can help.  Having a separate caml-announce list is a
good step, and I hope people get (even more) in the habit of using it to
let others know about useful stuff.  I also wonder whether someone
(perhaps Alan Schmitt, who does something similar already?) could try
posting occasional "minutes" of the discussions on the list, so that
people like me could check in and see what's been going on without trying
to read every message.

Regards,

        Benjamin
