Frankly,
I do not think that design of a programming language (or any reasonably=20=

complex
scientific activity) can be seriously accomplished by exchanges through =
a
large mailing list using random criteria of taste and distaste. In other=20=

words,
there is no "motion" to second, we have no tradition of design by =
voting.

The revised syntax of Ocaml is certainly not the final satisfactory=20
solution, but it is a well thought out experiment in improving the=20
syntax of Ocaml along orthogonal principles. Its community may not be as=20=

large as the wider community using the standard syntax, but it is a=20
community of users who appreciate stability,
upward compatibility, and principled discussion.

I personally believe that syntax, and notation in general, is important.=20=

Important
for guiding intuition consistently with the semantics, important for=20
teaching the
language, important for avoiding mistakes such as case capture because=20=

of poor
bracketing. So it deserves a serious argumentation. Furthermore, it is=20=

not just
a matter of concrete syntax, it is also a matter of consistent tools for=20=

the edition and maintenance of programs in a spirit of literate=20
programming.
