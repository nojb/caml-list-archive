"God is dead!" cried Zarathustra. I don't know about that, 
really, but I can tell you that "Culture is very ill!"

I have just been told that the Politecnico di Milano, 
acknowledging the industry's need for new class of 
engineers--more obtuse, acritical, and, overall, 
cheap--intends to swap the traditional Software Engineering 
course with the more modern, obtuse, and cheap "Software 
Engineering in Java". I feel *so* proud that my university 
should be *so* modern. Wow.

Vive la France! Vive l'X! Et surtout, vive le Caml!
