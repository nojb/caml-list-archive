Very true, but I have a feeling most users/developers are on 
'nixes and don't really give a dime about Windows. I expect 
most people to be willing to release their working 
sources--working on their flavor of unix--but not to work on 
creating a Windows distro, be it source or binary. I also 
don't expect anyone, say, of the Debian folks, to pick up 
the Windows-port crusage single-handedly.

Let's just say this is a pretty nasty topic. I have a 
feeling that the only solution would be to have an official 
O'Caml IDE à la DevStudio--eeek!--capable of handling 
compilation and packaging in just the right way wherever 
it's used, without resorting to such unix tools as /bin/sh, 
configure, make and whatnot, but this would fit better in a 
commercial project than in an open source project.

The other solution is to start using Windows installation 
discs for what there best at: saving your tablecloth from 
beer stains...
