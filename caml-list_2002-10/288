Hi all,

I try to make a text editor with syntax coloring. I use lablgtk (the
GEdit component). When I want to colorize some words according to the
language (caml or latex by example), I use the freeze and thaw functions
as used in the browser application of the lablgtk distribution.
But, some flash of the GEdit component occur each time I hit a key. I
guess that the freeze and thaw function make the component flash.

Does anybody know how to stop this unpleasant flash ?
If there is no way to stop it, is there another way to make dynamic
syntax color ? (Now I send the modified line to a lexical analyser and
replace the words which must be in color, as the sample browser
application of the lablGTK distribution)

Thanks for your assistance.

Vincent
