What do you know about Caml big numbers library ? Are you sure to have
used the proper layer of the library tuned to performance or have you
used the casual layer tuned to coding facility ?

What do you know of the Smalltalk big numbers library ? In which
language is it written ? What are the algorithms used ?

What were your benchmark programs ? What are your figures ?

Be serious on such a topic please! Comparing arithmetic packages is
not a trivial task and you cannot state ``Dolphin Samlltalk
outperformed O'Caml by a factor of 4'' without strong arguments and
evidence that this is indeed true.
