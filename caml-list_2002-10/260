 My intention was not to begin a flame war.

 Dolphin's numerical algorithms are written in assembly language, like
all time-critical parts of the interpreter. Unfortunately, Dolphin's
team just announced "new faster algorithms" (and didn't give information
about the algorithms they use).
 Of course, I tried to tune my O'Caml code but I couldn't beat Dolphin's
implementation (despite the use of Nat etc.). Dolphin's bignums are
natively supported by the language and there is no way to hack them.
This is however very convenient for occasional users like me because I
don't have many time to "hack" numerical packages.
 Please note that I'm perfectly happy with O'Caml though.

 Sebastien.
