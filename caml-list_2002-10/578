I miss moderation too, but we won't find a volunteer willing to
moderate the list (too time consuming!), at least within the Caml
team.

Majordomo supports "selective moderation", though: messages matching
certain patterns require moderator approval.  This possibility has
been put to good use (for the first time) against Mr. Olczyk.
There are limits to the levels of cluelessness, aggressiveness and
trolling one can reach on a public forum.

My only advice to readers of this list would be to not feed the
trolls: don't even bother replying, or do it privately.
