Hello,

I'm having trouble linking a library which uses threads, using
ocamlfind.  The library I'm having trouble with, is the xmlrpc
library.  (I have added a module which handles xmlrpc requests, and
this module uses threads.)

ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg  -package "stew xmlrpc threads" -o server.opt   application_impl.cmx application_skeleton.cmx main_server.cmx
No implementations provided for the following modules:
  Thread referenced from /usr/local//lib/ocaml/site-lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cmxa(XmlRPCServer)

If I remove threads form the package list, I get the same error,

ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg  -package "stew xmlrpc" -o server.opt   application_impl.cmx application_skeleton.cmx main_server.cmx
No implementations provided for the following modules:
Thread referenced from
/usr/local//lib/ocaml/site-lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cmxa(XmlRPCServer)

but removing another package, results in errors related to modules
defined in that package, and which is what you would expect.

ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg  -package "xmlrpc threads" -o server.opt   application_impl.cmx application_skeleton.cmx main_server.cmx
No implementations provided for the following modules:
  Time referenced from /usr/local//lib/ocaml/site-lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cmxa(XmlRPCServer)
  Thread referenced from /usr/local//lib/ocaml/site-lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cmxa(XmlRPCServer)

Thus, it seems that trying to link with the threads library have no
effect.

I have a similar problem with the byte-code version, but I was able to
get round the problem by linking in the thread library while linking
the xmlrpc library.

ocamlfind ocamlc -cclib '-lstew' -thread -package "xstr threads netclient netstring equeue pxp pcre stew " -a -o xmlrpc.cma \
        -predicates "" threads.cma xmlRPCTypes.cmo xmlRPCDtd.cmo
xmlRPCNet.cmo xmlRPCClient.cmo xmlRPCServerMethods.cmo
xmlRPCServer.cmo

This is probably not the right way to do this, and trying the same
approach with the native-code version does not work.

ocamlfind ocamlopt -cclib '-lstew' -thread -package "xstr threads netclient netstring equeue pxp pcre stew " -a  -o xmlrpc.cmxa \
        -predicates "" threads.cmxa xmlRPCTypes.cmx xmlRPCDtd.cmx xmlRPCNet.cmx xmlRPCClient.cmx xmlRPCServerMethods.cmx xmlRPCServer.cmx  
/usr/local//lib/ocaml//threads/threads.cmxa
is not a compilation unit description.


I'm able to use native-threads if I don't compile it as a library, but
makes the module XmlRPCServer part of the test application I'm
creating.  So I would guess the problem is not that I have
native-threads incorrectly installed.

I'm runing debian-3 stable.  ocaml 3.06 compiled form sources, with
thread support.


Any suggestions on that I might be doing wrong?

Kindest regards,

Hans Ole Rafaelsen
