Well of course. After all he probably knows it better then any other
language ;) , and we all tend to lean towards the language we know the
best.

That's not what the claim was though. The original claim by me was
that when I hear people ( especially people close to the progress of
the language ) go around saying things like "X is the greatest
language of all time" or  "once you learn X you will never want to
program in anything else" then I start wondering if  "the Emperor
has no clothes". 

The reply was that all major actors in a language act as rabid
proponents of the language. They use the examples of Ritchie and
Stroustrup. I don't know whether or not it's true of Ritchie.  But I
know that Stroustrup does not follow that example.

It's not about finding a "favorite language". Its about learning 
a new language each year. Part of that entails spending time
working with the language. It also entails avoiding getting bogged 
down in installing things.

I already decided not to. If all the posts ( assuming people don't
change the topic ) stayed within one thread, it would be OK. What
I failed to take into account is that the mailing lists append the
name. So things tend to get out of threads. My mistake. Sorry.
