Views are an interesting idea. I had not thought about it. I 
have to look into this, although, as you pointed out, they 
are probably not what I'm looking for.

I want to point out that I think this string thing is not 
vital to Ocaml. The various regexp libraries amount to more 
than is necessary for any string processing task. I'd just 
like to have a more Camlesque way of dealing with strings 
than what is offered by regexps and the like.
