The people who say that your work is "a waste of time" may indeed mean
that it's cool, in their own words. The whole research activity is a
"waste of time", to some extent :)

"waste of time": something that one does for fun and not for money, in any
way.

About camlp4, i would like a basic version of camlp4
integrated with the basic distribution, and a camlp4-ext
package available to power users, with extensions, an
alternative syntax etc ..
