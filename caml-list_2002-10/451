Right, it's also kind of silly because OCaml is an imperative language, so 
flames like "imperative languages suck" belong on the Haskell, Clean, and 
Mercury mailing lists, but not here!

Sure, you've probably nailed the most popular one, which is doing C++ 
style compilation by monomorphizing everything. I doubt this will happen in 
OCaml because it is a research vehicle for research in language design, 
and that implementation strategy makes lots of things hard in a language like 
OCaml. This where the "Standard" in SML is somewhat meaningful, as some 
researchers in that community have focused on those kind of optimizations. 

There was a recent thread on this, here
