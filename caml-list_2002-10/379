Well, i guess the problem is essentially for the windows folk, and the
solaris/linux user who are used to rebuilding their stuff themselves.

Also suppor on rpm based distribs is not as mature as we have in debian,

If this happens, maybe we can prevail on inria and the ocaml team to
make disk space available to us ?

Yes, this is the problematic part.
