I'm afraid I can't diagnose your problem offline.  There is one known
bug that was discussed on this list (you have to do 
        make -f Makefile.nt jumptbl.h
manually in byterun/), but apart from this it should work if you
follow the instructions in README.win32.  In particular, I'd advise to
compile under Cygwin (but with the -mno-cygwin option to gcc)
rather than under Mingw + Msys.

No to the first question.  Yes to the second.  (Unless your program
explicitly requires third-party libraries, e.g. TCL/TK if you use
Labltk.)
