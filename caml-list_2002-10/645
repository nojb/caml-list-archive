I do not follow all the discussions of the caml-list so I hadn't seen
this message before.

Baire [List] has been moved to [BaireList] (in the same way
BairePervasives worked before)  to avoid conflicts and all "cool"
names have been liberated for standard library compatibility

All this of course in Baire 0.1 (not yet avaible for downloading)

I tried that but it didn't work (I do not know why), and I gave up
mostly because the second solution seemed cleaner to me.

The Caml-team should feel free to take whatever they want in Baire
anyway and include it in the standard library, without any restriction
(I can send you a more official authorisation if you need)
