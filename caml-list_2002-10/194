thank you for you help... but I'm still missing something.

I want to produce a let statement. However my code produces 
something like that:
let _ = let pc = `Forall [|`Rule "a"; `Rule "b"; `Rule "c"|] in pc

that is not really helpful. I suppose the problem lays in the level
declaration (I used expr : LEVEL "top") or in the quotation iteself (I
used <:expr< let $lid:n$ = $s$ in $lid:n$>>).

I don't quite understand the quotation syntax. They are written in the
revised syntax, so they don't permit to write something like "let a =
10;;", but there are not "value" statement to declare a binding.

how can I transform my declaration 
str pc : [a;b;c];;
in something like that
let pc = `Forall [|`Rule "a"; `Rule "b"; `Rule "c"|];;
?

My final goal is to use camlp4 to simplify and extend the ocaml syntax
to write simple programs that I'll use to feed a virtual machine...

thanks,
p
