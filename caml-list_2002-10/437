This is a new feature in the language, and you really don't need to learn 
it quite yet if you're just starting out.  Basically, before the 'a. syntax 
was introduced, there was no way to store some kinds of functions 
(polymorphic ones) in datastructures.  You don't need int. int->int because 
that's not a polymorphic function, so it's just int -> int.

I'd just ignore it for now.  :)  You should also check out the O'Reilly 
book referenced on http://caml.inria.fr
