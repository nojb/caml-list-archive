> (linux and laptops: try getting wlan and acpi to work :-)

My laptop Linux box has once been happily backuping my Ipaq PocketPC
(also running Linux of course) using adhoc mode wireless networking :)

My personal acpi is named emacs and works perfectly for any file in /etc :)

Anyhow, I agree with you that a Mac could be sometimes a lot
simpler. However, I hate my Mac when it suddenly ceases to work
properly: my feeling then is often that the OS is way more complex
and difficult to masterize than Linux...
