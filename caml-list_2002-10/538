Subject: [Caml-list] debugger losing contact with debuggee process

Hello,

A process I am debugging has a bus error and crashes. When it crashes, it
loses contact with ocaml_debug. The output looks something like this:

calling db->put with db=3c8c0 txn=0 flags=0
Invalid argument (error number 22)
BDB: aborting transaction
Lost connection with process 3531 (active process)
between time 290000 and time 300000
Trying to recover...
Time : 290000 - pc : 59612 - module Printf
186 <|b|>let res = Buffer.contents dest in

The debugger loses contact with the debuggee process because the debuggee
has a bus error and terminates.

The information provided by ocamldebug above isn't very helpful. How do I
get a backtrace at the time of the bus error ? Something along the lines
of a bactrace on a core dump file would be great. How does one get this
information using ocamldebug ?

Sincerely,
Lex

[ I posted this question to the ocaml_beginners list. After receiving no
replies on that list after 12hours, I conclude that the people on that
list don't have the experience with ocamldebug to answer the question and
am posting it to this list. ]
