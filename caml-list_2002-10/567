This is more or less what I've been doing up to now. Yet, 
the CVS version, is still tempting, in some respects. I'm am 
considering running a double installation setup with the 
official distro in /usr/bin and /usr/lib and the cvs in 
/opt/bin and /opt/lib. I could then test my code againsta 
the CVS snapshot by simply using a pinch of makefile magic.

The bottom line is that I don't like to work-arounds in my 
code. I'd like my code to be as obvious and idiomatic as 
possible.
