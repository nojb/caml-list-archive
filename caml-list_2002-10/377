OK, I give up. People on this list have been helpful, but there are too many=
 problems with the distributed source files for me to cope with. And they=
 seem not to be too up-to-date, if it really is so that I can't use Tk/Tcl=
 8.4.0.1. So I give up. I give up. I'll go back where I came from, i.e. the=
 rebol programming language, which is installed in a second or less.

Thanks again, even though it didn't help.
