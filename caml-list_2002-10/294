The idea here is that people who aren't subscribed to the list can ask
questions and receive answers without *having* to subscribe.  It's a minor
inconvenience for people who *are* subscribed to the list, but it would be
an extraordinary inconvenience to people who *aren't* subscribed to the
list if they couldn't get their questions answered :)

For what it's worth, if you use an email client like `mutt', you can set it
up to recognize mailing lists you are subscribed to, and then use a
reply-to-list command (`L' in mutt) as long as you know that everyone
involved in the correspondence is a list subscriber.  I don't know if other
clients support features like this, but it might be something to look into.

cheers,
William
