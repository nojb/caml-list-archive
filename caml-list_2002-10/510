Moderating is perhaps not the best solution.
Actually the main problem is due to the community growth with many newbies
who need support.
In order to increase the signal/noise ratio, perhaps a mailling list split
should be done.

Here's a proposal for a split :
- general ( support , any post welcomed, of course many noise )
- beginners ( support for newbies )
- academic ( FP / algorithms / langage features discussions => something
like the previous moderated list )
- industrial ( for people interested in developing the industrial usage of
ocaml )

Of course such a splitting will only work if it comes with a real WILL and
label from the official team, and proper advertising on the Caml
website(s) - the "unofficial"aspect of the current beginners list is perhaps
the reason why people use the general list.
