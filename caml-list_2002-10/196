Subject: [Caml-list] Possible Preprocessor and Debugger Interactions

I noticed in the OCaml reference manual that it is possible to
load special purpose printing routines for particular types into
ocamldebug.   However there is no mention of a facility to
load a special parser for ad hoc queries about variable values
that one might wish to perform within the debugger, using fragments
from the mini-language accepted by a pre-processor.  =20

I am thinking, for example of writing a library that allows routines with=
=20
prolog-like variable binding.  Suppose a pre-processor is used to allow=20
embedded definitions in a prolog-like syntax, which are pre-processed
into OCaml source code.  For debugging purposes, one would ideally like
to query the variable values using a syntax close to the original source
file.

So my question is "Has anyone has hacked ocamldebug in
this type of way and perhaps has a relevant example to share?"
And my topical thought is that there are potentially substantive=20
interactions between a sophisticated pre-processor, ocamldebug,=20
and what the compiler does with the '-g' flag.
