I like and seems me a good compromise actual revised syntax,
also do { ... } is a good (and visible warning) that may be
side effects to care. No way to if ... else ... end as you
said it isn't FP (it is pure impertative style).
I prefer the revised syntax despite extra verbosity because
it overcomes some confusing situations of the official syntax.
(if with or without else, { and begin, } and end, the match
function ... among others).

Best regards.
