You probably discovered a bug in the implementation of the Scanf
module :(

I will correct it in the working sources, as soon as possible.

However you should report those bugs to caml-bugs@inria.fr, instead of
reporting to this list. We have a bug tracking system which is much
easier to deal with for recording and tracking than the Caml mailing
list...
