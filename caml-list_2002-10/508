In Italy we respond to such bullshit by asking, "Did you 
drink your brain?" What in the world makes you think caml 
generates C code? Did you ever notice Caml gets compiled to 
bytecode? Good lord, wake up! You can't wake up one fine 
morning and start ranting about what other people like in 
their own parlor!

You don't like Caml. You have no clue what caml is about. 
You don't give a damn about caml. Fine. Who cares?
