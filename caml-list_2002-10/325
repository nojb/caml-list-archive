Ok, ...

Still i have difficulties understanding how this work, in my idea
bytecode was build once run everywhere, how does this go with your
statement that it can be made to use 64bit integers by a compiler
switch ?

Mmm, maybe you are speaking about ocamlrun only ?

Do you want access ? I can try to arrange that if you want. To an hppa
machine also.
