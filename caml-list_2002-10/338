This is an interesting point, but the main nightmare will be 
tying in PostgreSQL code into Ocaml. You have to consider 
that PostgreSQL is the SQL engine, and necessarily the 
embedded-Ocaml interpreter/runtime-system will have to be 
able to invoke such portions of the PostgreSQL system as are 
necessary to run queries and retrieve recordsets or to open 
and use cursors. So, C calls Caml which calls C which...
