What gtk-devel package? For that matter what packages. Windows doesn't
use packages.

I've downloaded lablgtk and the gtk dlls for windows from the labgtk
web site. As far as I can see it is setup correctly.

The only other option would be to go to the GTK for Windows web page.
That won't work because the page is one of the worst written and most
badly irganized web pages in existence.
