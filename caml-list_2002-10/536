 i am quite confused about the orgnization of source files.
i have programmed with java . java has a simple rule to orgnize files: one file contains one class(public) or interface, and name of the file and the class  must be identical.

As to Ocaml.
Does the file name of *.ml or mli has some similar relation ship with the content ?
  for example , in the on-line manul
  it says :
  if complie like this
  ocaml -c aux.mli
  ocaml -c aux.ml
  behaves exactly as if 
  module Aux: sig (* contents of aux.mli*) end = struct (*contents of aux.ml*) end;;
  in the toplevel
  that seems to imply the exsiting fo some relationship , but i still has these questions:
1) can many modules be write in just one file ? 
   maybe not , then how does classes?
  
2) Is the multi sigs with one struct  or multi structs  with one sig  compiled at a prper dependency can get the same result that like as in the toplevel?   should i write anther file to tell them how to assigning?

3) take set.ml and set.mli for example which defined one functor: Make and two sigs : S and OrderedType.  But when we use , we use this command    Set.Make(..).       "Set" here seem can only get from the name of the file. So it seems the file name determined the library name .  Then how about the noraml module (not functor) case that if i define a module A with a funtion a(), in file b.ml and b.mli, how can i refer to a() in module A.  A.a() or B.A.a() or B.a()? 

 
 

Best regards
            
              Yours
