Subject: [Caml-list] automatic extraction of mli file?

First, I'd say I like the idea of OCaml has separate interface and 
implementation files.

I'm quite new in OCaml and I want to know what is the practice of the 
OCaml programmers. Will you first write the interface files, then 
implement, or vice versa? I think neither way is satisfactory. I guess 
the first approach goes against prototyping and the second means both 
duplicated work and violation of software engineering.

What I'm wondering is "wouldn't it be preferrable to automatically 
produce the interface file from the implementation file?", so that we 
can program in the literate programming style, do prototyping, and save 
the drudgery of writing the interface (though a little manual editing 
may be necessary, or some kind of markup in the source code).

Maybe such utility already exists. Only I'm not aware of. If so, I'd 
like to know how to get it.

Thanks.
