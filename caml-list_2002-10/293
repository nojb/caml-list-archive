You should have reported this behaviour, since it is a bug: the
library was known to provide a normal form to value of type num. If it
fails to do so it is just an implementation flaw that we have to
correct.

Yes, you're right, it is almost impossible to handle: that why the
library was supposed to provide a normal form for nums ...
