Yes, I agree with -silent too!  The only problem with using the pipe for 
everything is that Win2k's echo passes the quotes along to ocaml, so you need:

echo Sys.word_size | ocaml

Sadly, this means you'll need different commands on unix versus nt.  -eval 
would avoid that problem to a large extent, except in that case quoting 
inside a string is different between the two systems, so you're stil kind 
of hosed.  We probably need all of these switches!

Would -silent not print anything that wasn't "printed" from the script, or 
would it only print the types?  Maybe we need -Q for printing nothing 
(script must print to stdout), -qq for printing only values, and -q for 
printing types and values.  Or something.  And -e[val] for evaluating a 
string (should support multiple of them on a single command like perl does, 
which is handy).  Not sure if there are equivalents for perl -n & -p that 
we'd want...ocaml is a bit heavy for quick scripting like this, so -eval 
might be enough.
