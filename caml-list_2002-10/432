Hi All,

   MLdonkey 2.00 has been released. MLdonkey is a peer-to-peer
file-sharing client completely written in Objective-Caml, that can be
used to access the eDonkey2000, Overnet, Gnutella, Direct Client and
Soulseek networks. It supports downloads from multiple sources and
corruption detection, complex search requests, chat with friends,
internationalization, history of search results, etc...

  MLdonkey is a (non-root) daemon, that can be run under Linux, Mac OS
X and other Unix flavors with Objective-Caml support. The daemon can
be controled through a command-line interface (via telnet), a WEB
interface or a GTK GUI (using lablgtk).

  As I have to move from INRIA, development on MLdonkey will slow down
next month. If some Ocaml programmers are interested in working on
this project, already used by several thousands of users, they are
welcome to join our team, and to contribute to whatever thay want
inside (GUI, network plugins, i18n, ...)
