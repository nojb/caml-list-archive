Subject: [Caml-list] Strange slowness of input_line on mingw

I've noticed some strangely slow behavior from input_line on mingw.  I
wrote a simple loop to scan through a file, and found that for a given
file, it took about 10 seconds to run, whereas wc -l took only a small
fraction of a second -- the difference was about a factor of 70.  This is
on a W2K machine using mingw.  On the other hand, using the same file on a
linux box, the difference between wc -l and my code was only about a
factor of 3.
Any ideas where the big difference might be coming from?   The code I
wrote is attached below.
y


open Printf

let fname = try Sys.argv.(1) with _ -> printf "Must provide filename\n";
exit (-1)let file = open_in fname
(* let read = Newparse.create_tick_reader file*)

let () =
  try
    while true do
      ignore (input_line file);
    done
  with
      End_of_file -> printf "File ended.  Hah!\n"
