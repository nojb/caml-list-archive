Can you imagine how the mailing lists (beginners' of caml-list) would be polluted if anybody having problems compiling a caml software posted to these lists ? What next ? You will ask Linux questions because you develop a software in OCaml under Linux ?
I tried to reply to you, and I posted a message on the cameleon-list to say I would not make a port to windows (though I would add such a port if someone makes it). But you did not make any effort. You're just waiting for people to work for you ? Well, if you give me root/admin access to your machine, I may help you .. ;-)

Now you are the lier. I made you a suggestion to compile and you just replied to me : "It fails". Then I had to ask you for details...

Well, the point is that you should not try to develop software if you can't make some effort. The best you can do is to use Visual Basic, I think... Then Microsoft will be very happy too reply to your phone calls and e-mails, with your credit card number of course :-)

I don't know. I don't even care, in fact. There's a lablgtk list, you know.

Now you're really bothering me, kid.

I send a copy of this message to the caml-list, because I don't want to hide anything about my decision about you : I'll kick you out of the cameleon-list.

Please, unsubscribe from the caml-list.
