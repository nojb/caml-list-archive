Subject: [Caml-list] On the equality of functional values

I have been experimenting with equal signs, and I noticed 
that the equality operator (=) behaves in a strange way with 
respect to functional values.

         Objective Caml version 3.06

# (=) = (=) ;;
Exception: Invalid_argument "equal: functional value".
# let x = (=) in x = x ;;
- : bool = true

The first line seems to imply that no comparisons are 
possible between functional values. However, the second line 
I typed does not raise the same exception. This seems to 
imply that comparisons are allowed between functional 
values, too.

Now, which of two hypotheses is correct?
