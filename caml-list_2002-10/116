Michel Mauny gave here his personnal point of view, but told me, some
time ago, that "liberty of expression" is good for research. I then use
it, as it is my right, to contest the political decision of keeping
Camlp4 in OCaml, which can only come to the end of Camlp4.

If I say: "Camlp4 must be separated", it is just to say, to tell
everybody of you, that I want to continue to work on it, to improve
it, to receive your remarks and to debug it.

Therefore, I continue fighting for the separation. Except, of course,
if insults against my work are no more considered as "liberty of expression"
and if I can be sure that these insults stop.
