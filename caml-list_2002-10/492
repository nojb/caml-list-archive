I don't understand what you are talking about, ocamlc generates
bytecode which gets interpreted in a virtual machine, not c, or
something such, and ocamlopt generates native code, that is assembly
which needs to be assembled by an assembler (gasm on linux/unix, and a
windows assembler on windows). The bytecode you compile on unix should
run without problem on the windows virtual machine (ocamlrun), provided
you don't use the -custom flag to ocamlc.

Maybe you should try using only ocamlopt.

That said, there are a few library which are only bindings to C code
(the FFI you spoke about previously) and which need a C compiler. But
once they are compiled, you can use them without problems.

Well, since ocaml doesn't generate C that is compiled, maybe you should
revise your conclusion. Well, there was a caml->C compiler available
some time ago, but it is _not_ the same thing as ocaml.

Check again your facts, the ocaml reference manual clearly says that :

This chapter (16) describes the Objective Caml source-level replay debugger
ocamldebug.

  Unix:
    The debugger is available on Unix systems that provides BSD sockets.
  Windows:
    The debugger is available under the Cygwin port of Objective Caml, but
    not under the native Win32 port.   

So, you would like to install the cygwin port, and you get access to the
debugger.

Well, you should not judge the performance of ocaml on windows, by the
behavior of a rather recent library/app like cameleon, which had also
problems on unix/linux.

Did they really lie ? I don't think so,

And here is your error, these are _not_ prepackaged libraries.

But then, i am the debian maintainer for ocaml, and may have to big
opinions about what a packaging system is, and there is nothing such on
windows, so you are screwed and need to rebuild things, which can be
difficult. But then, there are numerous reports of other people doing
it, so you should beable to do so also.
