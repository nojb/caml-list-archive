OK, I took a glance at the scores in
http://icfpcontest.cse.ogi.edu/scoring/.  We are yet to analyze them
in detail, but here are two obvious facts:

 - The scores of team #107 (us) and team #161 (the 2nd) are *very*
   close and rather incomparable in various scenarios.  The game was
   almost a draw, I would say.

 - On the other hand, the CPU times are quite different: we are
   more than 70 times faster!  This is surprising enough---even though
   speed was not a goal in the task and even though the CPU times may
   be somewhat imprecise as the judges say---considering the other
   entry is written in (raw) C.

By the way, we have to confess that we did not do so much *functional*
programming - our code is almost imperative.  This may be natural,
arguably, because the task was rather imperative involving a quite
"stateful" server.
