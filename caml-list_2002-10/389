At least for the windows solution, i strongly think a binary
distribution mechanism is what is needed for the users and also would
save a lot of time and 'howto build' kind of questions on the mailing
lists. There is no reason not to do so, i am no windows expert, but
windows offer a stable set of libraries and other system component that
can be relied upon to install ocaml binary packages upon. This already
works for ocaml itself.

Yes, i also think so.
