Daniel, 

I'm still not sure I understand (BTW I did not know Camlp4 was being 
integrated into O'Caml itself) 

You are saying that "[integrating Camlp4 into O'Caml] was a good compromise", 
but you are *also* saying that you are refusing to work on Camlp4 as part of 
O'Caml.  Why?

Pardon my ignorance, but is the offer to work on Camlp4 as part of O'Caml 
some sort of demotion for you at INRIA, or is the whole conflict merely about 
the location of Camlp4 in the CVS tree?

(I'm just curious as to what's going on)

Cheers
Oleg
