I tried this week with mingw, but didn't manage. After solving a few=
 problems discussed on this list, I didn't succeed in finding out why the=
 file ocamlrun.a wasn't present. I used the CVS source files in my last=
 attempt, but that didn't help. So I'm hopelessly stranded, and on the point=
 of giving up.

I have a new version of mingw (downloaded this monday). I needed to change a=
 few variables (e.g. BYTECC in config/Makefile) so that my WebObjects=
 installation would not hijack the %PATH% and force through an older version=
 of gcc.

Oh, and by the way: If I should be so lucky as to manage to compile it, and=
 then to build Windows native executables, will client machines still need=
 mingw to run these files? I.e. will these Windows native executables really=
 be Windows native executables, and not rely on any third party software?
