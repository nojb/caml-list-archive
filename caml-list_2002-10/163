You *don't need* the sources of OCaml to compile Camlp4. You just need
that OCaml (binary and library) is installed, that's all.

The director of the project argues me that it is not possible to
separate Camlp4 from OCaml because "we have industrial contacts".

Yes. But right or not, it is not the point. In the point of view of
having users, or customers, destroying the work of his colleagues is a
dangerous thing, which has consequences. Bad for sells, or bad for
convincing the decidors, who are sometime not scientifics.

You joke? They would be happy, for sure, that scientifics encourage
them and give them free ad!

Ah, this is what they say in "Formule 1". I am convinced of the contrary.
