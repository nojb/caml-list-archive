Yes, it failed anonymously for me as well (on freebsd, when I was testing 
my win32 patch...this is a reminder to reply to my mail to you about that, 
too :).

Yep, all programs should be able to take a response file for arguments.

We just need to pack the standard library and be done with it, and then it 
will finally liberate all of those common names for user programs!  It's 
the Right Thing.  :)

Hmm, now that I think about it, the native code pack could just shove any 
dependent C obj/lib files into the packed object as well, truly doing away 
with any external files.  Maybe it already does this...
