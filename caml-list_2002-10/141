I did. Actually, the streams are just syntactic sugar, and their place
is in a preprocessor. In the very first version of OCaml, there were
no streams. I had added them, because there were not Camlp4 at this
time.

The problem of the streams inside OCaml is that the generated code
is very inefficient. To be more efficient, one has to optimize the
code (the generated source code), and it is very easy to do with
Camlp4 (thanks to the quotations) and very hard in OCaml (no
quotation and, moreover, a syntax tree too complicated).

For me it is better also. But I cannot work under a system whose
director considers my work as a "waste of time". Sorry. Or explain
him to stop telling that!
