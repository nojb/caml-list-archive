You need a bit more than this: file and socket handles also need some
checkpointing (of the kind that fork() does on file descriptors in the
Unix world).

Yes, and I've looked at the fork() implementation in Cygwin.  It's a
remarkable engineering feat, but not something that I'd call
"relatively easy" :-)

> As for Unix sockets, Win32 has almost the same thing: named pipes.

Agreed, this isn't a show-stopper.

> So maybe is time to bring ocamldebug to Win32? :-)

As soon as someone writes a decent process checkpointing library for
Win32 :-)
