No, if I have to do it. Yes, if people want it and implement it.

A fast, clean, simple, reliable, extensible, law memory footprints HTML
compiler written in a high level language, that you can easily extend
using the high level language.

I made the minimum that fullfilled my needs. If others want to use it,
I'm please to share it with them. If they want to extend it, I would
be glad to incoporate their extensions if they want to share them with
me. No big plans, no big deal, just a proposition to try something I
considered useful to use and would continue to develop if there are
volunteers by there.

Thank you for your appreciation. This project is new but htmlc was used
for a long time to generate pages for the Caml web site.

May be HTMLC announce was a bit modest too, I don't know. I really
would like to share ideas and code with other programmers on the
subject of HTML pages generation using Caml. It is a practical issue:
I had so many problems with SSI that I moved to the side of statically
checked source pages (and HTML compilers).
