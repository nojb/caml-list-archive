Any X teacher around? :-)

Daniel gave his personal point of view about what should be the status
of Camlp4, whereas the question was why teachers at École
Polytechnique didn't include Camlp4 in their OCaml courses. Slightly
different matters.

As a consequence, let me repeat that Camlp4 is still part of the OCaml
distribution, as all of you noticed. Even though the process of
updating Camlp4 in the CVS OCaml tree is more painful than before, the
camlp4 and the ocaml/camlp4 trees get merged at least at each
distribution.

So, there is no reason so far to worry about the status of OCaml
streams.

Done.
