I noticed this. You are probably linking to a library which 
raises and then catches the exception, printing out the 
error message. Oftentimes, GUI libraries have this feature. 
This might explain why your program does not terminate when 
the exception is raised.

Can you send in a test case that reproduces this behavior, 
for reference?
