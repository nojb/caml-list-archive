I am just curious why ocamldebug cannot work in the native Win32
Ocaml. Having searched the mailing list archives, I found the following
Xavier Leroy's article

http://caml.inria.fr/archives/199903/msg00014.html

where he explains that two main problems are (1) absense of checkpointing
facilities and (2) absense of unix sockets equivalent.

Ocaml debugger normally implements checkpoins via fork() syscall, which is
not available under Win32. But why simply not to use
ReadProcessMemory()/WriteProcessMemory() Win32 API functions to
save/restore the process memory image? I think it should be relatively
easy (BTW Cygwin uses these functions in its fork() implementation).

As for Unix sockets, Win32 has almost the same thing: named pipes.

So maybe is time to bring ocamldebug to Win32? :-)
