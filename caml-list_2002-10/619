This is one of those things that's always troubled me (perhaps there's another 
petty complaint coming up) about OCaml. In a language with a hierarchical 
module system, it seems that we should be able to avoid such problems by 
having the standard library packages nested under a "Std" module, or something 
like that, so that List, Array, etc., become Std.List, Std.Array, etc, as we 
do now for the labeled modules. 

I suppose it's too late now for such a change, but I'm pretty sympathetic to 
people who grouse over the fact that lots of good names are taken.
