:)

What I was really asking was if any of the authors of packages that are now 
only in the CDK (like asmdynlink) are planning on pulling their packages 
back out.  I assumed there were more than just asmdynlink that are now 
"trapped" in the CDK, but maybe that's the only one.

We SO need a package manager like CPAN/apt/dpgk/anything!  Someone must 
have a grad student they can throw at this problem! :)
