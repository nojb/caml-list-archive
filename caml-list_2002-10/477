Well, the correct answer to your last questions is probably:

  Don't try to learn Ocaml from the reference manual.

It will tell you everything about the language, but not necessaryly in the
order you need to know it, and it doesn't tell you which parts of the language
are fundamental (core language, modules), optional (labels, objects) or arcane
(universal quantification, when to omit the first type in a coercion). Try the
tutorial by Jason Hickey first.

Note to INRIA: Describing the manual with "The Objective Caml manual begins
with short tutorials on the core language, objects and classes, and modules."
on the tutorials page is slightly misleading, those tutorials don't really add
up to an introduction to ocaml.

Yours, Florian.
