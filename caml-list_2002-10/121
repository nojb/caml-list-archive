I already noticed.

There is a book called The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and
Dave Thomas. One of the things they advise is learning a new
programming language each year. Some people are trying to formalise
the process. 

I have suggested that people use the contest to mark the beginning of
the Loty ( *L*anguage *o*f *t*he *y*ear ) year. That way you take last
year's contest as a project to learn the language and at the end of
year the contest acts as a final exam.

The language I decided to on this year is OCaml. So do you know
if these three are going to release their source code? Also will they
write up their project?
