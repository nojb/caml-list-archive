It did help.

There was just a minor problem using -thread.  It requires that a
multitreaded version of the xmlrpc library is provided.  Making a copy
of xmlrpc.cma to xmlrpc_mt.cma and the same for the .cmxa and .a file,
and then installing these files as part of xmlrpc package solved those
problems.


Thanks,

Hans Ole
