Yes, indeed. There is no problem of disk space here. The problem is to
grant access in a secure and reliable way.

I think we can set up a standardized compilation and installation
procedure (meaning a standard Makefile for libraries, based on the
configuration set up by the original Ocaml installation). We can start
with the Caml team maintained software (the ``bazaar'') and encourage
people to do the same for their own software by storing (and
distributing) it on our server. This could be a lot of book-keeping
but we could probably manage it...
