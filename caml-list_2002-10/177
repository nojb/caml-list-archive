Perhaps a problem of installation. The file pa_extend.cmo should be in
the library directory of ocaml, sub-directory camlp4. Is it there? If
yes, try the command "camlp4 -where": it should display how camlp4
sees its library directory.

But it may be also a problem with Cygwin, because it is often
difficult to know if you have to use /cygdrive/e and right slashes or
E:\ and backslashes or a mix of right and back slashes or double
backslashes because of OCaml strings, and so on.

A way to change the Camlp4 library directory, without having to
recompile it is to define the environment variable CAMLP4LIB. Perhaps
redefining it with a "good value" (try several), it works better?
