Well, Linux is not the center of the world (even of the Unix-world). There
are several OS, several distributions, and you're not always sys admin on
the system you're working on (or don't want to use root priveleges to
install an ocaml package).

What about a Central OCaml Archive (with a nice acronym; or simply a
centralized list of URLs) and some conventions about namespaces ?

If it is impossible to manage such a central repository, an intermediate
solution would be to provide explicitly URLs for findlib-dependencies.

A standardized compilation and installation procedure would be great,
indeed.
