All the explanations given so far make sense except for one thing:  they 
all suggest that the program should terminate.  But my program doesn't 
terminate, it just prints out the "Uncaught exception" string and keeps 
on executing.  I am not to my knowledge making any use of threads, so 
that odesn't seem like it should be the right explanation either.

So, any more thoughts?
