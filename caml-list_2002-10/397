Subject: [Caml-list] Question on -g

Precedence: bulk

Does -g toggle a debug flag, so that an even number of -g's 
is equivalent to not specifying any, or are are multiple 
occurrences of -g beyond the first one just ignored?

I ask because it has occurred to me to compile with -g being 
emitted sometimes more than once by my makefile, and 
incidentally I was unable to use the debugger. But the 
reason might be some other problem with the setup of the 
development environment.
