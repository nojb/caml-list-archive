I don't think it's a problem to require cygwin to be installed to build 
ocaml stuff, even the msvc build requires it now.  That's fine.  It's 
whether the resulting executables require cygwin (they shouldn't) or less 
importantly, whether they were built with msvc (they should be able to be 
in addition to cygwin/mingw).
