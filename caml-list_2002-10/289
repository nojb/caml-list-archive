Hi, -pack is disabled on msvc builds because nm and objcopy are not 
installed by default.  However, the cygwin nm and objcopy work on PE format 
files (msvc objs, libs, and exes), so everything should work just fine 
(perhaps you didn't know this, Xavier, or maybe you did know it and they're 
broken in some nonobvious way?).  I enabled nm and objcopy in the config 
files, rebuilt, and I've almost got it working (there's a "-o" that needs 
to be turned into a "-out:" as a config.ml parm to link, but that's 
minor).  The big problem is that when the pack.obj is made by asmpackager, 
it includes the camlpackage tmp obj file created, so nm dumps out this 
file's symbols as well.  But the camlpackage tmp is deleted after the 
packed obj is made (around line 242 of 3.06 asmpackager.ml), so when 
objcopy goes to do its thing in rename_in_object_file, it blows up because 
that obj file is missing from the tmp dir.  I just now got access to a unix 
machine to see how it works there, because it doesn't seem like this is an 
msvc-specific problem, but I must admit to not knowing all the details of 
the nm/objcopy step.

Anybody looked at this?

Chris
