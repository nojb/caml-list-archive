No one can tell, but an important point is that the CVS version is
unstable by nature.

By using the CVS version you help the developpers, not your product.
If I were you, I would be selfish!

Of course in the long run helping Caml is helping yourself, but I
assume  you are coding for food and that you eat every day.

I am no industrial.

But for hevea I stick to the following guidelines.

- Always develop with the current distributed version.
- Avoid new features as much as possible.
- I check hevea at every compiler release.
- I case of bug I favor work-arounds in my code over enforcing upgrade (at
least until the next official Ocaml release).

I do not think my statement can be considered ``official'', just
common sense.
