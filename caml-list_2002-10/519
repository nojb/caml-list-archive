And Pierre  Weis says that I shouldn't call people liars, but when
I see a post like this...

There is a big difference between saying " if I could only use one
language it would be C", and saying "C is the best language".

Stroustrup has said  and continues to say that he refuses to get
into the debate about what the best language is. Last I looked it
was the stated on the FAQ on his web page.

Uhmmm. If you look at the line of the build that I have posted,
there are no C or C++ source files in the compile that uses
cl.exe.

Indeed. As I pointed out the guy who did the test is
not exactly the person I would want to write efficient C code.
Which is usually why such preformance tests comparing
two languages suck. The person is either an expert in one
language and lacking in the other.

Actually this is the perfect example of the kind of tunnel
vision that those clueless exhibit. (With the caveat that I have
not yet used the debugger, so go by what I read, and not the actual
feel) CL/Scheme and Smalltalk both have debuggers with this 
feature ( I also suspect that Dylan has it too ) and they have had
it for a *long. long time* , predating OCaml ( almost predating ML
as an implemented language).

In fact both languages have another feature which AFAIK OCaml does
not. They both support core/images, which allow you to checkpoint 
a run and restart "close to the bug" even when you've pushed the go
back feature to much.

I don't read the C/C++ Users Journal much any more. But I still
get it and read the editorials.
Today the next one arrived with this comment:
"If you're like me, you tire easily of hype machines that cry wolf
about this or that whiz-bang tool."
