I agree with everything you write above. Well said!

However, if separating CamlP4 from OCaml (the way it used to be) ends the 
problem then I am for it.

Also relevant perhaps, was something we said a long time ago in the States which 
began "When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people 
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another..."
(Please, no references to hanging together or hanging separately! ;-)

Of course, I'd prefer that it wasn't so, but I really want OCaml to be 
successful and if the status quo is not workable then let's return to the way it 
was and get back to hacking.
