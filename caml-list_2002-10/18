  Thank you for help.  Yes, you are right - problem with "sed" and
end-of-lines.  I get sources from cvs using cvsnt, which writes CRLF
instead of LF.  And there's an easy way to fix this problem - you can
change
 sed -n -e 's|.*/\* \("[A-Za-z_]*"\) \*/$$|  \1;|p' byterun/fail.h | \
to
 sed -n -e 's|.*/\* \("[A-Za-z_]*"\) \*/|  \1;|p' byterun/fail.h | \
in Makefile.nt (thus not matching end-of-line) - the result will be the
same, but it will work with CRLFs (matching ".?$" or "\r?$" or "\x0D?$"
instead of "$" won't work).
