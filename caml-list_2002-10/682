Skip this thread if syntax discussions don't interest you. 

    I was wondering what Revised users think about replacing comparison = with 
==, as in Haskell, and giving phys ref equality some other name? 

    Why? Well, = is overloaded in OCaml/Revised for both binding and  
comparison, and this change removes that overloading and uses a 
fairly common (C, Haskell, Clean,...) symbol == for equality. Physical 
reference equality should be used rather sparingly anyways so it is better 
perhaps that it not even be infix. 

    Besides the extra keystroke, I couldn't think of good reasons why not. 
Backwards compatibility is not much argument against changes in Revised 
syntax. 

    Another possible change along the same lines is having =/= or /= for 
inequality, which happens to look a little more like the mathematical 
symbol.
