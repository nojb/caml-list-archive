Few months ago I investigated the ability to write UDF ( User Defined
Function ) for MySQL under Win32. But it seems like this feature is only
available under *Nix versions of MySQL. The main points are the same. First
you write a C function with specific API in order to access fields and
values in a given row. Then you compile the C into a server-side DLL and
register it under MySQL with a specific SQL command which add a new SQL
keyword binded to your function.

Is there any differences with PortgreSQL ?
If only the API calls differs, should I advise you to consider having an
"opened API" design ( in order to support both PostgreSQL, MySQL, and maybe
other systems... )

Although I don't have dev time for it, I would agree to share ideas and
point of view with you about this subject.
