I agree completely. Here I only meant that a closing 'parenthesis' for
the match construction is desired. I don't use revised syntax and don't=
 know it,
but in the standard syntax you have to use parentheses over the entire =
'match...'
to resolve ambiguity.

Of course a masterpiece cannot be created by a referendum. :-)

Me too. BTW quite recently I made a presentation on FP in my company,
and one slide just showed two equivalent programs in Python and OCaml
side by side. This slide was crucial in the overall receiption of the
presentation.  My colleagues got a feeling that FP is not _that_ weird
(as one would infer from the previous slides ;-) after all. (Here in
biotech we use Python very intensively.)

Especially when you promote the language among skillful users of some
other language be it C or Ada or Python.
