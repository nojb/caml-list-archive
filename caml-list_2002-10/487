Subject: [Caml-list] 3 camlp4 questions
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


1.  Are the latest camlp4 manual and tutorial in the camlp4 cvs tree 
somewhere, or are they available as a tarball for downloading?  The 3.06 
versions are available as a tarball or as webpages, and the latest (3.06+6) 
are available as webpages, but I can't find them as a tarball.

2.  I'm trying to compile otags 3.04.3 but it's dying in pr.ml:

ocamlc -pp "camlp4o q_MLast.cmo" -c -I "`camlp4 -where`" pr.ml
File "pr.ml", line 105, characters 33-43:
While expanding quotation "class_type":
Parse error: ';' expected after [class signature item] (in [class type])
Preprocessor error
make: *** [pr.cmo] Error 2

That line looks like this:

     | <:class_type< object $cst$ $list:csf$ end >> ->
	List.iter pe_class_sig_item csf

This is with the cvs version of camlp4.  I don't know enough camlp4 yet to 
fix it.

3.  I'm trying to use camlp4o parsing in my toplevel running in emacs (on 
Win2k).  It works fine most of the time.  However, if I send a large buffer 
of text to the toplevel, emacs and the toplevel hang.  It's behaving 
exactly like a similar problem I had with the toplevel that I fixed and 
documented here:

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=fa.grqn5sv.1c46apb%40ifi.uio.no

With that fix (taking out the output for comments and newlines in 
toploop.ml), the toplevel works fine without camlp4o on these big files, 
but with camlp4o (and the fix) it still hangs.  The question is, is there a 
similar place in the camlp4o source that's outputting something per newline 
parsed at the top level?  In other words, does camlp4 output anything while 
it's eating input, or just when it finishes?
