I thought I was mostly passing on the common wisdom about the Num library.
 I didn't test it myself, but the numerix documentation has some
performance numbers which make the Big_int part of Num look quite weak
compared to GMP and Numerix  --- it came up as the loser over both in most
cases, especially for large sizes.   You can find it on Michel Quercia's
page.  But I don't know much about Num's performance outside of Michel's
results, and I'm open to being corrected.
