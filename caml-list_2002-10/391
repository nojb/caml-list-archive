Yes, binary distribution would work fine on windows.  Bytecode binary 
distribution for most libraries should work fine on all platforms.

I think at this point it's more important to do something small and get it 
going than it is to solve all possible package management problems.  Even 
something that just allowed a standard way of getting a tar ball of source 
for a given package and for its dependencies would be better than nothing, 
and we could improve it as we went.

The -pack option made this a lot simpler, because now libraries can be 
distributed as a single module.  If we make some relatively simple 
standards for build targets I think we can start making progress.

Of course, if something like apt would just work for us (on all platforms, 
source and binary), then that would be excellent and we should just start 
using it.
