No, CamlIDL doesn't support C function pointers.  The reason is that
mapping C functions pointers to Caml functions is easy, but mapping
Caml function closures to C functions is nearly impossible (there is
nowhere to store and pass the environment part of the closure).

However, CamlIDL support COM interfaces, which are basically a subset
of C++ classes.  These support two-way conversions between OCaml
objects (i.e. more or less collections of Caml functions) and COM objects
(i.e. more or less collections of C function pointers + instance
variables).
