In Unix, if you don't create a signal handler that explicitly handles or
ignores the signal SIGPIPE, this signal will be thrown to the application if
its tries to write to a file descriptor that has been closed (in particular
if it has received an RST from the remote TCP host).  If the signal is dealt
with by the application, the offending write will return the error EPIPE.  I
presume that the OCaml implementation has manifested the throwing of the
signal by raising the exception you are seeing.

Hope this helps.
Mike

Subject: [Caml-list] Uncaught exceptions (or am I going crazy?)


I'm getting some very weird behavior with respect to exception handling
in ocaml 3.06.  I'm probably missing something obvious, but here's my
situation.  I have a networking application which for some reason,
occasionally prints out the following message:

Uncaught exception: Sys_error("Broken pipe")

What's so strange about this is that as far as I can tell, there is no
place in my code where I actually print out such errors.  In particular,
the text "Uncaught exception" doesn't appear anywhere in my code, and I
don't see any printfs that could be the cause either.  And weirdly, this
only seems to come up with byte-code compiled code.

So has anyone else seen something like this?
