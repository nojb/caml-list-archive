Well, I took a look at the 2nd-place C program a bit--it's *designed*
to use as much CPU time as possible, up to the limit.  Whenever it has
time left over after planning, it uses that left over time to improve
its map of the world.  Apparently in the default setup, it will always
take very near to one full CPU second per move.

That might explain the "CPU-hungry" nature of the entry, even though
it's written in C.
