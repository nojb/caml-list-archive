If you read Haskell, you should look at Haskore (the documentation is
a Haskell litteral program).

http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/haskore/

Paul Hudak wrote a few papers on the subject.

But the best work (in my opinion) has been done by the IRCAM with
their program Open Music (in Lisp). It is much more difficult to
understand.

I also remember a Caml program (for guitar) by a student of ENS Ulm
but I haven't been able to find it again. I will give more information
as soon as I find it.
