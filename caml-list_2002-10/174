I am an anti-smoke radical, and I must state this before I 
continue. "Joe Camel" c'est sympa! C'est tout! I refuse to 
delete from my vocabulary all words and acronyms which in 
specific contexts mean something I abhor. For example, I do 
not advocate nuking Marlborough, Massachusetts, because of 
the famous cigarettes.

This project is about catergorical abstract "machins", not 
about cigarettes.

Sorry for mixing French and English, but some words like 
"sympa" and "machin" cannot be translated.
