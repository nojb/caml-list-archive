I'm trying to find (for download?) the paper 

G. Cousineau, P.-L. Curien, and M. Mauny. The categorical abstract machine

Alternatively (or additionally) any downloable reading about CAMs would be 
very helpfull (I've been reading some CT, and I'm trying to learn about 
its computer science applications).

I understand that CAML was originally based on a CAM, but this is no 
longer so... I'd appreciate any comments/references of the reasons it was 
abandoned.

Thank you

Enrique Vetere
