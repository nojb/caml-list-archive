Hi

Lists like caml-list@inria.fr are a wonderful place to get help, but I would=
 like to comment on the way that list is set up. There is no Reply-to: field=
 in the headers, so when I click "reply" in my e-mail-reader,=
 caml-list@inria.fr is not addressed, but only the sender of the message. I=
 have to manually change it each time. I dislike that (and I hate bugging=
 people with e-mails that should go directly to the list). Is this really=
 ment to be so?

Second, the prefix [Caml-list] does not always appear first in the subject=
 line, but could be anywhere. This makes filtering less obvious. Is this=
 also ment to be so?

Regards,
~HY
