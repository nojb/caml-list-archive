I must warn you that Caml is a bit special: it is known as extremely
addictive. Many people that learnt it seriously, just don't want to
give it up and go back to real programming with *p++ or null pointers ...

You have to consider that before trying Caml: it could very well be
your last attempt to learn a new language.

A better (and more cautious) approach would be to try all other
languages first (it ensures that the process will long for years) and
at the end, last but not least, try Caml :)

All the best for trying to learn Caml!
