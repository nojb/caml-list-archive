We could answer: why "standard ML" has a different syntax than Caml?
Caml is as old as standard ML: we did not decide to differentiate.
Don't be fixed on the word "standard" which is just a "marketting"
term, not a real standardization.

Well, if you prefer standard ML syntax, do it! and compile your
programs by:
      ocamlc -pp "camlp4 pa_sml.cmo pr_dump.cmo" -c foo.ml

And why not Scheme syntax:
      ocamlc -pp "camlp4 pa_scheme.cmo pr_dump.cmo" -c foo.ml

For example?

That's right: but this difference is not just syntax: it has big
consequences on typing.
