Well, debian uses a system with upload queues, and signed package witha
strong web of trust between developpers who are allowed to upload
packages. Sure we also have ssh access on most debian boxes, but this is
not necessary for uploading.

I am sure a scheme could be found for this kindof distribution, with an
upload queue, where you could anonymously upload packages, which get
scanned for secure signatures and uploaded onto the server, or something
such. Maybe you could go without signatures even, since after all, there
is nothing critical and absolutely needing root access in the ocaml
packages.

Well, the problem is more in the dependency handling, and could be worse
if you maintain binary distribution, like you do for windows. But
anyway, i don't believe you could really afford to do binary
distribution for something else than windows or maybe macOSX.

It is very difficult to do this nicely without an integrated
distribution. Mmm, maybe it can be done, but would need lot of work, and
anyway, inria don't has the vast multi arch build farm that debian has,
so i don't know if it would be meaningfull.
