I must advise you to download the O'Reilly caml-book, and
read through it. The answers to all your questions are in there.

Yes. Modules can contain modules. Every compilation unit
automatically defines a module. An ".mli" defines the
signature of the module defined ecapsulating the
corresponding ".ml".

I don't understand what you mean.

> 3) take set.ml and set.mli for example which defined one functor: Make and two sigs : S and OrderedType.  But when we use , we use this command    Set.Make(..).       "Set" here seem can only get from the name of the file. So it seems the file name determined the library name .  Then how about the noraml module (not functor) case that if i define a module A with a funtion a(), in file b.ml and b.mli, how can i refer to a() in module A.  A.a() or B.A.a() or B.a()?

As I already pointed out, the compiler encapsulates every
".ml" in its own module declaration, where the name of the
module is equal to the name of file, with the first letter
capitalized. Therefore, if you can write
