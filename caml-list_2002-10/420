I've found Haskell's use of IO monads to be "interesting", but terribly=20
restricting and hard to understand. I do like their operator and function=
=20
overloading mechanisms though - I wish Ocaml would have something similar=
 (it=20
just gets tedius having to add a "." in every floating point calculation)=
.=20
I've also had problems with converting stateful programs into Haskell.

That's strange. How could the Haskell program not have to do IO?

Now, that is very true.

PKE.
