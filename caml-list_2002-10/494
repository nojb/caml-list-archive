I created the cameleon-list because, suddenly, there seemed to be various users having problems compiling cameleon, and the caml-list is NOT the place to discuss about it. The cameleon-list is the good place to post such messages, as you won't bother caml-list subscribers not interested in cameleon.
You may think it's stupid, it's your opinion. But I think that people on this list will agree with me. 
BTW, sending error reports just saying "it fails" IS stupid : I had to ask you for the error messages...

AS replied by Remi, I don't claim Cameleon works on Windows, but should work on Cygwin under Windows, which is different.

As you may have read on the cameleon-list, if someone wants to port the building system of Cameleon to Windows, i'll be happy to add it to the cameleon distrib. I can't do everything. Please don't blame people for not doing something YOU need.

I know I should not say that but here it comes : What about spending some time reading docs ?
