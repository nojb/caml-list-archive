This brings about an interesting problem, which I would like 
the developers to comment on.

I'm using O'Caml in an industrial project. Of course, I'd 
like to make sure that I give my customers the most stable 
environment possible. As more and more bugs are found and 
fixed in the CVS version, the temptation to upgrade from the 
official distribution becomes stronger. But is the CVS 
version usually more or less buggy than the official distro?

I know this is a very diffucult question, and that it is 
much easier to answer, "Try and it, and if you find a bug, 
report it." Yet, I would like the developers to take a stand 
on the use of the cvs source. Do you encourage widespread 
use? Do you encourage use only for testing purposes?

I ask because I would like to stick with official 
reccomendations, rather than experimenting on completely 
unknown grounds.

TIA

Alex
