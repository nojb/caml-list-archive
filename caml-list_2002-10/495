	===> More advanced?  In what way?  They follow different paradigms,
e.g. lazy/eager evaluation, but that doesn't necessarily make one more
advanced than another.

	==> Yes, I've seen what you've posted.  Here are some examples:

	"No. I am asking for a sample program. Can't you read, but then from
	the rest of the post I can see that you are not very intelligent."

	"<clipped>A lot of shit about how great functional programming is
but
	all slogans no substance. </clipped>"

	"Are there any people out there who are not language zealots who
know
	what they are talking about and understand higher order functions?"

	and 

	"Are you realy that stupid?"

	- to which I can only suggest that the person you were insulting
isn't, but you certainly seem to be.  I won't bother commenting on the rest
of your diatribe.
