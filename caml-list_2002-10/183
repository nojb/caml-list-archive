I'll try the rest later, but a comment for now.

I took the self-extacting 3.06 distribution.
( For those with no Windows knowledge. )
Basically an executable that is supposed to 
set everything up. 

So if this is an installation problem one of the people
creating the distribution screwed up.

PS: The file is there. I checked before sending.

PPS: camlp4 -where reports c:/caml/lib/camlp4/ which is just wrong.
About six months ago I put on an old version of caml ( which I removed
) perhaps that is causing the problem.
