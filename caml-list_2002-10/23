Subject: [Caml-list] Uncaught exceptions (or am I going crazy?)

I'm getting some very weird behavior with respect to exception handling 
in ocaml 3.06.  I'm probably missing something obvious, but here's my 
situation.  I have a networking application which for some reason, 
occasionally prints out the following message:

Uncaught exception: Sys_error("Broken pipe")

What's so strange about this is that as far as I can tell, there is no 
place in my code where I actually print out such errors.  In particular, 
the text "Uncaught exception" doesn't appear anywhere in my code, and I 
don't see any printfs that could be the cause either.  And weirdly, this 
only seems to come up with byte-code compiled code.

So has anyone else seen something like this?
