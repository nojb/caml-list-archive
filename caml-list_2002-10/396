Just that it is not used yet. You know from previous threads that i
strongly advocate its use for all libraries, including pervasives, the
standard library. This is for namespace control, not distribution.

Well, apple uses it (for darwin) so there should be no portability
issues. But then, i would have done a ocaml reimplementation, which
would allow to do some more advanced stuff, like checking for external
dependencies, which are not packaged. This cannot be done with the
standard dpkg/apt.
