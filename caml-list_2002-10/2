Depending of the platform, POSIX threads may not or badly
available. Emulation can be set up, either by coercing existing thread
capabilities to the POSIX interface, or by implementing a POSIX thread
library, using processes and interprocesses communications to do the job (i
have been told it was the way with linux, please confirm or infirm it).

Maybe the switch is here because it is better to use POSIX threads when they
are well supported by the system (e.g. BSDs); but the caml thread emulation
may give better results in (some) other cases.
