Nope, 3.05, so it's pretty new!

I agree, hopefully the whole standard library will be -packed in the next 
release (assuming we fix the windows -pack, which is likely).  Perhaps that 
will break too much stuff, though...

There's also the question of how smart the linker is on packed 
objects...hopefully it will only link used modules and functions (and the C 
linker will do the same).  A few tests could answer this...

Yes, but if we don't even have time to use apt, we definitely don't have 
time to rewrite it.  :)  I think going with something that works but is 
nonoptimal is the way to start making progress on this problem.
