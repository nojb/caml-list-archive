Xavier,

Is there a particular reason why ocamlmklib does not support the pack
option ?

$ cat a.ml
let z = 0
$ cat b.ml
let z = 1
$ ocamlc -c a.ml 
$ ocamlc -c b.ml 
$ ocamlc -a -pack -o lib.cma a.cmo b.cmo
$ cat c.ml
let z = 18
let () = Printf.printf "z = %d, A.z = %d, B.z = %d\n" z A.z B.z
$ ocamlc -o test lib.cma c.cmo
$ ./test
z = 18, A.z = 1, B.z = 0

But ...

$ ocamlmklib -pack -o lib a.cmo b.cmo
Unknown option -pack

Is this because the pack option is not supported on all arches ?

Also, i have the feeling that the correct way of distributing a bunch of
.cmo is to create a .cma, not to cram them together in a super .cmo
thanks to the pack option, i may be wrong about this though.

The current documentation only gives an example of using the -pack
option to build .cmos, not to build a .cma. Maybe such an example could
be added, or at least a little notice about it ?

BTW, advi build fails on ia64, i think ocamlopt on ia64 does not like the
big array in dvicolor.ml, since removing some of the entries will make
the build work (you have to cut them after grey50 or somethign such). Is
this a bug in ocamlopt/ia64, or a normal restriction on array size ?

Friendly,

Sven Luther






I have a question about this selfsame behavior, but then i admit, i did
not have time to test this myself.

My impression of the way to use the pack option is that you should use
it to create libraries, not super object files like it is done here.

I think the natural way of distributing a bunch of .cmo is to provide a
.cma, like it was done before, not have people
