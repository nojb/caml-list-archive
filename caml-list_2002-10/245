But it is the lower bit that is ignored, no, si i guess incrementing an
ocaml integer by 1, correspond to incrementing the machine integer by
two, and would set the overflow flag in the processor status register
all the same, would it not ? 

The flag is then ignored, but it is set all the same, at least until it
is overriden by some other calculation.
