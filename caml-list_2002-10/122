I've looked for this feature in both the manual and the O'Reilly book
and asked numerous people. If it exists, it seems not to be that well
known.

The feature itself should be quite simple to implement. The basic
idea is to specify a environmental variable, call it CAML_PATH
or CAML_LIBRARY_PATH, which is a colon seperated (semicolon for
Windows ) list of directories where libraries can be found.

It would add greatly to portability of Caml programs and libraries.
Yes you can add libraries on the commandline, but to make projects
portable you have to resort to tricks with scripts producing scripts.
( Autoconfig,Automake etc come to mind. ) It becomes particularly
nasty when scripts or script generating scripts are for one reason or
another broken.

Using the technique I describe, a person adding a library only has
to do two things: 1) Set the environmental variable to include needed
libraries; 2) Follow the normal build procedure.
