That was exactly my proposal some time ago:

No way! It would only require adding "open Std" to the existing
sources. But we can even introduce it transparately (although I think it is
really not necessary): open Std by default (like Pervasives) and having a
compiler flag "-nostd" (like "-nopervasives") to disable this auto open.

Everybody except Ocaml developers seems to agree that the standard library
in Std module is a good idea :-)
