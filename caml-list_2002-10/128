I can live with asynchronous killing :)

That's what I thought. Unfortunately, not all functions can
be cooperative, and I wanted to stop a gethostbyname and
open_connection (+reads and writes) if it took too long.
I know how to do this for reads and writes, but not the others.
And I could live with the bytecode version, but I wouldn't want
to maintain 2 ocaml distributions ...

Thanks for your time,
nadji
