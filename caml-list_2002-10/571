Unless I'm mistaken, ocamlopt doesn't generate a camlprim.c file;
ocamlc -custom does.  The reason for going through C in this case is
that ocamlc has no knowledge of the assembly language for the
processor: ocamlc is designed to work for any system that provides an
ANSI C compiler.

We have addressed this issue in at least two different ways.  One is
the dynamic loading of C/Caml stub code, as implemented since release
3.04.  Now is the time for external C libraries to use this mechanism,
especially if they are to run under Windows.  The second answer to
this problem is the Mingw port.  Don't complain about lack of options :-)
