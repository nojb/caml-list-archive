I probably did not consider the problem thoroughly enough. I 
was expecting "%[]]" to match a range of ']' and "%[]" to 
match the empty range of characters (which is a rather 
useless construct anyway, as you point out). Now I realize 
this would render almost impossible the interpretation of a 
such a format as "%[]abcdefg...": you simply never know if 
it is the prefix of a range conversion specifier or a empty 
range conversion specifier followed by a string constant 
specifier.

While the empty range conversion is admittedly useless, a 
full range conversion is a whole different story. Coding it 
as "%[\000-\255]" is possible, but maybe it would useful to 
add a "%z" specifier to mean "read till the end of input".

What do you think?
