There are other possibilities, such as having a group of moderators taking 
messages out of a set and thus spreading the work. I assume the Caml team 
considered this and decided it wasn't worth the effort. I'll urge you to 
reconsider, but just once, since I don't want to start a moderation 
meta flamefest. 

Others posters have suggested even more segmentation of the Caml lists, such 
as industrial vs academic, but I think that's a really bad idea. Unlike some 
ill-behaved "industrial" programmers, I don't see this distinction as being 
a meaningful or interesting one. The problem as I see it is a decline in 
SNR (signal to noise ratio for the acronym impaired ;) since the end of 
moderation. A large part of that is probably beginner's questions, but the 
increasing number of hostile flames is ominous. 

Perhaps, viewed optimistically, this is the inevitable result of Caml's 
increasing popularity.
