Honest to god, I had never about Joe Camel before perusing 
http://caml.inria.fr. I thought the only connection with 
cigarettes was the name. I was fully convinced that what 
made that camel a really cool dude were first class 
functions and polymorphic type inference. Only now have I 
discovered that Joe Camel is a cartoon character used by a 
tobacco corporation to publicize its products.

Given this, I ask forgiveness of DdR for having criticized 
his standpoint on the matter.
