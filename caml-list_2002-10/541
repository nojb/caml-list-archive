These numbers are very valuable information...

The information that ocamldebug gave you is helpful : it provides the
mean to go back way before the bus error (Time 290000), and ensures
that the bus error will appear before Time 300000. To go (go) just before
the bus error and ask for a backtrace then (bt) is just a matter of
dichotomy and is very fast. Once your very near the bus error you can
step use instruction stepping (s) and print (p) and next event (n) to
understand what happens.

(Use help in the debugger to get help in the debugger.)

This is a bit fast: don't forget the time difference between you and
the rest of the world! Also consider that people may have something
else to do than answering to your message just now!
