You might then be interested in Caml Weekly News ... It's a weekly
summary of what I (subjectively) find objectively interesting on the
mailing list (all announcement, and some insightful discussion). It's
sent to the Linux Weekly News for inclusion in the development page, but
I also bcc people who ask me. So don't hesitate to ask ;-)

Best,

Alan
