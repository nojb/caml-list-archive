Actually, it looks like ld supports pe-i386 files as well, so there's just 
a couple small places to patch asmpackager.ml (msvc generates a leading 
underscore on symbols) and it should work.  I'll fix the objcopy command 
line length problem as well (I guess I should sync cvs and make sure that's 
not already fixed) while I'm in there, and post a small patch.
