OK, thanks. Things work better now. But there still is a problem. There=
 seems to be noe file named "ocamlrun.a" anywhere, but it is required by=
 byterun/Makefile.nt, line 43:
        $(CC) -o ocamlrun.exe main.$(DO) ocamlrun.$(A)

I get this error in the DOS console:
C:/mingw/bin/gcc -mno-cygwin -o ocamlrun.exe main.d.o ocamlrun.a
gcc: ocamlrun.a: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [ocamlrun.exe] Error 1
make: *** [coldstart] Error 2

(I need to specify full path to gcc, because I have WebObjects installed on=
 my computer, with an older version of gcc. It took a while to figure that=
 out. WO has bugged me before, overriding my java paths, so I really wasn't=
 all that surprised.)

Is ocamlrun.a really missing, or am I overlooking something again?

Thanks,
~H
