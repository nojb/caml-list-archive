I am a 'victim' of OCaml's addictiveness, but I agree with
okzyk@interaccess.com in some points. The syntax is bit uncommon,
but my main problem were the compiler error messages in the 3.02 version.
Automatic type derivation is a concept that requires some acclimatisation.
The debugger keeps telling me that there is no code where I want to set a
breakpoint. As I am used to the 'printf debugging style, this is no real
problem for me.

However, after having mastered these obstacles, I use OCaml wherever
possible. A SIP (IP telephony) client written in OCaml processes real-time
audio without a problem and a OCaml SIP call generator outperforms some
commercial tools. A code size comparison between my SIP parser (~5000 lines OCaml)
and the corresponding parts of the free Vovida stack (~50 000 lines C++)
speaks for itself.

Some promlems remain: If I need co-workers in a project, teaching them OCaml
would take too much time. It's not just teaching OCaml but teaching the
functional paradigma as well.
In a small commercial project, licensing was an issue. But yes, I've earned
my department money in a project using OCaml. 

No, OCaml is not a fraud.
