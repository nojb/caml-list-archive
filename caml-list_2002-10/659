Ah, woe is me! I put ashes on my head. I do not understand 
the example, but yes, what I am asking for is essentially, a 
substitution of constant expressions for their alias in the 
syntax tree of the program. So yes: CamlP4 can do it. Since 
I don't want to reinvent the wheel, has anyone written--and 
documented for the syntax laymen--such an extension?
