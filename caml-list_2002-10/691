I was thinking of Ada with /=, but I agree with others that this isn't that 
important. You could make the argument that <> is better than /= since it is 
symmetric. I'm not fond of != in classic OCaml for that reason and since 
the ! usually makes me think of dereferencing. 

Anyways, the "=" change is really the one I care about. 

I'll have to check my Ada 83 Rationale to see why Ichbiah and the Green 
Team chose /= instead of <>, since Ada is based on Pascal. There's a 
similar syntactic quirkiness about Ada as in OCaml, where constants 
are given values with ":=" instead of "is". IMO, of course ;-)
