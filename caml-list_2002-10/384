Maybe -thread is missing? Selecting the package "threads" without -thread does
not have any effect.

As explained.

Linking a library with libraries does not work for native code. Btw, your approach
would also not work if ocaml had been configured for bytecode threads, because the
-thread option has a special effect in this case (selects a different version of the
standard library). This is why ocamlfind demands -thread always, even if the
ocaml compiler sometimes does not need it (when linking executables for POSIX threads).

Simply follow the rule: Give both -thread and -package threads for compiling
and linking.

I hope this helps,

Gerd
