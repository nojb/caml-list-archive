Well, O'caml programming is so much fun that everybody wants to
reinvent the wheel. I really understand that, I'm also tempted
every day.

My wheel came into the world in the spring of 2000, and has grown
since that a lot. It is now called "ocamlnet" after the fusion
with Patrick Doane's wheel, and includes not only a parser for RFC(2)822 
messages, but supports also the MIME RFCs (2045-47), RFC 2231, 
parsing of dates, the ability to parse from pipelines chunk by 
chunk, and last but not least even printers for these (partly 
brain-dead) formats. You also find an HTML parser, and a lot of
other useful stuff. It is now more a mobile construction set than
a wheel.

By the way: if anybody has something to contribute, any addition
that is useful, works, and will be maintained is still accepted.
