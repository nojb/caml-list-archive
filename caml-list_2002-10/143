Yes: it was integrated in version 3.04, last year (by me). And now,
because of this conflict, I claim that Camlp4 return to its previous
state: separately developped. But the direction refuses.

No: "separating" is a good compromise, not "integrating".

When people cannot get on together, the solution is to separate
them, in order that they can go on working.

I have been feeling better work in a separate version of Camlp4, and I
have had more ideas in this liberty; in that position, I feel better
in front of those who say that it is a "waste of time". I don't give a
damm of what they say and I use my energy developping, debugging and
improving it.

The problem, the serious problem, is that the direction refuses that.
Because of you, users, of course, and I understand that. But try to
explain that to my imagination: sorry, inside a constraint to work
inside a system who considers my work as a waste of time, I am blocked,
I cannot have ideas. Research is a creative action, I am not a robot.
I am an human being and I cannot work in any conditions.
