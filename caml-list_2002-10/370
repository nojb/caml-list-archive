I can't understand this recurring obstination: we _have_ a package
manager, it's name is 'findlib'.
It's ligthweight, simple, and do its dirty work well.

When there was the CDK I have seen a sort of concurrency between findlib
and CDK, but now .... is better not to use any package manager or to use
findlib?

[ please not that I've never used the CDK, I'm only replying regarding
  the need of a package manager, please forget this mail if it will be
  evidently off-thread ]

My 0.02 EUR.
Cheers.
