I insist because I consider that as important, what the direction does
not. And be sure that I shall not quit that fight.

If OCaml wants to succeed in the industry, some reflexions must not be
tolerated: the direction of OCaml refuses to understand that elementary
point and prefer think that the problem is me.

It is not developped any more, but there are still users. Therefore,
the bugs are fixed. If I quit developping Camlp4, there will be no
more developpments on it, and it will be like Caml Light: you will be
able to use it, but for the improvements, it is terminated.
