I was told that nm and objcopy might work on MSVC-generated object
files.  But I was also warned that the .obj file format used by MSVC
might not be *exactly* the documented PE format...  So, basically, it
should work most of the time, but might break.

A perhaps less risky alternative is to use the mingw build of OCaml.
I encourage all our advanced Windows users to give it a try and let us
know if it works well.  If it does, it might provide a better
alternative to the MSVC build (working -pack, no need to fetch MASM
from obscure places, etc).

I don't fully understand what you're describing.  Let us (you and me)
discuss that off-list once you've experimented some more.
