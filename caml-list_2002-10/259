Didn't know that. (Mostly i know about powerpc and M68K assembly only).

Mmm, Is that why these processors are faster on number crunshing ? Or
better said, a consequence of designing these processors fro being fast
at number crunshing ?

Did you ever got hand on a MAJC processor, which supposedly has an extra
bit for GC purpose, or something such ?
