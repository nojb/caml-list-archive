The SML basis library provides the nice but often overlooked concept of
substrings (or more generally, vector slices,
http://SML.sourceforge.net/Basis/substring.html). Ported to Caml the
Substring module would enable

where your parsing functions operate on substrings instead of strings.
Such an approach seems like a good compromise between use of a heavy
regexp lib and inefficient repeated copying of parts of strings.
