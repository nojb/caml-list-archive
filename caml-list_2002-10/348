Is there any plan to "break up" the CDK libraries again?  In some ways it's 
worse now than before, because now a lot of the libraries (like asmdynlink) 
depend on a ton of CDK files and patches to the compiler because it was 
"convenient" to do so in the CDK.  But, now that the CDK is dead, it's even 
harder to separate out the libraries you want.

So, while it was a noble effort and I really respect and appreciate the 
effort and the attempt, it's kind of a lose now because all of those 
previously separate useful libraries are trapped in the decaying body!  :)
