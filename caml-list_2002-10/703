input_line has to work a bit harder than wc because it actually copies
the data to strings.  However, on my tests with your program (Linux,
OCaml 3.06), this makes essentially no difference: both your code and
wc run at about 50 Mb/s.  

Two possible explanations:

1- The file wasn't in the file cache when you timed your program; then you
timed wc, at which time the file was in the file cache.  In other
terms, you're measuring the difference between a "cold cache read" and a
"warm cache read".  Try measuring wc first :-)

2- Your file contains very long lines and you're using OCaml 3.04 or
earlier.  There was a performance bug in pre-3.06 versions causing
input_line to run slowly on very long lines (100000 characters or
more).
