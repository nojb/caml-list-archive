Hello,


some months ago I asked for the possibility
to create e.g. human bodies' animations
with Ocaml.

There was mentioned a program, written in
Ocaml, using OpenGL (lablgl?) for creation of
such animations.

I have looked onto the homepage of that program,
and it was very interesting, but I
missed the link and the mail-response to my question,
so I ask again for the name of the program and the
link.

What program was it and where can I find that project?

TIA,
  Oliver
