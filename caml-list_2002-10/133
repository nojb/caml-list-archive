It's obviously clear from the list archives that people think campl4 is a 
very good thing.  It's a great and useful tool.  It makes the ocaml system 
more powerful.  It's a win.  From a user's perspective, it is by far better 
if it is included in the main distribution/installation so my programs can 
use it and be portable to other people's installations.

It would be great if the drama associated with it could just go away...as 
we say here in the states, "Can't we all just get along?"  It's impossible 
to tell who is at "fault" in the machinations from the weird snippets we 
see on the list, but I doubt any user on the list actually gives a flying 
lambda.  We just want to use ocaml.  You guys all need some group therapy, 
and to resolve your differences like adults, and get back to work.

Thanks for a great language,
Chris
