Yes, I was aware of that, only it's quite some now so that I attempted
to compile it myself.

I thought it's enough to have the ocaml-source installed. :(

I have ocaml-3.0.6 unzipped at ../ocaml-3.0.6. So I cd to that
directory, "./configure" and "make world opt". Then I switch back to
cameleon-1.1, which is cleanly gunzipped, and do the following:
./configure --includedir ../ocaml-3.0.6
make depend
make
I get all the same errors. :(

I still don't know what I've done wrong.

Even if I can compile cameleon myself, I prefer to the debian packages.
That would be great! Thanks.
