Num is by all accounts a pretty mediocre bignum implementation.  There's
also mlgmp, which is an interface to GMP.  I haven't used it, but GMP is
fast.  There's also Numerix, which I have used. Numerix at least at one
point was a good deal faster than GMP in many cases, and is very easy to
use.  I'm not sure how GMP and Numerix compare in terms of speed these
days, since GMP has seen more development and Numerix has not.
