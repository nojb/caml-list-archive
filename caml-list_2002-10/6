Right, I believe this is a small bug in the 3.06 distribution
(the file byterun/.depend.nt should be in the distributed sources, but
isn't).

Probably the file bytecomp/runtimedef.ml was generated incorrectly,
maybe because you didn't use the correct version of "sed".  The
Win32 Makefiles are known to work with GNU sed as found in Cygwin, but
one user reported problems with another version of sed coming from
another Windows port of Unix tools.
