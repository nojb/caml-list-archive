This is a good idea, indeed, but I have two remarks:

- first, this is more a question of library than syntax; Camlp4 can do
  that, but it is a not really clean. Well, actually, it does it for the
  record label "contents" which is renamed "val" in the revised syntax
  (to be shorter).

- second, it is a semantic change, and if programs using the revised
  syntax used the physical equality ==, this change would change their
  code into normal equality.

Therefore, IMHO, this could be included only if there are several
other changes, a set of several changes being more acceptable.

I agree with you, for the same reasons.
