    Bonjour,

I answer here to a few frequently asked questions :

- Baire hasn't changed for more than one month, not that it is
considered ready to release (there is still a lot of work to do) but
the last month I have been working on long term evolution rather than
short term.

- I have been asked (many times) for a better support of english in
Baire (documentation, comments, web-page), and some people would like
to package it.

In my opinion Baire is not yet ready for packaging and stable official
release. I am preparing a 0.1 version with a better english (hope
multilingual) support, more homogenity, more documentation, (less
bugs), etc.

- I have been asked to change Baire web-site of place (mostly because
of annoying advertising and download times), I also have been asked
for a CVS.

I hope I will be able to put it on the server of the university in a
few weeks but it does not depend only on me.


        Diego Olivier
