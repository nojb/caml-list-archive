The "-i" ocamlc compiler flag is what you need.
It prints all the types found in the ML file.
But since there is no rule for interface exclusion, you have to maintain
separatly both ML & MLI files.

For example, if you start working on a new module, you can start writing it
without any interface ( then all members are "public" ) and after some
testing you write the interface and that way ensure that your implemenation
match exactly what's in your mind ( not always obvious :)
