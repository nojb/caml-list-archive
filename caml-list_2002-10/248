Mmmh, I did not intend to launch a new flamewar here ...

Maybe you can give some information yourself about the library. If I want
to manipulate only integers (no rational numbers), most of which will be
small integers, is it better to use Num or Big_int ?  Would Num benefit to
be specialized to (small+big) integers (that is, throwing away the Ratio
constructor) ?  Because int values and Big_int values can be distinguished
at runtime, one could imagine implementing the union "by hand" (without
explicit tagging, and thus avoiding a lot of memory allocation and
garbage collection). What would be the gain ?

General question: the library seems to be extremely stable since a several
years. Does it mean you consider that it is just good as it is, or does it
mean you don't want to continue working on it  ?
