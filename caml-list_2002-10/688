It's an idea that is worth considering. It fits well with the consistent
use of the other C like operators as "||" and "&&" and the disposal of
"or".

I've seen somewhere the operator "===" for physical equality, infix
obviously. It's not really diffused but seems to me that is really
intuitive.

Uhm ... I disagree here, changing an operator in favour of a more
diffused one is comfortable, adopting a new one from scratch just
because it look more like the mathematical symbol can be really
confusing ...

Cheers.
