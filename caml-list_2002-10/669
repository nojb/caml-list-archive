Hi,

There is already a Camlp4 syntax extension "pa_ifdef.cmo" which adds
"define" and "ifdef" (in lowercases). This is more for conditional
compilation.

In C macros, you have the two system with the same #define directive:
   #define FOO
   #define FOO(x) (...)

The first form suggests that you are going to do a conditional compilation
somewhere with #ifdef or #ifndef (and you can do it also in the command
line by -DFOO: the pa_ifdef.cmo Camlp4 extension adds also this option
-D).

The second form suggests that you are going to do a macro substitution.

Is is a good idea to follow the same idea in Camlp4 macros?
I.e. having one construction for both cases? I don't know.
I think it is possible, but perhaps a little bit tricky.
Does anybody have an opinion?
