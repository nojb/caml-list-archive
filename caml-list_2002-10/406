Interesting, but I still think ocaml maintains its superiority not only in 
traditional string and list processing but algorithmic prowess as well.

I have a feeling I can beat any ANN implementation written in C++ for that 
matter ;) I was writing a generic ANN library in C++ and found it to be quite 
difficult to put together different kinds of networks and algorithms in the 
same basket. It would really benefit from a well designed generic graph 
library which I can imagine would be possible only in a functional language.

Cheers,
