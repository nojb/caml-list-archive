Well, as Maxence Guesdon says, it is really a pain to retain them.
Because it implies complicated actions in the lexer *and* in the parser.

Storing the comments, as Sven luther suggests, well, why not? But it
is complicated also.

A simple solution would be to store... the whole input! This way I
could read the "input file" in memory, and I am sure the change would
be easy to program.

I can do that, just for the case when the input is the standard one.
Are you interested and OK for this solution, even if it uses more
memory? (but now, machine memory spaces is big).
