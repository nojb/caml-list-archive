Microsoft's SSCLI distribution, which is freely downloadable, includes a
fast industrial-strength C# to .NET compiler. This is written in less than
100,000 lines of C++.  By your reckoning, you should be able to write an
equivalent compiler in 5,000 lines of O'Caml.  Are you willing to produce
an example compiler to substantiate your claim?

I'm staggered at your suggestion that C++ has a simple semantics.  To me, a
major advantage of the ML family is that their semantics is relatively simple.
