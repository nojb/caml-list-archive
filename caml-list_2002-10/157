What's the title of the thread? I can't seem to find it.

( Given how trivial the change is I find it hard to believe that
it would generate any sort of discussion. )

Are you telling me that if I have someones xyz library 
and it can't build because it can't find libraries already installed
on my machine, that all I would have to do (to fix it) is add findlib.

Are you saying that if I have a library that relies on libraries and
I want to distribute it, all I have to do is add findlib with no other
effort.

If not then findlib is not the solution to this problem.
