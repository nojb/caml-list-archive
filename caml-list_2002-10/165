I think camlp4 is a very interesting system, but there are many cool
things in the world, and I don't have time to get deeply into all of
them.  All I really care about is that there be some convenient way to
do parsers built into ocaml (i.e. without lex/yacc - and yes, there
are lots of times I'm willing to pay any resulting efficiency penalty).
I don't know who decided that camlp4 was the way to do that, but
somebody did, and so I hope that at least that much of camlp4 comes as
part of the ocaml distribution.

It may meet your (Daniel's) personal wishes that camlp4 be separated
from ocaml, but I think that for the rest of us, it is better that it
be shipped with ocaml.

Good luck and good wishes to all trying to clean up the personal mess.
