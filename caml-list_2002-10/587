I'm very sorry.  Sincere apologies.

I mistakenly assumed, since the documentation does not explicitly say 
that the inherit clause defines a constructor method named after the 
superclass, that your examples would not compile.  Surprisingly, they 
actually do in ocaml-3.06.  It's not the most pleasant syntax I could 
imagine, but I'm very pleased to see that it's already possible to do 
what I want.

I have a suspicion, though, that the implementation makes a lot of 
temporary copies in this process.  Is that so?

Oh, never mind.  I'll find out for myself.  Thanks for all your help.
