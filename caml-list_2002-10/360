Apple uses a modification of apt/dpkg for darwin also, so it would not
be to far away. I was more thinking along the lines of a partial/minimal
reimplementation in ocaml though, using a separate status archive on
systems who don't have integrated package system. If MacOS X can be made
to use apt or something similar, i would be interrested by where they
get the packages from, and if the plain debian source packages can be
used there. Any mac user care for it enough to try ?

The problem will also be present for people not using a debian based
linux distrib, but i guess they rely on either inria packages or they OS
vendor. Altough i suppose if we manage to have something working that
works on windows, they can use it too without much modifications.
