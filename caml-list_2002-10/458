Dear caml-list
 
 Could you explain this senence for me in the Ocaml mannul in Using coerecions?
" When the domain of a coercion is left implicit and its co-domain is an abbreviation of a known class type, then the class type rather than the object type, is used to derive the coercion functions".

i am not quite clear the defintion of  codomain ,  class type and object type  respectively?


Best regards
            
              Yours
