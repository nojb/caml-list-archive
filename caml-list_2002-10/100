What do you mean? I have never done something like this. Maybe you mix it
up with one of the following ideas:

- PXP supports some kind of "class selection". Depending of the name of the
  XML/HTML element, different classes can be instantiated to represent the
  element in the object tree
- In WDialog it is possible to bind ocaml code at various stages of
  page processing in order to customize the actions. The XML/HTML document and
  the ocaml code are connected by various kinds of binding tags.
  It is part of the philosphy to separate the HTML markup from the algorithm
  generating the HTML blocks from input data.

Neither of these concepts need the ocaml compiler at runtime, but I have
dynamic HTML pages in mind, so calling the compiler would be a bad idea
(security, performance, etc.).
