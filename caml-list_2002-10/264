hi

  Have anyone succeded at building OCaml (with native-code
compilers and threads) under MinGW?
  Can you say which packages (with its versions) have you installed
to do this, what was the order of directories in your PATH if you
have installed both cygwin and mingw, and which makefiles have you
used to build OCaml?

bye
