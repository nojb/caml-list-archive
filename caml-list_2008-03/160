                           CALL FOR PAPERS

                 The 2008 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

                      Sunday, September 21, 2008
                  Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
               To be held in conjunction with ICFP 2008

               http://www.kb.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/ml2008/

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission deadline:        Monday, June 23, 2008
Notification of acceptance: Friday, July 18, 2008
Final revision due:         Monday, July 28, 2008
Workshop:                   Sunday, September 21, 2008

GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP:

ML is a family of programming languages that includes dialects known
as Standard ML, Objective Caml, and F#.  The development of these
languages has inspired a large amount of computer science research,
both practical and theoretical.  This workshop aims to build on
previous occasions (recent instances are ML 2005 in Tallinn, Estonia,
2006 in Portland, Oregon, and 2007 in Freiburg, Germany), providing a
forum to encourage discussion and research on ML and related
technology.

The 2008 Workshop on ML will be held in conjunction with the 13th ACM
SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2008)
in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on Sunday, September 21, 2008.

This year we extend the scope of the workshop from ML itself to
technologies closely related to ML (higher-order, typed, or strict
languages) and invite high-quality papers in all areas of crucial
importance for the future of ML.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

We seek papers on topics related to ML, including (but not limited
to):

 * applications

 * extensions: objects, classes, concurrency, distribution and
   mobility, semi-structured data handling, etc.

 * type systems (static and dynamic): inference, effects, overloading,
   error reporting, contracts, specifications and assertions, etc.

 * implementation: compilers, interpreters, partial evaluators,
   garbage collectors, etc.

 * environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language
   interoperability, functional data structures, etc.

 * semantics

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results,
ML-related projects, or informed positions regarding proposals for
next-generation ML languages.  In order to encourage lively
discussion, submitted papers may describe work in progress.  All
papers will be judged on a combination of correctness, significance,
novelty, clarity, and interest to the community.

All paper submissions must be at most 12 pages total length in the
standard ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference format (9pt):

        http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital Library.

More details about the submission procedure will be announced later on
the web page:
