			       UITP'08

		  The 8th International Workshop on
		 User Interfaces for Theorem Provers

	 [http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~omega/workshops/UITP08/]

		    (TPHOLS'08 Satellite Workshop)

	  Friday, 22nd August 2008, Montréal, Québec, Canada


The  User  Interfaces  for  Theorem   Provers workshop  series  brings
together   researchers  interested    in designing,    developing  and
evaluating  interfaces for interactive proof  systems, such as theorem
provers, formal   method  tools, and   other tools   manipulating  and
presenting mathematical formulas.

While the reasoning  capabilities  of interactive proof  systems  have
increased dramatically over the last years, the system interfaces have
often  not  enjoyed   the    same  attention as  the  proof    engines
themselves. In   many cases,  interfaces remain relatively   basic and
under-designed.

The User  Interfaces for  Theorem  Provers workshop series  provides a
forum for researchers  interested in improving human  interaction with
proof systems.  We  welcome participation  and  contributions from the
theorem  proving, formal methods and tools,  and HCI communities, both
to report on  experience with  existing systems,  and to  discuss  new
directions.  Topics covered include, but are not limited to:

  * Application-specific interaction mechanisms or  designs for prover
    interfaces
  * Experiments and evaluation of prover interfaces
  * Languages and tools for authoring, exchanging and presenting proof
  * Implementation techniques (e.g.  web services,  custom middleware,
    DSLs)
  * Integration of interfaces and tools to explore and construct proof
  * Representation  and  manipulation   of  mathematical  knowledge or
    objects
  * Visualisation of mathematical objects and proof
  * System descriptions

UITP 2008 is a one-day workshop to be held on Friday, August 22nd 2008
in     Montreal,    Canada,      as     a      TPHOLS'08      workshop
[http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~tphols08/TPHOLs2008/]


FORMAT OF THE WORKSHOP

The proposed  format of  the workshop  is one  day of presentations of
accepted regular papers  and system demonstrations  of accepted system
descriptions. In addition the program might include an invited talk.


SUBMISSION

Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:

  - Regular paper:    Submissions  in this category  should   describe
    previously unpublished  work (completed or in progress), including
    descriptions of research,  tools, and applications. Papers  should
    be formated following the ENTCS [http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html]
    guidelines and  up to 15   pages long (please find  the additional
    UITP'08-specific macro file at 
    [http://www.entcs.org/files/uitp08/prentcsmacro.sty].

  - System description:   Submissions in this category are intended to
    describe existing systems. Papers should be formated following the
    ENTCS [http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html]  guidelines and  up to  5
    pages long (please find here the additional UITP'08-specific ENTCS
    macro file [http://www.entcs.org/files/uitp08/prentcsmacro.sty]).

Submission  of    papers  is  via  the  EasyChair    conference system
[http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=uitp08].   All submissions
will be peer reviewed and final  versions of accepted submissions will
be  published  in    an  ENTCS  [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/entcs]
volume. In addition,  printed workshop proceedings will be distributed
at the  workshop.  Final  versions   of accepted  papers  have to   be
prepared with LaTeX.
