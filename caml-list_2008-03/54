I have an idea.  Remove symlinks pointing to the _build directory *only*
if the basename of the symlink is the same as the basename of the target.

Hence, if I have toto.native in project/_build and toto.native in project
pointing to project/_build/toto.native, it would get deleted when ocamlbuild
is invoked without toto.native as a target.

However I can create a link project/toto.opt that links to project/_build/toto.native
and it wouldn't get deleted by myocamlbuild.

This would also be a way to respond to people who find the ".native" extension
too long - tell them that they would be better of creating their own symlinks anyway.
