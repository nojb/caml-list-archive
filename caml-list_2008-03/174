Most of the GPL stuff are copyright FSF, which is indeed not legal in
France. Following what you say, almost the full GNU tools suite is not
legal in France (hopefully, lawyer have other things to do...)

But, you can still provide a patch! If there is something that is
acceptable regarding INRIA licence, it is patch... Maybe it will only be
included as a patch, in a contrib directory...

But anyway, lets stop right now this discussion, i won't enter in the
usual "licence" flameware about OCaml. The first step to have a problem
is to have a patch that cause a problem. When there will be a patch, or
even better, a lot of patches, maybe INRIA will reconsider its position.
For sure, if there is a lot of discussion about "what if there is a
patch and then..." and no patch, i really don't see any reason to change
anything.
