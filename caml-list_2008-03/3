Hello,

I discovered the some OCaml bytecodes were silently corrupted in Ubuntu
Hardy (and Gutsy)[1]. The source of corruption, the package
pkg-create-dbgsym, is now fixed in current Hardy. The package ocamlnet
which was corrupted has been properly rebuilt and now works.

However, other packages might also be corrupted.

Right now, I have identified the following packages:
 * cameleon

 * dag2html

 * ocsigen

 * omake (not sure)

 * polygen-data (not sure)

A rebuilt has been asked here:
 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pkg-create-dbgsym/+bug/197293

But I might have skipt some of the corrupted packages (I don't know the
expected behavior of all packages). So, if you have access to Ubuntu
Hardy, could you test your favorite OCaml package and report any issue
to me or at the above Ubuntu bug.

Yours,
d.
