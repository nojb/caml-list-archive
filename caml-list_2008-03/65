I agree wholeheartedly with the inclusion of those syntax extensions
as standard.  I know they would help clean up a lot of my own code.
However, I think that the libraries and syntax extensions to include
by default should be in a separate thread to help maintain focus.
Particularly given that there is some (initial) agreement on this
particular OSR proposal.
