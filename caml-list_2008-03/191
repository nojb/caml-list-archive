Right. The '-' annotation says the parameter is contravariant which means that
with a coercion you can "loose" some of the variants. Without the
annotation the coercion would fail.

Yes because it doesn't even get to the coercion, it fails while trying
to build the list:
text and b1 have incompatible types.

In the end, the easiest way to write this is probably to avoid the
list altogether:

  form_add_component form text ;
  form_add_component form b1 ;
  form_add_component form b2 ;
