	Hi all !

Along with our project (liquidsoap), we (the savonet team) have developped an 
advanced scheduler that we needed for our software. It is now available as a 
seperate module, and we hope it could be usefull for some of you.

The basics of this scheduler is to implement a wrapper around Unix.select in 
order to be able to wait for events on a socket and/or a given delay and 
execute a task when one of the waited events occured.

We also wrote an asynchronous interface as well as a simple I/O interface, in 
order to read and write to sockets, or submit an asychronous task to a 
scheduler.

Several queues can be run against the same scheduler, each one living in a 
different thread. Also, each task has a priority, which can of your favorite 
type, and each queue decides if it wants to process a task according to a 
predicate passed at its initialisation.

This scheduler can be very usefull to write simple servers, as well as to 
develop a multi-thread task processing system. Two simple telnet and http 
examples are provided in the source.

You can find more informations on the module there:
  http://www.rastageeks.org/duppy.html
In particular, the documentation is available there:
  http://www.rastageeks.org/ocaml-duppy/Duppy.html
You can also download the module there:
