                          Call for Papers

  19th International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR 08)

              Toronto, Canada, August 19-22, 2008

             >> http://www.cse.yorku.ca/concur08 <<
              Submission deadline: April 11, 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------------

CONCUR 08, the 19th International Conference on Concurrency Theory, 
will take place in Toronto, Canada, on August 19-22, 2008.  The 
purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together researchers, 
developers, and students in order to advance the theory of 
concurrency, and promote its applications (in a broad sense).

CONCUR 08 will be collocated with the 27th Annual ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS 
Symposium on the Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2008). 
The program of CONCUR and PODC includes invited talks by
  Tevfik Bultan, University of California, Santa Barbara, USA
  Peter Druschel, Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Saarbruecken, Germany
  Joseph Halpern, Cornell University, Ithaca, USA
  Prakash Panangaden, McGill University, Montreal, Canada
  Shaz Qadeer, Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA
  Don Towsley, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA

Furthermore, there will be a symposium celebrating the contributions 
of Nancy Lynch and the following nine workshops:
  Workshop on Approximate Behavioural Equivalences;
  Workshop on Concurrency in Enterprise Applications;
  Workshop on Distributed computing, Concurrency theory, and Verification;
  15th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency;
  International Workshop on Foundations of Mobile Computing
  Workshop on Formal Methods for Wireless Systems;
  10th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems;
  6th International Workshop on Security Issues in Concurrency;
  Young Researchers Workshop

The overall event will take place at the University of Toronto on 
August 18-23, 2008.

CONCUR 08 welcomes two categories of papers:
- regular papers;
- tool papers.

Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics, 
verification and analysis of concurrent systems.  The principal 
topics include (but are not limited to):
- basic models of concurrency (such as abstract machines, domain
  theoretic models, game theoretic models, process algebras, and 
  Petri nets);
- logics for concurrency (such as modal logics, temporal logics and
  resource logics);
- models of specialized systems (such as biology-inspired systems,
  circuits, hybrid systems, mobile systems, multi-core processors,
  probabilistic systems, real time systems, synchronous systems, and 
  web services);
- verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems (such 
  as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model-checking, 
  race detection, run-time verification, state-space exploration, 
  static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving and type
  systems);
- related programming models (such as distributed or object-oriented).

Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee for inclusion 
in the proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in 
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Papers must be in 
English and should be formatted according to the Springer-Verlag 
LNCS guidelines.  Simultaneous submission to journals or other 
conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.  Both regular 
and tool papers will be presented at the conference, and so at least 
one author of each accepted paper is expected to be present at the 
conference.  The link for submissions is

     http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=CONCUR08

Regular papers
--------------
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract.  Regular papers 
must contain original contributions, be clearly written, and include 
appropriate reference to and comparison with related work.  Authors 
are encouraged to submit a paper title and a short abstract before 
submitting the extended abstract.  The short abstract should not 
exceed 200 words, and it should be entered in ASCII at the link given 
below. The extended abstract should not exceed 15 pages.  If necessary, 
the extended abstract may be supplemented with a clearly marked 
appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of the program 
committee.  

Tool papers
-----------
Tool papers should present novel tools based on aforementioned 
technologies (such as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, 
model-checking, race detection, run-time verification, state-space 
exploration, static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving 
and type systems) or fall into the above application areas (such as 
biology-inspired systems, circuits, hybrid systems, mobile systems, 
multi-core processors,probabilistic systems, real time systems, 
synchronous systems, and web services) and have an explicit emphasis 
on handling of concurrency.  If previous versions of the tool have 
already been presented at meetings or published in some form, the 
enhancements and novel features of the tool should be clearly described.  
A tool paper should not exceed 4 pages and should have an appendix 
that provides a detailed description of:
- how the oral presentation will be conducted (for example illustrated
  by a number of snapshots) and
- the availability of the tool, the number and types of users, and 
  other information which may illustrate the maturity and robustness 
  of the tool (if applicable, a link to a web-page for the tool).
The appendix will not be included in the proceedings, but during the 
evaluation of the tool papers it will be equally important as the 
pages submitted for publication in the proceedings.

---------------
Abstract Submission: April 4, 2008
Paper Submission: April 11, 2008 (strict)
