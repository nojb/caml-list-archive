GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SFM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Formal methods are emerging in computer science as a prominent
approach to the rigorous design of computer, communication and
software systems.

The aim of the SFM series is to offer a good spectrum of
current research in foundations as well as applications of
formal methods, which can be of interest for graduate students
and young researchers who intend to approach the field.

This year SFM is devoted to computational systems biology and
covers computational models, calculi and logics for biological
systems, and verification and simulation methods.


COURSES AND LECTURERS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The school features the following ten regular lectures:

* "Quantitative Methods in Systems Biology"
     by Stephen Gilmore
     (University of Edinburgh, UK)

* "Pathway Logic"
     by Carolyn Talcott
     (SRI, USA)

* "Automated Verification of Biological Systems"
     by Francois Fages
     (INRIA Paris Rocquencourt, France)

* "Hierarchical Specification of Biological Systems"
     by Adelinde Uhrmacher
     (University of Rostock, Germany)

* "Simulation Methods in Systems Biology"
     by Daniel Gillespie
     (Gillespie Consulting, USA)

* "Membrane Computing"
     by Gheorghe Paun
     (Romanian Academy, Romania)

* "Petri Nets for Systems and Synthetic Biology"
     by Monika Heiner
     (Brandenburg University of Technology, Germany)

* "Calculi for Biological Systems"
     by Jane Hillston
     (University of Edinburgh, UK)

* "Using Beta-Binders for Systems Biology"
     by Corrado Priami
     (University of Trento and CoSBi, Italy)

* "Self-Assembly of DNA Structures"
     by Natasha Jonoska
     (University of South Florida, USA)

and the following six talks from the BISCA project:

* "ViCe: A Virtual Prokaryote"
     by Pierpaolo Degano
     (University of Pisa, Italy)

* "The Calculus of Looping Sequences"
     by Roberto Barbuti
     (University of Pisa, Italy)

* "Bisimulations for Biological Calculi"
     by Paola Quaglia
     (University of Trento, Italy)

* "Hybrid Systems and Biology"
     by Alberto Policriti
     (University of Udine, Italy)

* "A pi-Based Process Calculus for the Implementation
   of Compartimentized Bio-Inspired Calculi"
     by Cristian Versari
     (University of Bologna, Italy)

* "Expressiveness Issues in Calculi for Artificial Biochemistry"
     by Gianluigi Zavattaro
     (University of Bologna, Italy)

All the participants will receive a copy of a tutorial book published by
Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


LOCATION
^^^^^^^^

SFM-08:Bio will be held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro.

This town is in Emilia Romagna, about 70 km south-east of Bologna,
at an elevation of about 230 m. It can be reached in a couple of
hours from the international airport "G. Marconi" of Bologna by
shuttle (from the airport to the railway station) + train (from
Bologna to Forli`) + bus (from the railway station to Bertinoro).
The closest airport is the "L. Ridolfi" airport of Forli`, which
is 13 km away.

Bertinoro is close to many splendid locations such as Urbino,
Gradara, San Leo, and the Republic of San Marino, as well as some
less well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme.

Bertinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known
Italian locations such as Bologna, Ravenna, Ferrara, Venezia,
Padova, Verona, Firenze, Pisa, and Siena.

Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with its narrow streets and
walkways winding around the central peak. The school will be held
at the Centro Residenziale Universitario (CRU), an ex-episcopal
fortress that has been converted by the University of Bologna into
a modern conference center with computing facilities and Internet
access. From the fortress it is possible to enjoy a beautiful vista
stretching from the Apennines to the Adriatic coast and the Alps
over the Po Valley.


ORGANIZATION
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scientific directors:
* Marco Bernardo (University of Urbino - Italy)
* Pierpaolo Degano (University of Pisa - Italy)
* Gianluigi Zavattaro (University of Bologna - Italy)

Secretary:
* Monica Michelacci (CRU Bertinoro - Italy)

Webmaster:

APPLICATION
^^^^^^^^^^^

Prospective participants should send by 17 March 2008
the application form, available on the school web site,
to the two e-mail addresses below:

  Marco Bernardo
  bernardo AT sti.uniurb.it

  Monica Michelacci
  mmichelacci AT ceub.it

by specifying in the form whether a grant is requested to cover
part of the registration fee (no grant can be requested to cover
the accommodation fee or the travel expenses).

The registration fee is 550 euros and includes the school material.

The accommodation fee is 350 euros and covers the period June 1-8
(7 nights) in double room (to share with another participant),
half board (breakfast and lunch, dinner of June 1 included,
lunch of June 8 excluded).

The reduced accommodation fee for the participants who do not
need a room is 100 euros and covers the period June 2-7
(6 lunches).
