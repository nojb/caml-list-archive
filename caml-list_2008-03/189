Why do I want a tool to do the _very mechanical parts_ of the job ?
  A simple example :
because I would be happy to get the comment brackets automatically translated ( and the C++ like C extension // too.)
  There are several such very automatic things like if( ) -> if then.

> You could call most of your C routines from Ocaml.
  Yes, but in the present case, I'm interesting in a full rewriting. This is precisely because I imagine to be able to rewrite the C ( game ) program a very different and terse way, that I undertake this task.

Absolutely : that's the reason why I play to rewrite the C program an OCaml way.

  Without daring to brag about 'mastering' the language,
I however declare to perfectly know this.

  Obviously.

  When I play chess, I always think the other player will give the best things and never suppose he has absurd ideas in mind...

  However, I remember you are the man who oriented me to OCaml and I'm very grateful of this, because OCaml programming is a real pleasure
