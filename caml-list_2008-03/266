For what it's worth, not at Jane Street.  We've looked at using existential
types once or twice, but have yet to find a really compelling application.
We don't really use objects much either.

I'm actually a bit puzzled by your original post, in that I don't have a
clear sense of what kind of situations you've run up against where using
poor-man's objects (e.g., collections of closures wrapped up in a bundle)
doesn't do the job.  On the whole, I've found that collections of closures
are easier to think about than objects precisely because you don't have to
worry about subtyping.  I'd be quite curious to hear about concrete examples
where that approach doesn't fit well.
