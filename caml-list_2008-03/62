And ocamlfind also supports camlp4(o|r) and any other syntax extension
through the camlp4:

Extract from the manpage of ocamlfind:

-syntax pred-name-list

 These predicates are assumed to be true in addition  to the standard
 preprocessor predicates. See below for a list.

and

syntax

 This predicate is set if there is a -syntax option. It is set both for
 the preprocessor and the compiler/linker stage,  and it can be used to
 find out whether the preprocessor is enabled or not.

I.e. ocamlcs = ocamlfind ocaml -syntax openin! Just have to define
package name. The OSR can list the minimum syntax extension to be found
on a system...
