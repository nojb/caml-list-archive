Subject: Looking for full-fledged C++ Parser with OCAML interface

Hello everyone. I'm a graduate student majoring in program analysis.

I'm looking for a full-fledged C++ parser with OCAML interface. Our team
researched some C++ parsers and found that
Olmar(http://www.cs.ru.nl/~tews/olmar/) was the best candidate among
them. I have two questions about it.

  1. Is there a better candidate than Olmar? Please recommend one if
anyone knows about it.

  2. If anyone have used Olmar before, I'd like to listen to your
experience with it. I'm curious of its tolerance with various C++
dialects, robustness, and efficiency on the code used in real world.

Thanks in advance for your help.


Best Regards

Soonho Kong
