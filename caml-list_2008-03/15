X-Spam: no; 0.00; gnuplot:01 gnuplot:01 bindings:01 printf:01 fprintf:01 ouput:01 camlimages:01 mli:01 ocaml:01 mli:01 sourceforge:01 caml-list:01 bin:01 modules:02 argument:02 

There are working binding to gnuplot in fact :
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocaml-gnuplot/

And there is also plplot and another one which name I can't remember.

As a side note, I recently used gnuplot but not with these bindings :
a very easy way to create plots with gnuplot is to write the plot
coordinates to a file (in human-readable format) and then run gnuplot
with the file as argument. That's as easy as :
  let log_c=open_out_bin "./results/pour_gnuplot.txt" in
  Printf.fprintf log_c "%d %f\n" !i !mistake
  (* this is an excerpt from an actual code *)
Then it is possible to have gnuplot create a image with three commands
I unfortunately can't remember properly (you just had to set the ouput
file, format and last issue "replot").

Last you can also use CamlImages.


As for the lack of documentation for modules, I had myself troubles
until I got the .mli thing. Now, after only a few months of ocaml, mli
files are usually all I need. This way, I had alsa, ao, mad or
xml-light working (just to name a few). However it took me some time,
probably because I simply wasn't aware of how much information they
carried and did not read them. Maybe Alexander Mikhalev was in the
same situation.
