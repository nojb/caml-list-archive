Hi,

As far as I understood it (I wasn't in Paris; I only listened to the audio
recordings), the research has been done (there are actually several different
projects that focused on this subject), and there are no major technical
impediments to the inclusion of type-safe marshalling into the core language.
However, given the present man-power constraints of the Ocaml team at INRIA,
I may have used the expression "near future" in a non-conventional way...
In any case, only the Ocaml team can elucidate us on that matter.

(Anyway, Xavier's talk was very interesting, as were all the others;
I recommend anyone interested in the future of the Ocaml language to
watch the video or to listen to the recordings)

Cheers,
Dario
