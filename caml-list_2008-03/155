Hi Arnaud,

To make this code cleaner, you can query Findlib directly instead of
parsing "ocamlfind query" via the shell (I posted on this list a few
days ago a small code sample that does precisely this).  I am not sure,
however, how easy it is to use external libs ocamlbuild plugins.

So in a sense if you have to replicate a lot of the work that ocamlfind
already does.  Not ideal, but at the moment I also don't see another
solution.

Cheers,
Dario
