I would like to announce an update to my PLplot [1] library bindings
for OCaml.

The code can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-plplot/

The main changes for this release are:
- Works now with camlidl from Debian and other non-GODI installs.  The
  previous release had problems on non-GODI OCaml installations.
- More or less complete coverage of PLplot 5.8.0 functions.  If anything is
  missing or needed, please let me know.
- The version number has changed to match the corresponding PLplot version

Requirements:
- OCaml (tested with 3.10.0, should work on older versions?)
- PLplot version 5.7.x or 5.8.x - tested with 5.7.3 through 5.8.0
- camlidl
- findlib

The license is the same as PLplot (LGPLv2+).

This code has been developed and tested on Debian Sid and CentOS 5,
using both GODI and Debian OCaml packages.  I would be happy to hear
about any successes or failures on other systems.

There are currently two examples included [2], which corresponds to
examples 11 and 19 on the PLplot website [1].  The PLplot documentation [3]
is a good reference as this binding is very close to the C library.
There is some
documentation available on the ocaml-plplot Google Code wiki as well.  Please
feel free to ask if you have any questions, problems or requests.

Enjoy!
