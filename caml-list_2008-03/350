              12 PhD Fellowships in the Doctorate Programme:
                      ``Program and Model Analysis''

                          http://puma.in.tum.de

The German Research Council (DFG) funds 12 doctoral fellowships through
the new Doctorate Programme (Graduiertenkolleg) ``Program and Model
Analysis''. The programme starts in July 2008. Applications are invited now.


Hosting institutions.

The programme is hosted by the Technische Universität and
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, two of the three universities
selected in the first round of the highly competitive Excellence
Initiative. Their Computer Science departments are among the most
reputed in Germany. The Professors involved in the programme are:
Manfred Broy, Javier Esparza, Martin Hofmann, Alexander Knapp, Alois
Knoll, Tobias Nipkow, Helmut Seidl, Christian Urban, Helmut Veith and
Martin Wirsing.


Objective.

The programme will enable PhD students to conduct leading-edge research
on methods, algorithms and tools for the analysis of programs and models
of information systems.  The research topics seek to establish and
exploit links between the four leading approaches for this task (theorem
proving, model checking, abstract interpretation and type systems) and
to apply them to software-intensive systems. PhD students will receive
individual in-depth supervision and will participate in a structured
programme of courses and seminars offered by world experts.

Positions.

The doctorate programme offers 12 doctoral fellowships for a period of
three years.  Renumeration is according to Level 13 of the TV-L German
salary scale. This amounts to an initial gross salary of 2900 Euro per
month, increased to 3225 Euro per month after one year. Doctoral degrees
are awarded by the Technische Universität or the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. The earliest possible starting date is
July 2008.


Eligibility.

Applicants should be at most 28 years old and hold a MSc (or an
equivalent degree) in computer science or related disciplines (typically
mathematics, physics, or engineering). Applications from MSc candidates
who expect to get their degrees within the next months are also welcome.
Fluency in spoken and written English or German is required.


Applications.

Applications will be considered until all positions are filled. They
should contain a full curriculum vitae, a statement on the candidate's
scientific interests, names and contact information of 2 references, and
should be sent to

    Prof. Dr. Helmut Seidl
    Technische Universität München
    Institut für Informatik, Boltzmannstraße 3
    85748 Garching
    Email: puma@in.tum.de

Shortlisted applicants will usually be invited to visit München and give
a talk on their Master's Thesis or on a scientific topic to be agreed
upon. The decision on admission will be communicated shortly after the talk.
