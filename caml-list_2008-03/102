Hi all,

I've been following all of the OSR discussion with great interest.  I've 
currently got three questions about it though:

1.  How is delivery of our "community ocaml" going to work?

2.  Sadly I couldn't make the Paris meet, are there going to be followup 
meetings?

3.  How do we decide on a consensus for an OSR proposal?

Personally, I think the answers to these questions are linked.  A system 
that I would like to see is something like: a community release every 
six months, meetings a couple of months before release, final decisions 
made about which suggestions make the release decided in the meeting.  I 
think it would be better to decide in a face-to-face setting which 
proposals are best, as a mailing list just leads to endless forking of 
conversation and drift from original topics.

Regards,
Peter.
