Indeed, i would have prefer to have ocamlbuild outside ocaml compiler
package. The reason for ocamlbuild in OCaml is to solve the complex
scheme to build camlp4 (as far as i can remember). This is unfortunate,
but we can't blame INRIA to build a tool and test it against its more
complex compilation scheme.

I don't think INRIA team are against accepting your patches, if it fits
correctly in OCaml. Most of the time, the first step is to provide a
patch... If you have the time to correct this problem on your own, i
think INRIA team will happily integrate your patch.
