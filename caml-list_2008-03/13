Well, I have to admit that I made some errors while crafting the =20
binary package.
I just fixed them and uploaded a new version (check out =
http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/downloads.html)=20
.
You should now be able to use the various tools. Here is a short test =20=

session assuming you
have a "source.ml" file (typical content: <<let () =3D List.iter =20
print_endline ["hello ..."; "... world"]>>):

Execution of toplevel:
	java -jar ocaml.jar

Compilation to OCaml bytecode:
	java -jar ocamlc.jar -o bc source.ml
Execution of produced btyecode:
	java -jar ocamlrun.jar bc

Compilation to Java jar file:
	java -jar ocamljava.jar -standalone -o prog.jar source.ml
Execution of produced jar file:
	java -jar prog.jar


However, I noticed a bug with the binary package that does not show up =20=

if you have
the standard OCaml distribution installed on your computer: the =20
ocamlc.jar/ocamljava.jar
compilers will fail if the current directory contains the by-product =20
of a previous compilation
(e.g. cmo or cmi files). The temporary workaround is to delete these =20
files before any
compilation.

I suspect this bug has something to do with the embedded mode (the =20
ability for the
Java-run programs to look for files inside their jar files rather than =20=

on the local file
system). I will hunt this bug and report to the list when it is fixed.
Sorry for the inconvenience in the meanwhile.
