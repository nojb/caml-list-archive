               CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS AND PARTICIPATION



                              Workshop on

        MULTIPARADIGM PROGRAMMING WITH OO LANGUAGES (MPOOL 2008)

                                 at the

    EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (ECOOP 2008)

                     7 or 8 July 2008, Paphos, Cyprus

                                 

While OO has become ubiquitously employed for design, implementation, and even 

conceptualization, many practitioners recognize the concomitant need for other 

programming paradigms according to problem domain.  We seek answers to the 

question of how to address the need for other programming paradigms--or even 

domain specific languages--in the general context of OO languages.



Can OO programming languages effectively support other programming paradigms or 

the embedding of other languages?  The answer seems to be affirmative, at least

for some paradigms.  For example, significant progress has been made for the

case of functional programming in C++. Additionally, several efforts have been

made to integrate support for other paradigms as a front-end for OO languages 

(the Pizza language, extending Java, is a prominent example). Libraries and

extensions for concurrency are also being developed for new and upcoming

multi-core and heterogeneous architectures.



This workshop seeks to bring together practitioners and researchers in this 

developing field to `compare notes' on their work--describe existing, 

developing, or proposed techniques, idioms, methodologies, language extensions, 

or software for expressing non-OO paradigms in OO languages; or theoretical 

work supporting or defining the same. High-level presentations of position are 

welcome, and reports of work in progress, are welcome.



Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to:



  - non-OO programming with OO languages;

  - merging functional/logic/OO/other programs (language crossbinding);

  - non-OO programming at the meta level (e.g. template metaprogramming);

  - techniques for language embeddings (e.g. multistage programming); 

  - module systems vs. object systems;

  - OO design patterns and their relation to functional patterns;

  - multiparadigm and multilingual programming in the .NET framework;

  - type system relationships across languages;

  - theoretical foundations of multiparadigm programming with OO languages;

  - multiparadigm approaches to support emerging hardware architectures (e.g.

    multi/many-core CPUs, GPGPUs, IBM Cell, etc).



The workshop will consist of short presentations with interspersed discussion 

sessions, and longer general discussions of themes or topics derived from some 

common element of subsets of presentations. We expect the majority of the 

participants to give presentations.



Prospective participants may submit either presentation abstracts or full 

papers. All accepted materials will be distributed at the workshop and also

made available at the MPOOL 2008 Web site.  A synopsis of the workshop will

be published as a chapter of the Springer LNCS ECOOP 2008 Workshop Reader.



For authors of accepted presentations who require justification for travel 

the organizers can provide official letters of invitation. 



SUBMISSION PROCEDURE



Prospective authors are invited to submit abstracts or full papers in PDF, 

postscript, or Microsoft Word. Authors of accepted papers are responsible for 

submitting the final version using the Springer LNCS LaTeX template to ensure 

inclusion in the proceedings. Submission and email correspondence to 

mpool08@multiparadigm.net
