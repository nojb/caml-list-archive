Second Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
6 July 2008,  Reykjavik - Iceland
A satellite workshop of ICALP 2008

PRESENTATION
The workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming is
devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable
power and abstraction. Monadic programming in Haskell is the
paradigmatic example, but there are many more mathematical insights
manifest in programs and in programming language design:
Freyd-categories in reactive programming, symbolic differentiation
yielding context structures, and comonadic presentations of dataflow, to
name but three. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to
reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006.
An associated special issue of the Journal of Functional Programming is
in preparation.

INVITED SPEAKERS
Andrej Bauer, University of Ljubljana
Dan Piponi, Industrial Light and Magic

SUBMISSIONS
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science have provisionally
agreed to publish the proceedings of MSFP 2008. ENTCS require
submissions in LaTeX, formatted according to their guidelines
(http://www.entcs.org/prelim.html).

Papers must report previously unpublished work and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Programme
Committee members, barring the co-chairs, may (and indeed are encouraged
to) contribute. Accepted papers must be presented at the workshop by one
of the authors.

There is no specific page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.

We are using the EasyChair software to manage submissions.
To submit a paper, please log in at:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=msfp2008.

TIMELINE:
Submission of abstracts: 4 April
Submission of papers: 11 April
Notification: 16 May
Final versions due: 13 June
Workshop: 6 July
