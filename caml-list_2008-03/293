No, but it's ok. There are products, sums, sequences, and options. What
you cannot do is to marshal cyclic data - this is a limitation XDR
shares with most other external representations. There's also no notion
of objects.

This may be an issue. Currently, ocamlrpcgen understands only a few
annotations that modify the O'Caml type the XDR type is mapped to. 

In the past months, I wrote Hydro, which is a library for another RPC
protocol called ICE. Hydro bases on my SunRPC efforts, and improves on a
number of its limitations. In Hydro, it is possible to annotate an ICE
type with an O'Caml function that converts it into a more pleasuring
representation. This allows to fix most shortcomings of the built-in
mapping to O'Caml types. Something similar could be done for XDR.

I wouldn't recommend Hydro for storing values, because its model is
OO-centric, and there is some impedance mismatch between the OO approach
and O'Caml's type system. Except you have cyclic values, because ICE can
represent that. (If you got curious: http://oss.wink.com)

I don't have numbers. The O'Caml implementation is definitely slower
than the C code generated by rpcgen. However, the company I'm currently
working for uses this implementation for a high-performance cluster of
servers, and we never even thought about the XDR speed. It never
mattered.
