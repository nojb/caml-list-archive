Thanks for ellucidation.  Alternatively, since the preprocessor is
oblivious to the name of the package (as you say, even Camlp5 may
only care about the name of the .cmo file), we can simply declare
this to be a documentation problem and to not enforce any convention
regarding the package name (except for the previously discussed .syntax
suffix).

Therefore, the package implementing the "openin" extension could be
called "pa_openin", "openin", or whatever the author prefers due to
historical reasons.  The only requirement is that the syntax extension
itself should reside in an "openin.syntax" subpackage.

I think that is also a documentation issue.  Ideally, the META files
should be constructed in such a way that the user should not have to
care about extension dependencies.  As an example, consider the Sexplib
syntax extension, which itself depends on the type-conv extension.
On my system, I have patched the META files so that this is transparent
to the Sexplib users.

Here's my META file for Sexplib:

--------------------------------------------------------
name="sexplib"
version="3.0.0"
description="Sexplib - automated S-expression conversions"
requires="bigarray"
archive(byte)="sexplib.cma"
archive(native)="sexplib.cmxa"

package "syntax" (
  requires = "sexplib,type-conv.syntax,camlp4"
  version = "3.0.0"
  description = "Syntax extension for Sexplib"
  archive(syntax,preprocessor) = "pa_sexp_conv.cmo"
  archive(syntax,toploop) = "pa_sexp_conv.cmo"
  )
--------------------------------------------------------

And the META file for Type-conv:

--------------------------------------------------------
name="type-conv"
version="1.0.0"
description="Type-conv - support library for preprocessor type conversions"

package "syntax" (
  requires = "camlp4"
  version = "1.0.0"
  description = "Syntax extension for type-conv"
  archive(syntax,preprocessor) = "pa_type_conv.cmo"
  archive(syntax,toploop) = "pa_type_conv.cmo"
  )
--------------------------------------------------------

I don't know if there's support for those cases (are there any in the wild?).
Perhaps some of Findlib's gurus can enlighten us...

Cheers,
Dario
