LLVM's OCaml bindings are aimed at authoring front-ends (i.e., IR =20
generation), and are reasonably complete from that perspective.

The LLVM project includes two C front-ends (separate projects).

llvm-gcc is a gcc branch maintained by the LLVM project. It is stable =20=

and complete, having successfully been used to compile very a large =20
volume of C, C++ and Objective-C code. Unfortunately, GCC does not =20
have a library-based design, so attaching to its parser would be very =20=

difficult.
clang is an entirely new compiler under development in the LLVM =20
project. It only yet compiles C. Objective C is also parsed. clang has =20=

a library-based design that should make it very attractive for tools =20
building. It is being designed to support such clients as refactoring =20=

and IDEs. It supports serializing the AST to disk, source rewriting, =20
and incremental reparsing. Full C++ support has been estimated at 2 =20
years out.

So, looking for a C++ parser now for a research project, you probably =20=

won't find anything of value from the LLVM project. In the longer =20
term, clang may be significantly interesting, not only because it has =20=

a library-based design, but also because it will be used in a first-=20
class capacity (compiler, IDE) by a large vendor (Apple).
