I have not used OCaml, just done some reading about it and toyed with the 
toplevel to see if it might be a useful tool here.  I have "Practical 
OCaml," which unfortunately is a rather wretched reference.

In any case, is it possible to define and use different types of records, 
which nevertheless share some field names?  I have had difficulty doing 
this in the toplevel.
