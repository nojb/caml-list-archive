The Oregon PL Summer School will run July 22-30, 2008 with the topic 
"Logic and Theorem Proving in Programming Languages".  This is a very 
exciting topic, and we've put together a great collection of speakers.  
The school has a long tradition and is sponsored by the NSF, ACM 
SIGPLAN, and Microsoft Research. The full "Call for Participation" may 
be found below.

Thanks,
 Matthew Fluet & Yannis Smaragdakis (OPLSS'08 Organizers)

                       Call for Participation:
 Summer School on Logic and Theorem Proving in Programming Languages
                           July 22-30, 2008
                University of Oregon (Eugene, Oregon)
      http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer08/
                     summerschool@cs.uoregon.edu

This Summer School will cover current research focused on integrating
expressive logical systems and powerful theorem-proving assistants
into the design, definition, and implementation of programming
languages. Speakers will present material covering foundational
theory, advanced techniques, and applications.

Material will be presented at a tutorial level that will help graduate
students and researchers from academia or industry understand the
critical issues and open problems confronting the field. The course is
open to anyone interested. Prerequisites are an elementary knowledge
of logic and mathematics that is usually covered in undergraduate
classes on discrete mathematics. Some knowledge of programming
languages at the level provided by an undergraduate survey course will
also be expected. Our primary target group is PhD students. We also
expect attendance by faculty members who would like to conduct
research on this topic or introduce new courses at their universities.

The program consists of more than twenty-five, 80 minute lectures
presented by internationally recognized leaders in programming
languages and formal reasoning research. Topics include:

  SMT Solvers - Theory, Implementation and Applications
     Leonardo de Moura, Microsoft Research
  Mechanization of Metatheory using LF and Twelf
     Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University
  Compiler Construction in Formal Logical Frameworks
     Jason Hickey, California Institute of Technology
  Specification and Verification of Programs with Pointers
     Rustan Leino, Microsoft Research
  Leveraging Domain-Specific Languages for Reasoning
     Sorin Lerner, University of California - San Diego
  Reasoning About Programs with ACL2
     Pete Manolios, Northeastern University
  Putting the Curry-Howard Isomorphism to Work
     Tim Sheard, Portland State University
  Nominal Techniques
     Christian Urban, TU Munich
  Coq for Programming Language Metatheory
     Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania

Venue
~~~~~
The summer school will be held at the University of Oregon, located in
the southern Willamette Valley city of Eugene, close to some of the
world's most spectacular beaches, mountains, lakes and forests. On
Sunday, July 27, students will have the option of participating in a
group activity in Oregon's countryside.

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cost for registration is $175.00 (USD) for graduate students, and
$275.00 (USD) for other participants. Registration must be paid upon
acceptance to the summer school, and is non-refundable. There are a
limited number of grants available to fund part of the cost of student
participation. If you are a graduate student and want to apply for
grant money to cover your expenses, please also include a statement of
your needs with your registration.
Additional information about the program, registration, venue, and
housing options is available on the web site. Or, you may request more
information by email.
To register for the Summer School, send a CV that includes a short
description of your educational background and one letter of
reference, unless you have already been granted a Ph.D. Please include
your name, address and current academic status.
Send all registration materials to summerschool@cs.uoregon.edu. All
registration materials should be delivered to the program by April
11, 2008. Materials received after the closing date will be evaluated
on a space available basis. Non U.S. citizens should begin immediately
to obtain travel documents.

Housing
~~~~~~~
The school will provide on-campus housing and meals. To share a room
with another student attending the school, the cost is $495 (USD) per
person. Housing rates are based on check-in Tuesday, July 22 and
check-out before noon on Thursday, July 31. Some single rooms may be
available for an additional fee of $150 (USD). If you'd like a single
room, please indicate your choice and we will try to accommodate you
on a first-come/first-served basis.
