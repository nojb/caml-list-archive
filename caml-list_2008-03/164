Thanks, it works Before_options (by replacing "false" by "true" too ^^) 
except when compiling myocamlbuild.ml (indeed: the plugin is not loaded 
yet), which is why I thought it didn't work at first.

I don't think there is a way to force classic-display = true for 
myocamlbuild.ml and then switch to classic-display = false in a plugin, 
but, well, a single weird line in emacs is fine I guess :)
