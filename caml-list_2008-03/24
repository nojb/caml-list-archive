 PhD Positions in Functional Programming
 at the department of Computer Science and Engineering
 at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden

 http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~koen/phdad.html

 Application deadline: March 11, 2008
 Position starts: April 1, 2008 or September 1, 2008

 The PhD student will join the research activities at our department in
 applications of functional programming, much of which concentrates
 on the design and application of Domain Specific Embedded Languages.
 Examples of our work are QuickCheck for specification-guided random
 testing, and Lava for hardware design and verification. Our group has
 also developed the award winning automated first-order logic reasoning
 tools Paradox and Equinox, which are both written in Haskell.

 There are advertised positions in two focus areas:

 1. Development of the next generation of Paradox and Equinox, which
 involves inventing new programming techniques for building a modular,
 flexible automated reasoning tool, as well as developing novel automated
 reasoning algorithms. As new exciting applications for automated
 reasoning tools arise, new demands are placed on the reasoning tools,
 forcing changes in how they are designed and implemented.

 2. Development of verification techniques for distributed systems
 implemented in the functional programming language Erlang. Methods
 here include QuickCheck-based testing, model checking and (automated)
 theorem proving techniques, and integration of these different techniques.
 There is a possibility of attacking real-world problems from our industrial
 partners.
