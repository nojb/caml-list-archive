You have probably been bitten by a bug related to the "embedded" mode.
The embedded mode allows a Java-compiled program to use a Java resource
(typically a file stored inside a jar file) when a file is requested =20
by the OCaml code.
This trick (disabled by default) allows to deploy standalone =20
compilers, which means
that ocamlc.jar / ocamljava.jar embed all the files they need. As a =20
result you do not
even need to have the regular OCaml distribution to be installed on =20
your computer.

Could you test your code with the newly updated version of the binary =20=

package ?
