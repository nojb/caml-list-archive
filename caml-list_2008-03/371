		CHINA 2008 Workshop 
Concurrency metHods: Issues aNd Applications

A satellite workshop of PETRI NETS 2008 co-located with ACSD 2008 

		June 24, 2008 
		Xi'an, China

http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/maciej.koutny/CHINA-2008.htm


Important Dates:
-  Deadline for submission			May   1, 2008
-  Deadline for pre-proceedings			June  1, 2008
-  Workshop                                	June 24, 2008


		INVITED SPEAKER:
		Alex Yakovlev (Newcastle, UK)

OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the workshop is to be a meeting place, in two
ways. It is intended to be a forum to exchange ideas and experiences with
different methods for the study of concurrent and distributed systems.
In addition, it will also be a meeting place for researchers from China
and neighbouring countries with the participants of the PETRI NETS and
ACSD conferences.
	
Therefore, in addition to the formal submissions, informal contributions are
still most welcome, in particular:
presentations of ongoing work like Ph.D. research or 
significantly based on already published work 
-possibly in a language other than English- 
for which the authors seek feedback.
(The latter under the condition that the prior work is adequately
referenced, and there are no publisher's restrictions.)
Also posters presenting initial ideas are solicited.

Extended abstracts of the accepted informal contributions will be included in 
the workshop proceedings and available at the meeting.

SCOPE
The scope of the workshop is broad. Its goal is to discuss models of
concurrency with an emphasis on issues relevant to certain application
domains which have led or could lead to the addition of structural
enhancements.
The focus of the workshop will be on qualitative rather than
quantitative aspects of concurrent systems. For the (enhanced) models
under discussion, also analysis techniques, extended or even completely
new, are to be considered. The meeting is deliberately not focussed on
any particular model of concurrency, issue or application. Fundamental
approaches as well as interdisciplinary applications may be discussed.

Aspects which are of interest to the workshop (in combination with
techniques for analysis, verification and synthesis) include:

(i) Concurrency models: Petri nets, process algebras, cooperating
automata, coordination languages, rewriting systems, discrete event
systems, message sequence charts, temporal logics

(ii) Issues: synchrony / asynchrony, mobility and security, locality and
components, supervisory control, dynamic reconfiguration, resource
access / testing, collaboration schemes, behavioural equivalence

(iii) Application areas: asynchronous circuits, GALS systems, biological
systems, membrane systems, mobile process networks, architecture,
component based software, workflow systems, communication protocols


SUBMISSION
Prospective participants are asked to submit by email 
(to the email addresses given below) 
an extended abstract of at most 15 pages as PDF or PS and 
using the Springer LNCS-format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)

Submissions should include a title and 
the authors' contact addresses and email.
 
At least one of the authors of each accepted contribution should
register and take part in the workshop to give the presentation.
