In this case the ':_' denotes a type annotation, using the "any-type" 
expression '_'.  You're declaring the return type of the method, as 
you'll see if you change the annotation to something incompatible with 
unit, such as

    class foo = object
      method bar ~(snoo : string):int = ()
    end

This works because the "unused variables" warning is disabled for 
variables which start with an underscore.  It's a useful feature for 
normal bindings but I don't think you should use it for labels, since it 
changes the interface.

I think the following is what you want:

    class foo = object
      method bar ~snoo:(_:string) = ()
    end
