I wrote a myocamlbuild.ml to use camlidl from within ocamlbuild if
anyone is interested.  I would also be happy to receive any pointers
on how to improve this.

The relevant files can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-plplot/source/browse/trunk/

The important pieces are:
  - myocamlbuild.ml which has a "rule" section for handling .idl files
  - libocaml_plplot.clib which defines the C portion of the library wrapper
  - Makefile which exports some environment variables and handles a
few other items

The Makefile could be folded in to myocamlbuild.ml with a few
Unix.open_process_in calls, but I don't see a need to do so at this
time.

Once this has been refined a bit I will add it or ask that it be added
to the ocamlbuild wiki.
