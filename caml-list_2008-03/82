Even though the whole thread seems to be syntax extension -oriented, I
had from this short sentence that you were interested in libraries as
well.

On the basis of this assumption I really would like to see the
"batteries included" distribution to come with ExtLib in it and, really
important, open-ed by default. That is, when I use List.map in my
programs I want that List.map to be the one from ExtLib rather than the
usual, non-tail recursive version.  Similarly, I want to be able to use
new functions defined in ExtList as they were in List without the need
to open anything.

Actually, I was going to mock up by myself a proof of concept
distribution of OCaml with extlib build during the build process and
some hacks to open it by default. But given that you've started this
thread I guess the efforts should be better merged.

Cheers.
