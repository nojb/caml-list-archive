It's not better.  It's not the same thing;  ocamlcs could indeed be implemented
with ocamlfind.

The idea is to collectively define a set of things like pa_openin, a Unicode library
or a Xml library, include them by default in a meta-distribution, and patch or wrap
over the base commands to ensure that those can be used with little to no command-line flags.

In other words, using unicode should be as simple as using a built-in library; in particular,
I don't want to have to add -I +unicode; it would be fine if I could just add unicode.cma;
better if I didn't have to.
