Well, he had read my book and chapter 2 details the use of the excellent 
ocamlbrowser tools for quickly and easily perusing OCaml APIs. All you need 
to do for Lacaml, for example, is add the "lacaml" directory to 
ocamlbrowser's search path and you can explore the Lacaml API within the 
comfort of a GUI application.
