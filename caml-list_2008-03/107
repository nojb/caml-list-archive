Hi,

And thanks for the reply.

Yes.

I've been mucking around with the myocamlbuild.ml plugin but still haven't
managed to achieve what I want.  And judging from a previous message by
Nicolas Pouillard, it may be altogether impossible with the current version
of Ocamlbuild.

Anyway, ideally one should be able to specify in the _tags file the findlib
packages that each ml file depends upon.  Suppose that by default you wanted
your ml files to use the "extlib,lwt,ocsigen,pgocaml" packages, but you also
had a "database.ml" file that used the PG'OCaml syntax extension, and therefore
should be preprocessed using the instructions in the "pgocaml.statements"
package.  I could define a _tags file as something like this:

true: pkg(extlib,lwt,ocsigen,pgocaml)
<database.ml>: camlp4, pkg(pgocaml.statements)

Any thoughts on how this could be achieved?  (I'm not even sure if
Ocamlbuild's tags can be parameterised).  This would go a long way
towards simplifying the use of syntax extensions that we've been
discussing in the OSR thread.

Thanks in advance,
Dario Teixeira
