Indeed.  Personally, I see little technical need for ocamlcs.  With built-in
support for Findlib in Ocamlbuild and properly constructed META files, using
any syntax extension (even if the extension depended on other extensions or
libraries) could be achieved with a simple entry in a _tags file.

You are quite right.  Moreover, considering that technically the advantage
of ocamlcs over plain Ocamlbuild+Findlib is not that great, I also think
that managing ocamlcs might be too much trouble for very little benefit.

This of course does not invalidate the original intention of this OSR:
we do need to simplify the use of syntax extensions.  However, Ocaml won't
need to include batteries if getting them is as simple as pushing a button.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
