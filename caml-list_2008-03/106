Maybe next year. It will depend on people who are interested that this
meeting happen again.

Sometimes ago, i propose to put the OSR on vote at a certain date. The
answer was something like: "better use the IEEE (or W3C, don't remember)
way to do: talk until a consensus happens".

This could be an idea. I am not sure that people can end up with a
solution however -- even with a meeting face to face. To my mind a
solution like "put everything there (including test + kind of build
system), if it builds and pass all the test, this is good for release". 
If something fails, just remove it. If a lot of things fails, don't
release.
