No  ocamlbuild don't use camlp4. However camlp4 use ocamlbuild. And ocamlbuild
functions like Unix.isatty and Sys.is_directory. That appears in 3.10.

Moreover I don't have enough time to release/package ocamlbuild more often.

Hopefully  ocamlbuild plugins are a way to extend it and try new ideas without
waiting for a release.
