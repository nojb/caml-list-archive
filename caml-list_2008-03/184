The problem I ran into with this is that the felix language supports
being built with visual studio, and the visual studio ocaml version.
This means that the end user doesn't need anything else to compile,
and our build system (is supposed to) be able to run in cmd.exe with
our custom python build system. In this setup we can't really justify
using ocamlbuild since our crusty build system is actually more
compatible. Now we could add a dependency on cygwin, but cygwin
implies so much more than just bash that it might not be worth
changing something that works (poorly) right now.
