You should rather run "java -jar ocaml.jar".
I was not aware of the existence of a "javaw" utility; it is a Windows-=20=

only thing ?

No, ocamljava should run on any 1.5+ JVM provided that:
	- JVMs remains backward compatible (this should be the case, as =
a Sun =20
policy)
	- there is no ocamljava-related bug that show up only on later =
JVMs

The roadmap mentions a move from Java 1.5 to Java 1.6; it will induce =20=

producing
Java 1.6 bytecode and giving up 1.5 compatibility. This should =20
hopefully make
ocamljava a little faster, notably at startup where 1.6-introduced =20
stack frames should
have some impact.

Thanks for the testing.
I did not mention it in my previous post but the beta update features =20=

some
toplevel enhancements such as the access to session history, as well =20
as the
ability to save this history to a file.
