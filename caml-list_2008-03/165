Hi,

Thanks for your help.  I have tried the new "Ultimate Ocamlbuild Plugin"(tm)
you suggested and it seems to work fine.  So I guess that one long-standing
request from the community -- streamlining the use of syntax extensions --
has now been satisfied!

All that we need now is GODI packages for the most requested syntax
extensions, and to make sure that packagers build compliant META files
(I have noticed that not all GODI packages ship with findlib+camlp4
compliant META files).  Soon, I will write down an OSR formalising
this latter aspect.

Kind regards,
Dario Teixeira
