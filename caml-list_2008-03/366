Hi,

   Olmar(http://www.cs.ru.nl/~tews/olmar/) was the best candidate among
   them. I have two questions about it.

If you try Olmar I would be interested in your experience!
Further, as the documentation is inexistent (there are almost no
Olmar users), if you hit a problem, don't hesitate to ask me. 

For documenting the Olmar ast see the Elsa ast nodes pages in the
Mozilla wiki (http://wiki.mozilla.org/Elsa_ast_nodes). There is
not much additional information in there, but at least you can
click through the interfaces and add your own findings. We know a
bit more than what's in the wiki, so don't hesitate to ask on the
oink-devel mailing list.

If you try Olmar I would suggest that you use the cvs version,
there have been lots of changes/improvements since the last
release. 

    2. If anyone have used Olmar before, I'd like to listen to your
   experience with it. I'm curious of its tolerance with various C++
   dialects, robustness, and efficiency on the code used in real world.

Olmar relies on Elsa for parsing, so this is really a question
about the capabilities of Elsa. The current Elsa version can't
parse all new gcc headers, through I never run into this problem
and use whatever header are installed on my system. For Mozilla
this was a real problem, but Taras Glek's blog seems to indicate
that they fixed most of those in their Elsa branch in the pork
repository. A problem with Elsa is that the current maintainer
makes it really difficult to contribute something back. Therefore
everybody has there own (incompatible) Elsa branch. A problem
with Olmar is that you cannot simply use it with a different Elsa
branch. But I am working in that direction...

However, my current contract ends this April and I might not have
any time left for Olmar then. If you decide for Olmar you must be
prepared to take over maintenance.

   I personally haven't used it, but I'm pretty sure it's what Mozilla is
   using to rewrite their code for automatic exception rewriting. Which is
   a good sign.

I am not completely sure, but I would be surprised, if Mozilla
already uses Olmar. 



Sorry for the late reply, but I sometimes get overwhelmed by the
traffic on the ocaml-list and then I am suddenly 500 messages
behind... 

Bye,

Hendrik Tews
