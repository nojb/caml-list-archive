I like this idea, and think that it would make getting started with
OCaml and its libraries much easier for new users.

If ocamlfind were included as a standard part of the community OCaml
distribution, then I think it would ease this process significantly.
The standard set of libraries and syntax extensions could be checked
against the proposed extra switches (-onlylibs/-exceptlibs/-libs) and
used accordingly.  The user would only need to know the ocamlfind name
of the library they wish to include/exclude.  The script would not
have to keep track of including or excluding the proper directories
for each new library which comes along in the ocaml(c|opt) search path
since ocamlfind takes care of this.  I think ocamlfind/findlib
supports syntax extension packages as well - if it does then these
could be handled in the same way.
