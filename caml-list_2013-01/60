Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ocamlc compiles hello world, ocamlopt not

Hi Gerd,

Minix3 is an ELF based system indeed. I asked the guys on the minix3 forum =
and one of the developers said that neither the default minix toolchain (cl=
ang) nor the minix port of gcc prepends leading underscores. However, he ha=
d a hint about checking if the ocaml package itself is trying to guess duri=
ng its build whether leading underscore prepending is done on the host syst=
em or not. If so, that guessing might have gone wrong in case of minix3. Af=
ter googling a bit, I found something indicating that point may be valid, (=
cited from http://asm.sourceforge.net/howto/conventions.html#AEN647 ):

Some C compilers prepend an underscore before every symbol, while others do=
 not.
Particularly, Linux a.out GCC does such prepending, while Linux ELF GCC doe=
s not.
If you need to cope with both behaviors at once, see how existing packages =
do. For instance, get an old Linux source tree, the Elk, qthreads, or OCaml=
...

If that's true, I'd need to recompile the ocaml package whilst trying to in=
dicate somehow that the minix3 system does not need leading underscore prep=
ending, right? Do you think this to be a valid assumption? If so, do you ha=
ppen to know how can I influence the ocaml build in such a way?

Thanks&regards,
r0ller

Interesting. I guess you use an ELF-based system (Minix-3.2)? If not it>

This would be a problem of the installed compiler toolchain. Maybe you>
