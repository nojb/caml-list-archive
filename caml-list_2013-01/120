Opam is the best package manager for ocaml I have ever used, thanks for 
your hard work!
> The goal of this beta release is to formally introduce OPAM to the community, to gather some general feedback on the documentation and tools and double-check that we've not forgotten some useful features. I would also like to use that opportunity to make an official call to maintainers: if you have developed packages which are already in OPAM do not hesitate to claim their ownership and to improve their description - if your packages are not yet in, it's time to start packaging them!

OPAM has been initially funded by Jane Street[2] and the DORM EU research project, and it has received continuous help and resources from OCamlLabs[3].

We will gladly accept any kind of help and support from the community to do this!  We plan to announce the release of 1.0.0 in a couple of months, with improved package quality and better integration with the future OCaml platform.
