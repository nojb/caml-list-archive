I asked the guys on the minix3 forum and one of the developers said that neither the default minix toolchain (clang) nor the minix port of gcc prepends leading underscores. However, he had a hint about checking if the ocaml package itself is trying to guess during its build whether leading underscore prepending is done on the host system or not.

Indeed, the "configure" script tries to guess this, among other
platform dependencies.

Yes.  For your first try, just manually edit the generated file
config/Makefile so that it has

ARCH=i386
MODEL=default
SYSTEM=linux_elf

then do "make opt" and "make opt.opt" and see if it now works.

If it does, you may want to investigate why the ./configure script
guessed wrong on your Minix system.  Running "sh -x ./configure"
generates a useful trace.
