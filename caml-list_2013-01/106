OPEN PHD POSITION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE


The Software Technologies research group at the Otto-Friedrich University i=
n Bamberg, Germany is offering a three-year PhD position starting as soon a=
s possible.

The group's research comprises the foundations and practice of software spe=
cification, verification and analysis. Foci of application are concurrent, =
reactive and embedded software. Recently the group has expanded its interes=
t to machine learning and its application to program analysis and verificat=
ion. Possible areas of research for a PhD candidate include, but are not li=
mited to, interface theories, automated verification and synthesis, as well=
 as heap analysis =96 all with a strong focus on tool development.

A strong background in the foundations of computer science is required such=
 as evidenced by a Masters degree in computer science or a closely related =
discipline with excellent grades.  A good knowledge of, and experience with=
 a modern programming language is also required (e.g. C++, Java, OCaml, Has=
kell). The ideal candidate would have some background in formal methods and=
 theoretical computer science. Applicants are expected to have fluent spoke=
n and written English.

For detailed information please refer to the original job advertisement tha=
t can be found here:

   http://www.uni-bamberg.de/swt/news/phd-position-in-computer-science/


As one of the group's current projects is the continuation of the developme=
nt of a small model checking framework written in OCaml, another the develo=
pment of novel tools in the intersection of machine learning and heap analy=
sis, this offer could be interesting for OCaml enthusiasts searching for a =
position in academics.

Please feel free to contact info@swt-bamberg.de in case of any additional q=
uestions.
