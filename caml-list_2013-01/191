I was going to bring this up on the new mailing list, after waiting a 
bit for it to get populated.  I am glad that you intend to keep 
metaocaml-style metaprogramming as 'a different story', as it really is 
exactly that.

Note that the metocaml based on ocaml 3.09 did have a full camlp4 port 
(I did it), but it never worked for the 3.11 version (I tried and did 
not succeed).

Anyways, I've joined the new mailing list, and will participate in such 
a discussion over there.
