Description of the workshop
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D
Numerical computations are ubiquitous in cyber-physical systems:
supervision, prediction, simulation
and signal processing rely heavily on numerical calculus to achieve
desired goals.
Verification of numerical algorithms has a unique set of challenges,
which set it apart from rest of software verification.

While verification and validation of software target global properties
of the whole system,
numerical techniques intrinsically focus on local considerations or
approximations of system components.
While =E2=80=9C abstracting away =E2=80=9D the data can still give meaningf=
ul proofs
of correctness for many types of software, in numerical algorithms,
such abstractions are unlikely to succeed.
The implementation of numerical techniques on modern hardware adds another
layer of approximation because of the use of finite representations of
infinite precision numbers.
Such representations usually lack basic arithmetic properties such as
commutativity
and associativity, and can cause catastrophic variations in the global
system behavior through something as innocuous as a rounding error.

It is hence imperative to develop logical and mathematical techniques
that would allow reasoning about programmability and reliability in this
space.
The NSV workshop is dedicated to the current development and the future
prospects for such techniques.


Topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The topics of the workshop include:

- Models and abstraction techniques
- Specifications of correctness for numerical programs
- Formal specification and verification of numerical programs
- Quality of finite precision implementations
- Propagation of uncertainties, deterministic and probabilistic models
- Numerical properties of control software
- Hybrid systems verification
- Validation for space, avionics, automotive and real-time applications
- Validation for scientific computing programs
- Optimality of program behavior
- Tradeoffs between quality of service and resource (for example energy)
- consumption in programs
- Benchmarks and tools for numerical software verification


Submission information
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
We solicit regular research papers about recent work under
the wide umbrella of Numerical Software Verification detailed above.
The submission should not exceed 15 pages, Springer LNCS format.
We also welcome tool, benchmark and case-studies papers of at most 6 pages.
Extended abstract describing work in progress of no more than 5 pages
are also highly encouraged.
More information about the submission guidelines can on the workshop
website.

All accepted submissions will be included in the CPSWeek CD-ROM.
After the workshop, presenters of selected research papers will be
invited to submit
an extended version to a special issue about Numerical Software Verification
of the journal of Mathematics in Computer Science.

Papers should be submitted (as PDF) through easychair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dnsv2013
