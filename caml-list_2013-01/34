There is ...  light...  unicode support.  UTF8 strings are still supported,
and can be transcoded from and to Latin-1.  For anything more complex than
that, you'll need to use Camomile or some other unicode library.  You're
right that these modules somehow got omitted from the API documentation;
the online docs are being regenerated as I write this.  The disappearance
of UCharParser may have been a mistake; looking back at that commit, it
looks like it was deleted instead of being modified to fit the removal of
camomile.  It will probably reappear in batteries 2.1.
