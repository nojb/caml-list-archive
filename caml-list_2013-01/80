Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Re: [ANN] beta-release of OPAM

There is just one odd corner case that I've been trying to track down.

If you have ocamlfind installed in your system PATH, then the 
"ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind" mode seems to pick that one up in preference
to the OPAM-installed ocamlfind (which sits in ~/.opam/<compiler>/bin, and
is also on the PATH).

I've not fixed that yet, but if you do run into odd bugs where an OPAM 
package fails to build due to not finding a library, then try uninstalling
your system findlib, and the OPAM one should be picked up.

This doesn't happen with OASIS ocamlfind invocations, but only with the
-use-ocamlfind mode of ocamlbuild.
