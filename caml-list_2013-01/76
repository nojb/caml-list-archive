Subject: [Caml-list] Re: [ANN] beta-release of OPAM

To people already using OPAM, I forgot to mention that it is highly recomme=
nded to NOT upgrade opam using opam. The auto-update thing was a mistake at=
 the first place. It is also advised to start from a fresh opam init. It sh=
ould work if you don't, but it would definitely avoid some confusions in so=
me corner-cases.
