Let's think through what an e-mail workflow might look like rather than jus=
t throwing it out as a superior alternative to what we use now.  Let's say =
it goes to an e-mail list, with a few people subscribed to it.  Then, someo=
ne adding the package would reply to the list saying that they'll handle it=
, and have to deal with it immediately and not get distracted.  Next, we ha=
ve to convert the package into a Git commit with the submitter's name, so t=
hat we have a reasonable package history.  Finally, we need a queue of pack=
ages to track which ones haven't been replied to, or else risk forgetting p=
ackages.  And of course, anyone who wants to be involved has to subscribe t=
o a mailing list, and the only way to find past submissions is by digging t=
hrough e-mail archives.

Git/Github takes care of all this, to the point where a merge is a single b=
utton on the website.  Specifically, it:

- track provenance of updates (so we can go contact whoever introduced a pa=
ckage reliably, assuming their Github ID doesn't change).

- lets people maintain private branches outside of Github, and easily merge=
 against upstream updates.  Citrix are doing this for their internal reposi=
tories, which they re-base against OPAM upstream, and then regularly submit=
 their packages to the mainline once they're tested.  I also do this with M=
irage.

- a public tracking system with comments to ensure packages don't get lost.=
 I don't particularly fancy having my mailbox fill up with mailed tar-balls.

- an easy-to-use API that lets us run continuous build directly off Github.=
  I think of this as "Internet threads". A callback from Github wakes up an=
 Lwt thread to do some work on the continuous build server. That's kind of =
cool :-)

It should be really trivial to build a package uploader using the OPAM exte=
nsion mechanism I described earlier, and the ocaml-github bindings. If anyo=
ne wants to help add this, get in touch with me and I'll walk you through i=
t.  My plate's a bit too full to get to this in the near-term.
