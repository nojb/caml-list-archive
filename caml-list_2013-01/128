Yeah, but OPAM also has compiler version constraints, so that you can mark =
a package as requiring {>=3D4.00} for example.  If the package is just mark=
ed trunk, then we need to manually record the version number somewhere.

One option is to have a very high version, so that any packages with a lowe=
r bound will continue to work.  The other option (which I chose) is to pick=
 the current working version, since compiler releases only happen a couple =
of times a year.  We can improve on this...

(that binary is hopefully just a stopgap until the OPAM binary packages bec=
ome more widely available)

opam-mk-repo is installed as part of OPAM, so you'll need to install from s=
ource.  However, you don't actually need to create a repository unless you =
want to host a mirror of the tarballs.  Simply try this:

$ mkdir -p my-repo/packages
$ opam remote add localdev my-repo
<create your package inside my-repo/packages/>
$ opam update
<the new packages will be available>
$ opam install <new-package>

The same applies for compilers.

If you specify a git:// or darcs:// URL in the package `url` file, a subseq=
uent `opam update` will refresh the working copy from the remote source.

If you want to work with a local copy of that package, just do `opam pin <p=
ackage> <dir>`.

If you want the bleeding edge version of a stable package, you can even do =
`opam pin <package> git://foo/bar`.

Quite the swiss-army knife, but each of those scenarios has come in useful =
at one point or another, particularly when hacking on Mirage which requires=
 rebuilding lots of forward dependencies if (e.g.) a network driver library=
 is being modified.
