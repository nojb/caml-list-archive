Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] beta-release of OPAM

Congratulations to everyone involved, and thanks. OPAM is a pleasure
to use, and packaging could hardly be easier. Mike

ote:
> I'm very happy to announce the beta release of OPAM (0.9.1). OPAM is a pa=
ckage manager for OCaml to install libraries and tools from source archives=
. It supports multiple simultaneous compiler installations, flexible packag=
e constraints, and a Git-friendly development workflow.
>
> The goal of this beta release is to formally introduce OPAM to the commun=
ity, to gather some general feedback on the documentation and tools and dou=
ble-check that we've not forgotten some useful features. I would also like =
to use that opportunity to make an official call to maintainers: if you hav=
e developed packages which are already in OPAM do not hesitate to claim the=
ir ownership and to improve their description - if your packages are not ye=
t in, it's time to start packaging them!
>
> OPAM is developed by OCamlPro[1] and has been in alpha release since June=
 2012. It is already quite mature and has gained some nice momentum (+40 co=
ntributors, +300 packages).  OPAM has been initially funded by Jane Street[=
2] and the DORM EU research project, and it has received continuous help an=
d resources from OCamlLabs[3].

> The source code of OPAM is available on Github:
> * installer: https://github.com/OCamlpro/opam
> * packages and compiler descriptions: https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-re=
pository
> * website: https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam2web
>
> The documention:
> * install instructions and tutorial are available http://opam.ocamlpro.co=
m/
> * the main source of documentation is 'opam --help' or 'opam <command> --=
help'
> * user manual: https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/raw/master/doc/dev-manual=
/dev-manual.pdf
>
> You can report issues on github bug tracker:
> * https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/issues
>
> The next steps for us is to focus on improving the package descriptions q=
uality and the global consistency of https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repos=
itory. We will gladly accept any kind of help and support from the communit=
y to do this!  We plan to announce the release of 1.0.0 in a couple of mont=
hs, with improved package quality and better integration with the future OC=
aml platform.

> Last point, if you are working in a company and that you already use OPAM=
, or plan to use OPAM, and you would like to help us ensuring it a sustaina=
ble future[2], you can contact us at contact@ocamlpro.com.
