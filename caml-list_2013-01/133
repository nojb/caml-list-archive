---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computability in Europe provides the largest international conference
dealing with the full spectrum of computability-related research.
The Nature of Computation is meant to emphasize the special focus of
CIE13 on the unexpected and strong changes that studies on Nature have
brought in several areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science.
Starting from Alan Turing, research on Nature with a computational
perspective has produced novel contributions, giving rise even to new
disciplines.

We particularly welcome submissions in emergent areas, such as
bioinformatics and natural computation, where they have a basic
connection with computability.


SUBMISSIONS

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the
conference. Each presentation will be 25 minutes long, including the
time for the eventual discussion. Submitted papers must describe work
not previously published, and they must neither be accepted nor under
review at a journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings.
Authors are required to submit their manuscripts electronically in PDF
using the LNCS style. Authors using LaTeX can download the needed macros
at Springer-Verlag site. Papers should not exceed 10 pages; full proofs
may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which will be read at
the reviewers=B9 discretion.
The submission process is managed by EasyChair and is available at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcie2013.

The proceedings will be available at the conference venue.
The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer Verlag.
