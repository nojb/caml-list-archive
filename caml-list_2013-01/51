-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the primary annual meeting for
researchers studying the theory and applications of the propositional
satisfiability problem, broadly construed.  Besides plain propositional
satisfiability, it includes Boolean optimization (including MaxSAT and
Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints), Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF),
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP)
for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

Many hard combinatorial problems can be encoded as SAT instances, in the
broad sense mentioned above, including problems in formal verification
(hardware and software), artificial intelligence, and operations research.
More recently, biology, cryptology, data mining, machine learning, and
mathematics have been added to the growing list.

The SAT conference aims to further advance the field by soliciting original
theoretical and practical contributions in these areas with a clear
connection to satisfiability.

SAT 2013 takes place in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Helsinki is a
vibrant Scandinavian and international city with a lot to offer to visitors.
SAT 2013 takes place during the main summer season, allowing one to
experience the white nights during which the sun almost never sets.


IMPORTANT DATES
===============

(Follow http://sat2013.cs.helsinki.fi/ for updates.)

February  1, 2013: Abstract Submission
February  8, 2013: Paper Submission
March    18, 2013 (approx.): Response from Authors begins, lasts 72 hours
April     3, 2013: Acceptance Notifications
April    22, 2013: Final Camera-Ready Versions

July   8-12, 2013: Main conference and workshops

SCOPE
=====

SAT 2013 welcomes scientific contributions addressing different aspects of
the satisfiability problem. interpreted in a broad sense.  Domains include
MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints, Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF),
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP).

Topics include (but are not restricted to)

  Theoretical advances (including exact algorithms, proof complexity, and
    other complexity issues);

  Practical search algorithms;

  Knowledge compilation;

  Implementation-level details of SAT solving tools and SAT-based systems;

  Problem encodings and reformulations;

  Applications (including both novel applications domains and
    improvements to existing approaches);

  Case studies and reports on insightful findings based on rigorous
    experimentation.

OUT OF SCOPE
============

Papers claiming to resolve a major long-standing open theoretical
question in mathematics or computer science (such as those for which a
Millennium Prize is offered, see http://www.claymath.org/millennium)
are outside the scope of the conference because there is insufficient
time in the schedule to referee such papers; instead, such papers
should be submitted to an appropriate technical journal.

SUBMISSIONS
===========

Submissions to SAT 2013 are solicited in three paper categories, describing
original contributions:

  REGULAR PAPERS (9 to 15 pages, excluding references)
    Regular papers should contain original research, with sufficient detail
    to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.
    For papers reporting experimental results, authors are strongly encouraged
    to make their data and implementations available with their submission.
    Submissions reporting on case studies are also encouraged, and should
    describe details, weaknesses, and strengths in sufficient depth.

  SHORT PAPERS (up to 8 pages, excluding references)
    The same evaluation criteria apply to short papers as to regular papers.
    They will be reviewed to the same standards of quality as regular papers,
    but will naturally contain less quantity of new material.
    Short papers will have the same status as regular papers and be eligible
    for the same awards (to be announced later).

  TOOL PAPERS (up to 6 pages, excluding references)
    A tool paper should describe the implemented tool and its novel features.
    Here "tools" are interpreted in a broad sense, including descriptions of
    implemented solvers, preprocessors, etc., as well as systems that exploit
    SAT solvers or their extensions to solve interesting problem domains, etc.
    A demonstration is expected to accompany a tool presentation, and the
    software for the tool should be made publicly available.
    Papers describing tools that have already been presented previously are
    expected to contain significant and clear enhancements to the tool.
    Evaluation criteria include (but are not limited to) accurate
    documentation, usability, and potential for furthering the state of
    the art, with availability of source code being a significant factor.

For all paper categories, the page limits stated above do not include
references, but do include all other material intended to appear in the
conference proceedings.  Submissions should use the Springer LNCS style
(without space-squeezing modifications), and be written in English.

Submissions should not be under review elsewhere nor be submitted elsewhere
while under review for SAT 2013, and should not consist of previously
published material.

Submissions not consistent with the above guidelines may be returned
without review.

Besides the paper itself, authors may submit a supplement consisting
of one file in the format of a gzipped tarball (.tar.gz or .tgz) or
a gzipped file (.gz) or a zip archive (.zip).  Authors are encouraged
to submit such a supplement when it will help reviewers to evaluate
the paper, and such a supplement will be treated with the same degree
of confidentiality as the paper itself.  For example, the supplement might
contain detailed proofs, examples, software, detailed experimental data,
or other material related to the submission.  Individual reviewers
may or may not consult the supplementary material; the paper should
be self-contained.

Links to information on the Springer LNCS style is available through
the SAT website at http://sat2013.cs.helsinki.fi/cfp.html .

All papers submissions are done exclusively via EasyChair at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sat2013 .

PROCEEDINGS
===========

All accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the conference,
which will be published within the Springer LNCS series.
