Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] beta-release of OPAM

I'm very happy to announce the beta release of OPAM (0.9.1). OPAM is a pack=
age manager for OCaml to install libraries and tools from source archives. =
It supports multiple simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package =
constraints, and a Git-friendly development workflow.

The goal of this beta release is to formally introduce OPAM to the communit=
y, to gather some general feedback on the documentation and tools and doubl=
e-check that we've not forgotten some useful features. I would also like to=
 use that opportunity to make an official call to maintainers: if you have =
developed packages which are already in OPAM do not hesitate to claim their=
 ownership and to improve their description - if your packages are not yet =
in, it's time to start packaging them!=20

OPAM is developed by OCamlPro[1] and has been in alpha release since June 2=
012. It is already quite mature and has gained some nice momentum (+40 cont=
ributors, +300 packages).  OPAM has been initially funded by Jane Street[2]=
 and the DORM EU research project, and it has received continuous help and =
resources from OCamlLabs[3].

The source code of OPAM is available on Github:
* installer: https://github.com/OCamlpro/opam
* packages and compiler descriptions: https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repo=
sitory
* website: https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam2web

The documention:
* install instructions and tutorial are available http://opam.ocamlpro.com/
* the main source of documentation is 'opam --help' or 'opam <command> --he=
lp'
* user manual: https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/raw/master/doc/dev-manual/d=
ev-manual.pdf

You can report issues on github bug tracker:
* https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/issues

The next steps for us is to focus on improving the package descriptions qua=
lity and the global consistency of https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-reposit=
ory. We will gladly accept any kind of help and support from the community =
to do this!  We plan to announce the release of 1.0.0 in a couple of months=
, with improved package quality and better integration with the future OCam=
l platform.

Last point, if you are working in a company and that you already use OPAM, =
or plan to use OPAM, and you would like to help us ensuring it a sustainabl=
e future[2], you can contact us at contact@ocamlpro.com.=20

On behalf of the OPAM team,
Thomas Gazagnaire
