*************************************************************************

The 24th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications
(RTA 2013) is organized as part of the Federated Conference on Rewriting, 
Deduction, and Programming (RDP 2013), together with the 11th International 
Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2013), and several 
workshops. RDP 2013 will be held at the Eindhoven University of Technology
in the Netherlands.

*** INVITED SPEAKERS ***

- Simon Peyton-Jones (Microsoft Research, UK) 
joint invited speaker for TLCA+RTA 2013
- Jarkko Kari (University of Turku, Finland) invited speaker for RTA 2013
- Mitsu Okada (Keio University, Japan) invited speaker for RTA 2013

*** TOPICS OF INTEREST ***

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects of 
rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols; rule-based 
  (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and algebraic computation; 
  SMT solving; theorem proving; system synthesis and verification; proof 
  checking; reasoning about programming languages and logics; program 
  transformation; XML queries and transformations; systems biology;
  homotopy theory; implicit computational complexity; 

Foundations: equational logic; universal algebra; rewriting logic; 
  rewriting models of programs; matching and unification; narrowing; 
  completion techniques; strategies; rewriting calculi; constraint solving; 
  tree automata; termination; complexity; modularity; 

Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and 
  higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical and 
  infinitary rewriting; stochastic rewriting; net rewriting; binding 
  techniques; Petri nets; higher-dimensional rewriting;

Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution; rewrite and 
  completion tools; certification of rewriting properties; abstract 
  machines; explicit substitutions; automated (non)termination and 
  confluence provers; automated complexity analysis.

*** PUBLICATION ***

The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs (Leibniz International 
Proceedings in Informatics). LIPIcs is open access, meaning that 
publications will be available online and free of charge, and authors 
keep the copyright for their papers. LIPIcs publications are indexed 
in DBLP. For more information about LIPIcs please consult:
  <http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics>

Also, authors of selected papers will be invited to submit
an extension of their RTA 2013 paper to a special issue of
Logical Methods in Computer Science (LMCS) 
  <http://www.lmcs-online.org/index.php>.

*** SUBMISSION GUIDELINES ***

Submissions must be
- original and not submitted for publication elsewhere,
- written in English,
- a research paper, or a problem set, or a system description,
- in pdf prepared with pdflatex using the LIPIcs stylefile:
  <http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors.tgz>,
- at most 10 pages for system description,
  at most 15 pages for the other two types of submissions
- submitted electronically through the EasyChair system at:
  <https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rta2013>.

The page limit and the deadline for submission are strict.

Additional material for instance proof details, may be given in an appendix 
which is not subject to the page limit. However, submissions must be 
self-contained within the respective page limit; reading the appendix should 
not be necessary to assess the merits of a submission.
