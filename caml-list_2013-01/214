Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Core Suite 109.07.00 released

I'm pleased to announce the 109.07.00 release of the Core suite of
libraries.  Core is an industrial strength alternative to OCaml's
standard library.

Tarballs can be found here:

  https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/109.07.00/individual/

And the documentation:

  https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/109.07.00/doc/

All packages are available through opam.

** The Core suite **

The Core suite includes a variety of useful libraries, including:

- Core: the heart of the standard library.
- Several useful syntax extensions
  - type-conv: a library for building type-driven syntax extensions
  - sexplib: a library for handling s-expressions, and a syntax
    extension for auto-generating conversions between OCaml types and
    s-expressions
  - bin-prot: a syntax-extensions for generating
  - pipebang
  - variantslib
  - comparelib
  - fieldslib
- Async: a monadic concurrency library.
- Core_extended: extra components that are not as closely vetted or as
  stable as Core.  This includes, Shell, an interface for interacting
  with the UNIX shell, and Command, a command-line parsing library.

** Repositories **

The official repositories for the Core libraries are now located on
the "janestreet" organisation on github and the "janestreet" team on
bitbucket.

github:            https://github.com/janestreet
bitbucket:         https://bitbucket.org/janestreet
github home page:  http://janestreet.github.com/

We changed the way we are exporting our source tree; there will now be
only one visible commit per release and project. Hopefully this
simpiflied process will allow more frequent updates.

** Contribution **

If you want to contribute to core the preferred way is to submit a
pull-request, which won't be merged in the end but will be used for
working on the changes before they are accepted and added to our
development process for integration in a future release.

** Changes **

He is a list of changes since the previous public release (108.08.00):

- Switched to OCaml 4.0.
- Async:
  - Add a [~perm] argument to [Writer.open_file] to set the file
    permissions in the same way [Unix.openfile] does.
  - Added [Async.Unix.unsetenv].
  - Fixed a bug in [Reader] that in some situations would make the
    reader unusable after an error in user code (e.g. a failed sexp
    conversion).
  - Fixed a bug in [Writer] that manifests when scheduling bigstrings
    with non-zero pos parameter.
  - Fixed a bug in [Scheduler.go], which previously behaved incorrectly
    if an exception had been raised to the main monitor prior to
    [Scheduler.go] being called.  The exception is now dealt with
    immediately, rather than running a cycle.
  - Exposed the type and value [Async.Config.t] as sexpable.
  - Improved error message when a user requests async to manage a file
    descriptor that it is already managing.
  - Improved error message when creation of the async scheduler fails.
  - Added [val _squelch_unused_module_warning_] to [Async.Std].
  - Made [Reader.load_sexp{,s}] handle exceptions other than
    [Of_sexp_error].
  - Fixed a bug in async's handing of file descriptors -- a missed check
    for a file descriptor having been closed.
  - Added [Writer.set_buffer_age_limit].
  - Improved the performance of [Deferred.Queue] by changing the
    implementation to use lists rather than arrays, which reduces gc
    promotion.
  - Added [?should_close_file_descriptor:bool] argument to [Async.Unix.close].
  - Moved the implementation of finalizers from Async_unix to
    Async_core.  This makes it possible to unit test finalizers (and
    things using them) using only the Async_core scheduler.
  - Changed the async scheduler so that if there are no upcoming events,
    it times out in 50ms rather than waiting forever.
  - Added =Monad_sequence.iteri=, which in turn adds it to:
    =Deferred.Array=, =Deferred.List=, and =Deferred.Queue=.
  - Added =Pipe.init=, which is analogous to =Deferred.create=.
  - Improved the performance of =Pipe.iter{,_without_pushback}=.
  - Improved =Reader.read_one_chunk_at_a_time_until_eof=:
    - the callback need not consume everything
    - add =`Eof_with_unconsumed_data= as a possible result
    - grow internal buffer of the reader when needed
  - Added =Shutdown.exit=, removed =Shutdown.shutdown_and_raise=.
  - Added =Scheduler.force_current_cycle_to_end=.
- Core:
  - Added [Char.of_string].
  - Fix [Backtrace.get], which was broken in 109.00, with the
    switch to OCaml 4.0.
  - Added [Heap.iter_el].
  - Updated [Core.Unix.stat] so that access, modify, and change times
    have nanosecond precision.
  - Fixed a bug in [Nano_mutex.invariant].
  - Simplified the implementation of [with_return] using a local
    explicit polymorphic type variable.
  - Added [Map.symmetric_diff], for returning a list of differences
    between two maps.  It has a fast-path implementation for maps that
    share a large amount of their internal structure.
  - Added a number of functions to =Bounded_int_table=: =equal=,
    =exists{,i}=, =for_all{,i}=, =filter_map{,i}=, =map{,i}=.  Also
    added a functor, =Bounded_int_table.With_key=, that makes a
    bounded-int table binable and sexpable, and adds =of_alist= and
    =of_alist_exn=.
  - Added =Doubly_linked.iter_elt= and =Bag.iter_elt=.
  - Added =module Invariant=, which defines signatures that are to
    be included in other signatures to ensure a consistent interface to
    invariant-style functions.
  - Added =module Ordering=, which defines:
      =type t = Less | Equal | Greater=
