                           Call For Papers

    1st International Workshop on Automated Reasoning in Software 
Verification

                      http://arisve2013.lri.fr/

                        Monday, June 10, 2013
                        Lake Placid, NY,  USA
                       Affiliated with CADE-24

Aims and Scope

   The focus of the workshop is application of automated reasoning in the
   context of software verification, and, more generally, automation in
   software verification. Relevant topics include but are not limited to:

     * specifics of verification-related automated reasoning tasks;
     * efficient translation of high-level verification conditions to
       logical languages of automated reasoning tools;
     * handling of the prover's feedback: proofs, models, answer terms;
     * logical theories of interest for program verification, decision
       procedures, integration into existing ATP and SMT systems;
     * combination of automated and user-assisted verification;
     * tool presentations, tool comparisons, and benchmarks;
     * experience reports on verification of complex algorithms and
       real-life software with the use of automated reasoning tools.

Paper Submission and Proceedings

   All submissions are reviewed by the programme committee. We expect
   that one author of every accepted paper will present their work at the
   workshop.

   Submissions are limited to 6-12 pages in the LaTeX EasyChair format
   easychair.cls (http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip).
   Technical details may be included in an appendix to be
   read at the reviewers' discretion. Tool presentation papers and
   experience reports are welcome.

   Papers should be submitted through EasyChair,
   at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arisve2013
   Submissions must be in PDF format. Electronic version of proceedings
   will be freely distributed from the workshop web site.

     * Abstract submission deadline: March 8, 2013
     * Submission deadline: March 15, 2013
     * Notification: April 10, 2013
