> Have we started an FAQ for OPAM ?

I've created a FAQ with these two questions on OPAM wiki: https://github.co=
m/OCamlPro/opam/wiki/FAQ

Feel free to edit and contribute!

(once we get sufficiently nice contents, this can automatically go somewher=
e on opam.ocamlpro.com as the other wiki pages).
