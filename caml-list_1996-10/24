Hi Camlers,

Is there any way to produce a sunos and/or solaris shared library from a
caml module? Preferably in Caml Special Light, but Objective Caml will also
do.

In fact, I'm interested in a more specific problem. Could I use csl or
ocaml to produce input for the Tcl "load" command? Has anybody tried it
yet?

Cheers,
Leszek
