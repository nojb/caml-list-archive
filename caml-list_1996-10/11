You're probably talking about release 0.7 or earlier. You should try
VESA_S3.GRN first, which seems to be a "generic" S3 driver. If this
fails, try other drivers for cards that have S3 chips in them, such as
STEALTH.GRN and F1280.GRN

This said, graphics under MSDOS are a mess, and you're strongly
encouraged to do graphics under the Windows version of Caml Light 0.71.
At least, Windows takes care of the graphics drivers.

The graphics code for 0.7 was built on top of the CBGRX library for
DJGPP version 1, and I don't think this library can handle more than
256 colors. (This is code I wrote almost five years ago, so I can be
wrong.)

For 0.71, Caml Light will happily let you access all colors that
Windows provides.
