Caml does more than most compilers: it reports the column number where
the error occurred, not just the line number.  That's why the format
is different.

Please see the elisp code: the exact messages depend on the local
language, hence your regex probably won't work in the German version
(for one: lines => Zeilen).

You may want to check out my extensions to Caml Emacs tools, available
on
    ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/itz 
and the usual elisp archives (I hope).

They have not been updated for ocaml (or csl), though, because I don't
want to deal with unfortunate gratituous syntax incompatibilities.
(Has anyone out there tried that?  How do you cope eg. with the '
character being used both in char literals and type variables?)

Days spent working only for oneself are twice wasted; 
it would have been better not to work at all.
