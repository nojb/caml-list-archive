Subject: [Caml-list] Semantic Web Journal: Call for Special Issue Proposals

Semantic Web Journal: Call for Special Issue Proposals

http://www.semantic-web-journal.net

The Semantic Web journal seeks proposals for Special Issues of the 
journal. A proposal should fall into one of the following categories.

A) Special Issues which address core technological or fundamental 
challenges for Semantic Web research and/or applications.

B) Special Issues which are within the topical realm of a neighboring 
discipline but contribute directly or indirectly to Semantic Web 
research and/or applications.

Proposals for special issues shall be sent to the Editors-in-Chief
(contact@semantic-web-journal.net) and contain the following information 
in a single PDF file:

* Names and affiliations of all guest editors

* Topic of the special issue

* Tentative list of Guest Editorial Board members

* A short description of the topic

* Why the topic is currently of interest

* Why the topic is relevant to this call

* Credentials of the guest editors regarding their research impact and
their community standing with respect to the topic

* A draft call for papers, including a suggested time-line

Usually, it is recommended that the set of guest editors, as well as the 
proposed editorial board, are geographically diverse, have ample 
visibility within the discipline, and cover key dimensions of the 
special issue topic.

It will be assumed that all proposed guest editors are aware of the
journal's open and transparent review policy described at
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/reviewers#review

Submission deadline: 30th of September, 2012

Best Regards,

Pascal Hitzler
