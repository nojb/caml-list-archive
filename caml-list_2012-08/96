Thanks for your detailed report. I have fixed all these issues, and
uploaded a new version of the archive. Would you be kind enough to
test if everything is fixed on your installation too?
The address is the same:
     http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/ocamljava-2.0-early-access.tar.gz

Well, I provided no guidance because the current build does not
include the typer extensions allowing to manipulate Java elements
from OCaml code. Such extensions are not complete yet (some tests
are missing, and arrays are not handled yet), and will be integrated
in a future build (hopefully in september).

In the meantime, here is how it works. Some "special" functions behave
as "printf", meaning that their actual type is based on a "format"
string literal. For example,
     Java.make "javax.swing.JButton(java.lang.String,javax.swing.Icon)" (x,=
 y)
will create a "javax.swing.JButton" instance. The OCaml type of the
instance is "javax'swing'JButton java_instance" where "java_instance"
is a particular type whose parameter designates a Java class name
where dots are replaced by simple quote (to fit OCaml syntax).

They surely do! Thanks again!
