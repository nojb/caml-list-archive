Subject: Re: [Caml-list] What is the meaning behind the "labl" prefix?

The first "labl" implmentation was done by me, labl-light, an extnsion of
caml-light with labeled argumnts for my master thesis. I named it labl with
serious respct to Caml community. Not a joke. The real silly part is that
the implmentation was lost due to a hard driv crash.
