HOPE 2012

HOPE is a *new workshop* that is intended to bring together
researchers interested in the design, semantics, implementation, and
verification of higher-order effectful programs. This 1st edition of HOPE
is dedicated to John Reynolds, whose work is an inspiration to us all.

There were 21 talk submissions, of extraordinarily high quality. As
the workshop is only one day long, we were only able to accept 13 of
them for presentation at the workshop. So there will be 13 contributed
talks, but no invited talks or other sessions. We expect this to be a
very high-octane workshop!=20
