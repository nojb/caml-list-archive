Venue
-----

ESOCC 2012 events are held in the University Residential Center located in =
the small medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro. This town is in Emilia Romagn=
a about 50km east of Bologna at an elevation of 230m above sea level.  Bert=
inoro is easily reached by train and taxi from Bologna and is close to many=
 splendid Italian locations such as Ravenna, Rimini on the Adriatic coast, =
and the Republic of San Marino (all within 35km) as well as some less well-=
known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme, the Pieve di San =
Donato in Polenta and the castle and monastic gardens of Monte Maggio.  Ber=
tinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known Italian loc=
ations such as Padua, Ferrara, Vicenza, Venice, Florence and Siena.

Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with many narrow streets and walkways wind=
ing around the central peak.  Meetings are held in an archiepiscopal castle=
 that has been converted by the University of Bologna into a modern confere=
nce center with computing facilities and Internet access.  From the castle =
you can enjoy a beautiful vista that stretches from the Tuscan Apennines to=
 the Adriatic coast and the Alps over the Po Valley.=20
