CALL FOR PAPERS

******************************************************
World Congress on Sustainable Technologies (WCST-2012)
Technical Co-Sponsored by IEEE UK/RI Section
19-22 November, 2012
London, UK
www.wcst.org
******************************************************


The World Congress on Sustainable Technologies (WCST-2012)
is a multidisciplinary congress, bridging efforts across the natural,
social and engineering sciences, the environment and development
of communities. The congress covers a wide spectrum of topics
that relate to sustainability, which includes technical and non-technical
research areas. It also encourages sharing new knowledge in the field
of sustainable technologies and the environmental impacts.

The mission of WCST-2012 is to provide the opportunities for
collaboration and reflection that have the potential to greatly enhance
the infrastructure and capacity for conducting and applying art,
science and technology for sustainability. The WCST bridges
the gap between academia and industry by creating awareness of
current development in sustainable technologies.
