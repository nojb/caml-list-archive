Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml-Java 2.0 preview: call for testers

Dear list,

The OCaml-Java is a project whose goal is to allow compilation
of OCaml sources to Java bytecode, thus allowing execution on
any JVM. The objectives are to gain access to a greater number
of libraries, and to be able to take advantage of multiple cores.

Quite a lot of work has been done in order to greatly improve
the performances of the code generated by the "ocamljava"
compiler. Roughly speaking, some preliminary benchmarks
seem to indicate that ocamljava-generated code is most of
the time less than three times slower than ocamlopt-generated one.

This very mail is sent to try to gather feedback from the community.
As of today, the source is neither stabilized nor complete, and only
a binary version is available. Installation is very simple: uncompress
the archive, and put the "bin" subdirectory in your path.
More information can be found in the "README" file of the archive.
The archive can be downloaded at the following address:
     http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/ocamljava-2.0-early-access.tar.gz

For this version, I am mostly interested in compatibility reports,
and performance considerations. Although the compiler is already
able to compile itself, it is probably wise to start with smaller
examples...


Thanks in advance for your feedback,

Xavier Clerc


PS: I would have prefered to put the file on http://forge.ocamlcore.org,
but was not able to upload such a big file (about 63 Mb)
