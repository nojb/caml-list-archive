Subject: Re: [Caml-list] How to profile compiler's performance

You could try compiling a native OCaml compiler executable with profiling
option (-p) (setting that up might be a pain, though).

Before that you could try to only typecheck the file (option "-i") to know
whether it's the type-checking or code generation that is problematic. (-i
causes type printing as well, so for very large types that are internally
shared it can be its own source of slowness)

If it was in code generation, that would most likely only occur during when
compiling to native code. Have you noticed the performance bottleneck with
compilation to bytecode as well?

(Of course using the natively-compiled versions of your compilers will also
speed up performance, but if your generated code hits one of the source of
exponential behavior of the compiler you're out of luck anyway.)
