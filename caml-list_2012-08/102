Subject: [Caml-list] Companies using OCaml


--00235452fe24cec70d04c78fce19
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Dear OCaml list,

Some of you might already have heard about the OCaml Website
project<http://github.com/agarwal/ocamlweb>started after its
announcement at the last OCaml Meeting in April 2011.
There will be a page on the website where we list all companies using the
OCaml language.
We listed almost all well known companies (see the list at the end of this
mail), with a small description of the use of OCaml in the corresponding
company.
We wish to enrich this list as much as possible.
So, if you know or work in a company using OCaml and that is not in this
list, please tell us. And if you see some detailed descriptions that need
to be updated, let us know.

We also welcome new contributors to the project. You can submit pull
requests on Github (http://github.com/agarwal/ocamlweb) and also suggest
content to add, etc. We have a mailing list where you can subscribe:
https://lists.forge.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/ocamlweb-devel

Thank you for your help.

Esther Baruk
