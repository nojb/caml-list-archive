> Hi,
Greetings,
   Just have a try for the utop and give it up. Here are some 
difficulties that I came across, no complains, hope that will help
utop's next release.

   a. dependency too much. To my limited knowledge, utop is a standalone 
binary, dependency on lwt is a big problem, I never managed to install 
it successfully on Mac(I did on my Linux box)

   b. I still give a try. and grabed package react, try to install 
react, but found that react even don't work with ocamlfind. I stop here. 
(package react is just one file, dependency on react is not worth)

I know it would be convenient to use some package managers like Godi, 
but I maintained my own fork of ocaml(I changed the ocaml's compiler 
frequently, using Godi would bring a lot of pain).

   It would be great if utop is a stand alone package, or , a utop.byte 
is still fine. I have used otags.byte built on Linux, and copied to my 
Mac, it works fine.

   I never used utop(never succeeded :-( ) , but I guess it maybe 
something like slime for lisp, hope this will help utop to gain more users.
