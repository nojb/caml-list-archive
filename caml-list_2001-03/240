I guess I'm just dense, but I don't see how you generalize this.

I mean, OK, if you want to also say that (-1, 0)^2 -> (1, 0-) so that 
you can then do sqrt(1, 0-) -> (-1, 0) instead of (1, 0) then I guess 
I could live with this.

But how do you deal with all the other complementary pairs?  I mean, 
how do you distinguish the results of, say (4 + 5i)^2 and (-4 - 5i)^2 
-- both of which are (-9 + 40i) -- so that when you do sqrt(-9 + 40i) 
you get the number you started with rather than always the principle 
one?

I'm afraid I just don't see it.
