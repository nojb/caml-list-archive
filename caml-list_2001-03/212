Streams date from 1992. They have been implemented in Caml Light.

I added them in OCaml but actually it was an error: streams and
streams parsers are just syntactic sugar, it is work for Camlp4, but
Camlp4 did not exist at this time.  We plan to remove them from OCaml
but after having moved Camlp4 in OCaml contribution directory.
