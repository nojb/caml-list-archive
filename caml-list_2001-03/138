OK, as long as we are at it, the first few chapters of Mark Lillibridge's=
=20
thesis are also acceptable to the lay reader, though reading the whole=20
thing is overkill for the "working programmer" (as opposed to the=20
unemployed type theorist ;-)

This page has just the parts that Chris (and probably others) want to
read.=20

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/lillibridge97translucent.html

Since lots of people have issues with the amount of documentation, it
might be helpful if, once that person has an answer to their question,=20
they write the text that they wish they'd seen in the first place, and=20
submit it for inclusion in the Caml docs. I'm thinking of doing something
like that for the various "mutual recursion" issues, if there is interest.
Of course, I hope Tom and crew make such a document irrelevant by fixing=20
the problems...

Is there a good reference (book, tutorial paper, website, whatever) that ta=
