This is pretty much how it works internally, although the precise
mechanisms used are slightly different in the bytecode interpreter and
in the native-code compiler.  Viewed from the outside, it maintains
the illusion that every function takes only one parameter,
and fun x y -> ... behaves like fun x -> (fun y -> ...).
