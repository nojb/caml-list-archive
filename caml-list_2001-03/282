Hello Judicael,

I asked for this pragma one year ago, but was refused it :-)
This should come from the users, they said.

So bad you didn't say it one year ago :-(
In ocaml-2.99, this was the case, but I had to remove labels on find
and remove against my will :-)

Remark that this might suggest yet another evolution:
keep classic and label mode as they are now, but add more labels in
the standard library (revert back to the old labels ?)

P.S. It's friday night here, so I'll join back the discussion on
monday.
