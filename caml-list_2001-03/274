It might be worth trying as long as there remains a "way back". I could
have tried it earlier, of course, but as is probably true for others,
big steps (and it is a big one) are not easily taken unless somebody
pushes you...

If label mode really becomes the default mode, I wouldn't mind some mild
labelling in the standard library. Let's just don't become too hard-core
right from the start...

Being able to write the code of a functional at the end of some function
application is surely an advantage when using commuting labels.
