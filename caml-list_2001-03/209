I just gave a talk at the Game Developers Conference (www.gdconf.com) on "modern" language features, most of which are associated with functional programming (although the misnomer "modern" is a little odd, since they're almost all in Lisp, and ML's 20 years old :).  I don't have the feedback forms on the talk yet, so I don't know how useful people found it, but it filled up completely and they were turning people away, which for a 9am talk at a game conference strongly implies people are interested in alternative languages!

I'll put the slides up on my website soon, although I doubt anybody on this list will learn anything from them.  OCaml has all the features I talked about except 1) introspection/reflection and 2) template-style generics (as opposed to polymorphism-style generics).

I'm still planning on organizing the Bay Area OCaml Users Group, or at least a big dinner for anyone who's interested.  I'll add your name to the list.  Anybody else in the San Francisco Bay Area, USA, who isn't on my list mail me privately.

Chris
