Hi again ;)

Well, while still trying to compile findlib I ran into a problem with 
the Mutex module. I know that BeOS has no pthread support for now... 
but isn't it possible to port the scheduler.c file to BeOS. I must say 
i don't know anything about BeOS development, so I can't be of any 
help. But I'd really appreciate to work on BeOS with OCaml... for the 
moment I have to make my BSD server compile my project, which means 
compilation times that get twice longer than on my workstation (at 
least I get a glimpse of what development looked like years ago ;)

Cheers,
Seb.
