I have a value of the following type being passed to an external:

  type pointer = Null | Address of string

and I'd like to determine (in the C code) which variant the value is
and get the pointer to the string.  I've stared at mlvalues.h for a
while, but I can't really figure it out.  Can anyone help?  You won't
regret it...
