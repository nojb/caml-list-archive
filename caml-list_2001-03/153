I don't see that it makes much of a difference. Besides, the reason it
hasn't worked well for me is that inevitably I want to add some
functions to the module that has the variant type. For example, pretty
printers. The next compromise is to continue the path without a .mli file
until I don't want some of these utilities to be exported.  In the end,
I'm back to the source of the problem, having to duplicate a large variant
type.
