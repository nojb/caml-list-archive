Is there a good reference (book, tutorial paper, website, whatever) that talks about modules in an in-depth way?  I've read the chapter 4 on them in the help materials, and I want more.  I was trying to understand the group example someone posted to the list a few days back, and I think I need to find a good book or something to understand the real power of modules.

Some guy wrote a paper I found helpful, but the example code is in a very
strange language that nobody uses, instead of C++ or Java. 

     * A modular module system, Journal of Functional Programming 10(3),
       2000. Full source code available in the Web appendix.

You can get it from here
