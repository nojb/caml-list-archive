>It's not going to have different behavior, and it's not an optimization.  The library has to know because it has to know when to call a C function from another C function and it has to tell caml when to call it from caml.

By the way, I should point out that caml itself has to deal with this problem when calling c functions, which is why type abbreviations aren't expanded during arity checking, as it says in the manual in Subsection 17-1-1 on external declarations.  You are forced to use abbreviations for returning functions so the compiler can tell the arity of the external function.
