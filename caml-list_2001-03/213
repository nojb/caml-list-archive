Hello Fabrice, ...

I think this is a very nice idea.

Are you also aware of the debian-ocaml packaging effort, it is a plan to
integrate as much of the ocaml stuff in official debian packages. Upto now, we
have (at least) ocaml, ocaml-doc, lablgtk, lablgl, mlgtk, mldvi, ocamlp4,
ocamlweb, findlib, ocaml-tools (a collection of smaller thigns), hevea, and
more that i don't remember just yet.

We have both a mailing list (debian-ocaml-maint@lists.debian.org) with a
complete mailing list archive, and a web page :
http://www3.inrets.fr/Public/ESTAS/Mariano.Georges/OCamlDebian/html/

As well as a small group of people interested in working on this.

I would think that since the two effort share some common ideas, that it would
be nice to if not join, at least speak with each other about this issues, or
maybe cross post any mail discution on this ?

What do you think about it ?

Friendly,

Sven Luther
