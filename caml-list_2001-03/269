Jacques,
As a beginner in OCaml I could resume my experience as follows:
1) Labels on a local scope (within a specific app) are not so usefull as functions layouts are particular to that app and self documenting effect are acheived by using adecuate variable names.
2) The opposite is when working with big libraries, that is where labels with conmmuting and partial application capabitities play a great role. I have to say that for example LablGtk would be a real nightmare without conmmuting labels. So labels in commuting mode helped me a lot to do my first OCaml-GTK app. (When we are faced for the first time to a new library we all are BEGINNERS and spend a lot of time learning to deal with, so labels really helps).
So in my opinion labels are NECESSARY to deal with complex libraries. Moreover for me labels are really usefull IF_AND_ONLY_IF are in conmmuting mode.

Best Regards
Arturo Borquez
