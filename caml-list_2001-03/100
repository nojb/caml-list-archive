I can't remember, but the design and implementation of "with module"
dates back to 1996, so my memory is a bit hazy :-)

I agree with you that the most natural interpretation of the "with
module" constraint is to stand for a bunch of "with type" constraints
on the type components of the modules.  With this interpretation, the
current behavior is a bug.  SML'97 also interprets sharing constraints
between structures as the implied sharing constraints between the type
components of these modules.

There might be examples of signature surgery where the current
behavior is useful (I need to go back to my examples to check),
but I agree it's confusing.
