My only request for label mode is that if there's no ambiguity, don't require the labels (meaning if I apply all the arguments and there are no labels, don't make me write them out anyway).  Basically, I'd like to be able to use libraries that require labels mixed with code that doesn't really need them but just uses them for documentation.

Commutation seems useful for thinks like labltk where there are zillions of parms, most of which aren't going to be filled in most of the time.
