Hi David,
    Cudd or CUDD I think stands for the "Colorado University Decision
Diagram" package. It supports BDDs (or ROBDDs if you want to be that way) 
ADDs, and zero suppressed BDDs. It was written by Fabio Somenzi at
Colorado U. You can find it here

    http://vlsi.Colorado.EDU/~fabio/

    Yes, sure I'd like your binding, and please make it web available. 

    Here's a snippet from the cudd.h file concerning copyright 

  Copyright [This file was created at the University of Colorado at
  Boulder.  The University of Colorado at Boulder makes no warranty

    I'm not a lawyer, and I don't play one on the Internet, so perhaps a 
mail to Dr. Somenzi for clarification is in order. (PS: please don't reply 
to the list guessing what this copyright means if you are not a lawyer 
familiar with this aspect of US and international law :-|)
