You uploaded them where?  I searched unstable and didn't find them.  I
even looked in Incoming.  I had already installed libgtkmathview0,
libgtkmathview-bin, libgtkmathview-dev, libminidom0, and libminidom-dev,
if you were referring to any of those.  The two I am referring to are
the OCaml bindings.  If the versions I downloaded from Luca Padovani's
site (namely mlminidom-0.0.1 and lablgtkmathview-0.2.2) had been packaged,
they would have had dependencies on ocaml(>=3.00), and what I am finding
is that lablgtkmathview would also have had another dependency on 
ocaml(<=3.00).  But I will contact Stefano Zacchiroli as you suggest.
