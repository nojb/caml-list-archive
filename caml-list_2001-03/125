This is correct.

That's one reason.  Another reason is that when you have a low-level
file descriptor (Unix.file_descr) and build a channel around it
(Unix.{in,out}_channel_of_descr), it is often the case that you don't
want the file descriptor to be closed when the channel becomes garbage
collected -- your code may still be using the file descriptor.

I'm not sure which part of the doc you're referring to, but with the
new per-object finalization facility of OCaml 3, I think it is safe
to do
        Gc.finalise close_out my_out_channel
or
        Gc.finalise close_in my_in_channel

for the channels you'd like to see finalized.
