This is wrong. This should be:
  external get_frame : [>`math_view] obj -> Gtk.frame obj =
    "ml_gtk_math_view_get_frame"

LablGTK uses an encoding of widget types, in variant types, were
variant types are used as capacities. This can seem a bit unusual, but
you can see it in the fact the Gtk.obj abstract type is contravariant.
