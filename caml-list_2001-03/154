What's the problem with the hack I suggested earlier: put the huge variant 
(and other duplicated types) in a "pure" .mli file (I hate using .ml for
that) and "open"ing it where you need it, once in the .mli file and once in the 
.ml file? This way you reduce the duplication to two lines.

I know some people are open-phobes, but I find this use of open to be 
acceptable.
