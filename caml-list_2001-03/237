...however... the fact that so many scientists and engineers use the
"broken" code in Fortran and other languages demonstrates

1. Few if any scientists understand this arithmetic
2. Few if any do conformal mapping where its "broken-ness" would become
immediately apparent
3. Nearly all applications of complex arithmetic are of a nature in which
these broken elements do not contribute. E.g., impedance calculations,
phasor relations, FFT analyses, etc.

So what!? (I still like having a correct implementation...)
