Slightly off-topic, but anybody who's interested in string processing should read the bottom part of the interview with Ilya Zakharevich.  He talks about how Perl's text processing is really not all that great, and he has a lot of good things to say.  Here's a snippet.  It would be a coup for Caml to have a module that supports some of these features before other languages:

Let me also mention that classifying the text handling facilities of Perl as "extremely agile" gives me the willies. Perl's regular expressions are indeed more convenient than in other languages. However, the lack of a lot of key text-processing ingredients makes Perl solutions for many averagely complicated tasks either extremely slow, or not easier to maintain than solutions in other languages (and in some cases both).
