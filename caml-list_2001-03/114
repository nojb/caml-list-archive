Subject: [Caml-list] "Nasty" functions and memory usage

I have been waiting some ten minutes or so, now, for my Pentium
200 to calculate the type of nasty function number 5...

let f0 = function x,y -> x,y;;
let f1 = function x,y -> f1(f0 x, f0 y);;
let ...
let f5 = function x,y -> f5(f4 x, f4 y);;

... and I have reason to believe I will still have to wait a long
long time if I want to see the result.

The question is the following: the problem of calculating the type
of fN is DSPACE(2**(2**N))-hard, as far as I understand ...(I have
evidence, too! The type of f4 was so long it took the machine
several minutes only to print it to the screen once it had it
calculated.)

So how can the memory usage of the ocaml interpreter be constant
at 2200Kb? Here's my top screen...

The value has been constant at least since I started checking it,
about ten minutes ago.

Please, gurus, explain...
