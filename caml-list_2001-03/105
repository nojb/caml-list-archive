Subject: [Caml-list] good reference on modules?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Precedence: bulk


Coming from a C++ background, my idea of a module is a text file on the hard disk.  Obviously, they're a bit more powerful than that in OCaml.  Is there a good reference (book, tutorial paper, website, whatever) that talks about modules in an in-depth way?  I've read the chapter 4 on them in the help materials, and I want more.  I was trying to understand the group example someone posted to the list a few days back, and I think I need to find a good book or something to understand the real power of modules.

Thanks,
Chris
