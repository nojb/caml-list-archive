Hi,

 Thanks for all the help. I looked up at both the CamlIDL and the dbm
stuff . Both of them helped a lot. I even tried a few wrappers similar to
the dbm library. However, since my C library is quite extensive, using
CamlIDL seems to be a good idea.

 Can anyone please spare a few IDL samples to help me get a good idea of
it.

Thanks again for all the help
Ravi
