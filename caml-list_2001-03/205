My summary of this type of advice is "Make the easy easier and
make the hard harder".  If you want to turn Ocaml into the next
visual basic, it is excellent advice.  If you want to turn
Ocaml into the next Ocaml, then I think it is best that you
and the "someones at INRIA" keep doing what you all have been doing.  
I vote for the latter.
