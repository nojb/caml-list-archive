A few weeks ago, we started a project called "Caml Development Kit" or
CDK, which would gather in one big tarball or RPM several tools and
libraries, useful for Ocaml programming. 

For example, the CDK will include Ocaml, Camlp4, ledit, and many
user-contributed libraries. A new CDK will be released at each Ocaml
release (and probably more often from CVS sources), removing the need
to update, compile and install many different packages everytime to
have a coherent development envirronment.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, you can either
send me your code, or an URL where we can download your contribution.

We are particularly interested in general modules, providing useful
data structures, network(urlget,http_server,etc)/ crypto(des)/
multimedia(images) functions, or bindings to C libraries. 

The package includes a simple tool to generate HTML from .mli files.
Thus, contributions must provide .mli files for all interesting
modules, and these .mli files must be correctly documented.

Have a look at the just created web site:
