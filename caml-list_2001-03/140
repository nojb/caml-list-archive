I do not compile the caml-hilit.el file because I seem to recall that
hilit mode is obsolete.  It has also been pointed out to me that the
following line should be inserted into the spec file directly after
the %files line:

  %defattr(-, root, root)

this sets the ownership of all the installed files to root.root,
necessary if the binary RPM was built by a regular user.
