Thanks to all those who replied to my question - particularly the

Nice welcome to the list!

	My question:
	I get the following error when trying to install OCaml on a 
sun sparc station.

 > Options for linking with X11: -cclib -lX11
 > NDBM found (in /usr/include)
 > Configuring LablTk...
 > tcl.h not found.
 > Configuration failed, LablTk will not be built.

Xavier Rival, Alan Schmitt

	The reason:

Maybe tcl/tk is not installed. Or maybe it is installed but without 
the development headers. In any case, you may build ocaml, you just 
won't have access to tk bindings.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1- Configure the system. From the top directory, do:
...
-tkdefs <cpp flags>             (default: none)
-tklibs <flags and libraries>   (default: determined automatically)
...

Find out where your Tcl stuff is installed and configure with the 
correct options. 

thanks
