In the interests of backwards compatibility, and to prevent any confusion, 
I say stick with the camel. So what if Perl has "copyrighted" this? To
prevent confusion, and maybe to get more advertising by being
controversial, we could resurrect Joe Camel. I don't endorse tobacco, 
but I think that the Joe Camel ads were really cool. 

In the same way, I love the expression "ultra-puissant" used in the
O'Reilly book for describing Caml , even though as Joshua Guttman
correctly pointed out puissant looks and sounds a lot like "piss ant",
which means "insignificant" in that dialect of American English spoken by
those who reside south of the Mason-Dixon line. Well, I think that's what
it means, I'm a damned Yankee and proud of it :-).
