Which parts of the Cygwin distribution are needed to use the Cygwin
version of Ocaml?  I started to download the whole Cygwin distribution,
but gave up because it was taking so long.  But the distribution is
available as separate components, so if I knew which components are
needed, I could just download those.

Dave.
