Subject: [Caml-list] faq? gc'd channels & finalize?

This must be an FAQ, but I can't find anything about it in the FAQ, the docs, and only a few messages on the caml list early last year...

File handles (channels) are not closed on garbage collection, right (my tests indicate they're not)?  Why is this (just because no guarantees can be made on when objects will be finalized)?  The docs warn against using finalization routines, so it seems like manually doing it (or using a wrapper function, which then has to catch and reraise exceptions) is the only way.
