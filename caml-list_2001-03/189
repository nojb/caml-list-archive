Something we should think about also for Ocaml

http://www.jelovic.com/articles/why_people_arent_using_haskell.htm

"What can be done about this? First and foremost the Haskell community must
make a standard distribution of Haskell that contains enough libraries to be
useful. That should include a regular expression library, an Internet
protocol library, a library for dealing with standard internet data and
encoding, a crypto library, a multimedia library and a GUI library.

Next, the Haskell community must step out of its research circles and start
publicizing Haskell to the practicing programmers. Write articles in DDJ and
similar publications. Publish real-world programs written in Haskell."

Most of this is also relevant for Ocaml, for example there are
crypto libraries and XML-support (for example PXP, which require wlex, which
is a hazzle).

I stumbled over Ocaml, thanks to Mercury and ICFP-contest.
