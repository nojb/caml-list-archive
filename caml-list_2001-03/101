BTW, to challenge your memory a bit more :-), was there a reason not to
integrate manifest module specifications along with "with module"? It
seems a bit odd that I can write

  sig
    module X : S
  end
  with module X = Y

and now even

  sig
    module X : S
    include sig module Y : T end with module Y = X
  end

but not simply

  sig
    module X : S = Y
  end

and

  sig
    module X : S
    module Y : T = X
  end

as for types.

I believe so as well, but up to now I was not able to come up with any.
If you have an interesting example, I would like to learn about it.

Cheers,

PS: The docs seem to be somewhat `conservative' on include for
signatures: they say the syntax is

	include modtype-path

but obviously it is the more general

	include module-type
