Thanks all for your interest in the CDK project.  We have started
looking at all the libraries which have been proposed for
contribution to the CDK. 

We have now to integrate them in the CDK environment, ie change the
Makefiles, remove duplicate code, move generic modules in a generic
library, etc...

In particular, for Jacques, it means that the contributed code must
not stay self-contained, as it was before, but be smoothly integrated
in the CDK environment. Thus, you will have to develop the package,
maybe in your own CVS repository, but as a part of the CDK ...

As a first step, we will release soon a beta release of the CDK, and a
set of rules for packages to be easily integrated, from the experience
we will gain from the first libraries ...

Best regards,

- Fabrice
