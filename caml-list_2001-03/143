Yes yes yes, I know this.  I'm saying I understand why I need to type
stuff if there's a difference betwen the .ml and .mli versions (hiding
stuff, restricting stuff, abstracting stuff), and that's fine.  I'm
asking why I need to retype stuff if it's identical.  Check out some
of the source code in the compiler, or any ocaml project I've seen
(the ICFP winners, whatever).  There are tons of really huge variants
that are just duplicated in mli and ml.  That seems bad, for the same
reason that typing a C++ function declaration 2 times is bad.
