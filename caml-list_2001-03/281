Indeed, when a label disappears you cannot commute anymore, and this
is a pain. I explained it in detail, but ...

No, no. Nothing decided yet.
What I was thinking of was having a special module Stdlabels for
die-hard labelers like you and me, so you would just have to do
"open Stdlabels" at the top of your files, and get all the current
labels in Pervasives, List, String and Array.
There are not many labels left in other modules anyway :-(
One could say that this is still two modes, but at least the semantics
is the same.

That's the most serious problem for me, and this is even why I first
devised this two-mode system a year ago, rather than using the
Stdlabels scheme. I hoped that people would enjoy ocamlbrowser like you
and me.
Surprisingly, they do not seem to use it that much... habits, lack of
advertisement ?

Cheers,

Jacques
