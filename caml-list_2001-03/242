	The main problem is that the Tutorial and Reference are weak.
If the Ocaml Consortium gets off the ground, this ought to be one
of it's first tasks (i.e., hire a tech writer, not a programmer!)

	I am constantly stumbling over syntax: even when the underlying
principles are clear, it is hard to find the right syntax, and it
is even harder to comprehend which constructions are actually
supported by the compiler. My main source of information is postings
to this list.

	No. It isn't so good for low level systems software, (use C or C++)
nor for integration tasks (use C). It should be much better than
Java for everything Java can do, if only library support were extended,
with some core support for security and internet.
