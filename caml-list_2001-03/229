He talks about how Perl's text processing is really not all that great, and he has a lot of good things to say.  Here's a snippet.  It would be a coup for Caml to have a module that supports some of these features before other languages:

However, the lack of a lot of key text-processing ingredients makes Perl solutions for many averagely complicated tasks either extremely slow, or not easier to maintain than solutions in other languages (and in some cases both).
