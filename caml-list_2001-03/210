Nice idea, but how do you handle dependencies, and configuration.
Notice also that many OSs/distribution have their own notion
of package, which they may prefer over a monolythic build.

Moving everything to findlib might be a good idea.

Of course I'm interested. Get anything you like from
http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/ocaml.html

Do you need to have all the code in your own CVS, or can we use a more
distributed approach ?

OK, the format used seems to differ a bit from the main ocaml
distribution, but this should be doable.
By the way, are labels a sufficient documentation for most functions ?

Best Regards,
