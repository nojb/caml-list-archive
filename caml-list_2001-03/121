                   2nd Scheme and Functional Programming

                    Florence, Italy, 2 Septembre 2001

            The workshop forms part of PLI 2001, which consists=20
            of the ICFP and PPDP conferences and other workshops.

Background and Theme:
---------------------

   Over the past few years, Scheme and its implementations have made
   tremendous progress in support of generative programming, shell
   scripting, COMponent support and distributed programming, graphics
   and GUI support, OO programming, and various other aspects of
   engineering real-world software. We are calling on implementors and
   users of Scheme systems to share their ideas at a 2nd Scheme worksho=
p=20
   during PLI 2001 in Florence.

   The organizers goal is to attract presentations on a broad spectrum
   of topics:

    * applications=20
    * environments=20
    * extensions=20
    * implementations=20
    * logics (predicate types)
    * programs

   The committee will consider submissions concerning Scheme and other
   functional languages (Erlang, Haskell, LISP, ML, Caml, etc.).

Submission details
------------------

   Deadline for submission:      15 June 2001 =20
=20
   The organizers seek two kinds of presentations:
  =20
    * regular: These presentations are like conventional workshop and
        conference presentation.

    * short: These presentations last up to 15 mins and are on
=09unconventional topics. Examples include unusual applications,
=09nifty Scheme programming tricks, ideas on implementations,
=09designs and requests for implementations, etc.
