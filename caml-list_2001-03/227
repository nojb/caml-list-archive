Hi: Rolf:
Here is a little example of an alternative to operate with complex numbers. The key is to define a complex a a duple and define new opertators to do computations, ie +! for addition -! for substraction *! /!...

let (+!) (xr, xi) (yr, yi) = (xr +. yr), (xi +. yi);;
let a = (1.0, 2.0);;
let b = (0.0, -4.75);;
let z = a +! b;;
z;;
val z : float * float = 1, -2.75

The same applies for sub, mpy and div ops.
hope this helps.

Best regards.
