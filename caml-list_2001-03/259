The rumour I heard was that the O'Reilly graphic designer decided on a
horse "because it's the French camel".  Why not, indeed.

You'll notice that the animal on the book cover is not one of those
fancy racing horses, but rather the kind of workhorses ("percheron"?)
that was used in European farms for centuries.

Maybe we should change the name of the language to "Objective
Percheron" to match the book cover :-)
