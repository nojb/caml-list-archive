An even longer time ago I asked about overloading and got a nice long
reply from Francois Rouaix, describing the history of overloading in Caml
and ending with something like "Jun Furuse is now working on it". You can
read about the latest incarnation of his work by going to 

http://pauillac.inria.fr/jfla/2001/actes/index.html

and downloading 

Generic Polymorphism in ML

which as you can guess is in English unlike his paper last year. 

I'd also love to know if and when this will make it into Ocaml since this
is one of the few things that I dislike about ML style languages and
even after quite a bit of Caml programming I still miss overloading.
