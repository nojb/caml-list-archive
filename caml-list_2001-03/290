I completely support Benjamin opinion. We have exactly the same kind of problems
with our students and it would be a real pain if they had to learn labels from the
start.

So, my only strong wish is to still be able to use OCAML without having to know
anything about labels.

Note : I still find labels useful, especially in GUI bindings. And this comment is
in noway a criticism of Jacques Garrigue excellent work.
