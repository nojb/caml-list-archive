Correct.

Currently, the "float" annotation works only for external functions
where the result and all parameters are of type "float".  Typically,
transcendental and trigonometric functions.  In this case, the
arguments and result are passed unboxed, as C "double" floats.  But it
doesn't work for functions that take / return a mixture of floats and
other data types.
