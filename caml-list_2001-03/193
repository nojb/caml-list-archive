And runs at one tenth the speed :-). I laughed at this since one of my
Caml-hating colleagues recently suggested to my manager (who reads
this list :) that we rewrite some Java code in a low level language like C 
or OCaml (!) for speed.

What have the issues been? I hate to mention this again (and again, ...) but 
I find that beginners and non-experts stumble over syntax a lot. Now, it is 
clear that Daniel De Rauglaudre is too shy and modest to mention his Revised 
syntax available with CamlP4. If your people have syntax problems (they do 
go away with familiarity IME) then check it out.

Yes, how is that coming? I hope that ugly horse can get replaced by a
beautiful dromedary.

This might be the kind of thing that the Consortium can help with. If
enough members want Windows they can kick in for an extensive thin binding 
to Windows services.

Two issues there. First is that some tool like findlib or the Python distutils 
should be part of the toolset. Second is that a big library structure like 
the SML Basis library would be helpful.

Agreed.

I would have said that it's ideal for VLSI design software (any other EDA
hackers out there?) so maybe it's just ideal for everything?

Santa Clara (which hasn't had any blackouts!) area but there was an
attempt at a NoCal OCaml users meeting. Maybe the participants can tell
you how it went. It's great to hear that the number of industrial OCaml 
programmers is growing!
