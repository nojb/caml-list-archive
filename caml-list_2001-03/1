Negative feedback (= bug reports) is only one kind of feedback. You
should definitely also get positive one so you might want to know that I
usually fetch a CVS-snapshot every few weeks, and I'd be happy if most
final releases of other software I use were only half as rock solid as
your CVS-snapshots... keep up with your good work! :-)
