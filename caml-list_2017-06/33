The main thing I find lacking in Ocsigen is documentation.

That, and (I suspect) some security issues.  I notice that the URLs it 
generates contain things like ../../../.. with march out of the main 
directory right out into the main file system.  Yes, it gets to the 
file I intended it to get to.  But it seems that an attacker could 
easily add things to that url to get at anything on the machine.

Or perhaps I just haven't found what's something blocking that?
