Subject: [Caml-list] *DEADLINE EXTENSION*: HVCS'17 - 4th Workshop on Horn
 Clauses for Verification and Synthesis

(apologies for multiple copies)

*DEADLINE EXTENSION - SUBMISSION OPEN UNTIL JUNE 18*


Call for Papers

4th Workshop on Horn Clauses for Verification and Synthesis (HCVS)
Affiliated with CADE 2017

August 7, 2017 - Gothenburg, Sweden

http://software.imdea.org/Conferences/hcvs17


Invited speakers: 

- Christoph Weidenbach, Max-Planck-Institut fuer Informatik
- Arie Gurfinkel, University of Waterloo 


Submission deadlines:

- Paper submission: *EXTENDED TO* June 18, 2017
- Paper notification: July 3, 2017
- Workshop: August 7, 2017 


Many Program Verification and Synthesis problems of interest can be
modeled directly using Horn clauses, and many recent advances in the
CLP and CAV communities have centered around efficiently solving
problems presented as Horn clauses.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers working in the
communities of Constraint/Logic Programming (e.g., ICLP and CP),
Program Verification (e.g., CAV, TACAS, and VMCAI), and Automated
Deduction (e.g., CADE), on the topic of Horn clause based analysis,
verification and synthesis.

Horn clauses for verification and synthesis have been advocated by
these communities at different times and from different perspectives,
and this workshop is organized to stimulate interaction and a fruitful
exchange and integration of experiences.

The workshop follows three previous meetings: HCVS 2016 in Eindhoven,
The Netherlands (w/ETAPS), HCVS 2015 in San Francisco, CA, USA
(w/CAV), and HCVS 2014 in Vienna, Austria (w/VSL).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the use of Horn
clauses, constraints, and related formalisms in the following areas:

- Analysis and verification of programs and systems of various kinds
  (e.g., imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic, higher-order,
  concurrent)
- Program synthesis
- Program testing
- Program transformation
- Constraint solving
- Type systems
- Case studies and tools
- Challenging problems

We solicit regular papers describing theory and implementation of
Horn-clause based analysis and tool descriptions. We also solicit
extended abstracts describing work-in-progress, as well as
presentations covering previously published results that are of
interest to the workshop.

Submission has to be done in one of the following formats:

- Regular papers (up to 12 pages plus bibliography, typeset in EPTCS
  format), which should present previously unpublished work (completed
  or in progress), including descriptions of research, tools, and
  applications.

- Extended abstracts (up to 3 pages in EPTCS format), which describe
  work in progress or aim to initiate discussions.

- Presentation-only papers, i.e., papers already submitted or
  presented at a conference or another workshop. Such papers can be
  submitted in any format, and will not be included in the workshop
  post-proceedings.

All submitted papers will be refereed by the program committee and
will be selected for inclusion in accordance with the referee
reports. Accepted regular papers and extended abstracts will be
published electronically as a volume in the Electronic Proceedings in
Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) series, see http://www.eptcs.org/

Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of
them will be present at the workshop. Papers must be submitted through
the EasyChair system using the web page:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcvs2017.
