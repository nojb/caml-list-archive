Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the application of systematic,
disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, use,
deployment, and maintenance of software languages. The term "software
language" is used broadly, and includes: general-purpose programming
languages; domain-specific languages (e.g. BPMN, Simulink, Modelica);
modeling and metamodeling languages (e.g. SysML and UML); data models
and ontologies (e.g. XML-based and OWL-based languages and
vocabularies).

### Important Dates

Mon 23 Oct - Tue 24 Oct 2017 - SLE Conference

### Topics of Interest

SLE aims to be broad-minded and inclusive about relevance and scope.
We solicit high-quality contributions in areas ranging from
theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques, and
frameworks in the domain of language engineering. Topics relevant to
SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather
than aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is
interested in principled engineering approaches and techniques in the
following areas:

* Language Design and Implementation
   * Approaches and methodologies for language design
   * Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints)
   * Techniques for behavioral / executable semantics
   * Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation)
   * Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches

* Language Validation
   * Verification and formal methods for languages
   * Testing techniques for languages
   * Simulation techniques for languages

* Language Integration and Composition
   * Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools
   * Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages)
   * Traceability between languages
   * Deployment of languages to different platforms

* Language Maintenance
   * Software language reuse
   * Language evolution
   * Language families and variability

* Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design,
implementation, validation, maintenance)

* Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools
   * User studies evaluating usability
   * Performance benchmarks
   * Industrial applications

### Types of Submissions

* **Research papers**: These should report a substantial research
contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or
both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages including
bibliography in ACM SIGPLAN acmart conference style
(http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

* **Tool papers**: Because of SLE's interest in tools, we seek papers
that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection
criteria include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and
relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate
areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool
description of 4 pages including bibliography in ACM SIGPLAN acmart
conference style (http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/), and a
demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6 pages. Tool
demonstrations must have the keywords =E2=80=9CTool Demo=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=
=9CTool
Demonstration=E2=80=9D in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if t=
he
demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-page
demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for
evaluating the submission.

* **Industrial papers**: These should describe real-world application
scenarios of SLE in industry, explained in their context with an
analysis of the challenges that were overcome and the lessons which
the audience can learn from this experience. Industry paper
submissions must not exceed 6 pages including bibliography in ACM
SIGPLAN acmart conference style
(http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

* **New ideas / vision papers**: New ideas papers should describe new,
non-conventional SLE research approaches that depart from standard
practice. They are intended to describe well-defined research ideas
that are at an early stage of investigation. Vision papers are
intended to present new unifying theories about existing SLE research
that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches.
New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages including
bibliography in ACM SIGPLAN acmart conference style
(http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

### Artifact evaluation

SLE will for the second year use an evaluation process for assessing
the quality of artifacts on which papers are based. The aim of this
evaluation process is to foster a culture of experimental
reproducibility as well as a higher quality in the research area as a
whole.

Authors of papers accepted for SLE 2017 will be invited to submit
artifacts. Any kind of artifact that is presented in the paper,
supplements the paper with further details, or underlies the paper can
be submitted. This includes, for instance, tools, grammars,
metamodels, models, programs, algorithms, scripts, proofs, datasets,
statistical tests, checklists, surveys, interview scripts,
visualizations, annotated bibliographies, and tutorials.

The submitted artifacts will be reviewed by a dedicated Artifact
Evaluation Committee (AEC). Artifacts that live up to the expectations
created by the paper will receive a badge of approval from the AEC.
The approved artifacts will be invited for inclusion in the electronic
conference proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. This will
ensure the permanent and durable storage of the artifacts alongside
the published papers fostering the repeatability of experiments,
enabling precise comparison with alternative approaches, and helping
the dissemination of the author=E2=80=99s ideas in detail.

Participating in the artifact evaluation and publishing approved
artifacts in the ACM Digital Library is voluntary. However, we
strongly encourage authors to consider this possibility as the
availability of artifacts will greatly benefit readers of papers and
increase the impact of the work. Note that the artifact evaluation
cannot affect the acceptance of the paper, because it only happens
after the decision about acceptance has been made.

### Publications

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee. All accepted papers, including tool papers,
industrial papers and new ideas / vision papers will be published in
ACM Digital Library.

Selected accepted papers will be invited to a special issue of the
Computer Languages, Systems and Structures (COMLAN) journal.

### Awards

* **Distinguished paper**: Award for most notable paper, as determined
by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the program
committee.

* **Distinguished reviewer**: Award for distinguished reviewer, as
determined by the PC chairs using feedback from the authors.

* **Distinguished artifact**: Award for the artifact most
significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs
based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee.
