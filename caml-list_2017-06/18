FreeBSD ports still only has opam 1.2.0:
https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=opam&stype=all.  DragonFly may
be in the same boat, since, IIRC the ports collection is shared between the
two.   Also, what about pkgsrc?

The opam-2.x/master's "cold" target "just worked" for me when I tried it on
FreeBSD (after a tiny patch that has already been merged), so I am
optimistic that producing an updated port for FreeBSD is mostly a matter of
going through the motions.  One annoyance is that well-behaved ports are
only supposed to access network during the "fetch" stage, so one would need
to replicate in the FreeBSD port's Makefile the targets from the opam
source tree that download various things during opam's build (I think it's
mostly things in src_ext).  That isn't an insurmountable obstacle, by any
means, but just a bit of work that needs to be done.

<br>
### Why deprecate opam 1.2.0<br>
<br>
OPAM 1.2.0 was released in October 2014, and saw rapid uptake from the comm=
unity.=C2=A0 We did some rapid bugfixing to solve common problems, and OPAM=
 1.2.2 was released in April 2015.=C2=A0 Since then, 1.2.2 has been a very =
solid release and has been the stable version in use to date.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, part of the bugfixes in the 1.2.2 series resulted in an `opa=
m` file format that is not fully backwards compatible with the 1.2.0 syntax=
, and the net effect is that users of 1.2.0 now see a broken package reposi=
tory.=C2=A0 Our CI tests for new packages regularly fail on 1.2.0, even if =
they succeed on 1.2.2 and higher.<br>
<br>
As we prepare the plan for [1.2.2 -&gt; 2.0 migration](<a href=3D"https://g=
ithub.com/ocaml/opam/issues/2918" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">http=
s://github.com/<wbr>ocaml/opam/issues/2918</a>), it is clear that we need a=
 &quot;one-in one-out&quot; policy on releases in order to preserve the ove=
rall health of the package repository -- maintaining three separate release=
s and formats of the repository is not practical.=C2=A0 Therefore the 1.2.0=
 release needs to be actively deprecated, and we could use some help from t=
he community to make this happen.<br>
<br>
### Who is still using opam 1.2.0?<br>
<br>
I found that the Debian Jessie (stable) release includes 1.2.0, and this is=
 probably the last major distribution including it.=C2=A0 The [Debian Stret=
ch](<a href=3D"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStretch" rel=3D"noreferrer" ta=
rget=3D"_blank">https://wiki.debian.<wbr>org/DebianStretch</a>) is due to b=

re if so, and we should move them away.<br>
<br>
### How do we deprecate it?<br>
<br>
Due to the format changes happening in a minor version, it&#39;s a bit diff=
icult to give opam 1.2.0 users a smooth transition experience, to my knowle=
dge (Louis Gesbert or Thomas Gazagnaire may correct me here).=C2=A0 I would=
 propose:<br>
<br>
