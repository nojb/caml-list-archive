Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.04.2


Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Alan Turing by
announcing the release of OCaml version 4.04.2.

This minor release fixes the security issue described in
CVE-2017-9772 (included below).

All users should eventually upgrade to 4.04.2 from 4.04.0 and 4.04.1.
Any user who produces setuid programs with OCaml should read the CVE
and upgrade immediately.

It is available as an OPAM switch, or as a source download here:
  https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.04/
  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.04.2.tar.gz

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.


OCaml 4.04.2 (23 Jun 2017):
---------------------------

### Security fix:

- PR#7557: Local privilege escalation issue with ocaml binaries.
  (Damien Doligez, report by Eric Milliken, review by Xavier Leroy)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

CVE-2017-9772: Privilege escalation in OCaml runtime for SUID executables

The environment variables CAML_CPLUGINS, CAML_NATIVE_CPLUGINS, and
CAML_BYTE_CPLUGINS can be used to auto-load code into any ocamlopt-compiled
executable or any ocamlc-compiled executable in =E2=80=98custom runtime mod=
e=E2=80=99.
This can lead to privilege escalation if the executable is marked setuid.

Vulnerable versions: OCaml 4.04.0 and 4.04.1

Workarounds:
   - Upgrade to OCaml 4.04.2 or higher.
or - Compile the OCaml distribution with the "-no-cplugins" configure optio=
n.
or - OPAM users can "opam update && opam switch recompile 4.04.1", as
     the repository has had backported patches applied.

Impact: This only affects binaries that have been installed on Unix-like
operating systems (including Linux and macOS) with the setuid bit set.
However, in that situation, any user who execute the program gains all
the privileges of the owner of the executable (meaning that root-owned
setuid executables provide root access).

Fix: OCaml 4.04.2 mitigates this by modifying Sys.getenv and Unix.getenv
to raise an exception if the process has ever had elevated privileges.
The OCaml runtime has also been modified to use this function for
retrieving all of the runtime environment variables which could potentially
cause files to be accessed or modified.  The older behaviour is available
in Sys.unsafe_getenv for applications that require strict compatibility.
