Thank you all for the helpful feedback. Since there have been no more messa=
ges or objections, I have started the process off here:

https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/9477 <https://github.com/ocam=
l/opam-repository/pull/9477>

When I merge it, I will also update opam.ocaml.org <http://opam.ocaml.org/>=
 with a deprecation notice.  If you do spot any distributions packaging opa=
m 1.2.0, please do feel free to contact them to request an upgrade to a sup=
ported release such as 1.2.2.

regards,
Anil=
