It's predictable.

Closing a channel is not only about releasing OS resources. Imagine the=20=
=20
channel is actually a pipe - closing it means to signal EOF, i.e. it's=20=
=20
a way of notifying another program about an event. This should not=20=20
happen behind one's back.

Closing a regular file would in deed be harmless, but there is no=20=20
generic way to identify such channels (in the OS).
