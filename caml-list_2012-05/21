We take this opportunity to remind you that IJCAR 2012 is part of the 
Alan Turing Year, and is held immediately after

        The Alan Turing Centenary Conference
        http://www.turing100.manchester.ac.uk/

It is expected that Manchester will be a busy place during these meetings, 
so please try to register and book your hotels early. You will find some 
accommodation suggestions at the IJCAR website.

We are grateful to generous sponsors of IJCAR 2012
