Subject: [Caml-list] Summer School on Functional Programming for Parallel and Concurrent Applications

Dear all,

[Even if the lectures focus on Haskell, this summer school might be of
interest to readers of the caml-list.]

I am happy to annouce the CEA-EDF-INRIA summer school on

                     FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
            FOR PARALLEL AND CONCURRENT APPLICATIONS

11-22 June 2012, Castle of Cadarache, Saint Paul Lez Durance, France

         http://www-hpc.cea.fr/SummerSchools2012-CS.htm

Objectives

The aim of the summer school is to give a thorough and application-
oriented introduction to functional programming using the programming
language Haskell. A special focus is on parallel and concurrent
programming, highlighting the ways in which features such as strong
typing and purity make it dramatically easier to write reliable
parallel or concurrent code. The school is split into three different
courses that highlight different aspects of functional
programming. All courses consist of lectures and hands-on sessions
where everyone can try out the language on several exercises.

Public

This school is a 2 weeks course for engineers, and for students and
researchers. Participants should be familiar with programming (e.g. in
C or Java), but the school will be self-contained and no preliminary
knowledge of functional programing is required.

Speakers

Ralf Hinze (Oxford University)
Andres Löh (Well-Typed)
Simon Marlow (Microsoft Research)

Talks (to be confirmed)

Joe Armstrong, Mark Shinwell, Anil Madhavapeddy.
