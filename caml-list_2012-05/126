TBH we switched libguestfs hosting to github about 5 months ago, and
I'm not too happy with it.  Pull requests turn into merges (ie.
non-linear history) which I particularly dislike.

But there are lots of git hosting places, including the option of
setting up git hosting at INRIA -- it's very easy to setup and
maintain.

That's not the point though.  The point is that git is just *far
better* than SVN.  And also (compared to other VCS), git won.  Let's
get over it.
