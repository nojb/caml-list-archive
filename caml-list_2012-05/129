Seriously, what kind of maintenance a Git repository does require?
Just create a unix group, create a bare shared repo, and have fun.

Besides, they are already maintaining (somehow, dunno the details) an
svn repository. Maintaining a git repo isn't harderâ€¦

anyway, it is not said that they will switch to git anyway :) I'd be
happy if they do, but it is not my call. iirc, it has been considered
when they moved away from cvs and they didn't choose it. i'm not sure
how much the situation changed since then (for the core team).
