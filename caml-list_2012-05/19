Subject: [Caml-list] AISec 2012: Call for Papers

(Apologies if you receive this message multiple times!)


=========================================================================
CALL FOR PAPERS
5th ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec)
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/aisec2012/default.aspx
Held in Conjunction with ACM CCS 2012
October 19, 2012
Sheraton Raleigh, NC, USA
=========================================================================

The applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data
mining for security and privacy problems continues to grow. One recent 
trend is the growth of Big Data Analytics and the establishment of 
Security Information and Event Management systems built to obtain 
security intelligence and situational awareness. With the advent of 
cloud computing, every advantage the cloud offers, such as large-scale 
machine learning and data-driven abuse detection, is being leveraged to 
improve security. We invite original research papers describing the use 
of AI or machine learning in security and privacy problems. We also 
invite position and open problem papers discussing the role of AI or 
machine learning in security and privacy. Submitted papers of these 
types may not substantially overlap papers that have been published 
previously or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or 
conference/workshop proceedings. Finally we welcome a new 
systematization of knowledge category of papers this year, which should 
distill the AI or machine learning contributions of a previously 
published series of security papers.

Regular research, systematization of knowledge, and open/position paper
submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (note: 
pages must be numbered) excluding the bibliography and well-marked 
appendices, and at most 12 pages overall. Committee members are not 
required to read the appendices, so the paper should be intelligible 
without them. Submissions need not be anonymized. We recommend the use 
of the ACM SIG Proceedings templates for submissions. The ACM format is 
the required template for the camera-ready version. Accepted papers will 
be published by the ACM Digital Library and/or ACM Press.

Submissions can be made through EasyChair using the following link:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aisec2012


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
• Adversarial Learning
• Robust Statistics
• Online Learning
• Computer Forensics
• Spam detection
• Botnet detection
• Intrusion detection
• Malware identification
• Big data analytics for security
• Adaptive side-channel attacks
• Privacy-preserving data mining
• Design and analysis of CAPTCHAs
• Phishing detection and prevention
• AI approaches to trust and reputation
• Vulnerability testing through intelligent probing (e.g. fuzzing)
• Content-driven security policy management & access control
• Techniques and methods for generating training and test sets
• Anomalous behavior detection (e.g. for the purposes of fraud 
prevention, authentication)


Schedule
Submissions due: July 16, 2012 (23:59 PDT)
Acceptance notification: August 13, 2012
Final manuscript due: August 24, 2012
Workshop date: October 19, 2012
