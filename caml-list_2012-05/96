*****************************************************************

Third International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics, and Formal
Verification
Napoli, Italy, September 6th-8th, 2012

http://www.gandalf.unina.it

Co-located with GAMES 2012

      ******************************************************
      |         CALL FOR PAPERS (EXTENDED DEADLINE)        |
      ******************************************************


OBJECTIVES

The aim of the symposium is to bring together researchers from academia
and industry which are actively working in the fields of Games, Automata,
Logics, and Formal Verification. The idea is to cover an ample spectrum of
themes, ranging from theory to applications, and stimulate
cross-fertilization. Papers focused on formal methods are especially
welcome. Authors are invited to submit original research or tool papers on
all relevant topics in these areas.
Papers discussing new ideas that are at an early stage of development are
also welcome.

LIST OF TOPICS

The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to, the
following:

Automata Theory
Automated Deduction
Computational aspects of Game Theory
Concurrency and Distributed computation
Decision Procedures
Deductive, Compositional, and Abstraction Techniques for Verification
Finite Model Theory
First-order and Higher-order Logics
Formal Languages
Formal Methods for Complex Systems (e.g., Interactive Systems, Systems
Biology)
Games and Automata for Verification
Game Semantics
Hybrid, Embedded, and Mobile Systems Verification
Logical aspects of Computational Complexity
Logics of Programs
Modal and Temporal Logics
Model Checking
Models of Reactive and Real-Time Systems
Program Analysis and Software Verification
Run-time Verification and Testing
Specification and Verification of Finite and Infinite-state Systems
Synthesis


CO-LOCATED EVENT

GAMES 2012, Annual Workshop of the ESF Networking Programme on Games for
Design and Verification (http://www.games.unina.it/).


INVITED SPEAKERS

Alberto Policriti (University of Udine, Italy).
Moreover, we plan to have joint invited speakers with the co-located
GAMES meeting.

PAPER SUBMISSION

Submitted papers should not exceed fourteen (14) pages using EPTCS format,
be unpublished and contain original research. For papers reporting
experimental results, authors are encouraged to make their data available
with their submission.
Submissions must be in PDF or PS format and will be handled via EasyChair.

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission               May 16, 2012 (EXTENDED)
Paper submission                  May 22, 2012 (EXTENDED)
Acceptance notification           June 27, 2012
Final version                     July 15, 2012
Conference                        September 6-8, 2012


PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings will be published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical
Computer Science.
A special issue of a major international journal to publish an extended
and revised version of the best symposium papers is also under
consideration. Revised versions of the selected papers from the previous
editions lead to two special issues of the International Journal of
Foundation of Computer Science and of Theoretical Computer Science,
respectively.
