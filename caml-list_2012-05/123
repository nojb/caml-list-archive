Subject: [Caml-list] [fm-announcements] NASA/NIA PVS Class 2012

NASA/NIA PVS Class October 9-12, 2012

The Formal Methods teams at the NASA Langley Research Center and the
National Institute of Aerospace are offering a short course on the PVS
theorem prover in the fall of 2012. The class will take place October 9-12
in Hampton, Virginia:

  http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/PVSClass2012

The course is offered free of charge as a public service to the formal
methods community. The class is open to all interested individuals.
However, seats are limited and all attendees must register at

http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/PVSClass2012/registration.html

We emphasize a hands-on, immersion-style learning approach. Both
lecturematerial and in-class exercises using PVS are featured. For this
reason,
we strongly encourage attendees to bring a laptop equipped to run PVS. All
the instructors are members of the NASA Langley Formal Methods group and
expert PVS users. The PVS Class 2012 will feature a technical lecture and
an invited talk by Sam Owre, one of the creators of PVS and its main
developer.

  Cesar Munoz (Cesar.A.Munoz@nasa.gov),
