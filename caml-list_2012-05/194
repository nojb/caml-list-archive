We take this opportunity to remind you that IJCAR 2012 is part of the
Alan Turing Year, and is held immediately after

        The Alan Turing Centenary Conference
        http://www.turing100.manchester.ac.uk/

It is expected that Manchester will be a busy place during these meetings,
so please try to register and book your hotels early. You will find some
accommodation suggestions at the IJCAR website.

We are grateful to generous sponsors of IJCAR 2012
* The University of Manchester
* Artificial Intelligence Journal
* Microsoft Research
