                       HLDVT 2012

IEEE International High-Level Design, Validation and Test Workshop

                 http://www.hldvt.com/12/



        Huntington Beach, California, November 9-10, 2012

***************************************************************



The seventeenth annual workshop HLDVT 2012 aims to bring together a communi=
ty of researchers in the areas of design, validation, and test. The worksho=
p addresses the integration of multiple functions on-chip at higher levels =
of design abstraction, and the techniques and methodologies for modeling, a=
nalyzing, and validating such systems.  In particular, the workshop has bec=
ome a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the practic=
al issues associated with validation of extremely large designs.


The topics of interest include (but not limited to):

=EF Simulation-Based Validation
=EF Formal Verification and Hybrid Methods
=EF Design Abstraction & Behavioral Modeling
=EF Error Trace Interpretation and Debugging
=EF On-Chip and Core-Based Testing
=EF Test Generation for Defects, Design Errors, and Delay
=EF Hardware/Software and Mixed-signal System Co-Validation
=EF Emulation and Prototyping
=EF Post-silicon Validation and Debug


Paper Submission: The ProgramCommittee invites authors to submit papers not=
 to
exceed 8 pages (IEEE two-column conference format with 10pt minimum font si=
ze)
describing original and unpublished work. Panels and special session propos=
als are
also invited. All submissions must be made electronically in PDF format usi=
ng
the paper submission webpage: http://www.hldvt.com/submissions . Please
ensure that all the required contact details are entered during online subm=
ission.

Paper Publication and Presenter Registration: The submission of a paper or
panel proposal will be considered as evidence that upon acceptance, the aut=
hor(s)
will present their paper. For the papers to appear in the program and proce=
edings,
required is at least one full workshop registration by an author before the=
 submission
of camera-ready version. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from
distribution (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented=
 at the
workshop.

Submission deadline: June 24, 2012

Acceptance Notification: August 10, 2012

Final manuscript: September 9, 2012

Questions regarding paper submissions and the program may be addressed
to the program chair: Samar Abdi, programchair@hldvt.com.
Other questions may be addressed to the general chair: Prab Varma,
generalchair@hldvt.com. Additional pertinent information will be made
