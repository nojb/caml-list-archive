Because the filehandles are ressources from the system,
not just something like a value inside the users code,
I think this should not be done implicitly.

The already mentioned side effects with Pipes are one
reason. I remember the discussion was on this list
many years before, and there were mentioned more reasons
on why this should be done explicitly.


So, doing it explicitly is fine.

Other languages with GC also handle this case explicitly,
and surely not because the designers just forgot about it.
