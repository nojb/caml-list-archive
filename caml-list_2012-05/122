It's a trimslice, running what Fedora calls armv7hl.tegra.

I don't want to say this is a real bug yet, because I'm actually using
a version of your code which I backported onto 3.12.1 myself -- not
realizing there was already a tree you wrote that contained that.  In
any case I need to test again with the upstream OCaml from SVN
(why-oh-why doesn't OCaml use git!)
