I don't think so, I have the same problem; and that's just one example of a wrong identation pattern with typerex. It is unfortunately based on the completely broken tuareg-mode (which for reasons that are unknown to me seems to be preferred by many ocaml programmers to the better mode provided by the distribution). A reimplementation of the indentation engine is however planned :

Best,
