Roberto di cosmo's IRILL maybe: http://www.irill.org/

Also, for OASIS, as the project is under LGPL,
maybe you can get it accepted as an official FSF project,
then the project can receive targeted donations I think.

For ocamlforge, maybe you should list on a specific page if you accept 
donations like hardware, licenses for proprietary software or else
(and maybe how to send money some day).

Also, if donating is more complex than clicking a button,
the donation rate will be low I guess.
