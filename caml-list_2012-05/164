Subject: [Caml-list] Tuareg-mode and pipes |

Hi list,

About two years ago, the following bug was reported:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=659&group_id=43&atid=255

If you don't want to click, here is the issue. Tuareg indents 
pattern-matching like this:

match x with
   | Bla ->
     hello

But the previous behavior of Tuareg, which I prefer, was:

match x with
   | Bla ->
       hello

I have occasionally been updating my tuareg-mode, looking forward for 
this "tuareg-pipe-indent" variable (see the comments in the bug report), 
while patiently re-indenting pattern-matching by hand. But this 
variable, or any similar variable, never appeared.

After two years, I'm becoming suspicious that something went wrong. Does 
anybody know what happened to the patch? Or how I can get my preferred 
behavior back?

A related question is the following. I read here a few weeks ago a claim 
that the caml-mode was much better than the tuareg-mode. I was not able 
to find a comparison between these two modes, to support this claim, nor 
whether the caml-mode would fix the pipe behavior for me. Any comment 
here would be appreciated.

Cheers,

--
