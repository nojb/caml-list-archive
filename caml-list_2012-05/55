Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] findlib-1.3.0

Thanks for the good work!

Just a remark: I have sometimes considered sending a bug report for
findlib (actually each time the bug was in another place), and did not
know where to send them. On the (otherwise excellently polished)
camlcity wepages there is never any mention of a bug reporting
process. No bug tracker, no mailing list, etc.

What is the recommended process to report issues? Send them to the
caml-list (as is often done), or send them privately to yourself (as I
assume it must also be done)? It would be good if you made that
information available on the webpage.
