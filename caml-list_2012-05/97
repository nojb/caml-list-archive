                           CALL FOR PAPERS

                              FHPC 2012

                       ACM SIGPLAN Workshop
                                 on
               Functional High Performance Computing

                          Copenhagen, Denmark
                          September 15th, 2012

                     http://www.hiperfit.dk/fhpc12/

 Co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming
                              (ICFP 2012)
========================================================================


The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level) programming
technology in application domains where large-scale computations arise
naturally and high performance is essential. Such computations would
typically -- but not necessarily -- involve execution on highly parallel
systems ranging from multi-core multi-processor systems to graphics
accelerators (GPGPUs), reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), large-scale
compute clusters or any combination thereof. It is becoming apparent
that radically new and well founded methodologies for programming such
systems are required to address their inherent complexity and to
reconcile execution performance with programming productivity.

The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results, experiences,
and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative specifications of
computationally challenging problems can serve as highly transparent,
maintainable, and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.

The 2012 FHPC workshop comes with a particular theme motivated by
geographic co-location with the newly established HIPERFIT Research
Centre for Functional High-Performance Computing for Financial
Information Technology (www.hiperfit.dk) at the University of
Copenhagen. Hence, we particularly encourage submissions with a
background in computational finance. Notwithstanding, the workshop
welcomes submissions from other application domains as much as
general-purpose work on the theory and practice of declarative
approaches to high-performance computing.


Proceedings:
============

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital Library.

* Submission Deadline:  6th June 2012, anywhere on earth
* Author Notification: 27th June 2012
* Final Papers Due   : 10th July 2012

Submitted papers must be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
according to the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (double column, 9pt format).
See http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm for more information
and style files. The page limit is 12 pages. Any paper submitted must
adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy. Submission deadlines and
page limit are firm.


Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC programme, see its web page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).
