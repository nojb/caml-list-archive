Subject: [Caml-list] [fm-announcements] Call For Papers: RV 2012


International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV 2012)
September 25 - 28, 2012
Istanbul, Turkey
at the Koc University Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations in Pera

  http://rv2012.ku.edu.tr

SCOPE

Runtime verification is concerned with monitoring and analysis of
software and hardware system executions. Runtime verification
techniques are crucial for system correctness and reliability; they
are significantly more powerful and versatile than conventional
testing, and more practical than exhaustive formal
verification. Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment,
for verification and debugging purposes, and after deployment for
ensuring reliability, safety and security, and for providing fault
containment and recovery. Topics of interest to the conference
include:

- specification languages and formalisms for traces
- specification mining
- program instrumentation
- monitor construction techniques
- logging, recording, and replay
- fault detection, localization, recovery and repair
- program steering and adaptation
- metrics and statistical information gathering
- combination of static and dynamic analyses
- program execution visualization

Application areas of runtime verification include safety-critical
systems ranging from enterprise and systems software, to autonomous
and reactive control systems, to health management and diagnosis
systems, to security.

HISTORY

The RV series of events started in 2001, as an annual workshop. The
RV'01 to RV'05 proceedings were published in ENTCS. Since 2006, the RV
proceedings have been published in LNCS. In year 2010, RV became an
international conference. Links to past RV events can be found at the
permanent URL http://runtime-verification.org.

INVITED SPEAKERS

- Jim Larus (Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research)
- Martin Rinard (Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT)
- Giovanni Vigna (Professor, Department of Computer Science, UCSB)

INVITED TUTORIALS

- Stephen N. Freund, John Erickson and Madan Musuvathi: Dynamic analysis of concurrency
- Cristian Cadar and Koushik Sen: Symbolic execution

PAPER SUBMISSION

RV will have three paper categories: regular and short papers, and tool
demonstration papers. Papers in all categories will be reviewed by the
conference Program Committee.

- Regular papers (up to 15 pages) should present original unpublished
results. Applications of runtime verification are particularly
welcome. A Best Paper Award will be offered.

- Short papers (up to 5 pages) may present novel but not necessarily
thoroughly worked out ideas, for example emerging runtime verification
techniques and applications, or techniques and applications that
establish relationships between runtime verification and other
domains. Accepted short papers will be presented in special short talk
(5-10 minutes) and poster sessions.

- Tool demonstration papers (up to 5 pages) should briefly introduce
the problem solved by the tool and give the outline of the
demonstration. A Best Tool Award will be offered.

All accepted papers, including short papers and tool papers, will appear
in the LNCS proceedings. Submitted papers must use the LNCS style. At
least one author of each accepted paper must attend RV'12 to present the
paper. Papers must be submitted electronically using the EasyChair system.
A link to the electronic submission page will be made available on the
RV'12 web page.
