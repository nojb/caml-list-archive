DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP:

It has been understood since the late 1960s that tools and structures
arising in mathematical logic and proof theory can usefully be applied
to the design of high level programming languages, and to the
development of reasoning principles for such languages. Yet low level
languages, such as machine code, and the compilation of high level
languages into a low level ones have traditionally been seen as having
little or no essential connection to logic.

However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been that low
level languages are also governed by logical principles. From this key
observation has emerged an active and fascinating new research area at
the frontier of logic and computer science. The practically-motivated
design of logics reflecting the structure of low level languages (such
as heaps, registers and code pointers) and low level properties of
programs (such as resource usage) goes hand in hand with the some of
the most advanced contemporary researches in semantics and proof
theory, including classical realizability and forcing, double
orthogonality, parametricity, linear logic, game semantics,
uniformity, categorical semantics, explicit substitutions, abstract
machines, implicit complexity and sublinear programming.

The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together
researchers interested in the various aspects of the relationship
between logic and low level languages and programs. LOLA is an
informal workshop aiming at a high degree of useful interaction
amongst the participants.
