I think it is a good idea. Though, OASIS itself is just time consuming for
me. I'd prefer to receive some money for the forge, for which I have to pay
something.

But for reason related to my current job, I cannot receive money directly.
It will be better for me to have some kind of umbrella non-profit
organization to which I can ask to buy things (like a Windows license for
setting up a Windows build slave).

Regards
Sylvain
