Subject: [Caml-list] ML2012: Second Call For Presentations

The submission deadline for ML2012 is approaching (next Monday, 
2012-06-04), but given the submission format, it's not too late.
Please consider submitting a presentation proposal!

=======================================================================
CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML
Thursday, September 13th, 2012, Copenhagen, Denmark
(co-located with ICFP)

http://www.lexifi.com/ml2012
=======================================================================

The ML family of programming languages includes dialects known as
Standard ML, OCaml, and F#.  These languages have inspired a large
amount of computer-science research, both practical and theoretical.
This workshop aims to provide a forum where users, developers and
researchers of ML languages and related technology can interact and
discuss ongoing research, open problems and innovative applications.

The format of ML 2012 will continue the return in 2010 and 2011 to a
more informal model: a workshop with presentations selected from
submitted abstracts.  The workshop will not publish proceedings, so
any contributions may be submitted for publication elsewhere.  We hope
that this format will encourage the presentation of exciting (if
unpolished) research and deliver a lively workshop atmosphere.


SCOPE
-----

We seek research presentations on topics related to ML, including but
not limited to

   * applications: case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.
   * extensions: higher forms of polymorphism, generic programming,
     objects, concurrency, distribution and mobility, semi-structured
     data handling, etc.
   * type systems: inference, effects, overloading, modules, contracts,
     specifications and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting, etc.
   * implementation: compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial
     evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, etc.
   * environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language
     interoperability, functional data structures, etc.
   * semantics: operational, denotational, program equivalence,
     parametricity, mechanization, etc.

Three kinds of submissions will be accepted: Research Presentations,
Experience Reports and Demos.

   * Research Presentations: Research presentations should describe new
     ideas, experimental results, significant advances in ML-related
     projects, or informed positions regarding proposals for
     next-generation ML-style languages.  We especially encourage
     presentations that describe work in progress, that outline a
     future research agenda, or that encourage lively discussion.
     These presentations should be structured in a way which can be, at
     least in part, of interest to (advanced) users.

   * Experience Reports: Users are invited to submit Experience Reports
     about their use of ML languages. These presentations do not need
     to contain original research but they should tell an interesting
     story to researchers or other advanced users, such as an
     innovative or unexpected use of advanced features or a description
     of the challenges they are facing or attempting to solve.

   * Demos: Live demonstrations or short tutorials should show new
     developments, interesting prototypes, or work in progress, in the
     form of tools, libraries, or applications built on or related to
     ML.  (Please note that you will need to provide all the hardware
     and software required for your demo; the workshop organizers are
     only able to provide a projector.)

Each presentation should take 20-25 minutes, except demos, which
should take 10-15 minutes.  The exact time will be decided based on
the number of accepted submissions.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------

Submissions should be at most two pages, in PDF format, and printable
on US Letter or A4 sized paper. Submissions longer than a half a page
should include a one-paragraph synopsis suitable for inclusion in the
workshop program.

Submissions must be uploaded to the following website before the
submission deadline (2012-06-04):

   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ml2012

For any question concerning the scope of the workshop or the
submission process, please contact the program chair
(alain@frisch.fr).
