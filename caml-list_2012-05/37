Subject: [Caml-list] CiE 2012: Turing Centenary Conference, Cambridge - Final Call for Presentations

**********************************************************************
FINAL CALL FOR INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS - DEADLINE MAY 11th, 2012:

                    TURING CENTENARY CONFERENCE
                       http://www.cie2012.eu

         Computability in Europe 2012: How the World Computes
                      University of Cambridge
                     Cambridge, 18-23 June 2012

CiE 2012 is one of three major international Turing Centenary Celebrations. 
CiE 2012 offers researchers an opportunity to actively participate in 
this remarkable year of activities. 

SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS OF INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS are invited with a 
deadline of MAY 11th 2012. 

For submission details, see:
http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/WScie12/give-page.php?12

Authors will be notified of acceptance, usually within two weeks of
submission.

All accepted papers become eligible for consideration for post-conference
journals: COMPUTABILITY will consider journal versions of papers presented
at CiE conferences as a general rule; and there will be special issues of
Logical Methods in Computer Science (LMCS), Annals of Pure and Applied
Logic (APAL) and the Journal of Computational Biology.

CiE 2012 CONFERENCE TOPICS include, but not exclusively -
* Admissible sets
* Algorithms
* Analog computation
* Artificial intelligence
* Automata theory
* Bioinformatics
* Classical computability and degree structures
* Cognitive science and modelling
* Complexity classes
* Computability theoretic aspects of programs
* Computable analysis and real computation
* Computable structures and models
* Computational and proof complexity
* Computational biology
* Computational creativity
* Computational learning and complexity
* Computational linguistics
* Concurrency and distributed computation
* Constructive mathematics
* Cryptographic complexity
* Decidability of theories
* Derandomization
* DNA computing
* Domain theory and computability
* Dynamical systems and computational models
* Effective descriptive set theory
* Emerging and Non-standard Models of Computation
* Finite model theory
* Formal aspects of program analysis
* Formal methods
* Foundations of computer science
* Games
* Generalized recursion theory
* History of computation
* Hybrid systems
* Higher type computability
* Hypercomputational models
* Infinite time Turing machines
* Kolmogorov complexity
* Lambda and combinatory calculi
* L-systems and membrane computation
* Machine learning
* Mathematical models of emergence
* Molecular computation
* Morphogenesis and developmental biology
* Multi-agent systems
* Natural Computation
* Neural nets and connectionist models
* Philosophy of science and computation
* Physics and computability
* Probabilistic systems
* Process algebras and concurrent systems
* Programming language semantics
* Proof mining and applications
* Proof theory and computability
* Proof complexity
* Quantum computing and complexity
* Randomness
* Reducibilities and relative computation
* Relativistic computation
* Reverse mathematics
* Semantics and logic of computation
* Swarm intelligence and self-organisation
* Type systems and type theory
* Uncertain Reasoning
* Weak systems of arithmetic and applications

We particularly welcome submissions in emergent areas, such as
bioinformatics and natural computation, where they have a basic connection
with computability.

CiE 2012 will have a special relationship to the scientific legacy of Alan
Turing, reflected in the broad theme: How the World Computes, with all its
different layers of meaning. Contributions which are directly related to
the visionary and seminal work of Turing will be particularly welcome.

particularly invite papers that build bridges between different parts of
the research community.

The conference is sponsored by the ASL, EACSL, EATCS, Elsevier, the IET,
IFCoLog, King's College Cambridge, Science Magazine, The University of
Cambridge, the Isaac Newton Institute, IOS Press, and Microsoft Research.
