I subscribe. At the present state OCaml, which is otherwise an almost
perfect language, needs some tool, I mean any tool, to accomplish
*simple*metaprogramming tasks.

Camlp4, which could be an awful or an amazing tool, is known by an inner
circle of wizards, and the activity of creating a new syntax extension is
a... sorcery for initiates only.

My experience of average and maybe dumb OCaml programmer: last week I tried
to write a simple ORM, something resembling the Django
ORM<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/db/models/>and, after
some (random) trial and error, I simply gave up. I have started
thinking to use cpp as a preprocessor to create very simple "templates",
which is awful, but the only alternative I have is to define the ORM
classes in something like XML, parse them and generate OCaml sources.

It's definitively a lose-lose game.
