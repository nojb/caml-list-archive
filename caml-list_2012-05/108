Subject: [Caml-list] some camlp4 documentations

Hi, List
    I have read camlp4 source tree for quite a long time, and compiled 
it here
   http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hongboz/hongbo_zhang_files/temp.pdf
   It's still preliminary, and contains many errors.

   my 2 cents:
   1. don't use camlp4 for 3.12.0 (too many bugs there), it's fine in 3.12.1

   2. spend some time in ocamlbuild (covered in chap2), it's very easy 
to build any camlp4 extension, (not as hard as you thought)

   3. write a quick hack extension is straight-foward. a robust 
extesnsion is not easy. But, due to the fact that your camlp4Ast will be 
dumped to ocamlast, and to typedtree, the bug will be found later in 
most cases, so it's still a very powerful tool
