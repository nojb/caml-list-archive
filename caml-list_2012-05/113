Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN]: 108.00-pre2 pre-release of Core suite

I'm pleased to announce the 108.00-pre2 pre-release of the Core suite
of libraries.  Core is an industrial strength alternative to OCaml's
standard library.  The tarball can be found here:

  https://bitbucket.org/yminsky/ocaml-core/downloads

The Core suite includes a variety of useful libraries, including:

- Core: the heart of the standard library.
- Several useful syntax extensions
 - type-conv: a library for building type-driven syntax extensions
 - sexplib: a library for handling s-expressions, and a syntax
   extension for auto-generating conversions between OCaml types and
   s-expressions
 - bin-prot: a syntax-extensions for generating
 - pipebang
 - variantslib
 - comparelib
 - fieldslib
- Async: a monadic concurrency library.
- Core_extended: extra components that are not as closely vetted or as
 stable as Core.  This includes, Shell, an interface for interacting
 with the UNIX shell, and Command, a command-line parsing library.

Many of these libraries have been released separately in the past, but
we're now releasing them as a single tarball.

The release does not depend on Oasis to build, so it should be easier
to build and install than installing from the hg repo.

Feedback is greatly appreciated!  You can join the core mailing list here:
