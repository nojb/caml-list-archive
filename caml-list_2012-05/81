Subject: [Caml-list] Setting up donations for OASIS and odb.ml

Hello,

How about setting up a donate button to each of these projects?

I would personally like to give some of my pocket money to both of these
projects and I am sure I am not the only one in this situation.
Also, these two projects look very important for a wider adoption of OCaml.

Regards,
F.

PS: maybe ocamlbrew too?
