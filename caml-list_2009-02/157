There are several libraries available which seem to be reasonably
usable in their current state.
Distributed processing across multiple machines:
- OCAMLMPI - http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/software.html
- OCamlP3l - http://camlp3l.inria.fr/eng.htm
- BSML - http://frederic.loulergue.eu/research/bsmllib/bsml-0.4beta.html

Fork-based parallelism for exploiting multiple cores/processors locally:
- Prelude.ml - http://github.com/kig/preludeml/tree/master

There is also JoCaml (http://jocaml.inria.fr/), which is an extension
of OCaml itself.  JoCaml has examples for various distributed
processing methods.
