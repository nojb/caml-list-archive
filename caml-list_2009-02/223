Caml-list readers,

The quoted remarks appended below, sent out to Caml-list yesterday,
have just come to my attention.  I'm not sure what Jason intended
with his post, but I thought I should respond to clear up possible
confusion or misimpressions.  Earlier this week, a potential reviewer
contacted by Abscissa Press asked about similarities between TOCPL
and an online document he understood to represent a book to be
published by Jason.  Here is a copy of the response sent to him:

   It's good you asked the question because certainly the situation
   could be confusing.  "The Objective Caml Programming Language" is
   derived from an earlier unpublished joint work by Jason Hickey and
   Tim Rentsch;  if you look in the Preface in Rentsch's book you will
   see an attribution to this effect, mentioning Jason Hickey by name.
   Dr. Hickey has been aware of plans to publish a separate book based
   on their earlier joint work, and has asked only that he be given an
   attribution, which of course we were happy to do.

   The earlier collaboration started in early 2004 and continued until
   early 2007.  There were negotiations for the joint work underway
   with Cambridge University Press at that time, but when the authors
   couldn't agree on terms, each decided to proceed independently.

   Our understanding is that Hickey's forthcoming book with CUP is
   supposed to be based on previous material and not on material
   developed as part of the joint work, but even so, given the history,
   it wouldn't be surprising if there were lots of similarities.  We
   don't know how similar the two books might actually be.  As far as
   we know the CUP book has not yet been published.  We haven't yet had
   the opportunity to review the webpage material for the link you
   sent, and of course we don't know if that material is what will end
   up being published.  None of that changes the basic answer to your
   question, which is that there are two similar texts because authors
   who had been working together later decided to proceed and publish
   independently.

Of course Jason may have been unaware that TOCPL had been published;
however, despite whatever impressions his comments might offer, he
certainly was aware that I was working on an Objective Caml book
based on our earlier joint work.
