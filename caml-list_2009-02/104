XSD as in the crazy-complicated quasi-standard used in SOAP, WSDL etc?

I'm not sure you'll find any implementations in OCaml - it's hard
enough to implement when you have a large team of people available to
you.

I did a very very partial implementation using CDuce as part of my
SOAP client code for the Google AdWords API.  It's not directly
usable, but maybe you can have a look at it for inspiration anyway:
