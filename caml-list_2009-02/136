Apologies for multiple posting
-------------------------------

It is my pleasure to announce that the public defense of my PhD will
take place on thursday, March 5th at 10am, at

   Salle des Thèses, P2 building
   Université Paris 12, Créteil

The works presented have for title:

   "Systematic Development and Safety of Execution
    in Structured Parallel Programming"

and will be defended in front of the jury composed of:

- Emmanuel Chailloux
- Jocelyn Sérot
- Zhenjiang Hu
- Olivier Michel
- Frédéric Gava
- Frédéric Loulergue



Abstract:
----
Finding a good paradigm to represent parallel programming in a
simple and efficient way is a challenge currently faced by
computer science research, mainly due to the evolution of machine
architectures towards multi-core processors. BSML is a high
level, structured parallel programming language that takes part
in this research in an original way. By building upon existing
work, this thesis extends the language and makes it more general,
simple and usable with added imperative features such as
references and exceptions, a specific syntax, etc. The existing
formal and safety characteristics of the language (semantics,
type system...) are preserved and extended. A major application
is given in the form of a methodology for the development of
fully proved parallel programs.

Thanks for your attention,
Louis Gesbert
