                        Final Call for Papers
    ICFP 2009: International Conference on Functional Programming
          Edinburgh, Scotland, 31 August - 2 September 2009
              http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/icfp09.html
               ** Submission deadline: 2 March 2009 **
          Submission URL: https://www.softconf.com/a/icfp09/

ICFP 2009 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional
programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to
practice, from foundations to features, from abstraction to
application.  The scope includes all languages that encourage
functional programming, including both purely applicative and
imperative languages, as well as languages with objects or
concurrency. Particular topics of interest include
  * Language Design
  * Implementation
  * Software-Development Techniques
  * Foundations
  * Applications and Domain-Specific Languages
  * Functional Pearls

The conference also solicits Experience Reports, which are short
papers that provide evidence that functional programming really works
or describe obstacles that have kept it from working in a particular
application.
