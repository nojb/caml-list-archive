Documentation! I tried to use ocamlbuild several times and gave up because =
I=20
could not figure out how to do simple things.

I used Makefiles for a bit but make/ocamldep is so fragile that it broke so=
=20
often I ended up doing "make clean; make" to rebuild at every edit. So now =
my=20
method of choice is either writing the compile line out by hand every time =
or=20
using a bash script that always recompiles everything.

=46ortunately OCaml is ridiculously fast at compiling so there is almost no=
 need=20
for incremental compilation anyway. Although I would appreciate parallel=20
builds...

I managed to get Smoke compiled and running on Mac OS, which is LablGL as w=
ell=20
as OCaml itself. I thought Mac OS X sucked but I can hardly blame OCaml for=
=20
that. ;-)
