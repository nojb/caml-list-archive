Richard,

Thank you for pointing this out, I was unaware of this book.  My book
on OCaml (currently circulating as an online pdf) is under contract
with Cambridge University Press.

I haven't read Mr. Rentsch's book (I just ordered a copy from Amazon).
 I should point out that I have neither authorized nor endorsed Mr.
Rentsch's book, nor have I given permission to use any text that I
have written.  It would be heartbreaking to me if this work were to be
published without my permission -- I started writing in 2000, and the
text has been through many classes and much writing.  I must assume
Tim wrote his text independently.  Still, I look forward to seeing a
copy.

Jason
