Oh dear. Then I am very sorry to tell you that Tim Rentsch's book is virtually 
identical to your own, having been tweaked just enough to evade copyright.

I am just comparing your PDF with the free copy Abscissa Press sent me and it 
is almost a verbatim replica right down to errors in your text and parts of 
code examples that you chose at random (e.g. all of the example expressions 
involving chars and strings are literally identical to those from your book).
