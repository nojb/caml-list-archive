Hello,

I would like to read two files in two different threads.

I have made a first version reading the first then the second and it takes
2.8s (native).

I decided to make a threaded version and before any use of thread I realize=
d
that just linking no even using it to the threads library makes my first
version of the program to run in 12s !

I use pcre, extlib, csv libraries as well.

I guess it might come from GC slowing down thinks here, doesn't it ? Where
can it come from otherwise ? Is there a workaround or something I should
know ?

Can ocaml use multiple cores ?

Do you have few pointers on libraries to make parallel I/Os ?

Thanks,
R=C3=A9mi
