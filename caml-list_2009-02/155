Hi,

I am trying to evaluate ocaml for a project involving large scale numerical
calculations. We would need parallel processing, i.e. a library that
distributes jobs accross multiple processors within a machine and accross
multiple PCs.
Speed and easy programability are important. I have tried to search this
issue first, but the postings I found were usually negative and 4-5 years
old. On the other hand, I see a number of libraries in the Hump that by now
might be taking care of these things.

My question is: is ocaml good for parallel processing / hreaded computation,
are there (mature) libraries or tools that let developers make use of
multicore and multimachine environments?

cheers,
Atmam
