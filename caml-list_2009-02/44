Are you serious ?

> Or does the wiki really lacks important information?

Yes, the way the plugin api works is still lagely undocumented (a =20
random example is it possible to use Plugin.flag inside a rule and =20
what would the effects be ? another is why is the tags argument of =20
Plugin.rule deprectated and thus how can I make a rule apply only if a =20=

file has a given tag or maybe I shouldn't do that, etc.).

There are a lot of things the authors of ocambuild know that are not =20
in the wiki and that I don't want to discover by trial/error/=20
understand the ocamlbuild source/consult mailling list/try to look at =20=

the wiki and I'd be very grateful to them if they'd share this =20
knowledge in a well-written manual.

Many people don't understand that very often the barrier to adoption =20
is just a single, extensive source of documentation called a manual. =20
Let me repeat that again, a wiki (or its content) is not a substitute =20=

for a manual. The whole carefully edited "big picture" documentation =20
is missing and you won't get that by copy and pasting random samples =20
from the wiki. We need this well-written thing called a manual that =20
any respectful tool should provide, they had a good start here [1] but =20=

it is not sufficient as it covers only the simplest cases.
