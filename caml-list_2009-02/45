You don't have to be so mean :(

Unfortunately, while authors might be the best persons to answer these 
questions, they are also the ones who do not have any question ;) 
Finding the right questions is not easy and a Wiki is a nice way to find 
out.

While I agree that the documentation should answer most questions, I 
fail to see how "try to look at the wiki" is different from "try to look 
at the manual". The only problem I have with the wiki is that it is not 
in the same place as the OCaml manual. Do we have to rename "wiki" into 
"manual in which you can write your own notes" ? :)
