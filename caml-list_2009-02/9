Hello all,

This is my last post for OCaml Meeting. I have updated the schedule and
the "bar" we can meet before the dinner. 

To be more convenient, I have decided that we should just meet at the
"Brasserie du Palais" to have a beer. This way, we will already be at
the place of the dinner (less travel in a city I don't know).

Someone, suggest me to organize some kind of "practical workshop" at the
end of the day. I think this is a good idea. So if there is time left at
the end of the day, people who wish can stay in the WTC to do some
practical exercices (hacking/demonstration...)

Regards,
Sylvain Le Gall on behalf of OCaml Meeting organization team
