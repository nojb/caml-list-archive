Some people at the users meeting were asking me about the new OCaml
book, so here are the details:

http://www.amazon.com/Objective-Caml-Programming-Language/dp/0981599206

I have *not* read the book, but I'm hoping that the publisher is going
to send me a review copy shortly, and once I've had a look through it
I will be able to say more about whether it's any good (hopefully!)

Conversely if you have read the book, please let us know if you liked it.

Rich.
