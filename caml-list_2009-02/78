Ah, my apologies.  I didn't read your original post carefully enough.
Would it be possible to write a function to read these files in to a
list then use "dep [foo; bar] file_list;"?  This is what I use for
included files in .idl files.  I have only done this with static,
pre-defined lists using 'dep ["compile"; "camlidl"] ["file1.inc;
file2.inc"];'.  I'm not sure how well it would work or if it would
work at all with a dynamic list of files.
