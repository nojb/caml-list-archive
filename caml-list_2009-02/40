Is the problem really the lack of documentation or a problem to find it 
because it is not on the caml.inria.fr website?

The wiki:
http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild
should answer all questions you have to compile simple projects. In 
fact, the user manual (first link on the wiki) should answer these 
questions.

It would really help to improve the documentation if you could explain 
what were the problems you encountered and where did you look for the 
documentation.

Please note that since the first OCaml meeting (last year), the wiki has 
changed quite a bit, so if you tried Ocamlbuild before, you might want 
to try it again.
