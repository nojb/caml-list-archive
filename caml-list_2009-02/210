Looks like the publisher was created just to publish this book, as we created 
Flying Frog to publish OCaml for Scientists four years ago.

The publishers were kind enough to send me a complimentary copy so I shall 
blog a review on OCaml News in due course. Suffice to say that the content 
(264 pages from the main 17 chapters) is excellent from a purely theoretical 
standpoint and, I would say, targets undergrad computer scientists preparing 
to sit exams about OCaml. The book covers advanced topics in detail and 
contains lots of academic exercises. In particular, about a third of the book 
is devoted to OCaml's approach to object oriented programming.
