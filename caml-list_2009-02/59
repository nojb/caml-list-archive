> Regarding what is missing in ocaml build environment ...

I should add that one reason I chose to work with ocaml is also
because of its build environment. I links very efficiently with C code
and do link with object files. So it is not a self-contained
environment that would be difficult to use for systems programming.
This is very powerful. But it does have implications as I mentioned
before.

I'd also like to mention that I find ocamlbuild a very good tool - not
only for ocaml, but for building anything. That fact that you can
dynamically include dependency generators in the build based on
generated build products is outstanding. I hope it will get to used
more because many of the platform dependent unix tools used in
makefiles could be done in ocaml code instead in a portable way.

So I am just mentioning where I see areas for improvement, it is not
like I think everything is just bad.

Mikkel
