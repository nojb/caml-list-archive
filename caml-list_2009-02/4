                             FMOODS/FORTE

 IFIP International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Systems
    as joint international conference of FMOODS/FORTE

(11th Formal Methods for Open Object-Based Distributed Systems and 29th
   Formal Techniques  for Networked and Distributed Systems)

		Lisbon, Portugal, June 9-11, 2009

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IFIP International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed
Systems is formed jointly from the two conference series FMOODS and
FORTE. It is part of the federated conference event DisCoTec (Distributed
Computing Techniques) which also includes the 11th International Conference
on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION) and the 9th IFIP
International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable
Systems (DAIS). The event will be hosted by the Faculty of Sciences of the
University of Lisbon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives and Scope

The joined conference FMOODS/FORTE is a forum for fundamental research on
theory and applications of distributed systems. The conference solicits
original contributions that advance the science and technologies for
distributed systems, in particular in the areas of:

    * Component- and model-based design
    * Service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid and mobile computing
    * Software quality, reliability and security 

The conference encourages contributions that combine theory and practice,
address problems from the development of distributed systems, and present
novel solutions with formal methods and theoretical foundations.

FMOODS/FORTE covers distributed computing models and formal specification,
testing and verification methods. The application domains include all kinds
of application-level distributed systems, telecommunication services,
Internet, embedded and real time systems, as well as networking and
communication security and reliability.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

    * Languages and Semantic Foundations: new modeling and language
      concepts for distribution and concurrency, semantics for different
      types of languages, including programming languages, modeling
      languages, and domain specific languages; real-time and probability
      aspects; type systems and behavioral typing  

    * Formal Methods and Techniques: design, specification, analysis,
      verification, validation and testing of various types of distributed
      systems including communications and network protocols,
      service-oriented systems, and adaptive distributed systems  

    * Applications of Formal Methods: applying the existing methods and
      techniques to distributed systems, particularly web services,
      multimedia systems, and telecommunications  

    * Practical Experience with Formal Methods: industrial applications,
      case studies and software tools for applying formal methods and
      description techniques to the development and analysis of real
      distributed systems

			   CALL FOR PAPERS

			  Coordination 2009

	       Languages, Models, and Architectures for
		 Concurrent and Distributed Software

		    11th International Conference

		Member of the Federated Conferences on
		   Distributed Computing Techniques
		  Lisbon, Portugal 8 - 12 June 2009

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Scope

Modern software lives in a concurrent world.  The ubiquity of the
Internet allows distributed software components to be composed into
complex networked systems.  At the other end of the spectrum, with
multicore processors now the norm, concurrency is frequently necessary
to maximize application performance.

Coordination 2009 seeks high-quality papers on programming languages,
models, and architectures that address the challenge of building
robust distributed and concurrent applications.  The conference
focuses on the design and implementation of models that allow
compositional construction of large-scale concurrent and distributed
systems, including both practical and foundational models, runtime
systems, and related verification and analysis techniques.

			  Topics of Interest

DISTRIBUTED AND CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING MODELS: multicore programming,
     stream programming, data parallel programming, event-driven
     programming, web programming

FOUNDATIONS OF DISTRIBUTED AND CONCURRENT INTERACTION:
     models for processes, service composition and orchestration, workflow
     management, data query, tuple spaces

SPECIFICATION, VERIFICATION, AND TYPES: modeling and analysis of types
     and properties related to security, dependability, resource
     consumption, and component conformance for concurrent and
     distributed systems

HIGH-LEVEL OPTIMIZATIONS: program transformations for performance
     enhancement, runtime load balancing techniques, static and
     dynamic resource management

QUALITY OF SERVICE: fault-tolerant programming models and runtime support,
    models with responsiveness guarantees

DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT: component and module systems for
     distributed software, dynamic software evolution and update
     technologies, configuration and deployment architectures

SYSTEM SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMMING MODELS: P2P frameworks, mobile ad-hoc
     networks, sensor networks, publish-subscribe systems, event
     processing

CASE STUDIES: application of novel distributed and concurrent
     techniques in business process modeling, e-commerce, factory
     automation, collaboration, command and control

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

			Submission Guidelines

The Coordination 2009 conference solicits high quality papers
reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the
topics mentioned above. All papers must be original, unpublished, and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Contributions should be
submitted electronically as postscript or PDF, using the SPRINGER LNCS
style. Papers should not exceed 15 pages in length. Each paper will
undergo a thorough process of review and the conference proceedings
will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. Proceedings
will be made available at the conference.

Selected papers will be invited to a special issue of the journal
Science of Computer Programming
