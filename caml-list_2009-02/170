Mike and Erick,

In some of my work, I've got code which is constantly creating and
multiplying 4x4 matrices (Lorentz transforms).  I usually write in a
functional style, so I do not generally overwrite old matrices with
the multiplication results.  I have discovered that, at these sizes,
it's about a factor of two to three faster to do this with OCaml
arrays for the matrices rather than the Bigarrays you would need to
use to interface with the BLAS in Lacaml or ocamlgsl.  The reason is
that the memory block for a bigarray is malloc-ed, which is extremely
slow compared to the OCaml native allocation.  That overhead
completely eliminates the advantage of going through C or Fortran
libraries.

The ideal solution would be to use OCaml native float arrays (fast
allocation) with LAPACK (fast matrix multiply), but I'm satisfied with
the performance of my code, and too lazy to put out the effort to
implement the C glue for this.

Just thought you might appreciate another data point.  I have no idea
where the turnover is between 4x4 and 61x61 :).

Will
