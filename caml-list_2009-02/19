Subject: Melt 1.0.0 released : program LaTeX documents using OCaml
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Spam: no; 0.00; lri:01 ocaml:01 ocaml:01 jfla:01 melt:98 melt:98 slides:01 usable:02 latex:02 latex:02 readme:03 programming:03 typesetting:05 examples:07 fun:08 

Melt is a set of libraries and tools which allows you to program LaTeX 
documents using OCaml. This combines the typesetting power of LaTeX with 
the programming power of OCaml. It can be combined with Mlpost to 
include figures.

If you were at JFLA, it can be seen as my answer to the question "what 
about MlTeX" which was asked during the Mlpost presentation.

Melt can be download on OCamlForge:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/melt/

This is the first release of Melt. Thus, it might not be considered as 
truly stable. However, several documents, including articles and slides, 
have already been produced using Melt, so it is definitely usable.

The documentation is included in the distribution (read the README). 
Some examples can be found in the "bench" directory (see doc.mlt).

Have fun with Melt! :)
