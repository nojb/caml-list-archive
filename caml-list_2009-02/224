I should add one more thing, which is, I do subscribe to the caml-list
email list, but lately I've been busy with other things and haven't
been reading it.  Since this topic has come up obviously I plan on
starting reading it again, and also reviewing recent messages to
see if any others should be responded to.  I should be starting
that review sometime later today, and responding (if necessary)
over the next day or so, depending on what's been posted.
