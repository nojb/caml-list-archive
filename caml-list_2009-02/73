I learned Modula-3 recently, and of a neat tool that Modula-3 has called
 "showthread"[1].  I was wondering if anyone would be interested in
implementing a program similar to it for OCaml, as it's a really neat
tool, and one that I have not seen in other languages. There are also a
few other programs like "showheap" which shows the heap usage of a
program, rather than the threads.  It too might be interesting to make
for OCaml.
