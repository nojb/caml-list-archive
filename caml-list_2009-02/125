You can memory map files very easily entirely from within OCaml.

This was actually covered in the OCaml Journal article about OpenGL 2, whic=
h=20
used file mapping as an easy way to load texture maps. First, you open the=
=20
file to create a file descriptor:

  try_finally (Unix.openfile file [] 777)

Then you map the file to create a big array:

    (fun desc ->
       let source =3D Array1.map_file desc int8_signed c_layout false (-1) =
in

Then you can do something with the big array, like copy it into an ordinary=
=20
string:

       String.init (Array1.dim source) (fun i -> Char.chr source.{i}))

=46inally, you close the file:

    Unix.close

Note that I have used try_finally and String.init functions from my own std=
lib=20
but their purpose and use should be obvious.

You probably just want to replace read_char with a function that increments=
 a=20
counter and reads from the array, with the whole parser inside the=20
try_finally.
