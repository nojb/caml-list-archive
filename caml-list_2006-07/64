Not for the in/out_channel in the standard distribution.

However if you can change the code to use the IO class types defined
here (http://www.ocaml-programming.de/rec/IO-Classes.html) then you
can use something like input_string from the Netstring library:

 let s = "1\n2\n3\n4" in
 let ch = new input_string s in
 ch#input_line ()

If you can't change the code, then the best you can do might be to
read and write a temporary file (see: Filename.open_temp_file).

Another alternative from the std lib is Buffer, but that also requires
changing the code.
