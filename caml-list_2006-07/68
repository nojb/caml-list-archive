I've been urged to use Netcgi from OcamlNet-2 from
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/ocamlnet-2.2test2.tar.gz .

When I tried to configure OcamlNet2 it said it needed PCRE -- and even
though I installed what was labelled as PCRE from
ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/ , OcamlNet-2 refused
to configure because it couldn't recognize PCRE as being installed, and when
I commented out the test for PCRE in the configure it still couldn't find
it.

How can I install OcamlNet-2? Right now I'm stuck on getting it to recognize
PCRE.
