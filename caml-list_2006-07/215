If it makes you feel better, I don't think anybody was questioning the 
quality of your work.

What I was pointing out is the lack of trust from the users, which is a 
direct consequence of the lack of communication from the core OCaml team.
For example, why should anyone invest time in using Camlp4, when you see 
that the main developer left the OCaml group angrily a few years ago for 
unexplained reasons, and that the last version of the manual was 
released approximately at that time.

Now that you have been preparing a new version of Camlp4 and you are 
obviously very motivated, why not setup a web page that answers all the 
practical and philosophical questions that people may ask themselves 
about Camlp4 and its relationship with the OCaml language. Tell yourself 
that when someone actually asks one question on the caml-list, it probably 
means that hundreds of people have had the same problem and just gave up.


Thank you for your understanding,


Martin
