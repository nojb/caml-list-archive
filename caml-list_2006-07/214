Hi,

sorry for posting this to the list but I tried to get an account for  
the bug tracking system, but it didn't work.

This an additional note to Bug 4064.

The same bug, i.e. with the same backtrace in gdb, appears when  
compiling fjavac from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stse/javac/ 
fjavac-0.4.3.tgz

That package includes ocfgc a parser generator. For instuctions to  
reproduce that behavior look at the end of the mail.
I think this is easier to reproduce and debug than the original  
instructions because ocfgc does not involve lablgtk or other C  
interfacing code except the unix module of ocaml itself.
This crash does not occur with the bytecode-compiled version, ocfgc.

This is happening with MacOS X 10.4.7 on a MacBookPro and cvs  
checkedout version of today:  
CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@camlcvs.inria.fr:/caml cvs -z3 co -r  
ocaml3092 -P  ocaml
I didn't change anything in the ocaml sources.

Best regards,
   Jean-Marie
