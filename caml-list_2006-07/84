	Thanks, linking against driver/errors.cmo and using Errors.report_error 
worked.  However, is there some other library I could link against that 
wouldn't require end-users having access to the OCaml sources?  I did 
some some investigation, but wasn't able to find one.  I've seen some 
posts in the past where people have been using Errors.report_error, but 
it wasn't obvious from the context what they were linking to get it.
