That's how it was originally. But if you look again at my code, you can 
see that the version with Unix.O_NONBLOCK is commented out. That's 
because on one of my machines (the one with a newer version of GTK and 
LablGTK, I believe), I got exceptions every time the program tried to 
read the input. I don't fully understand why, but making the channel 
non-non-blocking eliminated the errors. It doesn't make sense to 
me--based on my limited knowledge of how POSIX I/O works, the channel 
really *should* be non-blocking. But I have no idea what kind of magic 
Glib is doing behind the scenes.
