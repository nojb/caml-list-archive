Scope and Topics

The IFL workshops form a tradition that has lasted for nearly two decades.
The  aim  of  these  workshops is to  bring  together researchers actively
engaged   in   the  implementation  and   application  of  functional  and
function-based  programming  languages.  They  provide  an open  forum for
researchers who wish to present  and  discuss new ideas and concepts, work
in progress,   preliminary   results,   etc.  related  primarily  but  not
exclusively to the implementation and application of functional languages.
IFL becomes symposium from 2006.


Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

     * language concepts
     * concurrent/parallel programming
     * type checking
     * concurrent/parallel program execution
     * compilation techniques
     * heap management
     * generic programming techniques
     * runtime profiling
     * (abstract) interpretation
     * performance measurements
     * automatic program generation
     * debugging and tracing
     * (abstract) machine architectures
     * verification
     * formal aspects
     * tools and programming techniques
     * array processing
     * demos of well working, useable tools and applications
       in functional languages

     Papers on applications demonstrating  the  suitability of  novel ideas
in any of the above areas and  contributions on  related  theoretical work
are  also  welcomed.  The  change  of  the  workshop  name adding the term
"application", introduced in 2004, is to reflect the broader scope IFL has
gained over recent years.

     Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in
the  draft  proceedings and to give  presentations  at  the workshop.  All
contributions must be written in English, conform to  the  Springer-Verlag
LNCS series format.

     Attendees  at IFL'06  will  have  an opportunity  to  submit a revised
version of their paper  for  post-workshop reviewing. Selected papers will
be  published  by  Springer  Verlag  in  the  well-known  Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) Series, as has been a long-standing tradition  for
the IFL.
