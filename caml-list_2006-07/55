The POLLHUP events means that the other side of the FIFO has been
closed.  Thus, you should stop listening on the FIFO.  To be portable,
you should also stop listening when you receive a POLLIN event but
there is nothing to be read.  (Mac OS, for instance, returns POLLIN
when Linux would return POLLHUP.)
