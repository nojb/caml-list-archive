Hello,


someone who is able to explain me them?
What are super-recursive algorithms?

How are they related to lazy programming?

The less I found about them seem to point in a direction,
that HvF has mentioned in his texts, where he wrote about
calculating a reality.

Are they endless calculations, and therefore related to lazy programming?

Thanks in Advance,
              Oliver
