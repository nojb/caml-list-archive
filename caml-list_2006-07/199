You may want to have a look at the Cf_journal module in my recently =20
released OCaml NAE Core Foundation library.  See <http://sf.net/=20
projects/ocnae/> for downloads.  It's not anywhere near as full-=20

build something that full-featured.

I find it works pretty well for debugging purposes.  Your mileage may =20=

vary.
