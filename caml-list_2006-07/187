I do not know Log4J. For the same purpose as yours, I did a small Log
library, using another one, called Tics.

Tics is a binding to QueryPerformanceCouter and al. on MS Windows. At
this moment, it is not multiplatform, but this should be done very easily.

I need Tics because each message sent to Log is timestamped and stored
in memory. The user of Log then can flush and print or display the
stored message when possible.

I did this because I have plenty of memory for those tests, and I wanted
to avoid IO perturbations of timing. I also needed precise timing,
because I'm working with hardware.

Except from those constraint, I really don't think my tools are forth using.
