Argh! This is getting really frustrating ...

I added a custom sleep function, and called it to sleep for 0.3 seconds 
whenever there is no input to read. That should hugely reduce the 
frequency of attempts to read the FIFO, while not introducing much of a 
delay in response to commands. I tried both implementations, by the way: 
both the usleep wrapper and the Unix.select hack.

It doesn't make any difference.

BTW, I did check the app in non-daemon mode, and CPU usage is quite 
modest, as I would expect. And the only real difference between normal 
and daemon mode is this Io watching thing.
