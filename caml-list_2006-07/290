Can you send me a copy of this paper?
(scanned or as paper-copies)?!
(Or at least mention, where to find it (ISBN)?!)

This one I have somewhere in my paper copies; I found this article
in a library.

But to understand it, I first have to jump into LoF-details.

Some poeple said they had to re-read this book many times,
until they really understand it.
I hope to be faster here ;-)

Only for that reasons?


LoF seems to be - even if it's mentioned that it's a mathematical book - quite good
for philosophical reasoning, and makes sense in a cybernetics-context
(cybernetics, radical constructivism, Heinz von Foerster, Maturana, ...).

And therefore there is a linkage to Zen/Buddhism
(for example look at Heinz von Foerster's text "Objects: Tokens for Eigen-Behaviors",
 in german: "Gegenstände: greifbare Symbole für (Eigen-)Verhalten").

Also interesting on this topic: Maturana's work.

But before we will be too off-topic, I will stop here. ;-)

Best,
   Oliver Bandel
