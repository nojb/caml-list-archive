Well, there  is at least an  ugly way to  do that, which is  to modify
lexbuf.lex_curr_pos manually, as in

======================================================================
  | <your regexp>   { lexbuf.lex_curr_pos <- lexbuf.lex_curr_pos - 1;
	              <your action> }
======================================================================

I've already used this with success  (yes, I feel ashamed :-). I would
like a  member of  the ocaml  development team to  confirm it,  but it
seems  safe, as long  as you  do not  backtrack before  the characters
matched by the  left hand-side regexp. Indeed, the  lexing engine will
not modify the lexbuf once the action is triggered and before the next
call to the lexer.

Hope this helps,
