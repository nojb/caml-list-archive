Fully agreed. Me myself try to enforce locality of syntax extensions to
avoid possible clashes. Unfortunately handling that in large project is
really painful, since you end up in having to differentiate "clusters"
of files which need to be built with different set of camlp4 flags, and
you need to do that in Makefile.

In my mind this is asking for trouble, and the usual solution I pursue
is to avoid using syntax extensions ... a pity.

Cheers.
