Is there a way in OCaml to read and write into memory using in and out
channels in the standard distribution?  It seems like there are functions
for converting everything else to in and out channels but I can't seem to
find anything for writing into and out of memory.  If there isn't something
already, is there a function for creating new in and out channels?

Thanks
