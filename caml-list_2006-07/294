You might have solved this in the meantime, but in case you haven't:

The problem is that the interface file errors.cmi isn't installed along
with ocaml.  You could keep a copy of errors.mli with your program and
use that to make a suitable errors.cmi for compiling against.  At least,
that seems to work for me.
