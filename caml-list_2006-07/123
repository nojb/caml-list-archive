Hi Mike,

i think there are more than one available SQLite bindings for OCaml, =20
including some that are just for versions of SQLite before the API =20
was changed in version 3 and others engineered directly for SQLite3.  =20=

I am using B=E1r=F0ur =C1rantsson's bindings that are available at:

http://www.imada.sdu.dk/~bardur/personal/45-programs/

These particular OCaml bindings in many ways directly mirror the =20
SQLite3 C API; they are not a DBI-like interfaces, but work well if =20
you are familiar with SQLite3.

I have modified the bindings slightly for my own needs by adding a =20
few methods and fixing a few bugs (any fixes of which I plan to =20
eventually contribute back to B=E1r=F0ur), but it works very well with =20=

the latest version of SQLite3.  I am using it just fine with version =20
3.3.6 of SQLite.  I have successfully used it to create database =20
files of several gigabytes (populated with marshaled OCaml objects =20
using Sqlite3's blob type).

Ted
