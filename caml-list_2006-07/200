At the risk of engaging in more than my fair share of self-promotion, =20=

I should point out that the OCaml NAE I/O Reactor library I just =20
released is an FRP framework.  It's pretty spare at the moment and =20
needs a lot of additions.  Also, I didn't write it with graphical =20
user interfaces in mind-- the goal was a good framework for single-=20
threaded multiplexing network application servers.  (The acronym =20
"NAE" stands for 'Network Application Environment'.)

	<http://sf.net/projects/ocnae/>

The Yampa framework doesn't strike me as appropriate for building a =20
GUI.  I suspect such a GUI toolkit would offer highly underwhelming =20
performance characteristics.  I could be wrong about that, and would =20
welcome such a surprise, but that's what my unscientific guess tells me.

For my own part, I plan to do all my GUI work in Cocoa with native =20
Objective-C.  A more useful addition to the OCaml HUMP, I argue, =20
would be bindings for CoreData.

	<http://developer.apple.com/macosx/coredata.html>

At some point, if no one else has done it first, I will get around to =20=

doing it myself.  Don't anybody hold their breath waiting for it, =20
though... I have a lot of hobby projects these days, what with a day =20
job and a 6-month old baby in the house.
