Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 4.10.1, release candidate

Dear OCaml users,

Along with OCaml 4.11.0, a bugfix release of OCaml version 4.10.1 is 
imminent.
This new version is collection of safe configuration, build system
and runtime fixes cherry-picked from the 4.11 development cycle.
It should be completely safe to upgrade to this version from OCaml 4.10.0.

The source code is available at these addresses:

https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.10.1+rc1.tar.gz
https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.10/ocaml-4.10.1+rc1.tar.gz

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with the following 
commands:

$ opam update
$ opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.10.1+rc1 
--repositories=default,beta=git://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

We want to know about any bugs. Please report them here:
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Happy hacking,
Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.
