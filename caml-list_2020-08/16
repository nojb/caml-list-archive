Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.10.1

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Augustin-Louis Cauchy
by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.10.1.

This release is a collection of safe bug fixes, cherry-picked from the 
4.11.0 development
cycle. If you were using OCaml 4.10.0 and cannot yet upgrade to 4.11.0, 
this release is for you.

See the list of changes below for more details.

It is (or soon will be) available as a set of OPAM switches,
and as a source download here: https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.10/

Happy hacking,

-- Florian Angeletti for the OCaml team.
