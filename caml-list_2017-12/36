Yes, and I would go further.  There are too many tools and languages to exp=
lore; any time spent exploring one has an opportunity cost in lost explorat=
ion of something else that might be useful or just cool.

Any moderately experienced programmer can learn a lot about a new language =
that=E2=80=99s not too different just by learning a few core concepts, look=
ing at some code, and trying to write some simple programs.   Past experien=
ce plays a big role, though.  If you=E2=80=99d never seen OO programming, r=
eading C++ or Java or OO-style Python or OO-style Javascript requires a bit=
 more learning, but once you know the concepts from one, you can guess a lo=
t about another.  The same point holds for FP.  And it holds for syntax in =
general.  Everyone knows C/Java/Javascript/a million other languages style =
syntax.  If you come from that world and try to learn Lisp or Haskell or an=
 ML-family language, you have to do a bit of study before you can even star=
t experimenting seriously.  Then you might ask:  =E2=80=9CIs it worth it ri=
ght now?  There all of these other tools or languages I want to learn.  Thi=
s new language with the weird syntax sounds cool, and I know I=E2=80=99m sm=
art enough to learn it, but I=E2=80=99m busy.   I have other priorities at =
the moment.  Maybe I=E2=80=99ll learn it another time.=E2=80=9D  And then y=
ou never get back to it, because there are always too many things to learn,=
 and you know, you have to have a life, too.  And maybe if the syntax had s=
eemed more intuitive, by the time you put the new language with the weird s=
yntax aside for the time being, you would have already written your first l=
ittle program in it, because you could guess how to write it just from look=
ing at a little bit of sample code and reading a screenfull of background i=
nfo.  And by now you would have taken the first step understanding the new =
language, and might be starting to wonder whether this could be a very usef=
ul tool to learn more thoroughly.

I like ML-style syntax, but I know that that makes me weird among programme=
rs. :-)
