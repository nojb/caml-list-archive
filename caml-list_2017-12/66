Subject: [Caml-list] RuleML+RR 2018 - Call for Papers

==================================================================

RuleML+RR 2018 FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

RuleML+RR 2018: International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning

http://2018.ruleml-rr.org

Part of Luxembourg Logic for AI Summit (LuxLogAI, https://luxlogai.uni.lu)

==================================================================

The International Joint Conference on Rules and Reasoning (RuleML+RR), the
leading international joint conference in the field of rule-based reasoning,
calls for high-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel
technologies, and innovative applications concerning knowledge representation
and reasoning with rules. Stemming from the synergy between the well-known
RuleML and RR events, one of the main goals of this conference is to build
bridges between academia and industry.

RuleML+RR 2018 aims to bring together rigorous researchers and inventive
practitioners, interested in the foundations and applications of rules and
reasoning in academia, industry, engineering, business, finance, healthcare
and other application areas. It will provide a forum for stimulating
cooperation and cross-fertilization between the many different communities
focused on the research, development and applications of rule-based systems.

RuleML+RR 2018 will take place in Luxembourg on September 18th-21th 2018
and will be part of the Luxembourg Logic for AI Summit (LuxLogAI) "Methods
and Tools for Responsible  AI", bringing together RuleML+RR 2018,
DecisionCAMP 2018, the Reasoning Web Summer School (RW 2018), and
the Global Conference on Artificial Intelligence (GCAI 2018).

== TOPICS ==

RuleML+RR welcomes original research from all areas of Rules and Reasoning.

Topics of particular interest include:

* Rule-based languages for intelligent information access and for the semantic web
* Vocabularies, ontologies, and business rules
* Ontology-based data access
* Data management, and data interoperability for web data
* Distributed agent-based systems for the web
* Scalability and expressive power of logics for the semantic web
* Reasoning with incomplete, inconsistent and uncertain data
* Non-monotonic, common-sense, and closed-world reasoning for web data
* Non-classical logics and the Web
* Constraint programming
* Logic programming
* Production & business rules systems
* Streaming data and complex event processing
* Rules for machine learning, knowledge extraction and information retrieval
* Rule-based approaches to natural language processing
* Rule discovery, extraction and transformation
* Rules and ontology learning
* Deep Learning for rules and ontologies
* Neural Networks and logic rules
* Neural Networks and ontologies
* Rule-based approaches to agents
* Higher-order and modal rules
* Rules for knowledge graphs
* Pragmatic web reasoning and distributed rule inference / rule execution
* Big data reasoning with rules
* Rule markup languages and rule interchange formats
* Rule-based policies, reputation, and trust
* Scalability and expressive power of logics for rules
* System descriptions, applications and experiences
* Rules and human language technology
* Rules in online market research and online marketing
* Applications of rule technologies in healthcare and life sciences
* Applications of rule technologies in law, regulation and finance
* Industrial applications of rules
* Rules and social media
* Rules of ethics, laws, policies, and regulations

Particularly encouraged are submissions that combine one or several of the
above topics with the overall focus theme of the LuxLogAI Summit: Methods
and Tools for Responsible AI

== SUBMISSIONS ==

We accept the following submission formats for papers:

* Full papers (up to 15 pages in LNCS style)
* Technical Communications (up to 8 pages in LNCS style)

Submitted full papers should present original and significant research results.
They must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or
that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with
formal proceedings. Double submission to a workshop with informal proceedings
is allowed.

Technical communications are intended for promising but possibly preliminary
work, position papers, system descriptions, and applications descriptions
(which may be accompanied by a demo).

Submissions: via EasyChair 
    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rulemlrr2018

The RuleML+RR 2018 best papers will be invited for rapid publication in the
Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

In addition to regular submissions, RuleML+RR 2018 will host an Industry Track,
a Doctoral Consortium, the 12th International Rule Challenge.

== PUBLICATION ==

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science series (LNCS). All submissions must be prepared in 
Springer's LaTeX style llncs (http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html).

== IMPORTANT DATES ==

Title and Abstract submission: 20 Apr 2018
Full papers submission: 27 Apr 2018
Notification of acceptance: 1 June 2018
Camera-ready submission: 15 June 2018
Conference: 18-21 Sept 2018

For each of these deadlines, a cut-off point of 23:59 AOE (anywhere on earth)
applies.
