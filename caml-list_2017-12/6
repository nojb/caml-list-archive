Poster/demo abstract submission guideline
-----------------------------------------

  * https://popl18.sigplan.org/track/PEPM-2018#Call-for-Poster-Demo-Abstrac=
ts

To maintain PEPM=E2=80=99s dynamic and interactive nature, PEPM 2018 will c=
ontinue to
have special sessions for poster/demo presentations.  In addition to the ma=
in
interactive poster/demo session, there will also be a scheduled short-talk
session where each poster/demo can be advertised to the audience in, say, 5=
=E2=80=9310
minutes.

Poster/demo abstracts should describe work relevant to PEPM (whose scope is
detailed below), typeset as a one-page PDF using the two-column =E2=80=98si=
gplan=E2=80=99
sub-format of the new =E2=80=98acmart=E2=80=99 format available at:

  http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/

and sent by email to the programme co-chairs, Fritz Henglein and Josh Ko, a=
t:

  henglein@diku.dk, hsiang-shang@nii.ac.jp

Please also include in the email:

  * a short summary of the abstract (in plain text),
  * the type(s) of proposed presentation (poster and/or demo), and
  * whether you would like to give a scheduled short talk (in addition to t=
he
    poster/demo presentation).

Abstracts should be sent no later than:

  Friday, 8th December 2017, anywhere on earth

and will be considered for acceptance on a rolling basis.  Accepted abstrac=
ts,
along with their short summary, will be posted on PEPM 2018=E2=80=99s websi=
te.

At least one author of each accepted abstract must attend the workshop and
present the work during the poster/demo session.

Student participants with accepted posters/demos can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses and other support.  PAC also offers oth=
er
support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel c=
osts
for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe.  For details on =
the
PAC programme, see its web page.


Scope
-----

In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2018 welcomes
submissions in new domains, in particular:

  * Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program
    optimisation.

  * Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and
    concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types,=
 and
    contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2018 include, but are not limit=
ed
to:

  * Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
    partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active
    libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring,
    decompilation, and obfuscation.

  * Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
    languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, st=
aged
    computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.

  * Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
    binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated test=
ing
    and test case generation.

  * Application of the above techniques including case studies of program
    manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and softw=
are
    development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectiv=
ely
    handling realistic applications, benchmarking.  Examples of application
    domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL
    implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific
    computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distribu=
ted
    and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, =
and
    security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions
describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program
manipulation in general.  If you have a question as to whether a potential
submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme
co-chairs, Fritz Henglein and Josh Ko (henglein@diku.dk,
hsiang-shang@nii.ac.jp).
