Hello,

I am trying to get the fastcgi examples from netcgi2 to work, but am
having some problems with this.  I am running with apache2 and
mod_fcgid.

I have compiled the counter_fcgi example with ocamlopt and copied the
executable to my fcgid directory.  When pointing my browser at the url
of the binary I get an internal server error and the logs contain the
following:

    [Thu Jul 16 13:20:38 2009] [warn] (104)Connection reset by peer:  mod_fcgid: read data from fastcgi server error.
    [Thu Jul 16 13:20:38 2009] [error] [client 127.0.1.1] Premature end of script headers: counter.fcgi

I can see that a socket is created for communication between apache and
counter.fcgi, so something is functioning correctly, and I am unsure
what the problem might be.

Any pointers are welcome!

Regards
Anders
