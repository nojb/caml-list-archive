Hello,

I have difficulties to delete one file (name: fn, file descriptor:
fdesc) with "Unix.unlink fn".

I suspect that this is because I have a bigarray ba mapped with fdesc.
Is it a possible reason?

At some point, I want to delete fn because the saving operation was
cancelled by the user.

I assure that the binding to ba is lost.

Then, I close the file handle with
"Unix.close fdesc;"

At this point,
"Unix.rename fn g;" works, but
 
"Unix.unlink fn;" fails with : Permission denied error.


following my idea that this can be due to the fact that fn is mapped in
memory, I tried to insert a Gc.compact, in order for ba to be erased:

Unix.close fdesc;
Gc.compact ();
Unix.unlink fn;

but got the same error message.

Any idea?

Salutations

Matt
