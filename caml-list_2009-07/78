Hi Mykola,

I think you posted this to fa.caml using Google Groups. Unfortunately, 
fa.caml is (or should be) a read-only copy of the messages on the 
caml-list mailing list. I have copied this to the list so that others may 
respond. You may wish to sign up to continue this conversation:

To answer your question, I don't think it is very easy to do HTTPS using 
netclient-ssl - you have to write your own version of the HTTP protocol 
because Ocamlnet's HTTP and SSL support are not compatible with each 
other. You will probably have a much easier time using Curl:

Good luck,
Dave
