I don't know, but it sounds like it might be a good idea.  I'm open to
patches or exploit/testing code for this issue.  But at the moment my
primary concern is to get the upstream developers to take a look at
the issue and deliver a proper, comprehensive patch.

And to fix up the immediate security hole for the major distros.  At
the time of writing, Fedora is going with the patch in comment 11.

Rich.
