I do not think this is the case since these are the example programs
that come with the distribution and so should work out of the box.

I have tried the counter_fcgi and add_fcgi examples under mod_fcgid and
mod_fastcgi with apache2, but I can not get the examples to work.

Under mod_fastcgi I get a slightly different error message:

    [Thu Jul 16 15:05:09 2009] [error] [client 127.0.1.1] FastCGI: comm with server "/home/alt/projects/ocaml/www/counter.fcgi" aborted: idle timeout (30 sec)
    [Thu Jul 16 15:05:09 2009] [error] [client 127.0.1.1] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) received from server "/home/alt/projects/ocaml/www/counter.fcgi"

Which suggests that apache and counter.fcgi can see each other, but that the 
communication between the two is somehow not functioning.  

I should mention that I am using the netcgi2 lib from godi-ocamlnet.

Previously I used debians standard ocaml packages, but I am now using
godi exclusively.  Maybe I have somehow linked with something from my
old ocaml installation and in this way messed something up?

I'll keep trying for a while,...

Regards
Anders
