I have also tried this, but to no avail. I still get an internal server
error and a message about a timeout in the logs.

I believe I have done this part correctly, though. Here's a sample
session when starting the program from the commandline as you suggest:

    $ ./counter.fcgi
    ./counter.fcgi (FCGI) listening on port 1200.

And in another shell:

    $ lynx 127.0.0.1:1200

This waits indefinately.  A timeout is also what is reported by
mod_fastcgi.

Maybe I am missing something very obviuos.  Often that is a reason for
obscure problems like this  :-/

Yes, I must admint that my knowledge of the FCGI protocol is limited.  I
will gladly do this once I get to the bottom of this problem.
