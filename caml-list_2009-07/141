Not really. The physical location of heap values is not stable (because 
of the GC), so you cannot use it as a total ordering.

It may be useful to know that the generic structural comparison has a 
physical behavior for OCaml objects (it compares their unique ids). So 
wrapping your values inside objects can be a good trick to get physical 
comparison (and hashing), as in:

class ['a] physical_reference init = object
   val mutable current : 'a = init
   method get = current
   method set x = current <- x
end
