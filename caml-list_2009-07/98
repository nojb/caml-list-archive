A few months ago, there was a discussion on this list about
"Le langage Caml", an early book on Caml (Light) programming written
by Pierre Weis and I.  The book was out of print, but the publisher,
Dunod Éditions, graciously agreed to relinquish its rights and give
them back to the authors.

Pierre and I are therefore happy to announce that the full text of the
book (2nd edition) is now available freely:

    http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/books/llc.pdf

There was a companion book, "Manuel de référence du langage Caml",
which is the French translation of the Caml Light 0.7 reference
manual.  For completeness, we also made it available:
