That's great. This book is still, in my opinion, the best introduction
to Caml for programming beginners.

When we discussed the matter a few months ago [1], there was an
interest in an english translation, or an update to Objective Caml. A
translation would be a huge undertaking, but I suspect that updating
the book to Objective Caml should not be so difficult, and I would be
happy to collaborate to such an effort.

Is there a possibility to get the document in an editable format ?
