Actually at compile time, as stated by Jacques Garrigue* *in the last 
message of said thread:

"By the way, the check is not at link time, as was stated in another
message, but at compile time. It is the typing of variants itself that
guarantees that no such conflict will go undetected. So you will be
warned early enough."

Example:

# type a = [ `ABC | `zyctRecABC ];;
Variant tags `ABC and `zyctRecABC have same hash value. Change one of them.
