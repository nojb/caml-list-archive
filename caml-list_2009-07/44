                    GAMES 2009

     Annual Workshop of the ESF Networking Programme on
            Games for Design and Verification

              September 14 - 17, 2009
                    Udine, Italy
            http://games2009.dimi.uniud.it/

               CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

GAMES is an European Network pursuing research and=20
training on the design and verification of computing=20
systems, in a framework that is based on the interplay=20
of finite and infinite games, mathematical logic, and=20
automata theory.=20

For details, see www.games.rwth-aachen.de/

PROGRAMME:
As in previous years, GAMES 2009 will be an informal=20
workshop, without proceedings. Its programme consists=20
of three invited introductory tutorial (90 min), 5=20

(30 min) and short presentations (15 min).=20
Contributed talks and short presentations will be=20
selected by the programme committee on the basis of=20
submitted abstracts.
GAMES 2009 will also feature an open problem session,
which will consist of very short (10 min) descriptions
of interesting open problems about games.

SCOPE:
The scope of the workshop includes the mathematical=20
and algorithmic analysis of finite and infinite games,=20
the interplay of games with automata theory and  logic,=20
and applications of games, automata, and logic for the=20
design and verification of computing systems.

SUBMISSIONS:
Researchers who would like to present a talk at GAMES 2009 are
invited to submit an extended abstract of up to two pages at

      https://fsv.dimi.uniud.it/Games2009_submission/
