  Commercial Users of Functional Programming Workshop (CUFP) 2009

           Functional Programming As a Means, Not an End

                       Call for Participation

                        Sponsored by SIGPLAN
                     Co-located with ICFP 2009
     _________________________________________________________

                          4 September 2009
                        Edinburgh, Scotland

     _________________________________________________________

   Functional languages have been under academic development=20
   for over 25 years, and remain fertile ground for programming
   language research. Recently, however, developers in industrial,=20
   governmental, and open source projects have begun to use=20
   functional programming successfully in practical applications.=20
   In these settings, functional programming has often provided=20
   dramatic leverage, including whole new ways of thinking about=20
   the original problem.

   The goal of the CUFP workshop is to act as a voice for these
   users of functional programming. The workshop supports the
   increasing viability of functional programming in the
   commercial, governmental, and open-source space by providing a
   forum for professionals to share their experiences and ideas,
   whether those ideas are related to business, management, or
   engineering. The workshop is also designed to enable the
   formation and reinforcement of relationships that further
   the commercial use of functional programming. Providing user
   feedback to language designers and implementors is not a
   primary goal of the workshop, though it will be welcome if it
   occurs.

   information.
