The Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has the=20
following vacancy:=20
=A0
One PhD position on the project
"Efficient Multi-Core Model Checking" (V50.122)=20
=A0
Project description=20
=A0=20
Model checking is one of the most successful formal=20
techniques for automated analysis and finding errors in=20
software and hardware. Nowadays, model checking is used by=20
major companies, like Microsoft and Intel, to improve the=20
quality of their products.=20
=A0=A0=20
The aim of this project is to develop algorithms for model=20
checking (including probabilistic model checking) that can=20
fully exploit the parallelism of the new generations of=20
multi- and many-core processors. The main bottleneck in=20
practical applications of model checking is the state=20
space explosion that has impact on the required memory and=20
run-time. Therefore, we will strive towards designing=20
efficient algorithms that are compatible with the major
techniques for state space reduction, like partial-order or=20
symmetry reduction.=20
=A0
We intend to develop prototype implementations of the new=20
algorithms In model checkers, like Spin and its=20
extensions, as well as the probabilistic model checker=20
MRMC. The prototype implementations will be validated on=20
case studies including models of biological systems.=20

<DIV dir=3Dltr><FONT face=3DTahoma color=3D#000000>The Eindhoven University=
 of Technology (TU/e) has the <BR>following vacancy: <BR>&nbsp;<BR>One post=
doc position on the project<BR>"Efficient Multi-Core Model Checking" (V50.1=
23) <BR>&nbsp; <BR>Project description <BR>&nbsp; <BR>Model checking is one=
 of the most successful formal <BR>techniques for automated analysis and fi=
nding errors in <BR>software and hardware. Nowadays, model checking is used=
 by <BR>major companies, like Microsoft and Intel, to improve the <BR>quali=
ty of their products. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>The aim of this project is to de=
velop algorithms for model <BR>checking (including probabilistic model chec=
king) that can <BR>fully exploit the parallelism of the new generations of =
<BR>multi- and many-core processors. The main bottleneck in <BR>practical a=
pplications of model checking is the state <BR>space explosion that has imp=
act on the required memory and <BR>run-time. Therefore, we will strive
 towards designing <BR>efficient algorithms that are compatible with the ma=
jor <BR>techniques for state space reduction, like partial-order <BR>or sym=
metry reduction. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>We intend to develop prototype implementatio=
ns of the new <BR>algorithms in model checkers, like Spin and its <BR>exten=
sions, as well as the probabilistic model checker <BR>MRMC. The prototype i=
mplementations will be validated on <BR>case studies including models of bi=
ological systems. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>As postdoc, you will: <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * perform scientific research; <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=

 of the <BR>work within the project will be done in the group of prof. <BR>=
dr. Joost-Pieter Katoen at RWTH Aachen University. Prof. <BR>Katoen has int=
