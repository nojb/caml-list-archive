Scope:

Graphs are used almost everywhere when representing or modelling structures
and systems, not only in applied and theoretical computer science, but also
in, e.g., natural and engineering sciences. Graph transformation and graph
grammars are the fundamental modelling paradigms for describing, formalizing,
and analyzing graphs that change over time when modelling, e.g., dynamic data
structures, systems, or models. The International Conference on Graph
Transformation (ICGT) series aims to bring together researchers from different
areas in this context and to provide a forum for presenting new results,
discussing novel ideas and sharing experience. In order to foster a lively
exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme
committee of the ninth edition of ICGT encourages all kinds of contributions
related to graph transformation. Topics of interest include, BUT ARE NOT
LIMITED TO the following subjects:

    - General models of graph transformation (e.g., high-level, adhesive,
      node, edge, and hyperedge replacement systems)
    - Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
    - Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
    - Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
    - Logical aspects of graph transformation
    - Computational models based on graph transformation
    - Structuring and modularization concepts for graph transformation systems
    - Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
    - Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation
    - Modelling and analysis of dynamic data structures
    - Term graph rewriting
    - Graph transformation and Petri nets
    - Ontologies and ontology evolution
    - Graph databases
    - Modelling and realizing software architectures, refactoring, evolution,
      workflows, business processes, access control, security policies,
      service-oriented applications, semantic web, ...
    - Natural language processing, natural computing, bioinformatics,
      quantum computing, ubiquitous computing, visual computing,
      image generation, natural and engineering sciences, ...
    - Model-driven development and model transformation based on
      graph transformation
    - Model checking, program verification, simulation and animation
    - Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages,
      domain-specific languages, and visual languages
    - Graph transformation languages and tool support
    - Efficient algorithms (pattern matching, graph traversal etc.)


The 9th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2016) will be
held in Vienna, Austria, as a STAF event (http://staf2016.conf.tuwien.ac.at/).
The conference takes place under the auspices of EATCS
(http://www.eatcs.org/), EASST (http://www.easst.org/), and IFIP
(http://www.ifip.org/) WG 1.3.

Paper Submission
----------------

Papers are solicited in three categories:

* Research papers (limited to 16 pages in Springer LNCS format)
   describe innovative contributions and are evaluated with respect to
   their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional
   material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final
   version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.

* Case studies (limited to 12 pages in Springer LNCS format)
   describe applications of graph transformations in any application
   domain.

* Tool presentation papers (limited to 12 pages in Springer LNCS
   format) demonstrate the main features and functionality of
   graph-based tools. A tool presentation paper may have an appendix
   with a detailed demo description (up to 5 pages), which will be
   reviewed but not included in the proceedings.

Papers can be submitted athttp://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgt2016.
Submitted papers must use Springer's LNCS format (http://www.springer.com/lncs).
Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of
material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed. The page
limits are strict and include references.

Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (http://www.springer.com/lncs) series.
