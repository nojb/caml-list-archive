Subject: [Caml-list] MSFP 2016: Call for Papers

Sixth Workshop on
MATHEMATICALLY STRUCTURED FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
8 April 2016, in Eindhoven, The Netherlands
A satellite workshop of ETAPS 2016

http://msfp2016.bentnib.org/

The sixth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming
is devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of remarkable
power and abstraction. Where would Haskell be without monads? Functional
reactive programming without temporal logic?  Call-by-push-value without
adjunctions? The list goes on. This workshop is a forum for researchers
who seek to reflect mathematical phenomena in data and control.

The first MSFP workshop was held in Kuressaare, Estonia, in July 2006,
affiliated with MPC 2006 and AMAST 2006. The second MSFP workshop was
held in Reykjavik, Iceland as part of ICALP 2008. The third MSFP
workshop was held in Baltimore, USA, as part of ICFP 2010. The fourth
workshop was held in Tallinn, Estonia, as part of ETAPS 2012. The
fifth workshop was held in Grenoble, France, as part of ETAPS 2014.
