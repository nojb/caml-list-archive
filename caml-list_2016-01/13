The practice and craft of functional programming :: Conference

Compose is a conference for typed functional programmers, focused
specifically on Haskell, OCaml, F#, SML, and related technologies.

Typed functional programming has been taken up widely, by industry and
hobbyists alike. For many of us it has renewed our belief that code
should be beautiful, and that programming can be as enjoyable as it is
practical. Compose is about bringing together functional programmers
of all levels of skill and experience =E2=80=94 from technical leads to
novices, and from long-time hackers to students just getting started.

It will feature a keynote by Eugenia Cheng on her work popularizing
mathematics, two days of great talks, and plans are underway for a
weekend hackathon/unconference.

* Invited Talks:
Eugenia Cheng: How to Bake 'How to Bake Pi': reflections on making
abstract mathematics palatable
