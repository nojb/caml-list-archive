Subject: [Caml-list] UNIF 2016 - Call for Papers

UNIF 2016  - Call for papers

The 30th International Workshop on Unification is the 30th event in a series 
of international meetings devoted to unification theory and its applications.
Unification is concerned with the problem of making two terms equal, finding 
solutions for equations, or making formulas equivalent. It is a fundamental 
process used in a number of fields of computer science, including automated 
reasoning, term rewriting, logic programming, natural language processing, 
program analysis, types, etc. 

The International Workshop on Unification (UNIF) is a yearly forum for 
researchers in unification theory and related fields to meet old and new 
colleagues, to present recent (even unfinished) work, and to discuss new 
ideas and trends. It is also a good opportunity for young researchers and 
scientists working in related areas to get an overview of the current state 
of the art in unification theory. The workshop will be  hosted by the 1st 
International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction 
(FSCD, Porto, June 2016)

Description of the Topic
------------------------
Unification is one of the central notions in automated reasoning and lies at 
the heart of many reasoning systems. Unification is concerned with the problem 
of making two terms equal, either syntactically or modulo a theory. UNIF 2016 
will be the 30th in a series of annual international workshops on unification. 
Previous editions have taken place mostly in Europe (Austria, Denmark, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, UK), but also in the USA and Japan. For more 
details on previous UNIF workshops, please see the UNIF homepage at
    http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~treinen/unif/.
Traditionally, the scope of the UNIF workshops has covered the topic of
unification in a broad sense, encompassing also research in constraint solving,
admissibility of inference rules, and applications such as type checking, 
query answering and cryptographic protocol analysis. A non-exhaustive list 
of topics of interest includes:
+ Unification algorithms, calculi and implementations
+ Equational unification and unification modulo theories
+ Unification in modal, temporal and description logics
+ Admissibility of Inference Rules
+ Narrowing
+ Matching algorithms
+ Constraint solving
+ Combination problems
+ Disunification
+ Higher-Order Unification
+ Type checking and reconstruction
+ Typed unification
+ Complexity issues
+ Query answering
+ Implementation techniques
+ Applications of unification
+ Antiunification/Generalization

Submission Details
------------------
Following the tradition of UNIF, we call for submissions of abstracts (5 pages)
in EasyChair style, to be submitted electronically as PDF files through the 
EasyChair submission site:
    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=unif2016

Abstracts will be evaluated by the Programme Committee (if necessary with 
support from external reviewers) regarding their significance for the 
workshop. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included 
in the informal proceedings of the workshop, available in printed form at 
the workshop and in electronic form from the UNIF homepage:
    http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~treinen/unif/

Based on the number and quality of submissions we will decide whether to
organize a special journal issue.

Important Dates
---------------
+ Paper Submission: May 1, 2016
+ Notif. of Acceptance: May 29 2016
+ Final version: June 5, 2016
