20th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
                              ETAPS 2017
                   Uppsala, Sweden, 23-29 April 2017

                      Call for  Satellite Events


-- ABOUT ETAPS --

The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to Software Science. It is an
annual event held in Europe each spring since 1998. Its twentieth
edition, ETAPS 2017, will take place 23-29 April 2017 in Uppsala,
Sweden.

ETAPS 2017 main conferences, scheduled for 25-28 April, are:

* ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
* FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
* FOSSACS: Foundations of Software Science and=20
      Computation Structures
* POST: Principles of Security and Trust
* TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and=20
      Analysis of Systems

-- SATELLITE EVENTS --

The ETAPS 2017 organizing committee invites proposals for satellite
events (workshops) that will complement the main conferences. They
should fall within the scope of ETAPS. This encompasses all aspects of
the system development process, including specification, design,
implementation, analysis and improvement, as well as the languages,
methodologies and tools which support these activities, covering a
spectrum from practically-motivated theory to soundly-based
practice. Satellite events provide an opportunity to discuss and
report on emerging research approaches and practical experience
relevant to theory and practice of software.

ETAPS 2017 satellite events will be held immediately before and after
the main conferences, on 23-24 April and 29 April.

-- ARRANGEMENTS FOR SATELLITE EVENTS --

The organizers of an ETAPS 2017 satellite are expected to:

* create and maintain a website for the event,
* form a PC, produce a call for papers for the event (if appropriate),
* advertise the event through specialist mailing lists etc. to
  complement the publicity of ETAPS,
* review the submissions received and make acceptance decisions,
* prepare an informal (pre)proceedings for the event (if appropriate),
* prepare the event's program complying with any scheduling
  constraints defined by the ETAPS 2017 organizing committee,
* prepare and organize the publication of a formal (post)proceedings
  (if desired).

The ETAPS 2017 organizing committee will:

* promote the event on the website and in the publicity material of
  ETAPS 2017,
* integrate the event's program into the overall program of the
  conference,
* arrange registration for the event as a component of registration
  for ETAPS,
* collect a participation fee from the registrants,
* produce a compilation USB memory stick of the informal
  (pre)proceedings of the satellite events of ETAPS 2017 and
  distribute this to the registrants,
* provide the event with a meeting room of an appropriate size, A/V
  equipment, coffee breaks and possibly lunch(es).

As a rule, ETAPS will not contribute toward the travel or
accommodation costs of invited speakers or organizers of satellite
events.

-- SUBMISSION OF SATELLITE EVENT PROPOSALS --

Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize satellite events are
invited to submit proposals to the workshop co-chairs Konstantinos
Sagonas and Mohamed Faouzi Atig using the web form at=20
http://www.etaps.org/2017/call-for-workshops .

The following information is requested:

* the name and acronym of the satellite event
* the names and contact information of the organizers
* the duration of the event: one or two days
* the preferred period: 23 April, 24 April, 23-24 April or 29 April
* the expected number of participants
* a brief description (120 words approximately) of the event topic for
  the website and publicity material of ETAPS 2017
* a brief explanation of the event topic and its relevance to ETAPS
* an explanation of the selection procedure of contributions to the
  event, the PC chair and members, if known already, information about
  past editions of the event, if applicable
* any other relevant information, like a special event format, invited
  speakers, demo sessions, special space requirements, etc.
* a tentative schedule for paper submission, notification of
  acceptance and final versions for the (informal pre-)proceedings
  (the ETAPS 2017 organizing committee will need the final files by
  the end of Feb. 2017)
* the plans for formal publication (no formal publication, formal
  proceedings ready by the event, formal post-proceedings, publication
  venue - EPTCS or elsewhere)

The proposals will be evaluated by the ETAPS 2017 organizing committee
on the basis of their assessed benefit for prospective participants of
ETAPS 2017. Prospective organizers may wish to consult the web pages
of previous satellite events as examples:
