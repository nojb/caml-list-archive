2nd INTERNATIONAL WINTER SCHOOL ON BIG DATA

BigDat 2016

Bilbao, Spain

February 8-12, 2016

Organized by:
DeustoTech, University of Deusto
Rovira i Virgili University

http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2016/

********************************************************

--- Regular registration deadline: February 5, 2016 ---

********************************************************

AIM:

BigDat 2016 will be a research training event addressed to graduates and po=
stgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a global scop=
e, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in the critical =
and fast developing area of big data, which covers a large spectrum of curr=
ent exciting research and industrial innovation with an extraordinary poten=
tial for a huge impact on scientific discoveries, medicine, engineering, bu=
siness models, and society itself. Renowned academics and industry pioneers=
 will lecture and share their views with the audience.

Most big data subareas will be displayed, namely: foundations, infrastructu=
re, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications. =
Main challenges of analytics, management and storage of big data will be id=
entified through 4 keynote lectures, 18 six-hour courses, and 1 round table=
, which will tackle the most active and promising topics. The organizers ar=
e convinced that outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most m=
otivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event. An op=
en session will give participants the opportunity to present their own work=
 in progress in 5 minutes.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduates and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal pre-=
requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will be diffe=
rences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed f=
or some of them. BigDat 2016 is also appropriate for more senior people who=
 want to keep themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. =
All will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researche=
rs, industry leaders and innovators.

REGIME:

In addition to keynotes, 2-3 courses will run in parallel during the whole =
event. Participants will be able to freely choose the courses they will be =
willing to attend as well as to move from one to another.

VENUE:

BigDat 2016 will take place in Bilbao, the capital of the Basque Country re=
gion, famous for its gastronomy and the seat of the Guggenheim Museum. The =
venue will be:

DeustoTech, School of Engineering
University of Deusto
Avda. Universidades, 24
48014 Bilbao
