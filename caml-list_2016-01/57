Subject: [Caml-list] release of OCPWin, and wxOCaml

--001a11443f0aa34a2105295d6d9b
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hi,

  I would like to announce a new release of OCPWin, the OCamlPro binary
distribution of OCaml for Windows. To test it, follow the links on the page:

http://www.typerex.org/ocpwin.html

OCPWin is a full OCaml binary distribution for Windows, available for both
4.02.1 and 4.01.0 in 32 and 64 bits. It is distributed as either a
Graphical Installer or Zip archives. OCPWin does not rely on Cygwin, and
can be used
directly from a Windows terminal, or better a Git Bash terminal. OCPWin
allows multiple installs on the same computer, each distribution being
managed similarly to a switch in opam, using a tool called "ocpwin.exe"
(`ocpwin -list`, `ocpwin -install SWITCH`).

It is packaged in 3 different flavors:
- msvc : a distribution of OCaml relying on the MSVC compilers (Microsoft
Visual Studio). All the versions of MSVC since 9.0 to 14.0 are supported,
and automatically detected (they can be selected using an env variable
called OCPWIN_MSVC).
- mingw: it is a self-contained OCaml+MinGW distribution, where MinGW (a
gcc for Windows) has been minimized to only contain the strictly needed
files for OCaml;
- full-mingw: it is a self-contained OCaml+MinGW distribution, with a full
MinGW distribution;

Note that even MinGW flavors can be configured after installation to use
MSVC instead of MinGW.

The changes also include using "ocpwin.exe" to register OCPWin in the user
PATH variable, instead of NSIS, to avoid the PATH-corrupting bug that
previous versions have suffered from. Both graphical installers and zip
archives use this new capability.

Support of MSVC has been tested by successfully compiling the last master
branch of wxOCaml ( http://www.typerex.org/ocplib-wxOCaml.html ) for all
binary versions of wxWidgets, version 3.02 (
https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.0.2 , VC 9.0, 10.0,
11.0 and 12.0). See the README.ocpwin file of wxOCaml.

Feedback is welcome !
