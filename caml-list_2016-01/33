I'd recommend using ctypes 0.4+ stub generation support which can bind
macro values and detect struct layout at an early compilation stage.
You can see it in use to do this in my ocaml-unix-errno library
<https://github.com/dsheets/ocaml-unix-errno>. One benefit with this
approach is greater static checking and c <-> ocaml type safety.

If you continue using dynamic bindings, two lonker flags may be of use to you:

--no-as-needed : on recent Ubuntu distributions, gcc automatically
includes the --as-needed flag which drops symbols that are not
referenced. Unfortunately, clang does not understand this flag so you
need to have a conditional in your build system to detect the compiler
in use if you want a cross-platform library.

-E : The Exports local symbols which are statically linked into a
binary into the dynamic symbol table so that they can be found with
dlsym.

You can use these with gcc like -Wl,-E for example.

Hope this helps,

David Sheets
