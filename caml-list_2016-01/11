OK, thanks for the info, so here is a recipe that worked for me:

wget https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/archive/master.tar.gz
tar xzf master.tar.gz
cd opam-repository-master
opam-admin make --resolve PKG
# here I needed to remove
# ocamlbuild from the depends field in the opam file of several packages
# so that the solver finally succeed, so opam-admin-make probably has
# a bug
opam repo add offline $PWD
opam repo remove default # then I have only one opam repository setup
# here I turned off my network card
opam update
opam install PKG # worked using tarballs from the local-disk only
