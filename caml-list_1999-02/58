Portable C-FFI for OCAML 2.01

Callback functions are now supported as well...

I have implemented a high-level C-Foreign Function Interface (CFFI),for
Win/NT 4.0 x86, along the lines suggested by Huelsbergen's paper for SML/NJ.
The OCAML version is a bit more flexible than the one currently in SML/NJ,
but callback functions have not yet been implemented.
