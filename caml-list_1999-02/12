None of this is supported natively in the language (OCaml's "int" type
and its associated operations is 31 or 63 bits, signed).

However, it's easy to define your "machine word" type as an abstract
type and implement it via small C functions.

Jean-Christophe Filliatre's "int32" library is a good starting point:
