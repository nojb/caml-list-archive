Nice idea! Maybe it would make sense to part the development access
(CVS) and the download section and use your system for the management
of the latter.

But...

Indeed ;-)

I entered a link, but the info-link got a wrong prefix. I wanted to
delete it and it did so - with Jean-Christophe Filliatre's entry! Sorry,
Jean-Christoph! ;-)

Maybe the first thing we could put under control of the new CVS-server
at INRIA is your system - then we could immediately start debugging and
extending it on a more public basis so that we can really use it for
production purposes...

Best regards,
Markus
