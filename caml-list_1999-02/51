Hi,

Here is a first approximation of what we have discussed some weeks ago:
The Ocaml Link Database. It is a web application where everybody can
simply enter links to software he or she wants to contribute. The
data model is rather simple: every item is described by
title, subtitle, release number, the owner of the item, and
two hyperlinks, one called "Info", the other called "Download".

Note that it is not possible to upload files, I fear that this might
be abused.

Before you can enter items, you must identify yourself. Everybody has
a password such that he or she can only modify his or her own items.
It is simple to get such a password; you only have to fill out a 
form and you will automatically get it.

As the age of the application is only several hours there might be
still terrible bugs in it. So I think it should be regarded as
test application that I present you for further discussion and, of
course, bug hunting.

The URL where you can find it is:

	http://www.npc.de/gerd/ocamllinkdb/

The application is of course written in Ocaml. For the curious, the
sources are in

	http://www.npc.de/gerd/ocamllinkdb/src.tgz

The whole thing is not a substitute for a real repository that 
developers helps to exchange source in a much better way. It is
intended to make visible what has already been developed and what
can be possibly reused for different tasks, i.e. it represents the
public side of user-contributed software.

If the application meets your requirements, I could place a 
final release on the same server. (It is a pure Web server,
so I can't put a CVS server on it, too.)

Gerd
