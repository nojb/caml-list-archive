Yes, unfortunately, we may have missed some functions in ocamltk41, and 
probably
miss most of the functions added in Tcl/Tk 8.0.
There is always the solution of adding entries in the Widgets.src file of
the ocamltk distribution, or simply create new .src files and apply the
"tkcompiler" to generate the stubs.
In this case, I would expect that something like

module tkscale {
  function (float) get ["tk"; "scale"]
  function () set ["tk"; "scale"; float]
  }

would be enough to lift the "tk scale" command. However, a brief look
at Welch's book does not confirm that this command can be used to do
what you describe (eg converting from Pixels to Millimeters).
