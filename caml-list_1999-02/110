Tuareg 1.36 is now available.

It's goal is to provide a good support for Caml editing and debugging.
See the README file and on-line help for details.

Tuareg home page is
http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/~acohen/tuareg
For direct access to the archive, use
http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/~acohen/tuareg-mode

Major improvements thanks to several contributions (see HISTORY file),
including :
- Phrase detection enhanced, with new short-cuts
- Improved interactive mode, with smarter coloring and error detection
- Extensive Tuareg menu
- Direct access to OCaml manual and library
- Direct access to definitions (values, types, etc.)
- Many bugs removed

This version requires Emacs/XEmacs 19.3x, or more.

Tuareg is a constantly evolving product: I'll be glad to receive bug
reports and comments! I apologize for long answer delays, but
my PhD manuscript keeps me busy at the moment...
