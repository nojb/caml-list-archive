I could not reproduce the problem. I'll add some more checks on error
conditions, and perhaps some logging. And, of course, I'll add 
many comments, because of...

I will do that.

We should find then another way of communication as I assume that most readers
of the Caml list are not interested in the details of a specific software
project. As long as the number of developers is relatively small, exchange of
ordinary mail would suffice. I will place a "MAIL" file in the CVS directory
where everybody who is interested in such mails can enter his or her name.

I have already received feedback about the user interface of the database:

- Is it ok to use frames for the UI? Of course, the current functionality
  is so simple that an interface without frames would be possible. Perhaps we
  should at least provide a frameless interface for queries only.

- There should be more ways to query information. It is interestant to sort by
  the date when the entry was added to the database (or changed) 

- Perhaps there should be more attributes at all: date of insertion, 
  kind of project (reusable module, application, documentation, ...),
  standardized keywords that can be searched. 
   It depends on how much the database is used whether these additions are
  sensible.

- Perhaps the entries should be arranged like a spreadsheet, and not as a
  list of items

I think there should be some discussion about these points
