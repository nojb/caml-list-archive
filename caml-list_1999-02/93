To save anyone else the bother, I'll point out the error of
my ways myself.  

I think SML has (had?) a check which stopped you accidentally
ignoring a function value before a semi-colon.  However, since
functions are first class citizens, why shouldn't you want to ignore
them just as you might ignore a list or integer value?

So instead, I propose you write an explicit ignore function for each
type you want to ignore:

val ignore_int : int -> unit
val ignore_fred : fred -> unit
...
