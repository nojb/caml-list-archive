Hi,

Our group wrote several implementation of sets - based on splay trees,
red-black trees, etc. Implementation based on the splay trees turned out to
be much faster than the OCAML Set module when the "mem" operation is more
frequent than add/union/remove/inter/diff operations. But on our usage
pattern it turned out that red-black trees are much faster than both Set and
SplaySet. If somebody is interested, I can put the code on ftp.
