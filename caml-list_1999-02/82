I have a few comments about new warnings in ocaml.

* having a warning when a function doesn't return unit in a sequence
may catch some bugs, but this is a pain with imperative programming
style, where you may not be interested by the result of a function but
just by its side-effects. Of course you can switch off the warning,
but I'm not sure having it on is a good default, since the default
mode should be normative.

ex. wrong code
	x = 3; ...
	  ^ should be <-

ex. right code
	f x y; ...
where f: t1 -> t2 -> int has some interesting side-effect.
	

* another common error with imperative code is partial application in
a toplevel call inside a module

let _ =
  somefunc hsj hjfhfd

somefunc takes 3 arguments but is only given 2. Since this is a
let-definition no warning is printed while such a partial application
is pretty meaningless.

Regards,

	Jacques
