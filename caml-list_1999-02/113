Hi everyone,

Has anyone written a CORBA interface to OCaml. Actually, the best thing
for me would be something that interoperates with the new IIOP based java
RMI.
I might be willing to do some porting of existing code that does most of
what I need. However, in either case it has to be freely distributeable
(GPL is fine.)

Thanks,

Roy
