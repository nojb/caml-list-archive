(Sorry only in English.)

The argument of a variant type constructor cannot be an anonymous record
type, i.e.:

  type foo = One of {one: int} | Two of {two: string}

is rejected at the first {.  Of course this is easy to work around, just
give the record types names:

  type foo_one = {one: int}
  type foo_two = {two: string}
  type foo = One of foo_one | Two of foo_two

But, just out of curiosity, is there a quick explanation of why it is this
way?

thanks & peace,
