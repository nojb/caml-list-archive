Syntactically, It's not pretty, but I can live with it.  I shied away
from this because I was not sure about the result of

  module F = FreeRing ( some ring ...)
  compare (F.unit_bad ()) (F.unit_bad ())

in this case.  Does O'Caml guarantee that the expression will always
evaluate to 0?  [ Currently it appears to, but can I depend on it? ]

I had this confused, thanks for pointing it out!
