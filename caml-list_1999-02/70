Subject: Is there a tool to generate documentation from O'Caml source files?
X-Mailer: VM 6.62 under Emacs 20.3.1
Sender: weis

In reading the *.mli files in the the .../stdlib directory of the
O'Caml distribution I've noticed that the documentation of the
standard library is extremely similar to the comments in the *.mli
files.  Was the documentation automatically generated from the *.mli
files?  If so, is the tool to do this available, or could it be made
available?
