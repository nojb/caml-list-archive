Yes, we did this too.  This certainly gets rid of the warning about
the type to the left of ";", but it doesn't address the problem of
accidentally using a partially applied function.

eg      let _ = List.map f
	in print_endline "done map..."

Are there any plans to provide a warning for this in ocaml?
