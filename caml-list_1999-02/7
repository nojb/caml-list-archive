Gee, OCAML is such a pleasure to use, and invariably, when I have a bug, =
it turns out to be in my external C routines. It sure would be nice if =
OCAML is someday extended to support a wider variety of datatypes (e.g., =
bytes, shorts, longs, floats, etc.) so that I can just skip this =
wasteful practice of coding in C. We could then enjoy using OCAML for =
all the systems level programming chores that plague us on a daily =
basis!

I still can't get over the amazement I have when, after making =
substantial architectural changes to existing code, that it works so =
well and without any bugs! I have never seen anything quite like it =
before!
