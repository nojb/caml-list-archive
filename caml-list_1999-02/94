This is a nit, but I've noticed that for the bytecode compiler that 

let _ = foo() in ()

generates more instructions than for

foo(); ()

In particular, there is an extra "push" instruction (presumably for the
binding to _) in the former.  Is there any way to avoid this instruction
given that we know the binding is not going to really occur?
