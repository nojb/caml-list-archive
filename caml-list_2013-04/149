> ./test_samplingM
> rejection_sample: done 100 worlds
> Fatal error: exception Assert_failure("samplingM.ml", 16, 9)

Luckily, the assertion failure is harmless. Here is the complete code
where the failure occurs:

let tflip2_shared () =   (* sharing of flips *)
  let v = flip 0.5 in
  v && v;;
let () = assert (
  sample_rejection (random_selector 1) 100 tflip2_shared
    = [(0.48, V true); (0.52, V false)]);;

Essentially, we flip a coin 100 times and see how many times it comes
out head. The `random source' (random_selector 1) seeds the random
generator with a fixed value -- 1 in this case. Therefore, re-running
the code should give the same results. Alas, the implementation of
random number generator may change -- and it did between OCaml 3.11
and OCaml 3.12. Therefore, given the same seed, the sequence of
produced numbers can be different. Also, the behavior of the random
number generator may be platform-specific.

So, the good news is that the failure is harmless. The bad news is that
the change in the random number generator or the platform has
invalidated the regression tests. To see that Hansei functions
properly, one has to check the results manually. For example, 

  sample_rejection (random_selector 1) 100 tflip2_shared

may now produce  [(0.49, V true); (0.51, V false)]) or
[(0.52, V true); (0.48, V false)], etc.

Very interesting! I do use GCC 4.2.1 but on FreeBSD. I guess the
problem is platform-specific (or GCC-backend specific). It could
happen that GCC 4.2.1 over-optimized on MacOS, and the later versions
of GCC have corrected the problem. Thank you for the investigation!
