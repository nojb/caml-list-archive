Can't tell about last year, but I visited both CUFP and OUD twice=20=20
(independently), and it was ok (well, I gave talks on OUD). But this is=20=
=20
not my point - I'm more worried about the audience the event attracts,=20=
=20
and also about the character in total. I mean it's a difference whether=20=
=20
you have an event of its own (even if small) or if it is part of a=20=20
larger conference, where you certainly also have visitors just seeking=20=
=20
entertainment for a bridge day.

You know I'm one of the guys who are always worried if the most=20=20
convenient path is taken.
