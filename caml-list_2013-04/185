Remember me of a paper I read some years ago that was measuring the effect of
the various optimisation levels of gcc against the effect of addresses choices
(randomised using environment strings of various lengths!), and which
conclusion was that the effect of -O3 compared to -O2 was less than the effect
of "choosing" a good environment string :-)

Couldn't find it again using Google ; maybe someone remember this paper?
