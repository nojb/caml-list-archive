*** The registration deadline for this year's Oregon PL Summer School has b=
een extended to April 30th.=20

This year's Oregon Programming Languages Summer School will take place from=
 July 22nd to August 3rd.  Full information on registration and scholarship=
s an be found here:
   http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool

The school has a long and successful tradition (sponsored by the NSF, ACM S=
IGPLAN, and industry).  It covers current research in the theory and practi=
ce of programming languages.  Material is presented at a tutorial level tha=
t will help graduate students and researchers from academia or industry und=
erstand the critical issues and open problems confronting the field.  Prere=
quisites are an elementary knowledge of logic and mathematics, as covered i=
n undergraduate classes on discrete mathematics, and some knowledge of prog=
ramming languages at the level of an undergraduate survey course.=20
A new feature this year is a Coq boot camp session, to be held on July 21st=
 -- one day before the summer school officially begins.  The boot camp will=
 provide a one-day, intensive, hands-on introduction to the practical mecha=
nics of the Coq proof assistant.  More information is available at the summ=
er school website.=20

This year's program is titled Types, Logic, and Verification.  The speakers=
 and topics include:=20

Amal Ahmed -- Logical Relations
Northeastern University

Robert Harper -- Type Theory Foundations
Carnegie Mellon University

Dan Licata -- Dependently-Typed Programming in Agda
Carnegie Mellon University and Institute for Advanced Study=20

Greg Morrisett -- Coq as a Programming Language
Harvard University

Simon Peyton-Jones -- Adventures with Types in Haskell
Microsoft Research

Frank Pfenning -- Linear Logic and Session-based Concurrency
Carnegie Mellon University

Andrew Tolmach -- Software Foundations in Coq
Portland State University

Stephanie Weirich -- Designing Dependently-Typed Programming Languages
University of Pennsylvania

Steve Zdancewic -- Verifying LLVM Optimizations in Coq
University of Pennsylvania

We hope you can join us for this excellent program!
