It should be exactly the same speed. The same bytecode interpreter is=20=20
running.

This is just not the way it is supposed to work. OCaml is primarily a=20=20
compiler language, and scripting only an add-on mode, which is mainly=20=20
useful for testing, or as driver, but not really beyond that.

The best you can do here with standard utilities is to split your=20=20
script into two files:

- One "loader" that contains the scripting directives to load
   everything, e.g.

   #use "topfind";;
   #require "unix";;
   #use "impl.ml";;

- The real implementation (impl.ml) not using any directives. This
   implementation can be independently compiled with ocamlc or ocamlopt.

ocamlfind is only a wrapper around the compiler, basically it=20=20
translates -package options into the list of compiler switches requires=20=
=20
to link a package. ocamlfind cannot change the language.

Maybe Martin's utility ocamlscript is also useful for you:
