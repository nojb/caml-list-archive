                         CALL FOR PAPERS

               European Conference on Service-Oriented
                    and Cloud Computing (ESOCC'13)

                 Malaga, Spain, 11-13 September, 2013
                    http://esocc2013.lcc.uma.es

                 supported by IFIP WG 2.14/6.12/8.10

ABOUT ESOCC

The “European Conference on Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing”
(ESOCC) is the premier conference on the advances in the state of the
art and practice of Service-Oriented Computing and Cloud Computing in
Europe. ESOCC has evolved from the ECOWS (European Conference on Web
Services) conference series, after the Steering Committee decided to
renew and broaden its scope, and to start a new conference series on
advanced topics of service-oriented and cloud computing. The first
edition of the new series, ESSOC 2012, was successfully held in
Bertinoro, Italy, and will be continued by ESOCC 2013 in Malaga, Spain.
The main objectives of this conference are to facilitate the exchange
between researchers and practitioners in the areas of SOC and Cloud
Computing and to foster future collaborations in Europe and beyond.
ESOCC 2013 will include invited talks, presentations of selected
research papers and an industrial track with the participation of top
researchers from industry. ESOCC 2013 will also include a PhD
symposium and a series of satellite workshops.

BACKGROUND

The continued success of service-oriented distributed applications has
shown that tightly coupled software systems may be useful for niche
markets, whereas loosely coupled software systems have proven to be more
flexible, adaptive and often more appropriate for practical applications.
Loose coupling makes it easier for a given system to interact with other
system components − including legacy systems − that have been developed
independently somewhere in a heterogeneous universe of services. Thus,
service-oriented applications can evolve more easily during their
lifespan and adapt better to changing or even unpredictable environments.
In such scenarios, cloud computing enables a new execution paradigm for
distributed software application where resources can be shared, optimally
realized as well as utilised and exchanged between heterogeneous execution
platforms and the cloud, so as to achieve fast response times and to
ensure immersive and non-interrupted user experience.

Services today are developed independently, deployed as well as freely
composed, and they can be implemented in a variety of technologies – a
fact which is of particular importance from a business perspective.
Similarly, cloud computing aims at enabling mobility as well as device,
platform and/or service independence by offering centralized sharing of
resources. It promotes interoperability, portability and security
standards,
and raises a completely new set of security issues. On the implementation
side, essential agreement has been reached on integration technologies and
consensus has emerged in today's middleware market. Customers use web
technologies extensively; however, service developers, providers, and
integrators need to create methods, tools and techniques to support
cost-effective and secure development and use of dependable devices,
platforms, services and service-oriented applications in the cloud.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

ESOCC 2013 seeks original, high quality papers related to all aspects
of Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing, which constitute the main
technology available to date for implementing service-oriented
architectures and cloud computing. Topics of interest to the Research
and Industry Tracks include, but are not limited to:

   * Business Process Management and Web Services.
   * Cloud Services Management and Composition using Web Services.
   * Dynamic and Adaptive Web Services.
   * Economics Models and Web Services.
   * Enterprise Architecture and Web Services.
   * Emerging Trends of Service Composition and Mashups.
   * Experience reports of novel applications of Service-Oriented and
     Cloud Computing in Health, Commerce, Finance, Telecom, Scientific
     Computing and other domains.
   * Service modelling, service-oriented analysis and design.
   * Formal Methods for Web Services.
   * Frameworks for Building Web Service-Based Applications.
   * Architectural Models for Cloud Computing.
   * Identity and Access Management using Web Services.
   * Mobile Web Services.
   * Model-Driven Web Service Engineering.
   * Next Generation Web Services Middleware and Service Repositories.
   * Service quality and service interface design guidelines.
   * RESTful for Clouds and Web Services.
   * Self-Organizing Service Oriented and Cloud Architectures.
   * Semantic Web Services.
   * Service Level Agreements for Web services.
   * Service-Oriented Business Collaboration.
   * SOA Governance and Web Services.
   * Web Services for Grids and Clouds.
   * Web Services in Service-Oriented Environments.
   * Web Services Life-Cycles.
   * Web Services Security and Privacy.
   * Big Data Management.
   * Cloud Interoperability and Federation.
   * Emerging Trends in Storage, Computation and Network Clouds.

ESOCC 2013 solicits both new research papers (in the main track) as well
as
reports on practical experiences from industry (industry track). However,
papers on existing products or product marketing information are not
within
the scope of the ESOCC 2013 Industry Track.

specific topics in the Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing related
domains.
Workshop proposals must consist of the following items:
   * name and acronym of the workshop,
   * motivation: short (up to 1 page) scientific justification of the

     topic and scope, its significance and relevance to ESOCC, and the
particular
     benefits of the workshop to the service-oriented and cloud computing
     communities,
   * name, affiliation, and short (up to 10 lines) bio of the workshop
     organizers,
   * contact organizer,
   * desired length of the workshop (half day or full day),
   * estimate of the audience size,
   * proposed format and agenda (e.g., demo sessions, tutorials, etc.),

PhD SYMPOSIUM

The ESOCC 2013 PhD Symposium is an international forum for PhD students
working in any of the areas addressed by the ESOCC conference. The
main aim of the Symposium is to give PhD students an opportunity to
present their research activity and perspectives, to critically
discuss them with other PhD students and with established researchers
in the area, and to get fruitful feedback and advices on their research
activity. PhD students working in any area addressed by the ESOCC
conference can submit a short report providing a clear statement of the
problem they intend to address, motivating the interest and novelty of
the underlying research challenges, demonstrating the ideas by examples,
and describing the proposed research plan and expected results. Reports
should not exceed 6 pages formatted according to the LNCS proceedings
guidelines. The papers should be authored by the PhD student and should
indicate the name of her/his supervisor. Submissions must be sent by
