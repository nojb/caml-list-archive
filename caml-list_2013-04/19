              FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS (DEADLINE EXTENSION)
                     14th International Symposium
                Trends in Functional Programming 2013
                Brigham Young University, Utah, U.S.A.
                           May 14-16, 2013
         http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/conferences/2013-tfp/

[The deadline  has been  extended two  weeks from  April 2nd  to April
16th.]

The  symposium  on  Trends  in  Functional  Programming  (TFP)  is  an
international forum  for researchers with interests in  all aspects of
functional  programming, taking  a broad  view of  current  and future
trends  in  the area.   It  aspires to  be  a  lively environment  for
presenting the  latest research results, and  other contributions (see
below), described in draft papers  submitted prior to the symposium. A
formal post-symposium refereeing process  then selects a subset of the
articles  presented   at  the  symposium  and   submitted  for  formal
publication.

Selected  papers will  be published  as  a Springer  Lecture Notes  in
Computer Science (LNCS: http://www.springer.com/lncs) volume.

TFP 2013  will be the main  event of a pair  of functional programming
events at  Brigham Young University.  First will be  the International
Workshop on  Trends in  Functional Programming  in Education  and then
TFP.

The TFP  symposium is  the heir of  the successful series  of Scottish
Functional Programming  Workshops. Previous TFP symposia  were held in
Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003, in  Munich (Germany) in 2004, in Tallinn
(Estonia) in  2005, in Nottingham (UK)  in 2006, in New  York (USA) in
2007, in Nijmegen (The Netherlands)  in 2008, in Komarno (Slovakia) in
2009, in  Oklahoma (USA) in  2010, in Madrid  (Spain) in 2011,  and in
St. Andrews (UK)  in 2012.  For further general  information about TFP
please see the TFP homepage at http://www.tifp.org/.


             SCOPE OF THE SYMPOSIUM


The  symposium recognises that  new trends  may arise  through various
routes.  As part  of  the  symposium's focus  on  trends we  therefore
identify the following  five article categories. High-quality articles
are solicited in any of these categories:

 Research Articles:    leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
 Position Articles:    on what new trends should or should not be
 Project Articles:     descriptions of recently started new projects
 Evaluation Articles:  what lessons can be drawn from a finished project
 Overview Articles:    summarising work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles  must   be  original  and  not   submitted  for  simultaneous
publication  to any  other  forum.  They may  consider  any aspect  of
functional programming:  theoretical, implementation-oriented, or more
experience oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques
to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.

Articles on the following subject areas are particularly welcome:
. Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
. Functional programming in the cloud
. Functional programming in education
. High performance functional computing
. Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
. Dependently typed functional programming
. Validation and verification of functional programs
. Using functional techniques to verify/reason about imperative/object-orie=
nted programs
. Debugging for functional languages
. Functional programming in different application areas: security, mobility=
,=20
    telecommunications applications, embedded systems, global computing, gr=
ids, etc.
. Interoperability with imperative programming languages
. Novel memory management techniques
. Program transformation techniques
. Empirical performance studies
. Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
. New implementation strategies
. Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you  are in doubt  on whether your  article is within the  scope of
TFP, please  contact the TFP 2013 program  chair, Jay McCarthy,
at tfp2013 at easychair.org


             BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD


TFP  traditionally  pays   special  attention  to  research  students,
acknowledging  that students  are  almost by  definition  part of  new
subject trends.  A student  paper is one  for which the  authors state
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed
as first authors,  and a student would present the  paper. A prize for
the best student paper is awarded each year.


             SUBMISSION AND DRAFT PROCEEDINGS


Acceptance of papers  for presentation at the symposium is  based on a
lightweight screening process of extended  abstracts (2 to 10 pages in
length) or  full papers (max 16  pages). Accepted abstracts are  to be
completed to full  papers before the symposium for  publication in the
draft proceedings. Latex style files are available from Springer's web
page (llncs2e.zip), and are linked below.

The  submission must clearly  indicate which  category it  belongs to:
research, position, project, evaluation,  or overview paper. It should
also  indicate  whether  the  main  author  or  authors  are  research
students. Formatting  details can  be found at  the TFP  2013 website.
Paper submission is done through TFP13's EasyChair page:
  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtfp2013

Important dates (2013):

The  papers of  the  local  proceedings will  also  be made  available
on-line under  some copyright conditions,  with which all  authors are
asked to agree.


             POST-SYMPOSIUM REFEREEING AND PUBLICATION


In addition to  the symposium draft proceedings, we  will continue the
previous  years'  decision  of  publishing a  high-quality  subset  of
contributions in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series.   Proceedings of  the last  three instances  of TFP  have been
published  as LNCS  6546  (TFP10),  LNCS 7193  (TFP11),  and LNCS  TBA
(TFP12).  All  TFP authors  will be invited  to submit  revised papers
after the  symposium. These will  be refereed using  normal conference
standards and a  subset of the submitted papers,  over all categories,
will  be selected  for publication.   Papers will  be judged  on their
contribution to the research area with appropriate criteria applied to
each category of paper.

Student papers will  be given extra feedback by  the Program Committee
in order to  assist those unfamiliar with the  publication process and
to help in improving the quality of the paper.
