Subject: [Caml-list] FHPC 2013: Call for papers

=====================================================================
                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                                FHPC 2013

                     The 2nd ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
                  Functional High-Performance Computing

                           Boston, Massachusets
                            September 23, 2013

                    http://www.hiperfit.dk/fhpc13.html

Co-located with the International Conference on Functional Programming
                                (ICFP 2013)

Submission Deadline: June 14, 2013 (anywhere on earth)
=====================================================================

The FHPC workshop aims at bringing together researchers exploring uses
of functional (or more generally, declarative or high-level) programming
technology in application domains where large-scale computations arise
naturally and high performance is essential. Such computations would
typically -- but not necessarily -- involve execution on highly parallel
systems ranging from multi-core multi-processor systems to graphics
accelerators (GPGPUs), reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs), large-scale
compute clusters or any combination thereof. It is becoming apparent
that radically new and well founded methodologies for programming such
systems are required to address their inherent complexity and to
reconcile execution performance with programming productivity.

The aim of the meeting is to enable sharing of results, experiences,
and novel ideas about how high-level, declarative specifications of
computationally challenging problems can serve as highly transparent,
maintainable, and portable code that approaches (or even exceeds) the
performance of machine-oriented imperative implementations.

Each FHPC workshop proposes a particular theme for applications where
high-performance computing and/or functional programming technology
can be applied. For FHPC 2013, the theme is "Large-Scale Simulation",
traditionally one of the main driving forces behind supercomputing.
A large fraction of compute cycles in supercomputers worldwide is spent
on simulation tasks, for various engineering tasks, drug design and
other medical simulations, and in different natural science domains.
Declarative languages have potential to radically change development
practice and workflow for simulation software in these areas.
Hence, we particularly encourage submission of application-oriented
contributions in the area of simulation.
As a general rule, while proposing the theme, the workshop welcomes
submissions from all relevant application domains as well as those
describing general work on the theory and practice of declarative
high-performance computing.

Proceedings:
============

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital Library.

* Submission Deadline: 14 June 2013 (anywhere on earth)
* Author Notification: 11 July 2013
* Final Papers Due   : 25 July 2013

Submitted papers must be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
according to the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (double column, 9pt format).
See http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm for more information
and style files. The page limit is 12 pages. Submission deadlines and
page limit are firm.

The FHPC workshops adhere to the ACM SIGPLAN policies regarding programme
committee contributions and republication. Any paper submitted must adhere
to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy. PC member submissions are welcome,
but will be reviewed to a higher standard.

Travel Support:
===============

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such
as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC programme, see its web page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).
