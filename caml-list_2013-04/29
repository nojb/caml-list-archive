In deed, this is all interesting and encouraging, and there is no=20=20
question that CUFP is an important event. For CUFP, I don't see any=20=20
problem of colocating it with ICFP. For the researchers this is, as=20=20
Martin points out in his special way, also a source of motivation. For=20=

OUD, the topics are different, though - it's more practical problems,=20=20
questions of OCaml's roadmap, and generally more technical. So I'd make=20=

there a difference.
