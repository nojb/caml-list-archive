Subject: Re: [Caml-list] modified error messages for ocamlc

One use case would be supporting other editors in an easier way. I
just tried OCaml with Geany, and apparently the people that wrote
Geany's OCaml mode didn't bother with a custom error regexp parser. If
we had a command-line option to the compiler to produce gnu-standard
error messages, that would be a non-issue.

I think a patch affecting the error and warning-printing functions of
the Location module (parsing/location.ml) should be a very satisfying
first step (what kind of errors are you thinking about that aren't
handled by these functions?). I'm considering writing such a patch.
