Subject: [Caml-list] Book reviewers wanted

Hello,

I have prepared a book "OCaml from the Very Beginning" which will be 
published in the next few months.

If you have been involved in teaching OCaml to people who have never 
programmed before in any language, either academically or more 
informally (or have a special interest in this situation), and feel you 
can spare a little time to review a draft, please drop me a note by email.

(A paid technical review will also be done -- this adds to rather than 
replaces that.)

If you've already seen an earlier draft, no need to write -- I'll also 
be sending this draft to the same people as last time.

Thanks,

--
