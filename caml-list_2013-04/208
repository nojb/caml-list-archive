RV'13, the Fourth International Conference on Runtime Verification,
will take place at INRIA Rennes, France, from 24 to 27 September 2013.

DEADLINE EXTENSION

The deadlines for RV'13 have been extended to *** 12 May ***.

INVITED SPEAKERS

Klaus Ostermann, University of Marburg, Germany
Viktor Kuncak, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland
Martin Leucker, University of Lubeck, Germany

PROGRAM COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRS

Saddek Bensalem, VERIMAG, Grenoble, France
Axel Legay, INRIA Rennes, France

ASSOCIATED WORKSHOP: SMC 2013

SMC 2013, the First Workshop on Statistical Model Checking, will take
place at INRIA Rennes, France, on 23 September 2013.  The workshop is
associated with RV'13.

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

As with previous editions, RV'13 will host a few invited tutorials. These
are three-hour presentations on a selected topic.  Additionally, tutorial
presenters will be offered to publish a paper of up to twenty pages in
the LNCS conference proceedings.

A proposal for a tutorial must contain the subject of the tutorial, a
proposed timeline, a note on  previous similar tutorials (if applicable)
and the differences to this incarnation, and a biography of the presenter.
It must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines and not
exceed 2 pages.  To submit a tutorial, send an email to
rv2013-info@lists.gforge.inria.fr

CALL FOR PAPERS

RV'13 will have two paper categories: regular and tool demonstration
papers. Papers in both categories will be reviewed by the program
committee.

- Regular papers (page limit 15 pages) must present original, unpublished
results. Applications of runtime verification are particularly welcome.
- Tool demonstration papers (page limit 5 pages) should briefly introduce
the problem solved by the tool and give the outline of the demonstration.

The RV'13 proceedings will be published as a volume of the LNCS series
at Springer. Submissions must be formatted according to Springer LNCS
guidelines. If necessary, the submission may be supplemented with a
clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of
the program committee.

Submission of papers to RV'13 is handled through EasyChair. The
submission link is https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rv13

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission: 12 May 2013 
Paper submission: *** 12 May 2013 ***
Tutorial submission: 5 May 2013
Tutorial notification: 12 May 2013
Paper notification: 17 June 2013
Final version: 15 July 2013

SCOPE

Runtime verification is concerned with monitoring and analysis of soft-
ware and hardware system executions.  Runtime verification techniques
are crucial for system correctness and reliability; they are signif-
icantly more powerful and versatile than conventional testing, and more
practical than exhaustive formal verification.  Runtime verification can
be used prior to deployment, for verification and debugging purposes,
and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety and security,
and for providing fault containment and recovery.

TOPICS

- specification languages and formalisms for traces
- specification mining
- program instrumentation
- monitor construction techniques
- logging, recording, and replay
- fault detection, localization, recovery and repair
- program steering and adaptation
- metrics and statistical information gathering
- combination of static and dynamic analyses
- program execution visualization
