Subject: [Caml-list] The 5th Coq Workshop: last call!

================================================================================
The Fifth Coq Workshop (2013)
http://coq.inria.fr/coq-workshop/2013
Colocated with the 4th International Conference on Interactive Theorem
Proving (ITP 2013), Rennes, France
================================================================================

The Coq Workshop series brings together Coq users, developers, and
contributors.  While conferences like ITP provide a venue for
traditional research papers, the Coq Workshop focuses on strengthening
the Coq community and providing a forum for discussing practical issues,
including the future of the Coq software and its associated ecosystem of
libraries and tools.  Thus, the workshop will be organized around
informal presentations and discussions, likely supplemented with invited
talks.

We invite all members of the Coq community to propose informal talks,
discussion sessions, or any potential uses of the day allocated to the
workshop.  Relevant subject matter includes but is not limited to:

     * Language or tactic features
     * Theory and implementation of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
     * Applications and experience in education and industry
     * Tools and platforms built on Coq
     * Plugins and libraries for Coq
     * Interfacing with Coq
     * Formalization tricks and Coq pearls

Authors should submit short proposals through EasyChair.  Submissions
should be in portable document format (PDF).  Proposals should not
exceed 2 pages in length in single-column full-page style.

Venue: ITP, Rennes.
Important Dates:

     * April 7: Deadline for proposal submission
     * April 28: Acceptance notification
     * July 22: Workshop in Rennes
