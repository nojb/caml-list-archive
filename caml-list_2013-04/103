I think Darwin and Ubuntu might be using different compilers (I think
Apple bet on LLVM/clang). Even when both system use GCC, chances are
they are of different versions, and some are more aggressive than
others (at optimization). The first thing to try is to compile
testd0opt without optimization (set -O0 or something like
that). Second, if there is a way to get a stack trace on seg fault
(e.g., via GDB) that could be helpful. 

BTW, it helps to compile stacks-native.c with the DEBUG
option. One can use either -DDEBUG or change
	#define DEBUG 0
at the beginning of the file so it reads "#define DEBUG 1". Now when
running the tesd0opt we should see more output. It would be good to
get the whole output of running tesd0opt.

And another thing: for native delimcc we don't have to use dynamic
linking. One may link in delimcc.cmx along with stacks-native.o
statically. Perhaps that might help.
