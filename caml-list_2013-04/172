INTRODUCTION

The 17th Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages, SBLP 2013, will be
held in Bras=EDlia, Brazil, on September 29th to October 4th, 2013. SBLP
provides a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in the
fundamental principles and innovations in the design and implementation of
programming languages and systems.

The symposium will be part of the 4th Brazilian Conference on Software:
Theory and Practice, CBSoft 2013, http://cbsoft2013.cic.unb.br/, which will
host four traditional, well-established symposia:

* XXVII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES)
* XVII Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP)
* XVI Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods (SBMF)
* VII Brazilian Symposium on Components, Software Architecture and Software
Reuse (SBCARS)

SBLP 2013 invites authors to contribute with technical papers related (but
not limited) to:

* Program generation and transformation, including domain-specific
languages and model-driven development in the context of programming
languages.

* Programming paradigms and styles, including functional, object-oriented,
aspect-oriented, scripting languages, real-time, service-oriented,
multithreaded, parallel, and distributed programming.

* Formal semantics and theoretical foundations, including denotational,
operational, algebraic and categorical.

* Program analysis and verification, including type systems, static
analysis and abstract interpretation.

* Programming language design and implementation, including new programming
models, programming language environments, compilation and interpretation
techniques.

SUBMISSIONS

Contributions should be written in Portuguese or English. We solicit papers
that should fall into one of two different categories: full papers, with at
most 15 pages, or short papers, with at most 5 pages. Full papers submitted
in English will be published in a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS), by Springer. For this reason, all papers must be prepared
using the LNCS template, available at
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=3D0-164-6-793341-0. We encourage
the submission of short papers reporting on partial results of on-going
master dissertations or doctoral theses. All accepted papers will be
published in the conference proceedings distributed in a digital media by
the CBSOFT organizers.

Submissions should be done using SBLP 2013 installation of the EasyChair
conference mangement system at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dsblp2013.

As in previous editions, a journal special issue, with selected papers from
accepted contributions, is anticipated. Selected papers from 2003 to 2008
editions of SBLP were published in special issues of the Journal of
Universal Computer Science, by Springer. The post-proceedings of SBLP from
2009 to 2012, also with selected papers from the conference proceedings,
are being edited as special issues of Science of Computer Programming,
published by Elsevier.
