Are you all in a bad mood today or something?  That's quite the mischaracte=
risation of CUFP. Let me sample some of the videos from the CUFP website (a=
t http://cufp.org/videos)

* Scala at Twitter
http://cufp.org/videos/scaling-scala-twitter-marius-eriksen-twitter
* Facebook Chat in Erlang
http://cufp.org/videos/functional-programming-facebook
* Freebase and Metaweb in OCaml (now part of Google)
http://cufp.org/videos/functional-programming-freebase-warren-harris-metaweb
* Scheme for games development in Uncharted 3
http://cufp.org/videos/functional-mzscheme-dsls-game-development
* F# at Microsoft for biological computing
http://cufp.org/videos/using-f-prove-stabilisation-biological-networks
http://cufp.org/videos/f-embracing-functional-programming-visual-studio-201=
0-luke-hoban-mic
* Big data at Nokia using Erlang/OCaml:
http://cufp.org/videos/disco-using-erlang-implement-mapreduce

And I haven't even mentioned our usual friends from Citrix or Jane Street:
* http://cufp.org/videos/citrix-haskell-xenclient
* http://cufp.org/videos/jane-street-status-report

And many more, of varying size and impact: there's been an interesting evol=
ution from the 'bedroom FP user' to large companies that use it without bli=
nking an eye.  All of this has been tracked by CUFP over the years, althoug=
h we unfortunately don't have videos from the earliest ones.=20=20

Please do stop directing your ire at a workshop that has done its best to b=
roaden the appeal of FP for nearly a decade now, and do start thinking abou=
t getting involved in the (many) open-source events that are out there thes=
e days.  Anyone can propose talks at places like Strange Loop and OSCON, an=
d your travel and registration is often covered by the event organisers.
