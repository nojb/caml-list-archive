 Functional Programming In Education (TFPIE)

L.S.,

Apologies for any duplicates you may receive.

EasyChair now open! [3]

Please find below the Third Call for Papers for the Second International Wo=
rkshop on Trends in Functional Programming In Education (TFPIE). As an adde=
ndum to previous CfPs for this event, I would like you to consider the foll=
owing: May FP researchers also teach FP or use an FP language to teach some=
thing else. Even though many of these teachers are very enthusiastic about =
what they do, they typically don't consider it something to write up. I bel=
ieve that having a serious forum specifically for the education of or with =
FP will help promote the use of FP as a teaching tool and will benefit the =
field of computer science as a whole.

Previous CfPs for the event were sent out in PDF form. Many mailing-lists r=
eject this. Therefore, below, is the plain textual form of the CfP. For mor=
e information, refer to the website [1]. For inspiration, see last year's p=
roceedings (like this year, published in the Electronic Proceedings in Theo=
retical Computer Science) [2]. Submissions are welcome via EasyChair [3].

Please forward this CfP to whatever forum you consider appropriate.

Regards,

Philip K.F. H=F6lzenspies
Programme Committee Chair TFPIE 2013

Third Call for Papers the Second International Workshop on Trends in Functi=
onal Programming in Education


TFPIE
-----

The second International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Ed=
ucation, TFPIE 2013, is co-located with Trends in Functional Programming (T=
FP 2013) at Brigham Young University in Utah. The goal of TFPIE is to gathe=
r researchers, teachers and all professionals that use, or are interested i=
n the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE aims to be a venue=
 were novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on the use o=
f functional programming in education are discussed. The one-day workshop w=
ill foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for publi=
cation after the workshop.

The program chair of TFPIE 2013 will screen submissions to ensure that all =
presentations are within scope and are of interest to participants. Potenti=
al presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or an =
article (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of all accepted presen=
tations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the wo=
rkshop's website/wiki. Any visitors to the TFPIE 2013 website/wiki will be =
able to add comments. This includes presenters who may respond to comments =
and questions as well as provide pointers to improvements and follow-up wor=
k. After the workshop, the presenters will be invited to submit (a revised =
version of) their article for review. The PC will select the best articles =
for publication in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Scien=
ce journal (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and all extended abs=
tracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC.

TFPIE 2013 welcomes submissions describing practical techniques used in the=
 classroom, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creati=
ve use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Comput=
er Science. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Teaching FP to highschool, beginning CS, and graduate students
- FP as a teaching tool for other (CS) topics
- FP and Robotics, Music and Philosophy
- Advanced FP for undergraduates
- Engaging students in research using FP
- FP in Programming Languages
- FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics


Important dates & Submission
----------------------------

Submission for presentation: Apr 20
Notification of acceptance: Apr 25
Submission formal paper: Jun 9
Notification of acceptance: Aug 16
Camera-ready version: Sep 8

Submission (pre-conference) through EasyChair: https://www.easychair.org/co=
nferences/?conf=3Dtfpie2013

Submission and review for publication occur after the meeting in Utah. This=
 allows authors to revise their articles, to include comments received at t=
he meeting. After submission, we aim to provide four reviews per paper.



Contact
-------

You can direct any questions you might have to the program chair, through t=
fpie2013@easychair.org. Discussion, both of the workshop itself and of the =
work presented there, is hosted on the TFPIE-wiki.


Venue
-----

Brigham Young University (BYU) is the third-largest private university and =
the largest explicitly religious university in the United States of America=
. Although BYU is owned and operated by the LDS church, the workshop is ind=
ependent of this affiliation. By BYU's own pen:

"Brigham Young University seeks to develop students of faith, intellect and=
 character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to s=
erve others throughout their lives. Established in 1875, the university pro=
vides an outstanding education in an atmosphere consistent with the ideals =
and principles of its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sai=
nts. Known for its academically minded and internationally experienced stud=
ent body, its world-class teaching and its beautiful mountain location, BYU=
 is also recognized for its extensive language programs, talented performin=
g arts ensembles, outstanding sports programs and devotion to combining sol=
id scholarship with the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ."

It should be noted that BYU's "Honor Code" applies only to students & staff=
. It does *not* apply to visitors.
