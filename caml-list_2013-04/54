Subject: [Caml-list] Job offer: compilation of synchronous languages for
 multicore safety-critical systems

Hello,

The PARKAS team at INRIA and École Normale Supérieure in Paris is
looking for an engineer or a postdoctoral researcher.
  http://www.di.ens.fr/ParkasTeam.html

This is a 2 to 3 years position, offered in the context of the FSF
project of the IRT SystemX laboratory, to work on a functional,
synchronous language for the design and implementation of multicore
embedded controllers. The position starts on May 15th and is based
primarily in Saclay (NanoInnov building, CEA), with the likely option to
relocate at the INRIA offices in Paris if preferable.

The unique configuration of the SystemX laboratory enables the effective
collaboration of academic and industry researchers and engineers. Direct
collaboration and transfer with Alstom Transport and Esterel
Technologies is expected in this context. The work will include the
development of a compiler for a variant of the Lustre language, building
on existing components in OCaml, as well as runtime system components
for safety-critical and real-time execution environments.

Please contact me as soon as possible if you are interested. More
information will be provided upon request.

Feel free to forward this offer to people you know who might be interested.

Sincerely yours,
Albert Cohen
