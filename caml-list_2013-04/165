  * Presentation of 31 papers including the CADE-24 Best Paper Award
    winner (details at http://www.cade-24.info/)

  * Tutorials:
    * Franz Baader: Reasoning in Lightweight Description Logics
    * Bernhard Beckert: Program Verification with the KeY System
    * Morgan Deters, Dejan Jovanovic, Clark Barrett and Cesare Tinelli:
      Becoming a Power User of SMT: The CVC4 Solver
    * Marijn Heule: State-of-the-art SAT Solving
    * Carsten Schuermann, Taus Brock-Nannestad and Chris Martens: Twelf

  During the conference, the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions
  to Automated Reasoning will be presented to Greg Nelson for his invention
  of equality sharing, also known as the Nelson-Oppen method, and his
  pioneering work on theorem proving and program checking, including fast
  congruence closure algorithms and the Simplify theorem prover.
