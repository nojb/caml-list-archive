               Paper Submission Due: June 2nd, 2013

GOALS 
=====

The  Future  Internet  has  emerged  as  a  new  initiative  to   pave
a   novel infrastructure linked to objects (things) of the real  world
to meet the changing global needs of business and  society. It  offers
internet  users   a  standardized,  secure,  efficient  and  trustable
environment,  which  allows  open  and  distributed  access  to global
networks, services and information.

To   be   consistently   adopted,   the   Future   Internet   will  be
enabled through standards-based  notations for messaging,   semantics,
process and  state  (such  as those   RDF,  OWL,  SOAP,  REST   and WS
-BPEL),  enabling  distributed systems   and entities to be  described
in a scalable and flexible robust dynamic  environment.  Multi-tenancy
will enable their remote  access as Software as a  Service (SaaS),  by
performing  the integration   into larger  networks  of  communicating
software (e.g.,  a mashup  or a  plug-in to  a Cloud platform). Future
Internet   applications  will have  to  support the   interoperability
between many  diverse stakeholders   by governing  the convergence and
life-cycle  of Internet  of Contents  (IoC), Services  (IoS),  Things
(IoT),   and  Networks   (IoN).   These   applications  should  handle
dynamic and  continuous change:  for example,  in the  provisioning of
services,  availability  of  things  and  contents,  connectivity   of
networks, diversity of user devices  etc.  They should  also bear   in
mind  that the   Future Internet  should  provide a better  experience
for the user journey, with personalized and  context -aware  contents,
adapted to  their preferences,  and where  users also  play an
active part in creating or sharing services.

There is  a need  for both  researchers and  practitioners to develop
platforms made up of adaptive  Future Internet applications.  In this
sense,   the  emergence   and  consolidation   of    Service-Oriented
Architectures  (SOA),  Cloud  Computing and Wireless Sensor  Networks
(WSN)  give benefits,  such as  flexibility,  scalability,  security, 
interoperability,    and    adaptability,    for   building     these 
applications. Although there already  are emerging solutions to  host 
software  services  and  data  on   remote   computers   and   create 
public   sensor   networks   by   using    these  technologies;   the 
mentioned  solutions employ  simple technical  approaches related  to 
replication strategies to ensure  availability and to achieve  a load 
-balancing  scalability.   Future  Internet  systems   however,  will 
also  need   to sense   and respond  to  a  huge  amount  of  signals 
sourced  from different  entities in real -time. In this  context, an 
event  would be detected  if, for example,  there is non-existence of 
a signal  which normally  occurs, affecting  the execution  of  other 
services. These events would be produced by IoT and processed in  the 
IoS.  In  order  to  build   business  level  events  Complex   Event 
Processing  (CEP)  may  be  used.  CEP allows  detecting  complex and 
meaningful events and inferring   valuable knowledge for  end  users. 
The main  advantage of  using CEP  to process complex events is  that 
the latter can be identified and reported in real time,  reducing the 
latency in decision  making, unlike the  methods used in  traditional 
software   for   event   analysis.     Event-Driven  Service-Oriented 
Architectures (ED-SOA or SOA 2.0)  are also being used to  respond to 
events that occur as a result of business processes.

The first edition of  WAS4FI was held in  conjunction with ServiceWave
2011,  in Poznan, Poland, on October 28th 2011. The second edition was
held  in  conjunction  with ESOCC   2012,  in   Bertinoro, Italy,   on
September  19th 2012.  In this third edition,  WAS4FI  again  aims  to
bring  together  the  community   at ESOCC  and addresses    different
aspects   of  adaptive   Future  Internet   applications,  emphasizing
the importance of  governing  the convergence of  contents,  services,
things  and networks   in order  to  achieve  building platforms   for
efficiency, scalability, security  and  flexible adaptation.  In  this
workshop, we  cover the foundations of the aforementioned technologies
as well  as new  emerging proposals  for  their   potential in  Future
Internet services.  To  promote collaboration, WAS4FI  has  a   highly
interactive  format   with   short  technical   sessions  complemented
by  discussions   on  Adaptive   Services  in   the  Future   Internet
Applications.
