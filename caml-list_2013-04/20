Subject: AW: [Caml-list] OUD2013 part of CUFP?

Sorry Anil,

I did meant to criticize people who put a lot of work into organizing=20=20
events. On the contrary, this is highly welcome.

My point is rather that you get a certain audience when an event is=20=20
organized as an addendum to a large academic conference. You don't get=20=
=20
the average programmer, but people with a strong academic background.=20=20
Or more direct: OUD is then just a side program for people who attend=20=20
ICFP anyway.

This is not meant with "rituals". The ritual is to visit ICFP every=20=20
year. The ritual is to publish a paper every year and to bore the=20=20
audience, as it happens often enough. This is acceptable as being part=20=
=20
of science, but I just have some doubts whether this is the right=20=20
environment for a users' meeting, especially if you also want to=20=20
address users outside universities and research institutes.

As an "industrial" user I am very interested into spreading out the=20=20
word to the masses. We have difficulties finding programmers, which is=20=
=20
no wonder if nobody (on the street) has ever heard of the language.=20=20
What we need are not further talks at scientific conferences, but at=20=20
events attended by more average people. That could e.g. be open source=20=
=20
conferences, hacker events, etc.

I put "industrial" in quotes because there isn't an industry yet. The=20=20
companies using OCaml are doing this for very individual reasons, and=20=20
there is not much cooperation (so far I can see that).

As you mention CUFP, this is a different type of thing. It's a=20=20
collection of success stories to encourage companies (and more=20=20
something for CTOs and chief architects).

Don't get me wrong, but a "travelling" conference has also many cons.=20=20
E.g. in general it is harder to plan the attendance (reserving time,=20=20
planning the costs, etc.), especially if the location is not at a=20=20
traffic hub.

Thanks for the suggestion, but I think I'm really doing enough for the=20=
=20
success of OCaml.
