> Yes and no - a way around it is to create a wrapper script for debugging in the toploop which loads all the required libraries (or just have libraries you usually need loaded via .ocamlinit). I think it's fairly unusual that you have something that's actively intended for both the toploop *and* separate compilation so it's usually just a matter of making debugging easier in the toploop with a little script.

The response goes to the list...

I am using a lot of scripting, and you could perfectly well execute the ml scripts
with a #!/usr/bin/ocaml line on top. The idea is that scripts are not "finished"
(or less finished, and not documented) compared to programs, and that you read and
adjust the source to your instant need. 

My findings say that scripted ml is only a little bit slower than bytecode, but has a
bigger memory requirement. This matches or is better than a lot of _very_
popular scripting languages. Additionally you can compile, even to native code.

If only it was not so unfinished. I am just writing exec functions, it should be
rather easy to capture "Reference to undefined global `Unix' " and repair it.

Has this not been done?? What is ocamlfind for?
