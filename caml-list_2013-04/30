I am also interested in participating to more developer-oriented
conference, preferably about Free Software. I missed the "call for
presentation" of this year FOSDEM but did consider sending something there,
and I will looking for a possibility to either talk or simply attend and
listen next year. If you (Gerd, Martin) are also interested, it would
surely be great to have more people from the OCaml community there.

In deed, this is all interesting and encouraging, and there is no question =
that CUFP is an important event. For CUFP, I don&#39;t see any problem of c=
