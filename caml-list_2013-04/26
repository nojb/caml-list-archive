But this is not my point - I'm more worried about the audience the event attracts, and also about the character in total. I mean it's a difference whether you have an event of its own (even if small) or if it is part of a larger conference, where you certainly also have visitors just seeking entertainment for a bridge day.

Apart from a comment about academic ritual, you haven't clarified what the problem really is.  In my view, if the events are described properly and word is spread widely, then anyone who shows up *is* the intended audience.  I personally don't know anyone (academic or otherwise) who'd spend a bridge day by going to events they're not interested in (as opposed to, say, doing some tourist stuff).

"Spreading the word widely" doesn't happen like that - it's the core of 
the problem.

In thought the goal was to raise awareness among professional software 
developers who might consider trying some more "functional" approaches 
to programming.
Pardon my cynicism, but this is different from a meeting whose goal is 
to show academics that their pet language was used by that one person 
in that big company and then pat each other on the back.
