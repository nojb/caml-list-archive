Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 2013 - Call for presentations

Dear List,

Here is the call for presentations to OCaml 2013, the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop, to be held in Boston, on September 24, 2013. The submission site should open in a few days. News about the workshop will be posted here as well as at http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/

                           OCAML 2013
                The  OCaml Users and Developers Workshop
                http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/
                       Boston, Massachusetts, USA
                           September 24, 2013

                        CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

                      Co-located with ICFP 2013
                        Sponsored by SIGPLAN
            Talk Proposal Submission Deadline: June 7, 2013
                                   
==============================================================================

The first occurrence of the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop was
colocated with ICFP 2012, in Copenhagen, following the OCaml Meetings
in Paris in 2010 and 2011. OCaml 2013 will be held on September 24,
2013, in Boston, colocated with ICFP 2013.

The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together industrial
users of OCaml with academics and hackers who are working on extending
the language, type system and tools. Discussions will focus on the
practical aspects of OCaml programming and the nitty gritty of the
tool-chain and upcoming improvements and changes.  Thus, we aim to
solicit talks on all aspects related to improving the use or
development of the language and of its programming environment,
including, for example:

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as (but not exhaustively) 
  GADTs, first-class modules, generic programming, or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design rationales

- tool enhancements by commercial consultants

- prominent industrial uses of OCaml, or deployments in unusual
  situations.

It will be an informal meeting, with an online scribe report of the
meeting, but no formal proceedings. Slides of presentations will be
available online from the workshop homepage.

To submit a talk, please register a description of the talk (about 2
pages long) at http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2013/talks/ providing a
clear statement of what will be brought by the talk: the problems that
are addressed, the technical solutions or methods that are
proposed. If you wish to perform a demo or require any special setup,
we will do our best to accommodate you.
