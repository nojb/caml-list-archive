This is harder than it looks because there are about a dozen places in the code where OCaml creates error messages.  They're spread out amongst all of the tools.

I believe I found them all, but each one requires careful work to avoid breaking things.   So far, I've only changed the one in ocamlc.  After finding them, I'll also need to learn how to trigger each of them to even test the change.

That's why I don't want to do it unless it's really useful to people.

I don't use emacs right now so I don't know how to test that part of the system.  Will using the standard Gnu error format be ok with what Daniel Bünzli was concerned about?
