Subject: [Caml-list] VSTTE Competition 2013 Second Announcement


Second Announcement

VSTTE Competition 2013
20-22 April 2013 (NOTE: The first announcement posted on 4 April had the wr=
ong dates!)
Organizers: Joseph Kiniry, Hannes Mehnert, Dan Zimmerman

This edition of the VSTTE programming contest is an experiment of a differe=
nt kind, as it is more about software
engineering than programming.  It is not a contest to see who can write and=
 verify small problems as quickly as
possible, but instead how can a team create a quality piece of code, using =
any tools and techniques (not just
verification), in a short period of time.

Quality software is about more than just verified data types and algorithms=
 at the source code level.  Unlike
previous competitions, this year's VSComp will focus on a rigorously
engineered software system.  Contestants will be evaluated for all of the s=
oftware engineering artifacts that they
produce, not just for verifying their implementations.

Consequently, teams that competed in previous competitions are encouraged t=
o recruit new team members whose skills
complement those of the existing team members.  For example, perhaps the cu=
rrent team is great at low-level design
and verification, but is weak in writing
requirements or in rigorous validation/testing.

The aims of the competition are:

  =E2=80=A2 to bring together those interested in rigorous software enginee=
ring and formal verification, and to provide an
    engaging, hands-on, and fun opportunity for competition and mutual-lear=
ning,
  =E2=80=A2 to evaluate the usability of a variety of software engineering =
tools, not the least of which are logic-based
    program verification tools, in a controlled experiment that could be ea=
sily repeated by others.

After the initial announcement of the contest we were asked the following q=
uestion by more than one party.  You=E2=80=99ll
find it in our FAQ.

Q. Why attach this style of contest to VSTTE, if we are not focusing exclus=
ively on verification?

A. Not a single international programming contest rewards good software eng=
ineering behavior.  We have tried for
years to influence the big contests and venues (e.g., ACM, ICFP, and TopCod=
er) to pay more attention to
engineering and quality, but to little effect.  If we are going to see a co=
ntest like this survive and even thrive
in the long run, it seems it has to be an outgrowth of the verification com=
munity, rather than the
implementation-centric hack-fast community.

The contest takes place over a two-day period.  The system that contestants=
 must develop is secret until the
moment the contest starts.  The system will be decomposed for the contestan=
ts into an architecture, whose
constituent pieces are the sub-problems of the contest.  Thus, by solving a=
ll sub-problems, one writes the entire
application.  What's more, the architecture is specified in such a way that=
 independent solutions to sub-problems
submitted by competing teams should compose into the final system.

The kinds of software engineering concepts mentioned in the contest include=
: requirements, domain analysis,
design, architecture, formal specifications, implementation, validation, ve=
rification, and traceability.  A
well-prepared team will have a methodology prepared for each of these facet=
s.  The submission of a solution for a
sub-problem need not include any of these facets in particular---i.e., runn=
ing, verified code is neither necessary
nor sufficient to win the
contest.

There are no restrictions on concepts, tools, and technologies used. Teams =
whose focus in on "early" (i.e.,
requirements or domain analysis) or "late" (validation/testing or evolution=
) phases of the software engineering
process are very welcome.  There is no limit on team size, but the results =
will be normalized by team size.

We particularly encourage participation of:

  =E2=80=A2 student teams (this includes PhD students),
  =E2=80=A2 non-developer teams using a tool someone else developed, and
  =E2=80=A2 several teams using the same tool

A panel of judges will evaluate contest entries to independently score sub-=
problems and determine the winner.
 Solutions will be judged for correctness, completeness and elegance.  The =
total score for a sub-problem is the
sum of its scores in the following categories, where the total number of po=
ints in each category available is
indicated in parentheses: domain analysis (3), requirements (3), architectu=
re (3), design (6), implementation (6),
validation (6), formal verification (12), traceability (3).  The maximum nu=
mber of points available for each
sub-problem is 42.  The verification researcher will note the weight given =
to formal verification.

All submitted artifacts will be made public immediately after the contest e=
nds so that contestants can comment
upon each other's submissions.  We expect that a paper will be co-authored =
by all interested contestants about the
contest's results, as in several previous contests.

The contest begins at 9:00 GMT on Sat 20 April and ends at 9:00 GMT on Mon =
22 April.

Prizes will be awarded in the following categories:

  =E2=80=A2 best team
  =E2=80=A2 best student team
  =E2=80=A2 tool used most effectively by the most teams

The contests website is http://www.vscomp.org/.  You will find there moment=
arily an outline of the contest, a some
Frequently Asked Questions.  The contest problems will go live at this site=
 at 9:00 GMT on Saturday the 20th of
April.  (Take note of your daylight savings time GMT offset!) There is no n=
eed to pre-register for the contest,
but you are welcome to warn us that you'll be competing.

Questions or comments about the contest should be sent to Joe Kiniry (kinir=
y@acm.org).
