Nothing stops you from organising your own group, inviting people, reservin=
g a building, sorting out registration, invoicing sponsors, organising loca=
l facilities and lunch, recording the talks, and uploading them online.  IC=
FP's "rituals" take care of all of that for us (Sylvain did a big job befor=
e).

Your cathedral analogy also doesn't make any sense to me.  I like attending=
 a few days in one go where I can interact with OCaml, ML, Haskell, Scheme,=
 Erlang, and F# users at the same time, see talks from industrial users at =
CUFP, and enjoy hearing the excitement and wails of the emerging new langua=
ges being developed by the community.

The rotating locations also enables worldwide users to attend, instead of j=
ust European ones.  The ICFP/CUFP at Japan a few years ago represented a bi=
g jump in attendance from the Asian community.  ICFP moves across Europe, A=
sia and the USA, which is difficult to arrange with a single user group.

Having said that, having more local meetups is a very positive thing. Ashis=
h and Christophe have been tracking them here: http://ocaml.org/meetings.ht=
ml
Do get involved and set up your own.
