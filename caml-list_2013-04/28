Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OUD2013 part of CUFP?

I, for one, have had an amazing time at the two CUFPs I've attended.  I
was also really happy OUD took place during the last CUFP.  I don't get
to use Ocaml professionally so CUFP is my best bet for getting to
interact with the Ocaml community in person, which is a great
experience.
