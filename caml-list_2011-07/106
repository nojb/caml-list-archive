Subject: [Caml-list] How to use ocamlbuild instead of ocamlfind


--20cf303bfe06d7f49604a89eb184
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi all,

I have working on a project that analyzing XML with PXP.
And PXP is recommended to compile with ocamlfind while my project is
compiled with ocamlbuild.
So I wanna to use ocamlbuild to compile project with PXP included but failed
in runtime
with errors that implicate the required PXP lex module is missing.
In fact that module has already been included as following :

-I XXXX

After all, anybody know about how to use the ocamlbuild to get the same
function as ocmalfind?
I think the key is the META file.

Any comment would be a great help.
Thank you!

Kevin
