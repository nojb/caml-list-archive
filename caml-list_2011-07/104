thanks for pointing to [1], which also tells me that the .cmo is built
because the .cmi becomes a target for the .cmx, and that .cmi targets
can only be built with ocamlc, not also with ocamlopt, for some reason.
conclusion, writing my .mli file is also an option.

Now, for simple files for which an interface would just be copy/paste, I
can also probably just add a line in my Makefile to generate them
automatically with ocamlc -i (before running ocamlbuild).

thanks
Guillaume
