Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

The talks and tutorials for CUFP are now up, and it's a really interesting
protocols, covering a broad range of FP topics, and including quite a bit
that touches on OCaml specifically.

Note: The deadline for reduced-fee registrations is August 15th.

I hope to see a lot of you there!

Functional
programming languages have been a hot topic of academic research for over 35
years, and they have seen an ever larger practical impact in settings
ranging from tech startups to financial firms to biomedical research labs.
At the same time, a vigorous community of working programmers employing
functional languages has come into existence. CUFP is designed to serve this
community. The annual CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how
others are using functional programming to solve real world problems; where
practitioners meet and collaborate; where language designers and users can
share ideas about the future of their favorite language; and where one can
learn practical techniques and approaches for putting functional programming
to work. CUFP 2011 will feature two days of tutorials given by language
experts, on the 22nd and 23rd, and a day of talks on the 24th. Attendees may
register for any subset of the days. Day 1, Tutorials (September 22nd)
================================= Morning: - Building reliable Client-Server
Applications in Erlang (Francesco Cesarini) - Jane Street's OCaml Core
library (Yaron Minsky) Afternoon: - Building a functional OS (Anil
Madhavapeddy, David Scott, Richard Mortier) - Collaborative Scientific
Software (Ashish Agarwal) Day 2, Tutorials (September 23rd)
================================= Morning: - Parallel Programming in Haskell
(Simon Peyton Jones, Simon Marlow, Manuel Chakravarty) - Systems Programming
in Scala (Steven Jensen, Marius Eriksen) Afternoon: - The Snap framework for
web applications in Haskell (Gregory Collins) - F# for the working
functional programmer (Michael Sperber) Day 3, Talks (September 24th)
================================= Keynote Lennart Augustsson (Standard
Chartered) Theorem-based derivation of an AES Implementation John Launchbury
(Galois) Discrete Event Simulation using Erlang Olivier Boudeville (EDF)
Model based testing of AUTOSAR automotive components Thomas Arts (Quviq)
HTML5 web application development in OCaml Keigo Imai (IT Planning)
Large-scale Internet Services in Scala at Twitter Steve Jenson and Wilhelm
Bierbaum (Twitter) Applying Functional Programming to Build
Platform-Independent Mobile Applications Adam Granicz (Intellifactory)
Fourteen Days of Haskell: A Real Time Programming Project in Real Time
Gregory Wright (Alcatel-Lucent) Disco: using Erlang to implement Mapreduce,
Nokia Prashanth Mundkur and Ville Tuulos and Jared Flatow (Nokia) Functional
mzScheme DSLs in Game Development Dan Liebgold (Naughty Dog) OCaml and Acunu
Experience Report Tom Wilkie and Andrew Byde (Acunu) There will be no
published proceedings, as the meeting is intended to be more a discussion
forum than a technical interchange, but videos of all the talks will be
placed online after the event. For more information, including presentation
abstracts and the most recent schedule information, visit:
