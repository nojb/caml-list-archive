VMCAI 2012 CALL FOR PAPERS

13th International Conference on
Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI)

http://lara.epfl.ch/vmcai2012/

January 22-24, 2012, Philadelphia, USA
Collocated with POPL 2012 ( http://www.cse.psu.edu/popl/12/ )
39th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages

SCOPE

VMCAI provides a forum for researchers from the communities of
Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation,
facilitating interaction, cross-fertilization, and advancement of
hybrid methods that combine these and related areas.

The program of VMCAI'12 will consist of refereed research papers and
tool demonstrations, as well as invited lectures and tutorials.
Research contributions can report new results as well as experimental
evaluations and comparisons of existing techniques. Topics include,
but are not limited to: program verification, model checking, abstract
interpretation and abstract domains, program synthesis, static
analysis, type systems, deductive methods, program certification,
debugging techniques, program transformation, optimization, hybrid and
cyberphysical systems.

Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including
concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic and
object-oriented programming.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not overlap with papers that have been published or
that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with
refereed proceedings. Proceedings are published by Springer Verlag as
volumes in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract Submission: August 12, 2011
Paper Submission: August 19, 2011
Acceptance Notification: October 10, 2011
