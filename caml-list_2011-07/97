Subject: [Caml-list] TLDI 2012 - Call for Papers and Contributed Talks

                              TLDI 2012
                CALL FOR PAPERS AND CONTRIBUTED TALKS

                 The Seventh ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
              Types in Language Design and Implementation

                      Saturday, January 28, 2012

                         Philadelphia, PA, USA
               To be held in conjunction with POPL 2012

                 Submission deadline: October 10th, 2011
              Submission site: http://tldi12.cis.upenn.edu

IMPORTANT: This year TLDI is introducing a significant change to the
workshop organization. There will be two distinct submission
categories: full papers (with a published proceedings, as always) and
2-page proposals for talks on more speculative or unfinished work. The
aim is to foster a more informal atmosphere in which new ideas can be
discussed while maintaining the TLDI tradition of presentations of
polished technical work.

  __________________________________________________________________

Scope

The role of types and proofs in all aspects of language design, compiler
construction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent
years. Type systems, type-based analyses and type-theoretic deductive
systems have been central to advances in compilation techniques for modern
programming languages, verification of safety and security properties of
programs, program transformation and optimization, and many other areas. The
ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation brings
researchers together to share new ideas and results concerning all aspects
of types and programming, and is now an annual event. TLDI 2012 is the
seventh workshop in the series and will be co-located with POPL in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in January 2012.

Submissions for TLDI 2012 are invited on all interactions of types with
language design, implementation, and programming methodology. This
includes both practical applications and theoretical aspects. TLDI 2012
specifically encourages papers from a broad field of programming
language and compiler researchers, including those working on
object-oriented or dynamic languages, systems programming, mobile-code
or security, as well as traditional fully-static type systems. Topics
of interest include:

  * Typed intermediate languages and type-directed compilation
  * Type-based language support for safety and security
  * Types for interoperability
  * Type systems for system programming languages
  * Type-based program analysis, transformation, and optimization
  * Dependent types and type-based proof assistants
  * Types for security protocols, concurrency, and distributed
    computing
  * Type inference and type reconstruction
  * Type-based specifications of data structures and program invariants
  * Type-based memory management
  * Proof-carrying code and certifying compilation
  * Types and objects

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list; papers on novel aspects or
uses of types are welcome. Authors concerned about the suitability of a
topic are encouraged to inquire via electronic mail to the program
chair prior to submission.

  __________________________________________________________________

Submission Guidelines

Full papers should be no more than 12 pages (including bibliography and
appendices). They will be judged on the usual criteria of novelty,
usefulness, correctness, and clarity of exposition.

Informal talk proposals should be no more than 2 pages (including
bibliography). These can be either technical or more general in nature;
they will be judged on their promise of leading to an exciting or
provocative talk.

The deadline for both submission categories is Monday, October 10,
2011. The submission deadline and length limitations are firm.
Submissions that do not meet these guidelines will not be considered.

All submissions should be in standard ACM SIGPLAN conference format: two
columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline. Detailed formatting
guidelines are available on the SIGPLAN Author Information page
(http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm), along with a LaTeX class
file and template.

Papers must be submitted electronically via the workshop website
(http://tldi12.cis.upenn.edu/) in Adobe Portable Document Format
(PDF) and must be formatted for printing on US Letter size (8.5"x11")
paper. Authors for whom this is a hardship should contact the program
chair before the deadline.

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy
(http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm).  Submissions should
contain original research not published or submitted for publication
elsewhere.

__________________________________________________________________

Publication

As in previous years, accepted full papers will be published by the ACM
and appear in the ACM digital library.
