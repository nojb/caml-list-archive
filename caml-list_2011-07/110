So, you mean that somewhere there's a version which -- if
recompiled and posted to the web site -- would eliminate
this error?

That's good.  

However, there's this public repository of information,
which, if you happened to read it any time in the last 11
months, would have an already reported, cheap-to-fix error.

That seems a discordant note relative to the high quality of
the work as a whole, and the highly devoted people who
maintain it.
