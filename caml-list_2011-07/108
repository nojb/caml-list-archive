--=-=-=

Strange that no one seems to be correcting errors in the
manual any more.  I submitted a bug report for an error in
the automatically generated text in the manual (it fails
because dynlink was not loaded).  

I got a prompt response, for which I am grateful.  

Oddly, though, the response simply classifies this bug as a
duplicate of a bug reported in August 2010.  That bug is
marked as having its resolution open.

I suspect that the documentation could be fixed with a few
minutes work, followed by whatever process updates the
public version.  

It's not a big bug, but it's odd that no one has bothered to
fix it in eleven months.

        Joshua

Summary:                    Errors in OCaml manual on web, Section 1.8
Description:=20
At URL http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual003.html
as of today, there are errors reported in the code being illustrated.=20

The first error is=20

##load "camlp4o.cma";;
Characters -1=E2=80=931:
Error: Reference to undefined global =E2=80=98Dynlink=E2=80=99
=20
after which there are of course others, such as=20

Error: Syntax error
=20
#let parse_expression =3D parser [< e =3D parse_expr; _ =3D Stream.empty >]=
 ->
e;;
Error: Syntax error
Composing the lexer and parser, we finally obtain a function to read an
expression from a character string:

#let read_expression s =3D parse_expression(lexer(Stream.of_string s));;
Error: Unbound value parse_expression
