Subject: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild and cflags

Hello,

I came across two ocamlbuild issues today:

1) how can one give a cflag that requires an argument, like
    ocamlbuild -cflag -inline 2 target.native
   Backtrace:
    - failed to build the target 2

2) I don't understand why ocamlbuild target.cmx would need to compile
target.cmo on the way... this actually prevents me from using any of the
ocamlopt-specific flags:
    ocamlbuild -cflag -S target.cmx
    (ocamlc itself complains it doesn't have a -S option)

any way around that?

cheers,
Guillaume.
