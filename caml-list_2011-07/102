                      Call for Workshop Proposals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of rewriting. 

Previous RTA meetings were held in Dijon (1985), Bordeaux (1987),
Chapel Hill (1989), Como (1991), Montreal (1993), Kaiserslautern
(1995), Rutgers (1996), Sitges (1997), Tsukuba (1998), Trento (1999),
Norwich (2000), Utrecht (2001), Copenhagen (2002), Valencia (2003),
Aachen (2004), Nara (2005), Seattle (2006), Paris (2007),
Hagenberg/Linz (2008), Brasilia (2009), Edinburgh (2010) and Novi Sad
(2011).

We solicit proposals for satellite workshops of RTA 2012 that are
related in topics to RTA.
 
Workshops should have a length of 1 or 2 days. It is tradition at RTA
that attendance to workshops is open to participants of parallel
events, similar to the way FLoC workshops are run.  There will be
three days (Monday, Tuesday and Saturday) reserved for workshops.
 
Please submit your workshop proposal by email to
 
 rta2012-workshop@trs.cm.is.nagoya-u.ac.jp
 
Proposals should be written in plain text. The proposal should cover the
following topics:
  
 1. Name of workshop
 2. A statement of the topics and goals of the workshop
 3. Names and addresses of the organizers
 4. Pointers to descriptions of previous editions of the workshop, if any
 5. A description of the submission selection process
 6. Plans for the publication of proceedings (informal proceedings
    distributed to participants, electronic journal,  proceedings with
    separate selection process, ...)
 7. Plans for invited speakers or special sessions (round-table
    discussion, tutorials, ...)
 8. Expected length of the workshop
 9. Expected number of attendees
10. Any special needs (for system demonstrations ...)
 
Workshop Selection Committee:
 
 Ashish Tiwari  (RTA 2012 program chair)
 Masahiko Sakai (RTA 2012 general chair).
