Unrelated, but thanks for reporting it.  It seems that INRIA's DNS is
broken and reports two different IP addresses for caml.inria.fr, the
correct one and the one of the server hosting advi.inria.fr...
I notified our network admins but we'll have to wait until Monday for
a fix.  Be patient...

We didn't discuss that.  For the moment, I'll wait until the
caml.inria.fr issue is resolved before asking our network admins
anything else :-)
