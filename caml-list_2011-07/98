  Dear Ocaml users,

We have the pleasure to announce a new release of Sawja, the /Static 
Analysis Workshop for JAva/.

/Sawja/ is a library written in /OCaml/, relying on the /Javalib/ 
library, and providing a high level representation of /Java/ bytecode 
programs. Whereas /Javalib/ is dedicated to isolated classes, /Sawja/ 
handles bytecode programs with their class hierarchy and control flow 
algorithms. /Sawja/ also provides some stackless intermediate 
representations of code and static analysis tools that makes analyses 
easier.

The main new feature of this release is an /Eclipse/ plugin for analyses 
developed /with Sawja/, which can be integrated into the IDE without 
requiring any additional Java code generation. By having these tools 
readily available in the leading environment for Java programmers, we 
aim at promoting the adoption of advanced static analysis tools in 
industrial settings, and at providing a solid basis for 
upstream/academic analysis debugging and demonstration.

More information, examples, and a series of tutorials are available at 
http://sawja.inria.fr <http://sawja.inria.fr/>. The /Sawja/ devteam is 
looking forward to your questions and feedback on the library.

Best regards,

The Celtique team
INRIA Rennes
