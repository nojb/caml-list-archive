Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] utop 1.0 released

Hello,

I am pleased to announce the first release of utop, a new toplevel for
OCaml.

utop has two modes; in can run in a terminal or in emacs. In the
terminal it supports real-time completion, colors, parenthesis matching
and prompt customization. In emacs it supports completion and
integration with the tuareg mode, and behaves more like a toplevel than
the default one of the tuareg mode, i.e. you cannot erase the prompt.

You can download utop here:

Enjoy!
