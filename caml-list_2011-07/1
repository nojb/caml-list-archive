Yes, they are nice, and I'd also recommend reading whole book if you
have some time for a good lecture. The examples are in Standard ML so
it's nearly direct translation to OCaml. I think it was mentioned but
Markus Mottl has implemented Okasaki's data structures in OCaml and made
it available on his website.  One thing to note is that you don't need
really laziness in case of leftitst heaps and red-black trees, as far as
I recall both are amortised.

Cheers;
