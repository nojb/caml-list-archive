I thought Unicode was a recognised subset of ISO-10646, corresponding to the
range 0-2^16.  Also, don't Windows NT/2000 use Unicode?  

My knowledge of C/C++ is probably out of date, but I thought they just used
the wide character type, without requiring a particular internal
representation.  In what way do ISO C/C++ support ISO-10646?

(I realise this isn't directly on-topic, but it may be relevant for future
extensions to OCaml?)

Dave.

	No. Unicode was abandoned years ago: there is an 'offical'
ISO Standard: ISO-10646. There are 2^31 code points, unlike
Unicode's 2^16, which is already barely adequate. ISO C and ISO C++
support ISO-10646. Linux runs ISO-10646 (via UTF-8).
