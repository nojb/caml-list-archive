I don't think this is true, i launched gimp on windows almost three year ago
(well it didn't go very far, since it searched for a home directory which i
didn't had defined, but it did work), and there are lot of windows-related
stuff in the changelog of the gtk1.1/1.2 versions, so i guess it is working
quite well, look at : http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/ for more info and
try it out.
