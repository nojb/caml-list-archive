Hello, 

Is there a way to test whether a float has value 'nan' or 'inf' ? I
didn't find in the standard library the equivalent of libc functions
isfinite() or isnan() (those are macros I think). 

I think that in C you can test if a float is nan by comparing it
with itself. It seems to work in  OCaml too :

        Objective Caml version 3.00

# let a = 0. /. 0. ;;
val a : float = nan
# a = a ;;
- : bool = false

Is it correct ? What about 'inf' ?

   Olivier
