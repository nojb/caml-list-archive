Let me repeat: ISO has formally agreed to not use code points outside of
the Unicode possibility.  This leaves room for about 2^20 characters.
Today has been published a draft of Unicode 3.1 (the definitive version 
is due out in a couple of months, which already uses code points outside
of the BMP.  See the Unicode FAQs at www.unicode.org for more
informations.

Unicode can be encoded in several ways, for example, UTF-8, UTF-16,
UTF-32, UCS2, etc..  This has nothing to do with the number of characters
that can be encoded.
