Well, it would be really funny to see OCaml compete against Java in
the browser market (a rather unrealistic dream, I fear). Wasn't there a
basic WWW-browser written in OCaml? I am not sure, but I think it also
supported OCaml-byte code.

I expected that people would mention GUI-libraries, but I don't write
GUIs. Is this really everything people are missing? I wouldn't mind
porting the one or other library if it has functionality I need.
