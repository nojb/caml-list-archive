Lest people get the wrong impression, that particular page is very
preliminary, and the entire project is a "work in progress".  You
might want to start from the project homepage:

I do find Ocaml to be very very fast, but one of the reasons Ocaml
does so well is that I've been able to complete all of my 23 tests in
it.  I do expect C and C++ to give Ocaml a run for its money when I've
completed all the tests in those languages.

Cheers,
Doug
