Has anybody successfully statically linked tk into an ocaml app?  Perl/Tk is set up such that it doesn't depend on the tcl/tk distribution, so I assume this is possible.  Would it be a ton of work?

AFAIK: Perl must be clever: Tcl and Tk require directories with 
(script) files on disk to operate: statically linking the binary isn't
enough.
