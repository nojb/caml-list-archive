	It has a serious faulty static
type system, idiotic object orientation, no generics, isn't
compatible with C, uses the worst features of C/C++ syntax,
is inefficient to compile, load, and run, doesn't interface
well, uses Unicode instead of ISO-10646, has a hodge podge library,
is less portable than C, C++ or Eiffel, stuffed up finalisation ...

	Surely, Java is the worst modern language around.
It is an inexcusably travesty, when so much good theory is
around, and C compatibility is not required.
