Thank you for this reference. I've already quickly looked at it (too
quickly?) but found it not very informative. The author just go through
various programming paradigms and the languages that embodies them but
it does not try to _compare_ the paradigms (except within one category,
i.e. OO, functionnal, ...).

I am more interested in a comparison of paradigms in a broader view (how
adaptation is handled by functionnal and object-oriented styles for
example) and a formalization (i.e. theorical presentation) of those
paradigms in a common framework. 

Anyway, thank you for your pointer,
Best regards,
d.
