Unison's win32 version is using lablgtk for its GUI.
     http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/

You may look at how they did it, and they may have some comments on
the subject.

My belief is that GTK works reasonnably well on windows, while being
slightly non-orthodox in its support: what was ported is GDK, which is
a bit like an X11 abstraction layer, rather than GTK itself. This
should make maintenance easier.
