A, yes, but is it not said that ocaml programs are easier to write and smaller
in size, thus easier to maintain ? would this not compensate the lower number
of available developpers ?

BTW, about the amiga/TAO stuff ? what is your feeling about the virtual code
or whatever they call it ? i had the feeling that it was very i386 like, but
haven't looked at it very long, but it would make it kind of a heresy to
longtime amiga users ?
