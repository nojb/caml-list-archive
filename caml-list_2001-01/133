Thanks for the hint - unfortunately, it seems that Meschach is not
actively maintained anymore. The last update was more than 5 years ago. I
wouldn't want to interface to a library which gets out of use...

I haven't tried it yet (will do now), but it is probably easy enough
to interface to Fortran, too (thanks to the Bigarray module). I'll give
LAPACK and BLAS a go...

I have already seen it before - it is really nice, especially, because
it specifies algebraic structures on a very high level. I could imagine
that one can easily integrate efficient libraries into this framework.

Thanks for the offer! If you (and potential other contributors) think it
is a good idea (maybe there are still better options), we could register
a project on SourceForge to interface the BLAS and LAPACK libraries to
OCaml. Since I am usually not too much into this topic, I'll probably
only implement the functionality I need (these libraries are *huge*),
but this should be enough to give the project a start.

If nobody has any counter-arguments, I'll register the project at
SourceForge on Monday...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
