No. ISO-10646 and Unicode contains exactly the same code points.
Unicode has room for about 2^20 code points. The ISO committee has
agreed to limit ISO-10646 to the same range.

The current version of Unicode 3.0.1 (and consequently of ISO-10646) has
less than 2^16 code points assigned.  The next version, due
out in a couple of months will contain about 100.000 characters

This is correct.

I have not been following this discussion, so I missed the message you are
replying to. One can say that C supports ISO-10646 in the sense that a C
environment *can* use ISO-10646 as its internal representation for wide
chars, if the C implementor so chooses.  Many compilers do just this, in
fact.
