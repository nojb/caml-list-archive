It's sad that it is still so difficult to attract investors to modern
(as opposed to "new") technologies. OTOH, it is understandable that they
are reluctant if they know that you are likely to have problems hiring
or training staff (-> higher costs = less profit).

How is the situation in France? Isn't (O)Caml used in most universities /
hautes ecoles for teaching? There should be much more "programmer supply"
over there (but probably not enough "venture capital supply" as compared
to the US...).

I do not really follow your concerns about Open Source: OCaml is pretty
"free" as are most other FPLs. Or do you mean something else?
