And that is exactly the problem in my situation.  The investors (myself 
being one of them) weren't that concerned with the choice of a 
non-mainstream/modern language/system for technical reasons, but we were 
entirely for many, many business reasons.

I'm sorry, I should have been more explicit.  I meant that if you are 
developing and Open Source product and you'd like large scale involvement, 
choosing OCaml as a source language isn't in your best interest.  While it 
is true that you are likely to get higher quality people involved, the 
source pool is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of Java.
