	Unless it has changed recently, the first 64K code points of ISO-10646
are known as the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), which corresponds
to ISO-10646. The other 'planes' are not currently used AFAIK,
but they exist. Indeed, some code points from the BMP are reserved
so Unicode can use multi-word encodings of the lower 4 planes.
