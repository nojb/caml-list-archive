I don't believe we need Ocaml as a VM, I am not even sure that Java will
exist as a VM in the future. Most advanced WEB-clients today are coded using
Javascript (or sometimes VBscript).

Thin clients is a good approach! By implementing the Ocaml-program as a
multithreaded HTTP-server which exports its functions using XML or SOAP
(typed rpc over HTTP encoded by XML), very advanced interfaces can be done
easily.

The client consists of a Javascript program, or stylesheets or some of the
newer XML-technologies.

If you restrict yourselves to modern browser (ie 5, netscape 6), there are
good nice way reducing the amount of javascript coding. One example is HTC.

These kinds of interfaces can both be used locally (http://localhost) or
over the internet. Performance is very good locally, I know from practical
experience.

Creating a table using HTML is very often much easier than creating a user
interface with a listbox with columns and filling it.
