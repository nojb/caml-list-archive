I also thought that this might be the best choice if I really have
to interface to C (or here: Fortran) libraries. The availability of
bigarrays, which support Fortran-layout, shouldn't make this task too
difficult, I hope.

Given the problem I want to solve, I'll only need a handful of functions,
but I'll try to get the basic design right so that other people can
continue extending the interface.

I am not terriby educated in numerical computation so if anybody wants to
contribute right from the start (both with design hints or (even better)
code), I could put the project on SourceForge.

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
