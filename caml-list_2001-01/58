I have been using GIMP on my Win2000 machine for 0.5 year, and it always
works, and I never had a crash. So I think GTK is stable enough.

If there is a problem, it is probably in the Lablgtk-layer. I also tried a
little to get it up and running on my win2000, but failed. Since I have a
Linux machine, I didn't put a big effort into it. Instead I use Lablgtk on
Linux currenlty, and hopes that there will be a easy to install lablgtk for
win2000 sometimes in the future.

I hope that Lablgtk will be a standard library of Ocaml.

I don't think this is true, i launched gimp on windows almost three year ago
(well it didn't go very far, since it searched for a home directory which i
didn't had defined, but it did work), and there are lot of windows-related
stuff in the changelog of the gtk1.1/1.2 versions, so i guess it is working
quite well, look at : http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/ for more info and
try it out.
