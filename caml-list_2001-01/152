It most certainly does. A Caml interpreter should not be hard to code
in Ocaml (or Caml itself, of course). A compiler is probably a lot
trickier. But I'd stick to pretty straightforward theoretical-model
work for now. I still have a quite a little I have to study ;-)

I'll take a look at it. Thanks.

I'll definitely look into logic languages. I have one in mind which I
would like to implement, if only for an exercise.

Cool! I imagined they would do it in Ocaml itself. Sounds like magic,
though.

I did not notice the sources were online. Thanks for mentioning the
address.
