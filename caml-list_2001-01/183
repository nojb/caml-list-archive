	You need cl.exe, and it's not the linker, but the compiler.
Mostly, it is used to call link.exe (the linker) with the required
arguments. However, I think ocamlc generate also a simple C file
for the list of primitives. Anyhow, you need VC++.

	Wouldn't it be possible to modify ocamlc so that only
the assembler and the linker are used ? (By generating this
table of primitives in assembly.)

	The Miscrosoft linker (link.exe) and the assembler (ml.exe)
are included in the Windows 98 DDK and in the Windows 2000 DDK.
Both can be downloaded form Microsoft website. The required
libraries are also included.

	I think so, but I'm not very interested in Cygwin, so you'd
better check.
