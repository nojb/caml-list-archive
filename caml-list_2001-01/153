Oggetto: A manual...


>Hi there! I'm a new Ocaml user and enthusiast. ...

I guess I am a little over enthusiastic. I forgot to mention one
important point: i found the online manual a read several sections. I
found parts that looked more like a reminder for somebody who already
knows the language very well, and others (the short overview at the
beginning of the manual) excessively shallow to help understand the
most powerful features of the language. I would really appreaciate if
anyone could point me to some other online documentation on the
language, with which from a simple Ocaml enthusiast I might become an
Ocaml guru.

BTW, thanks to all who have taken time to answer my first mail. I hope
I'm not bugging you guys. I have now been reading this mailing list
for several days, and I have noticed that the average level is a
little over my understanding (say, another couple of years of
university study above my understanding): it is probably not the right
place for a newbie to post, or is it?

Ciao a tutti! Hello to all! Salut à tout le monde!

Alex
