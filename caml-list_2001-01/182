You don't need the assembler, however you need the C libraries in
addition to the linker, so it looks like the full VC++ is needed to
get "ocamlc -custom" to work.

BUT: if there is no C code in your program, you can build a closed
bytecode executable just by concatenating the standard bytecode
interpreter with your bytecode executable:

copy /b \ocaml\bin\ocamlrun.exe+mybytecode.exe standalone.exe

or if you prefer the Unix-like way:

cat /ocaml/bin/ocamlrun.exe mybytecode.exe > standalone.exe

Easy, wasn't it.

No idea.

The next release of OCaml will contain a Cygwin port, so you'll be
able to do "ocamlc -custom" without buying VC++.  I think you'll need
to distribute the Cygwin DLL along with the generated executable,
though.
