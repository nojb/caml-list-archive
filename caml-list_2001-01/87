Does this include the recursive modules aspect of Moscow ML too? That's
where I feel the shoe pinching. I realize that at least one big name in
the ML community dislikes the notion and admittedly my main issue could be 
resolved by a recursion between a type definition and a module but it can
also be fixed with recursive modules. The problems arise fairly frequently.

Do the implementors have any impressions as to whether the Moscow ML approach or
the "mixin module" approach discussed here will be used to address this
problem?
