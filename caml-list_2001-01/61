 There is an easy solution: 
1) allow dots in module names
2) write a compilation script, which converts directory structure to a

[I really hate javish directory hierarchy for classfiles - it's good for
sources, not for binaries]

 And, btw, findlib is also a good tool for a big project structuring.
