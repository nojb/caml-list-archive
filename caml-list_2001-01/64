I've been free of Windows for a few months now but from what I recall and
have read all of the non WinNT (I guess that is WinX where X < 2000) platforms 
are a unstable with respect to GTK, so before blaming lablgtk or even GTK 
check your programs on some newer versions of Windows. If you use Win98 or 
Win95 and you can't tolerate unstable software you're in a quandary!

I agree that lablgtk (and CamlP4, and Pcre :) should be part of the prebuilt 
release, though I guess that lablgtk is still a work in progress so it may
be a bit soon for that.
