The namespace aspect is not so straightforward when you have parameterised
modules.  Suppose we adopted a Java-like global namespace, with subspaces
for each organisation, then for each project, etc.  What would it mean to
parameterise a namespace on another?  You don't necessarily want an entry in
the namespace hierarchy to refer to a complete semantic entity, but of
course this is at the heart of ML module systems.

Your example shows that there are several aspects:

- How to statically refer to a module at compile time = namespace aspect
- How to separate the code base into separately linkable/loadable parts
  = library aspect
- How to use/initialize the code, i.e. there may be fragments of libraries
  which can be used independently of the rest of the library

In O'Caml, we have currently:

- A library (always in archive format) consists of several toplevel
  modules
- When linking the executable, only the actually referred modules of the
  libraries are included and initialized

It is very simple to use libraries, but it might be difficult to produce
them,
because unfortunately the toplevel modules of the library are the
compilation units when the library is created. For example, if I want to
make a library with, say, IO.File, IO.Net, and IO.Base, I have only one
compilation unit IO, although it is desirable to have thee such units which
are
linked together later.

DLLs are more problematic than static libraries when only parts of the
libraries are referred to, because it is more difficult to initialize a DLL
only partly. (But I can still deliver the library as single DLL if the
operating system has a mechanism that loads only the needed parts.)

This is what I implemented in findlib, my package manager for O'Caml. It
focuses on the delivery problems of libraries: Where is the library
installed?
Which archives belong to a library? Which dependencies exist?

However, findlib is restricted because it only manages the details of the
command line arguments of the O'Caml compiler. So it can't find out
namespace
conflicts, nor it can rearrange namespaces.

The findlib URL:

I think that namespaces and libraries are simply independent notions. The
current O'Caml implementation does this right when libraries are used; i.e.
you
can form a library from arbitrary modules. What is missing is the
possibility
to reorganize namespaces when libraries are created.

Of course, DLLs are missing, too.
