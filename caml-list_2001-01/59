Interesting idea, and if it can be done without any penalty for people
who doesn't need it, it would be a nice addition to Ocaml.


Java and overview
=================

Java programming with a lot of files in a lot of different directories isn't
very nice. It is very difficult to get a good overview of the part of the
project you are improving.

However, in Java there are three things that destroys overview, and
I don't know which one is worst

1. size of code, java programs are long, and there is a lot of nonsense
   rows (for example accessors)
2. one class per file (true for 95% of the classes)
3. spreading the program over many different directories.

In order to solve this, a lot of graphical tools are built and sold to help
people get the overview, like class browsers, UML....

P.s Note that nonsense rows is also true for some part of Ocaml, for
that I have to write accessors for objects attributes.
