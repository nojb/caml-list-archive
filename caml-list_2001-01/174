Ok, so your question is mostly about software engineering (programming
in the large) rather than expressiveness on an algorithmic level. The
book is mostly concerned with the latter...

Since you seem to be more interested in high-level (formal) specification
of programs, you might find some things (for functional style = ML)
on this page (but no inter-language comparisons):

  http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/dts

And then there is also Xavier's paper on "Objects and Classes vs. Modules
in OCaml".
