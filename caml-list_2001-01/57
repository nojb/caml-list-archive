Hmmm ..... perhaps I've lost my mind.

I decided to use 32-bit integers (int32) for some operations in a
program today, and I was about to code something which required me to
do a comparison between two of them, and ... I can't figure out how to
do it.

That is, there isn't any comparison operator defined.  I suppose I
could code one up, using various primitives, but I figured I'd point
this out, in the hope that somebody could slap me upside the head and
point me at the officially-blessed way of doing this.

In the absence of such indications, I guess I'll just code one up.

Cheers,
