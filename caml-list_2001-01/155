Hello,

Markus suggested on this list a few weeks ago that someone write a
wrapper for the GNU libplot library. Seeing it as an opportunity to
learn how to interface C code with OCaml, I started working on
it. There's some basic but seemingly working code on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocamlplot/ . 

Libplot is a (rather low-level) graphics drawing library. What's
interesting compared to OCaml Graphics library, is that the API is
device independent : the same code can draw (among others) PostScript,
PNG, and X. On the other hand, I'm afraid it only works on Unix
systems.

	Olivier
