It is probably powerful enough as it stands.  But it restricts me to the 
naming scheme that has been chosen for me, which I don't like.  What if 
some kind of Hungarian notation for alphanumeric identifiers was enforced 
by the compiler?  That would be awful.  This feels kind of the same.

This is not nearly as big a wish as for some kind of overloading! :)
