Hello,

I wonder whether there are already any well-designed linear algebra
libraries for OCaml (i.e. with good support for vector and matrix
computations): I'd need one for implementing linear regression
methods. The library needs not be terribly fast (though I wouldn't mind
if it is ;), but should be well-behaved even when fed weird data (like
ill-conditioned matrices).

If I can't find any suitable library, I wouldn't mind interfacing a fast
C-library - but which? Library recommendations welcome!

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
