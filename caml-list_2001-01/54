A couple points:  Several games have used Lua as a scripting language, so developers are already using open source scripting languages.  And, while game developers are relatively flexible on which scripting languages are used, trying to use something that's not C or C++ as the main core programming language would be heresy right now in the game industry (even Java would be considered very risky).  I didn't get the impression that the previous poster was evaluating scripting languages as much as the core language for the project.

For what it's worth, I'm doing a talk about wacky languages at the GDC this year:

And, James Hague (who's on the list) wrote an artcle about this for gamasutra:
