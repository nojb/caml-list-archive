Thanks for this very helpful reply.

I think for simplicity, we may go with nativeint now.  Another
question: are there any tools that would enable us to track, e.g.,
how much memory is being occupied by instances of "Cell", or even just
how many "Cells" might be live at a given moment?
That way we could evaluate the potential savings in moving to int for
some variants...
