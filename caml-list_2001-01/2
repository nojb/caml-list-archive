When in doubt, you should read the Tk man page.
In this case, it tells you that you can bind a _sequence_ of events.
So this is not an "or", the callback is only called if all these
events happen, and in that precise order.

Stranger. This should be only the first case. At least, this is how it
works on X11.

Somebody on this list explained a while ago (around april 2000?) how
one could theoretically put in the linked binary the tcl source code
needed by the interpreter to boot. Since Labltk requires the tcl
interpreter to run (contrary to PerlTk, I believe), this would
probably be the way to go. But I have no precise idea on how to do it,
and how much code you must link in.

If you really need to distribute statically linked versions of your
code, you might wish to look at lablgtk. Unison moved to it partly
because of that, and also because it allows you to create a better
finished product than labltk.

Best wishes,
