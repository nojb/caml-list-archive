NO! There can never be too much OCaml enthusiasm. One of the many things a 
language needs to become widespread is enthusiastic newbies. Crank up the 
volume dude.

If you read French, try this site 

http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/Livres/ora/DA-OCAML/index.html

which is the online O'Reilly book. If you have time, and your French is as
good as your English, you could join the volunteer effort to translate
this. 

I wish there were more docs available, since a friend of mine who I was
trying to bring to the light is going to try SML instead, on account of
the wider availability of simple tutorial material. The level of the 
Caml materials was to high for him, given his background and available
time.

It is a well moderated list, so don't worry, if Pierre thinks it isn't
right, he'll reject it. Newbie questions are great, it means the Ocaml 
ranks are swelling. Maybe one day that other common thread about whether 
business will accept Ocaml will become irrelevant on account of the 
hordes of knowledgeable Ocaml programmers. Welcome aboard!
