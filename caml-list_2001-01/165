A very nice book is the following one ("Advanced Programming Language
Design" - 512 pages) by Raphel Finkel, especially because it is available
online free of charge as PDF:

  http://cseng.aw.com/book/related/0,3833,0805311912+20,00.html

It covers just about any programming paradigm and also gives a soft
introduction to formal programming language semantics. It seems that it
is exactly what you are looking for...

Best regards,
