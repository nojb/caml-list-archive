I remember using Meschach many years ago in a different life, and it was
pretty good for "non-huge" matrices. You can find it at 

ftp://ftpmaths.anu.edu.au/pub/meschach/meschach.html

It's C, not Fortran. Should be easy enough to hook to OCaml.

I think it would be more interesting to write a native OCaml library. Christophe 
Rafalli has already started something in numerical linear algebra but its
just a start, at 

http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/sitelama/Membres/pages_web//RAFFALLI/formel.html

I don't work in this field any more but if you want to specify the interfaces
and need someone to implement some of the algorithms I can find some time
to hack.
