Howdy,

I'm sure this has been asked and answered, but I cannot find the
solutions to the exercises from 'The Functional Approach to
Programming' at the Caml site.  I looked in the book and tried the
links that weren't broken, checked the faq, the mailing list archives
weren't searchable, and I found only the programs at the book site.
(Of course, sometimes I can't find the salt in the cupboard when it's
right in front of my face :-).)

The back of the book says '.. solutions are available', so I just need
to know where.

Thank you,
   - Zeno
