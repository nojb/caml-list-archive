Hi, 

I would like to use LablTk together with Bigarrays in the toplevel. 
Can I make my own toplevel with both modules linked in? I know
how to make it for Bigarrays alone and I know that labltk.exe (Windows)
is the toplevel with LablTk already linked in. But I couldn't figure out
how to make a toplevel with both Bigarrays and LablTk.

Besides this I couldn't find information about the modules Imagebitmap 
and Imagephoto which might be interesting for me. I have Ousterhouts 
Tcl/Tk book but couldn't find anything about this two modules.

I'have read that float arrays aren't boxed. Does this also hold for integers?
Considering speed are Bigarrays preferable? 

I would be very appreciative for any answers to my questions. 

I'm working on a project where I have to develop software for image 
processing and pattern recognition. I considered to make this in C++ or Java
because I'm quite familiar with these languages and graphical output can quite 
easily be done with both. On the other hand I like OCaml's toplevel because it makes
rapid prototyping very easy and I also would like to learn OCaml in order to
extend my programming skills. But the project has to be executed succesfully,
so I'm still undecided. 

Thank you in advance.

With kind regards.
