	At least in Australia, almost all computer science courses
include functional and logic programming as topics. 
Furthermore, programmers are _intelligent_ organisms: 
they can learn new languages. And since Ocaml is
so much more efficient to develop with, the savings in programmers
would easily offset any extra time required to learn it. IMHO. :-)

	The problem is one of hype and marketing.

	Consider the following note included in the 'wlex' README:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE
 *  The lexer generator is derived from ocamllex; due to licence issues
 *  (this part of the OCaml system is distributed under the terms of the
 *  QPL), I have to distribute it as a patch. This imply you will need
 *  the whole OCaml source tree to build wlex. If you experience any
 *  problem to apply the patch, please don't hesitate to contact me.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Please compare to the Python licence, which is unequivocal:
Python is FREE FOR ANY USE. [Its that simple]
