There was a smiley after my criticism... - anyway, though I'd never want
to switch to Java when I can use OCaml, it isn't this bad compared to
other mainstream languages. At least some major insanities have been
removed.

Why didn't you compare to OCaml or other FPLs (e.g. Haskell, Clean, etc.)?
Business reasons?

It would be interesting to know what (except for GUI-stuff) people are
missing in OCaml or other FPLs. I just haven't used Java often enough
to know details about its libraries.
