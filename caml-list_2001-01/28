Sorry, I'm seriously emoticon disabled.  I agree with your sentiment.  Some 
of the final insantities are being addressed by pretty bright people, 
(thread semantics, lack of assertions, parameterization), so let's hope 
they get it right.

Entirely.  I would have been happy to work in OCaml, but trying to convince 
investors (who are reluctant enough to go with something like Objective-C 
or CLOS) that ML is a viable option is a hard-sell.  Couple that with the 
whole training, hiring, maintenence, and Open Source issues and you hit a 
dead end immediately.

While on the other hand I can't claim expertise in OCaml -- hundreds of 
lines of code do not an expert make!.  Perhaps someone else on the list has 
written OCaml/ML and Java for > 10,000 LOC?  I hope to become an OCaml 
expert this year, partly because I'm doing a port to the new Amiga VP/Taos 
architecture and partly because it is next on "the list".

Best,
Joe
