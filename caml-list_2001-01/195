	Markus,

	I do not follow ocaml closely enough to appreciate supposed
	elegancy and efficiency of default arguments. If by this you
	mean that you can shorten the list of arguments when user wants
	to use defaults, but he still needs to supply all of them
	otherwise then this sounds as half a solution to me.

	By going this route you will present the user with exactly the
	same complexity as the original Fortran specification.
	
	To respond to your other objections I point you to a short
	introduction:
	http://www.eiffel.com/doc/eiffelworld/5.1/new_release.html

	Please do not take it lightly: LANPACK is a complex piece of
	software and there is no reason why your library would follow
	suit all those complexities and other quirks.

	Jan
