Is there such a thing as an assembly language -- and the matching
assembler -- for the Ocaml VM? You know, I'd like to write a (toy)
compiler for a logic language similar to Prolog, and I would like not
to have to worry about porting the code to various architectures/OSes.
If there were an Ocaml assembly language, such a compiler could
generate such a language. Otherwise, I would have to work with the
bytecode directlly, which is probably a little more complicated.

One more thing: is there a bytecode to binary compiler for Ocaml?

Merci!

Alex
