Has anybody successfully statically linked tk into an ocaml app?  Perl/Tk is set up such that it doesn't depend on the tcl/tk distribution, so I assume this is possible.  Would it be a ton of work?

I had the same problem which I solved by merging all the tcl/tk 
libraries files (written in
TCL) into one big file then I converted this file to "C" code (one big 
string which was evaluated
by the Tcl_Eval function) and this code was linked to Caml.
