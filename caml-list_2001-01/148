Regarding Caml (that I think falls in your category of lambda-calculi
language), you'll find a research report describing the implementation
of Caml in Caml (be aware, it is quite hard to read) :

Xavier Leroy. The zinc experiment: an economical implementation of the
 ML language. Technical report 117, INRIA, 1990.A
 http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/publi/ZINC.ps.gz

Otherwise, look at papers of team Contraintes, Cristal, Moscova (and
others I've not in memory right now) at INRIA. They use OCaml for
various languages, type-system and compilers.


> One more curiosity: what language is Ocaml written in?

In Ocaml, except for the Garbage Collector and the bytecode runtime
environment, both written in C. The OCaml Language is unable to express
some low-level systems.

But you could have found it by yourself looking at online source code:
