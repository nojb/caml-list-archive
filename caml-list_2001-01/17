	Here's my guess: this is a 'quirk' of the PC keyboard firmware.
It is a serious problem for game design. What happens is that
when there are NO keys pressed, and you press any repeating key,
you get a sequence of KEY_DOWN tokens from the keyboard.
If you then press another key, the auto-repeat is switched OFF
for the first key, and on for the second key. If you release
the second key, the first doesn't auto-repeat: 

	11111111111111122222222222222
        ^ press 1  ....^ press 2     ^ release 2  ^ release 1

	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
	^ press a        ^ press shift


	The _only_ solution is to reprogram the keyboard CPU.
The whole thing is a stupid hangover from DOS: the keyboard
should just send keyup/keydown tokens, and let the OS driver
handle repeats and timing.
