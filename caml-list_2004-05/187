The runtime is actually there for a reason.  It is much of what makes
ocaml, ocaml.  Even if you could generate C code from ocaml (it probably
wouldn't be very good, unless you did lots of non-compiler-portable
tricks like GHC), it would still need the same kind of runtime.  Ocaml
programs generate a lot of short-lived garbage.  Without a garbage
collector, the program would eat up a lot of memory.

The native code runtime isn't very big.

I think effort would be better spent porting the runtime to these new
platforms.
