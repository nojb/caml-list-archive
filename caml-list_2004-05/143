That's true, but my take is a little different.

Let's first make a general repository.  Something like CPAN, maybe,
where as long as people follow a few simple structuring conventions,
they can upload something and make it easily accessible to everyone.
Maybe GODI could be a starting point; maybe not.  My perception of GODI
-- and this may or may not be true -- is that it is a cathedral-style
operation, where central gatekeepers review and approve contributions
(and it requires knowledge of its build system).  Make it more open to
start with.

I don't see a lot of utility in Yet Another *forge.  Yes, problems exist
with the existing forges, whether they be SourceForge, Savannah, Alioth,
or whatever.  Maintaining a system like that is a complex task, and
making it "suck less" than the existing ones will mean starting up with
a real mirror network, redundant servers, backups, etc.  I guess I'm
just not convinced that 1) there's a real need for this, and 2) we (the
OCaml people) can do it better.  This isn't a personal insult to those
who are proposing the project at all; the best of admins have their
hands full maintaining one of these things.

If you are looking for a ready-made alternative to SourceForge and
Savannah, check out http://alioth.debian.org/.  It's a GForge
installation, and although run by Debian, is open to everyone in the
same spirit as the original SourceForge.  

Alioth has had, to my knowledge, one brief outage that was preventative
in nature to make sure it was not affected by a breakin that occured on
some Debian machines.  I believe this was less serious than some of the
outages suffered by SourceForge or Savannah, where some services stay
broken for weeks a a time.
