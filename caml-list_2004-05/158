I would be interested in hosting such things, for the social reasons outlined.
Also, having mailing list and bug tracking would be cool (everything else I can
do trivially with my existing webhosting)

Since CVS/SVN/arch/darcs have been debated a bit, I'll point out I use darcs,
and would snapshot the tree to this CPAN-like thing daily or some such.

I've never used either very much.  Savannah looks nice,  But I'm not picky.

If mirroring is made trivial, I offer bandwidth.
