Hello,
I suppose you're talking about the Num library described in the ocaml
manual at <http://pauillac.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual036.html>. As
mentionned there, you have to add nums.cma to the command line for the
linking phase. This is not needed for the compilation itself (-c option
of the compiler):
ocamlc -c test.ml
ocamlc nums.cma test.cmo=20
should work (you may have to add other .cm[o/a] files on the second
line depending on what's in test of course).
In addition, note that there is a subtle difference between the name of
the file providing the library (nums.cma), and one of the module of this
library (Num, without 's').
Hope this helps,
--=20
E tutto per oggi, a la prossima volta
Virgile
