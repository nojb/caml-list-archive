Well.  You can have an open file that doesn't exist but you can't open a
file that doesn't exist.

If a file is unlinked after it's been opened, it is no longer accessible
from any name but its blocks are not reclaimed until after every process
that has it open has closed it.  Thus the open fd remains valid.

(these semantics may differ on non-POSIX platforms)
