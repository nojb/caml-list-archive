Hello,

I am a little bit confused about what I am allowed to do with
OCamlMakefile. My question is:

Can I include OCamlMakefile in a BSD licensed project?

It is distributed with a LGPL license.
In some old versions of OcamlMakefile as well as in the current README
file, it is written:
free to copy and modify!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!


PS: is it possible to rewrite the LGPL license in OCaml? I am convinced it
would be much more concise and readable :-)


Martin
