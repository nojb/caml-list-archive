Can you be more specific about what doesn't work?  I haven't tried it with
the most recent versions of OCaml and Windows, so there may be bugs that I
don't know about.  Or you may be running into the limitations caused by
OCaml's use of a separate application for its runtime (ocamlrun.exe).  Make
sure you read and understand section 3 ("Subsystems") of the file build.txt
included with the OCaml-Win32 distribution.

That might work, but I think it might look less clean than having a true
windows subsystem app.

That's exactly what the "lkwinapp" and "mkwinapp" features of OCaml-Win32
do.  But again, if you read the "Subsystems" documentation mentioned above,
you will see why it might not work as well as you'd hope.
