ocamldap 1.4.6
Ocamldap is a suite of libraries for accessing ldap directory services. 
It includes
low level functions such as bind, search, modify, etc, as well as high 
level OO libraries
for representing objects, understanding and using the directory schema, 
and generating
attribute values.

Changes
the 1.4 series brings schema parsing, and an "ldapaccount" object for 
high level management.
1.4.6 fixes many bugs in the ldif parser, and a few nasty ones in 
ldapaccount.

rmwd 0.7 (remote middleware daemon)
rmwd is a library for identity management built on top of Ocamldap, and 
exposed
as an rpc server. It implements high level abstractions, and fine 
grained access control.
It also ties in (and comes with) to a remote event system designed for 
identity management.
The event system allows any type of action (notably provisioning) to be 
taken whenever
an rmwd function is called.

Changes
- event system
- many many bug fixes
- a few new functions
