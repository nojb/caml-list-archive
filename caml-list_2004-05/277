For a long, involved, reason, I've written a short (about 1 page) history
of Ocaml, as best as I understand it from various on-line resources.  I'd
like to get everyone's opinions on it, especially the people who were
there (please oh please check to make sure I spelled everyone's name
correct- I'm a stupid 'merkin and not used to charaters with accents,
unless they come from the south :-).  Comments on all levels- from flawed
chronology and incorrect causality to bad grammar and misspellings are
welcomed.  Don't worry about hurting my feelings.

The HTML version is here:

A PDF version is here:
http://www.bogonomicon.org/bblog/ocaml-history.pdf

For some reason, DocBook wants to make a 1-page article take 4 pages in
the pdf version, I'm not 100% sure why.

Thank you.
