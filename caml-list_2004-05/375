Hello,

Well to be sincere, i don't have tested it : i don't have win32 at hand.
However, i try to build the library with windows compatibility in mind.

If you have time to test it under windows ( there is a test/ directory
containing all the required test to be sure it works ).

I also need some scripts/things to make it compile on win32... I am not
very fresh regarding ocaml on win32 ( i have never try in fact ). 

If you perform the test, could you drop me a mail so i can do
correction ? ( i don't think this should be necessary, but there is
maybe some errors(c) ! ;-) )

Kind regard
Sylvain Le Gall
