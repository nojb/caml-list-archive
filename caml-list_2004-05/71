You're true, decentralized OO subtyping is more flexible because types are
"opened" for further additions, while ocaml types are "closed" and fully
defined and centralized (that's not the case for polymorphic variants of
course).
I have been working recently on a OO static type system with global type
inference and structural subtyping. The typer works pretty well, although
not yet optimized. I found some interesting properties : redefining an
inherited method is possible, but actually safely breaks implicit subtyping
acquired from inheritence..
