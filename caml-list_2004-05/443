ExcelEverywhere, which converts Excel spreadsheets into web pages where 
JavaScript does all the calculation is written in Ocaml.

The program consists of 40,000 lines of Ocaml, a 10,000 lines of 
JavaScript and Excel VBA.

We do no GUI in Ocaml, everything is done in VBA. The ocaml-part is just 
a native code compiled win32-executable.

We had very few problems with bugs with the ocaml-implementation, and 
always found simple workarounds.

Development is done on cygwin and linux, since we really like 
ocamldebug, the debugger that can execute backwards.

One big problem is that many of the good ocaml libraries are GPL, and 
cannot be used by ISV. For example, we had to implement our own XML-library.

If your datastructures are large, I would not recommend delivering 
byte-compiled code. It is noticable slower and easily runs out of memory.

If you use resonable datastructure, speed will not be a problem.

Good luck,

Mattias
