IMHO, a better approach than generating C output of questionable
usefulness would be to extend ocamlopt to:

1. Support those platforms it doesn't yet;
2. Support output to .o/.a/.so/.dll files to directly generate
   C-style shared libraries.

I still don't see the utility of the massive undertaking that would be
necessary to actually generate full C code from OCaml.  I doubt that
anyone would be able to maintain that C code directly in any meaningful
way, which pretty much negates any manager-related benefit.
