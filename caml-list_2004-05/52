Announcement: Camlmix 1.0 (first release)

   http://martin.jambon.free.fr/camlmix

Camlmix is a command-line tool for preprocessing any kind of file using
Objective Caml as an embedded language for inline expansion.
It has 3 major properties:
- easy: no obscure syntax, no complex library
- flexible: lets you use full featured OCaml
- universal: is not specialized in handling any specific file format

Short example:

File foo.tpl:
##
# load "unix.cma"
# use "my_utils.ml"
let my_name () = print_string "Camlmix"
##
[...]
This text has been generated by ## my_name () ##.
[...]
EOF

Command:
  camlmix foo.tpl -o foo.txt

Result file foo.txt:

[...]
This text has been generated by Camlmix.
[...]
EOF


I use Camlmix for my few static web pages. It is not supposed to replace
any already existing tool, but just provide an OCaml centric
general-purpose preprocessor.

It can of course be used to preprocess OCaml programs themselves, but I
would not recommend this. It allows to create easily a primitive template
system for OCaml and probably many other kinds of dirty hacks (see
the example on the web page).

Once again, it's here:

Have fun!
