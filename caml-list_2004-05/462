Thanks for asking this question.  I'm actually stuck on almost the same
problem right now.  I resorted to doing both:  filling out hash tables
in an initial pass.  I figure that the global namespace is not
dynamic--in contrast with locally-scoped bindings--so it's ok to use it
imperatively; I never need any version of it except for the final one.
In other words, there's only one full, accurate picture of the global
namespace (while the local bindings vary from scope to scope), so I
might as well take a pass to figure it out completely.

But I'm eager to read what others have to say.
