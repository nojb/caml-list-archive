Sure. Syntactically speaking, the expression 'm div g' appears to be a
call to function 'm' with arguments 'div' and 'g'. Of course, this
doesn't work because 'm' is an integer.

But actually I think your confusion is elsewhere. It looks like you were
trying to use 'div' as a binary operator; as far as I know, there is no
such operator. Try 'm / g' instead.

By the way, when you get error messages like this, it is helpful to pay
close attention to the *exact* position of the error--e.g., in this
case, the message gave a range of characters pointing to 'm' (and maybe
that character was underlined in the toplevel, too), so you know that
the toplevel or compiler expected 'm' to be a function.
