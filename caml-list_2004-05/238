Well, PCRE-OCaml is a bit more up-to-date than January 2003 ;-)

The README was last modified at this time, the package itself was last
updated at the end of April this year.

Otherwise, I cannot be very helpful, since I don't have access to any
Windows machine right now and wouldn't want to bother with those anyway.

The README.win32 was written by Artem Prisyaznuk last year, and I
don't know whether it is still valid.  Maybe anybody else has already
successfully installed PCRE-OCaml under Windows and can help Brian?

Regards,
Markus
