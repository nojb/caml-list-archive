Hello,

Well, i am not a great ocaml programmer, nor a real Debian developper,
but if you set up such a site, i will use it for my own developpement,
providing that i can :
- use a versionning system ( i prefer SVN, but if it CVS, it is also
  good )
- permit to upload tarball
- have a debian repository ( a kind of experimental one, i can give you
  hint how to do this ) 
- permit to download daily/weekly backup of my project ( i like to have
  a backup of dev/ML/html pages )

I can also try to help you setting documentation to do debian packaging
( but i am not that good at writing documentation ).

Anyway, i think it is a really good idea, to gather ocaml developpement
for the sake of simplicity ( having one central site to upload is
better than a lot of small site, not always online et al ).

Kind regard
Sylvain Le Gall
