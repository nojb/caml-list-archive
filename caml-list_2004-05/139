Yup, I think the idea is a little different from CPAN.  It's more like
an alternative place to host projects which isn't Savannah (because of
its well-publicised failures) or Sourceforge (depends on a company
which may well go out of business).

Of course, a CPAN-like repository could also happen, but I guess it
would have to be part of GODI now, with a way to upload source code as
well.
