Hello, I would like to invite you all into our Ocaml irc channel. We 
have a very small network
mostly for work communication, however we've recently set aside a 
channel called #ocaml,
just for Ocaml discussion. I was thinking this morning that it is a bit 
lonely with only 3 or 4 people in it,
so I thought I'd extend an invite.

irc.accela.net:6667
#ocaml

We run services, so you may register your nick if you please.

Eric
