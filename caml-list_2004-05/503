               5th International Summer School on
                Advanced Functional Programming
                           AFP 2004
               Tartu, Estonia, 14-21 August 2004
                  http://www.cs.ut.ee/afp04

                    Call for Participation

              ******** EXTENDED DEADLINE ********
              Early registration:   June 11, 2004


AFP is a series of international summer schools which aims to bring
computer scientist, in particular young researchers and programmers,
up to date with the latest advances in practical functional programming.
The main focus of the school is on the interface between results
presented at programming conferences and the programming in the real
world.

This is the fifth event in the series organized by the Department of
Computer Science of the Tartu University in conjuction with the Centre
for Dependable Computing. The previous schools were held in B=E5stad
(Sweden, 1995), Olympia (Washington, USA, 1996), Braga (Portugal, 1998)
and Oxford (UK, 2002).


Programme

The scientific programme of AFP'04 consists of short courses by renowned
experts of the field and a student session. The school offers eight main
courses, each composed of lectures and accompanied by lab sessions.  The
course list is the following:

      John Hughes (Chalmers University of Technology):
      Arrows

      Conor McBride (University of Durham):
      Epigram: dependent types for practical programming

      Alberto Pardo (University de la Republica, Montevideo):
      Combining datatypes and effects

      Rinus Plasmeijer (University of Nijmegen):
      Generic programming techniques for the construction of graphical
      user interfaces
      A strongly typed functional operating system based on dynamics

      Bernie Pope (University of Melbourne):
      Declarative debugging with Buddha

      Doaitse Swierstra (Utrecht University)
      Atze Dijkstra (Utrecht University):
      First-class aspects in Haskell

      Peter Thiemann (University of Freiburg):
      Server-side Web programming in WASH

      Simon Thompson (University of Kent):
      Refactoring Functional Programs

In addition, there will be some introductory and intermediate functional
programming courses serving as a preparation for the advanced courses.

The purpose of the student session is to give students an opportunity to
present their work and get feedback. Everyone intending to give a
presentation should submit an extended abstract (max 10 pp) along with
the registration form.


Venue

Tartu, with 100,000 inhabitants, is the second largest city in
Estonia, situated 180 km south-east from Tallinn. Tartu University,
founded 1632, is one of the oldest universities in Northern
Europe. The school will be held in the new building of the
Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. Tartu is accessible
from Tallinn by coach. The coaches run very frequently (1-2 departures
per hour) and the ride takes 2-2.5 hrs.

Tallinn, with 400,000 inhabitants, is the capital city of Estonia,
that used to be a member of the Hansa League. Tallinn's medieval Old
Town is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. There are direct flights

Prague, Warsaw, Moscow, Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki.
