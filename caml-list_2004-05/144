I think you didn't understood my point. I said that the OCaml community
maybe doesn't need a full-featured SourceForge yet, and that's a mailling
list and CVS server is more easy to setup and manage, and would be enough -
maybe I'm wrong... I wasn't at all thinking that we need to develop our own
SourceForge (or whatever).
