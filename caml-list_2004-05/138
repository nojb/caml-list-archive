My two cents : don't try to think everything before starting it, work
incrementaly.
First setup a -free- minimal service : allow users to create CVS repository,
home page, and mailing list, on a project basis. Add also a mailing list for
the global service where can be discussed later things such as package
naming, versionning, "global" repositry.... , and then add features when you
fell there is consensus to get them added.
Getting user to choose either SForge or GForge , then either CVS or SVN,
.... will start endless flames between proponents of each system : nothing
constructive here :)
