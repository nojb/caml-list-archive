Hello,

I am working with StrongARM-based Linux PDAs such as the Sharp Zaurus
and the iPAQ (when re-flashed to run Linux).  One thing that would be
very nice is an ocamlopt that can be a cross-compiler, generating
StrongARM code.

I notice that one person has posted such a beast online, but it seems
that there is not much support within the OCaml build system for this.
Can anyone confirm, or perhaps direct me to a "build your own ocamlopt
cross-compiler" tutorial somewhere?

(The post I found online appears to be an i386-hosted compiler that
generates ARM code; as my development platforms include alpha, powerpc,
i386, and amd64, I need to be able to build the compiler myself.)

What issues might I face should I choose to use libraries such as unix,
str, or third-party ones like pcre?  Will I be able to statically link
those into an arm executable somehow?

Thanks,
John
