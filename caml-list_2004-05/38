Sorry, but isn't talking about a stack even less meaningful
implementation-driven "gibberish"? Usually, a functional language definition
does not mention anything like a stack. In fact, some major FP
implementations don't even use a stack.

Tail recursion at least is a clear syntactic property that can be defined
without referring to implementation techniques. That a tail-recursive
function uses constant space is then a well-understood QOI issue. No serious
FP implementation would dare not to meet this criterion.
