Sure, so if someone buys my lib (in the form of .cmo and .mli files), writes 
their own code and compiles it into an executable then it should work 
forever.

But I want them to be able to constantly write new code and recompile it 
(statically linking their .cmo files with mine), forever. If their code and 
my lib depend upon the same object file and it changes, then this will break 
and the only fix will be for them to get a new lib from me for the new 
version of their object file. If I am right, then I am afraid that this will 
put people off...

Cheers,
Jon.
