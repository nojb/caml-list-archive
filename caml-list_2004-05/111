That's essentially correct. Ocaml community is not that large and number
of people are willing to contribute time into the project is
rather limited.
So in order for whatever new way of doing IO be successive it
shall be:
 a -  simple
 b -  compatible with existing codebase

Simplicity it's exactly an issue with I/O in ocamlnet and extlib -
interfaces are too rich, there is many different methods and classes.
Surely that model works quite well for the given project and probably
there is not much sense to rewrite implementation.  But that's not
required nor that important, important part is interoperability
between projects, so output of ocamlnet.Cgi could be feed to camomile.Utf8.

And it might be possible to agree on very limited interface, what
doesn't exposes all richness and features of many different modules,
but allows connect different modules together and supports future
extensions.
