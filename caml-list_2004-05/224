So one of these days I'd like to write a screensaver in OCaml for
xscreensaver, which means drawing on X's root window. Any suggestions
for a super-simple way to do this? The primitives in the built-in
Graphics module are plenty for my needs, I just don't know how make it
appear on the root window.

Thanks,
--Brock
