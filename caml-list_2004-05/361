I'll leave that to others to answer fully.  Last summer we developed
some large commercial software in OCaml, but it was a private
contract.

Yes, very much so.

There are very few bugs in the core compiler, so I can't comment on
support!  We encountered a few bugs in the Gtk bindings, which were
fixed rapidly, either by ourselves or with help from people on the
lablgtk list.

The main bugs we found were with the lamentable Microsoft development
tools that we had to use, eg. we found a massive (and quite scary) bug
in the MS assembler/linker.  I would avoid Windows as much as possible
if I were you.
