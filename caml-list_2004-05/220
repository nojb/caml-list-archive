I Just found it.
It should have occurred to me that this subject would be an FAQ.

However, my original question was more about the syntax of making
using modules to separate the field name less typing-ful :-)

I do _not_ need to use the same field name in the same module.
So using modules is the right way and what I will do.  

For my current application objects are, as you say, too heavyweight.
