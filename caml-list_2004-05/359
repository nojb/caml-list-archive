Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk

We are a small group starting a project 
developing language tools. 
It appears to us that Ocaml is ideally suited
for this purpose although none of us have 
good experience with functional languages 
(but we think we can learn fast and in the longer run
choice of Ocaml will payoff -- as opposed to
using C,C++).

We would really appreciate feedback from folks who 
have worked on large projects with OCaml. If this
has been answered earlier, we appreciate pointers
to the thread(s).

Specifically:

a) Are there examples of
commercial s/w developed in OCaml?
b) Is the native compiler/runtime/tools mature for
large commercial projects?
c) Is OCaml support (for bugs etc) good?

Thanks,
Ramu
