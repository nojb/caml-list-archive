| Yup, I think the idea is a little different from CPAN.  It's more like
| an alternative place to host projects which isn't Savannah (because of
| its well-publicised failures) or Sourceforge (depends on a company
| which may well go out of business).
|
| Of course, a CPAN-like repository could also happen, but I guess it
| would have to be part of GODI now, with a way to upload source code as
| well.

I think this is a really nice initiative. IMHO what the ocaml community
needs is a central place to share documentation and tools for ocaml
programming. A GForge/Savanne infrastruture is a good start but one
would additionally need a central website/wiki to help users/developers
to contribute documentation, tutorials, and so on. This wiki could host
an OCaml Programming Cookbook for instance.

Another important feature request is the possibility to organise SIGs
(Special Interest Groups) on topics such as crossplatform development,
build systems, networking, XML, databases, Internationalization (UTF-8),
web and webservices, GUI, mathematics and logics ... This would help the
OCaml community to struture itself into hierarchicaly specialised
sub-communities with their own mailing-list and wiki. Hopefully it would
enable constructive interactions between developers working on the same
area. A good example of SIGs management is the Python website :
http://python.org/sigs/ .

On a more practical viewpoint: have you heard about Trac
(http://www.edgewall.com/products/trac/ )? Trac is a collaborative
development plateform based on python, subversion (arch and CVS support
is planned) and sqlite. It features an enhanced wiki integrated with
bug/issue tracker and version control system. The screenshots page gives
a nice overview:
http://www.edgewall.com/products/trac/screenshots.html
The Trac development itself uses this platform:
http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/
