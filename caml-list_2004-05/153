To me their proposal seems complementary to GODI.  GODI provides the 
convenience of being able to get a lot of libraries in one place. 
Richard and Christophe's proposed site could be a place where you could 
find a lot of stuff *about* those libraries (mailing lists, 
documentation, development versions) in one place, and with a consistent 
user interface; I think it would be a great service to the community. 
Maybe it could be designed so that it doesn't overlap with GODI, but 
rather cooperates with it.

Some do feel strongly about such things, but I don't.  Having a site 
where everything worked in a consistent manner for every project would 
be a big benefit for users; that would outweigh any small inconvenience 
for me as a developer.

A Perl developer remarked to me recently that one of the main benefits 
of CPAN is that it encourages Perl developers to look at, and reuse, 
each other's code.
