In many functional languages, O'Caml included, it's assumed that tail calls
are optimized to jumps, so that tail recursive functions do not allocate
any stack space for each recursive call.  (I believe in Scheme this is even
included in the language specification.)

With that in mind, you can read "This function is not tail recursive" as a
behavioral specification, "This function might terminate abnormally due to
stack overflow" -- and that's a useful side effect to document.
