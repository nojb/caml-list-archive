There has been some discussion about how bad it is, but my view is
that this .cmi/.cmx compatibility problem is so bad that it makes
binary only distribution of libraries a nightmare for both the
provider and the user. Basically, any bug fix in the compiler (not
even a new feature) may break the compatibility.
If you are going to make binary only distribution, then you should
guarantee to your user that you are ready to provide them new versions
when needed. A terrible pain for both of you.
(At some time Ensemble was binary-only for licensing reasons. It was a
huge discomfort.)

Honestly, what is so bad about providing the source under a NDA?
This has been the standard way to proceed on Unix for a long time,
just because people may need to patch and fix the system, and you
don't wan't to have to go to your provider every time something
changes.
I suggest you rather think in that direction, since it would save you
lots of trouble.
