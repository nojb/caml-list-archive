I was just wondering if there was a compiler which could convert ocaml code 
into self-contained, efficient C code which could then be sold? By efficient, 
I mean performance comparable to that of native-code compiled ocaml.

I am asking because I think that C code (even unreadable C) may currently be 
more commercially viable than ocaml code.

Cheers,
Jon.
