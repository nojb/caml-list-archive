Do you think I should build, test and distribute for a variety of compiler and 
third party library versions then? That would be a set of object files for 
each permutation?

Ok, I just want to make sure that I'm providing the best possible service. :-)

I meant third party, sorry. I'm using my own version of lablgl as well as 
camlimages. I'll probably open-source an alternative to lablgl (based upon 
Isaac Trott's idlgl) but I'd like to use the standard camlimages.

I don't mind distributing the bulk of my code in source form (particularly the 
demos and paraphenalia) but I would like to keep the core closed source, 
unless someone is willing to pay an obscene amount of money for it. :-)

Ok, I'll keep considering distributing a source version. Maybe a cut-down 
version...

Cheers,
Jon.
