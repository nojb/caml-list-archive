Parts of the "standard library" aren't actually included in stdlib.cma,
which is the standard library file which every OCaml program opens
by default.  These include:

* unix
* str
* dynlink
* graphics

For these specific modules, you have to actually load the library by
hand (or link to it explicitly, if you're compiling an executable).
In your case you should do:

        Objective Caml version 3.07+2

# #load "str.cma";;
# Str.split;;
- : Str.regexp -> string -> string list = <fun>

(NB. the #load command).

OK, so second question is why does 'open Str' succeed, even though
OCaml won't be able to find that module if it wasn't loaded?  This is
trickier to answer, but basically what happens is that 'open Str'
looks at and loads the interface definition file ('str.cmi' in this
case).  But it doesn't check that the module has actually been loaded.

BTW, there is an ocaml-beginners list on Yahoo Groups for these sorts
of questions.
