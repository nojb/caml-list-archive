A strategic question for you: how do you hope to address the needs of
beginners if you're only putting a hobbyist level of effort into your
project?  I doubt you'll ever get anything done that actual beginners
will benefit from.  It sounds like a theoretical or exploratory
exercise.  It may be valuable to yourself or someone else, but not to
beginners.

Beginners are probably better served by Ruby plain and simple.  Why do
beginners care about type safety or performance?  For pedagogical
purposes, why do they want to work with something other than 'the
standard' version of Ruby?  They'd have an entire community of people to
answer questions and abundant assurance that everything works.
Meanwhile, you are only one guy.
