There is such algorithm in OCamake, which is a basic topological sort with
additionnal tricks when cross dependencies are found (since ocamldep does
not report the difference between dependencies for using types and
dependencies for using functions, the later only need a linkage dependency).
>From the OCamake sources :

" In order to link, we need to order the CMO files.
We currently have a ML/MLI dependency graph (in fact, tree) generated
by ocamldep.
To build the CMO list, we are reducing the dep-tree into one graph merging
corresponding ML & MLI nodes. ML-ML edges are keeped, ML-MLI edges
become ML-ML edges only if they do not create a cycle in the reduced
graph."

The other - best - way would be to have a tool that does that directly from
the depencies expressed in the CMO / CMX, so we don't care anymore about
types-only imports. Ocamldep is only working at a syntax level and is good
in order to compile, but does not provide enough informations for linking :
such an algorithm would be very useful directly in the linker !
