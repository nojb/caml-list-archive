I sympathize completely.  Although the junk mail controls in Mozilla 
Mail are great, I still have to wade through the suspected spam 
periodically to look for false positives and it's something that I admit 
that I don't get around to nearly as often as I should.

Although I am far out of my depth, I think that you may be correct.

Thank you for sharing this patch.  I tried applying it directly, but 
received some error messages.  When I applied it after first applying 
the patched linked from the ocaml-programming.de site, it went fine.  I 
was able to build findlib 0.8.1 w/no error msgs.  Unfortunately, findlib 
was functioning as before (only the browser worked and only partly, 
other commands did nothing, etc.).  This leads me to suspect that OCaml 
3.0.7 + findlib 0.8.1 just don't work together.

With the patch from Eugene Kotlyarov and following his advice, I was 
able to get the most recent version of findlib working with OCaml 
3.0.7.  That's solved my problems for now, but I urge you to share the 
frontend.ml.ocaml307.patch with Gerd Stolpmann (email 
<gerd(at)gerd-stolpmann.de>).  Undoubtedly, there will be someone at 
some point who's trying to get OCaml 3.0.6 working with findlib 0.8.1 
and your work may be a lifeline for them.  If I hadn't seen on Gerd's 
site that someone (you) had gotten a version of findlib working on 
Win32, I might not have pursued the matter as far as I did and may never 
have gotten this sorted out.

Thanks again
