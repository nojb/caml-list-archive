Also, here's the requisite RTFM (I mean that F in the nicest possible way ;)

IMO, it's inconvenient, and a drawback to the language, but not a kludge, or
even a mistake. I reserve that for the undefined order of evaluation :-).
Oh well, you didn't expect paradise, did you?

If you must share field names in the same module, your only alternative is to
use the OO part of Ocaml. That's unfortunate, because I think objects are a bit
heavyweight for things like points and segments in a computational geometry
program. OTOH, Ocaml's object system is quite powerful and principled (and
sometimes complex and unintuitive!) compared to lesser languages like C++
and Java. I often think a class system like CLOS or Dylan's would be more to my
liking, but hard to reconcile with ststic typing and modules.
