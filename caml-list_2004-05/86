I've spent the past few days trying to implement an interpreter for the 
Mathematica language. This is quite an exotic language. For example, it has a 
single type - the AST - and is "strongly typed" as a side-effect. For anyone 
who is interested, a brief description and my resulting code are on the web 
here:

http://www.chem.pwf.cam.ac.uk/~jdh30/programming/mathematica/

I'd be particularly interested to hear any constructive criticism of my coding 
style, both from the point of view of interpreter/compiler writing and also 
more general comments...

Cheers,
Jon.
