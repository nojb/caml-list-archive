If it is a library that you maintain you would need to send a new .cmi 
file with each
new version of the library. But an application linked to your library 
would not be effected
by this change in any way unless the application writer recompiled the 
application against
the new version of the library. There is no link phase (except linking 
to external c libraries)
at the start of an Ocaml program. The application binary contains a 
copy of all the Ocaml code
ever used by the program, including library code.
