Well, the library *is* maintained. I haven't quite kept up with the
newest stuff in GMP (fancy operations), but I can add it if it's needed.
Sometimes GMP breaks API compatibility, so I adapt to the newest
versions.

Some people have noted poor performance with MLGMP memory-wise. Such
problems are very difficult to fix - they have to do with the GC speed
in OCaml etc... I've not been able to recreate the problems, so I
suspect that I would have to be given some actual source code exhibiting
the problems in question.

I suspect that it has to do with the fact that MLGMP provides a
functional interface to GMP, while GMP was written with in-place
modification in mind. That's why there exist for integer values the Z2
module, which provides for in-place modification. I may extend this to
rational and floats if needed.

The latest version compiles and runs at least on GMP-4.1.2 on x86 and
AMD64.
