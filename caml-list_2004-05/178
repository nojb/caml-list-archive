I believe there has been some work to develop C parsers or pretty
printers for camlp4.  I don't think that any of them can do exactly what
you want yet -- making a completely self-contained program -- since, of
course, there are pieces of the OCaml runtime to bring along.

However, if you are going to do that, why not just compile the code to
native code with ocamlopt and not worry about the C piece?
