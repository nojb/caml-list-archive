When talking about the name of a module, I assume people so far refer to
"a", when the file is actually /some/where/lib/a.{ml,mli,cmi,cmo}. 
Would it make sense to consider a configurable suffix of the file's 
path instead? Say, you can tell the compiler to consider "lib/a" or 
"where/lib/a" as the module's name when computing the hash. This would 
be similar to a "salt". The longer the path, the more difficult it will 
become to move files around; hence it is a guarantee, that the file is 
used in the proper context.
