You and me both. The Ocaml team is aware of this desire.
At least one obstacle appears to be that the x86 backend
does not generate relocatable code. I'm curious if the
'C' backend could be used for this purpose though??

I cannot. My system has a fundamental requirement for self-extension
and high performance. Extensibility is possible with bytecode
but not native code.

	Yeah, you're deluded if you think performance and
quality have much to do with this .. just think about Java ..

	See Felix. I started off *mandating* the target
as a shared library. Static linkage was only added recently.
To a large extent this whole project is inspired by the inability
of Ocaml to build shared libraries and interface easily to C.
