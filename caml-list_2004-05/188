I have made a web search to understand which kind of
support for bignums is available for OCaml.
I must say that I am rather confused: it is not clear
to me which packages are still maintained and which
are dead, which ones are more widely used, and what
are the relative merits of the various proposals.
I would appreciate it very much if someone could
put me on the right track.
All the best,

     Roberto
