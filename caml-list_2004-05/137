I'd put the releases there if it was easy.  If it took lots of time,
making me go to a website and login somewhere (I don't usually work with
a browser open, and would prefer scriptable command-line tools), I'd
probably not do so as often.  Here's one brainstorm:

Authors could upload a tar.gz and a GPG signature file.  Your software
could compare the tar.gz to the list of authorized authors, and then
place both in whatever download area (so the sig serves as both
authentication for uploads and a verification method for end users).

There could be a standard for naming documentation within a tarball.
For instance, if everyone uses docs/html, then you could just pull out
the latest docs after each upload.

I would not store CVS there since I use Arch.  I personally wouldn't
store Arch stuff there either; I already have my own repositories.

I'm not quite sure what you're looking for here...  do you mean:

1. Information for new OCaml authors on writing Makefiles (or whatever)
   to build their programs/libraries?

2. Information for new OCaml authors on making their packages build
   on GODI or Debian?

3. Information for packagers on making others' packages build
   on GODI or Debian?

I'd say #1 is quite useful, and #2 could be for GODI at least.  However,
in general, instead of documenting existing procdures, I'd rather see
some effort go into designing new procedures that are easier to use.

As a developer, I want something I can drive from a command line and
automate.  I don't mind having to log in somewhere if I can do it from a
command line.  I definately don't want to have to log in to a web site
to post stuff, check bugs, etc.

So, I say neither.

I'm not sure that a SourceForge derivative is really the right tool for
a CPAN alternative.  Those tools are more designed to facilitate
development of individual projects rather than to facilitate managing a
massive repository of related projects.
