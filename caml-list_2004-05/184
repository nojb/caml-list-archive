Because ocaml compilers/runtimes do not exist for every platform (say,
consoles). And because compiling to C code could allow you to write
independent libraries for others to use. It would be nice to release
libraries that do a ton of stuff, usable for C/C++ coders, that were written
easily with ocaml. And also some managers seem to trust projects that are
"pure C/C++" much more than projects that use a variable amount of
languages.
