And this is good. flock is not as portable as lockf. flock usually does
not work over NFS, whereas lockf works. Normally, you need flock only to
synchronize with third-party BSD programs such as sendmail.

lockf does not lock regions of a file. It just locks abstract
byteranges, whether you interpret them as file regions is up to you.
That means, you can lock byteranges that do not exist in the file. If
you like, you can view an empty lockf-locked file as 2^32 potential
mutexes (or whatever the maximum file size is).
