Actually flock is non-POSIX (it's BSD) and is missing from some 
reasonably modern systems.

It's entirely possible to lock the entire file using the fcntl used by 
Unix.lockf, making it equivalent to flock.  The problem is that the 
OCaml Unix module doesn't allow the l_whence parameter to be set, which 
is a serious omission.
