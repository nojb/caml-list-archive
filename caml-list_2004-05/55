That would be a very nice feature for OCaml and an way to easily build
crossplatform GUIs for OCaml programs, and furthermore let you access
interesting XP components such as the SOAP one from OCaml.
(please refer to
http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:M_j-hazIPs4J:www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/+SOAP+XPCOM
for a complete list - google cache cause xulplanet is currently down).

I remember  having heard about 2 people interested in such a project on
the french speaking website linuxfr.org:
~  http://linuxfr.org/2004/04/20/16034.html (search for "ocaml" in that
page). I don't I those people are on registered the Caml-list ; in case
they are'nt you can't contact one of them at "vincent22 [a] altern.org"
as mentioned on the page.

As far as I'm concerned, I don't feel competent enough nor have enough
free time right now to help/contribute. However you can count me as a
potential enthusiastic user/tester/bug-reporter should you get something
up and running.

Having looked at the PyXCOM source tree, I couldn't get any clue on how
the ActiveState folks wrapped the XPCOM interface ... No swig nor
Boost.Python reference. I guess they did it all manually ...
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/python/xpcom/src/

I guess one could do the same for OCaml however it would be a long and
not-that-pleasant work ... I don't know if there exists a proper wrapper
generator from C++ to OCaml that get the job properly done (swig ?).

Best,
Olivier
