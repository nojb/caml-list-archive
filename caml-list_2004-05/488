The problem seems to be there, I have no gtkgl-2.0.pc in /usr/lib/pkgconfig

# ls /usr/lib/pkgconfig | grep gtk
gconfgtk.pc
gtk+-2.0.pc
gtk-doc.pc
gtkhtml-1.1.pc
gtk+-linux-fb-2.0.pc
gtk+.pc
gtkspell-2.0.pc
gtk+-x11-2.0.pc
libgtkhtml-2.0.pc

I use a mandrake 9.1 (which is LSB 1.2 conformant), but if this version is too 
old perhaps I will be more lucky if I try to install lablGtk 1. ? (or mdk10:)

Isn't there an ocmal make implementation ?
I think I have seen something like this in the links or in the docs,
isn't it a real project ? It would indeed be nice to use an ocaml make 
implementation for ocmal progs, isn't it ?
