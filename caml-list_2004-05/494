I DIRECTLY answered a question about building Ocaml
by suggesting a value for PKG_CONFIG_PATH which may solve
Florent's problem.  The value I gave is the one on my system.

I then gave some explanation of how pkg-config works
to explain why that value, and how to deal with
it if it doesn't solve the problem. It may even
*interfere* with correct building.

Finally I mentioned that this program is a heap of garbage
which I think is quite relavent to the currently hot
topic of package/build management for Ocaml software
which needs to know about C libraries too: hopefully
we can learn from badly constructed programs how to do it
better. 'findlib' for example does a related job for
Ocaml, and GODI is also managing package related
meta-information.

So in my opinion, everything I said was in fact
quite relevant to this list.
