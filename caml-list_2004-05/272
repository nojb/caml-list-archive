Hi all,

I've been working for a few months on largish project for ocaml, named
ocalibs. It's still mainly work in progress, but I thought it (or parts of
it) may be of some intrest to the folks here. Ocalibs is a collection of
libraries and tools to ease game development.

The main purpose for ocalibs is to serve as a test bed for me to see if
realtime "big" games can be built easily with ocaml. As it is, ocalibs
currently works only with the MSVC branch of ocaml (windows only). Later, if
it turns out that ocalibs is not suitable for full game development (for any
reason), I intend to turn it into a toolkit with which it's easy to develop
intermediate convertors from editor data (ie. maya, raw textures from
photoshop and such) into game related platform specific data (say, native
PS2 data).

It has many unfinished parts (which will probably be removed in a month or
two), but some snippets of intrest:
 - DirectX 9 bindings. Can already init the screen, read the mouse to some
   degree and render meshes (no textures yet).
 - XML based exporter for Maya. The exporter is written in C++, but may be
   of use for anyone who wishes to use Maya as their tool of choice for any
   project.
 - XML scene importer (using xml-light). Handles scene hierarchies as well.
 - Custom make system. Inspired by ocamake and the MSVC IDE. The make system
   consists of project "makefiles". Each makefile tells it's own sources and
   dependencies of other projects, native libraries and ocaml projects. When
   running the tool, the tool automatically checks each dependant project
   for changes and recompiles as necessary. For the link phase, the
   libraries are collected from the dependant projects.

Ocalibs can be found at:
