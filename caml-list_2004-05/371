Hello,

I have been working for some times on a collection of utils to
manipulate files following some UNIX convention. I provide for now those
function :
- cp : copy
- mv : move/rename
- ls : list ( pretty dummy )
- find : find a set of file according to a predicate ( is directory, is
  readable... )
- rm : delete file/directory ( can prompt, can delete children )
- mkdir : create a directory ( and optionnaly it's parent )
- test : do some test regarding a file ( is directory... )
- touch : update the mtime of a file 
- which : find an exec in a path

This module is FileUtil

All those function are based for now on the Unix module or the core
ocaml ( mostly Sys ). There is no C stub at all.

I provide by the same way a library for manipulating filename. It allows
to compute some intersting things :
- make_relative : make a path relative to a root path
- make_absolute : make an absolute path out of a relative path and a
  root
- compare : hierachical + lexicographic order
- reduce : remove any a/../b, a/./b ...

This module is FilePath

FilePath is abstract and doesn't need to have a real filesystem*.
FileUtil rely on the existence of a filesystem.

Theorically it should be platform independent ( FilePath comes with four
parser/lexer for each platform supported by ocaml : MacOS, Win32,
Cygwin, Unix ). This should also imply that FileUtil is platform
independent ( but it needs to be tested ).

You can find the source and documentation here :
http://www.carva.org/sylvain.le-gall/ocaml-fileutils.html
http://sylvain.le-gall.net/ocaml-fileutils.html

( webpages are in french, but documentation is in english -- sorry )

Don't hesitate to send any feedback/recommendation/bugs. 

Kind regard
Sylvain Le Gall
