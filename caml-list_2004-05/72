                        Call for participation

The Second International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR)
is the fusion of several major conferences in Automated Reasoning:
   * CADE (The International Conference on Automated Deduction),
   * FTP  (The International Workshop on First-Order Theorem Proving),
   * TABLEAUX (The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with
     Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods),
   * CALCULEMUS  (Symposium on the Integration of  Symbolic Computation and
     Mechanized Reasoning), and
   * FroCoS (Workshop on Frontiers of Combining Systems).
These five events will join for the first time at the IJCAR conference
in Cork in July 2004.

Registration to IJCAR 2004 is open: the deadline for early registration is

                              May 21, 2004

Please see http://4c.ucc.ie/ijcar/ for all registration, accomodation,
and travel details.
