That would not be a problem: most header files that must work
with both C and C++ do that.  For example, one thing that
the OCaml include files out to start and end with is

#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

...

#ifdef __cplusplus
} /* extern "C" */
#endif

Similar things based on the __cplusplus macro allows to obtain
header files that are 100% standard compliant with respect to
both C and C++.

This would do the trick, even though it is a bit of a hack.
What do the OCaml developers think?
Are they willing to accept patches to solve these problems?
Cheers,
