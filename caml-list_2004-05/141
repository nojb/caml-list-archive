I would be quite glad if it were not part of GODI. Hosting projects is
something different than hosting packages for a certain package manager.
And currently, GODI does not have the capacity to do all. I am also
convinced that the integrated CPAN way is not the right way for ocaml,
it is too complex for a non-scripting language.
