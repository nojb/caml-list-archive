Hi,

I am currently working on a process calculus that aims at modelling the=20
Fractal component model (see http://fractal.objectweb.org for more info=20
about this component model). We want to use this to build type systems=20
and other verification tools, as well as doing an implementation in our =20
favorite language (tm) (it has two implementations for the moment: one=20
in Java, and one in C).

We don't have much to read yet, we are currently finishing up a tech=20
report about the calculus itself. I can announce it here when we're=20
done.
