I really should devote more time to this :-) Merjis bought a domain,
and a machine, and hosting.  We tried setting up GForge, but the LDAP
configuration was beyond me, and things ground to a halt.

I suppose no one has any objections to using UseModWiki?  It's very
easy to set up.  The alternative would be TWiki, and I know one OCaml
user who is also a core TWiki developer.  However I must admit that
every time I've tried to install TWiki, I've failed.  There isn't any
wiki written in OCaml is there?

Rich.
