I would be glad to upload tarballs and documentation of my ocaml stuff
to such  a web  site but I  would not  put my CVS  development sources
there.

The idea of centralizing the  tarballs is good (having the ocaml users
contributions spread  all over homepages  is definitely an  issue) and
would ease  the use of  GODI (since most  if not all GODI  specs could
point to a unique web site).

Only  hosting  tarballs  and  documentation  should not  be  too  much
maintenance work;  if someone really needs  something like sourceforge
to host  his development  sources, he can  still use  it independently
(and then upload tarballs somewhere else when ready).
