A note: modules produced by the [Cf_rbtree.Set(E)] functor in my 
recently released Cf library deliberately presents elements in an 
indeterminate order, so as to minimize the amount of tree rotations 
required for set operations constructed from [fold] and [filter].

If you want the elements in increasing or decreasing order, the 
functions you want are [to_seq_incr] and [to_seq_decr] (or possibly 
[to_list_incr] and [to_list_decr] if you know you're going to want all 
of them).
