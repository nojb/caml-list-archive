This was about selling libraries to developpers.
If you're buying an ocaml library, then I hope you've got an ocaml
development environment, otherwise I do not see what you could do with
it.

I think that everybody agrees that a great strength of ocaml is its
ability to easily build standalone executables. This is what matters
to end users. But to build the executable you are going to distribute,
you need the sources.
