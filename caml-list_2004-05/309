Hi.

A few thoughts on the subject.

Iif you want practical features of OCaml, you could try the classic =20
"QuickSort in n lines" where n depends on how efficient you want to =20
make it, but you can still achieve O(n log n) in something like 4 =20
lines.  It takes 10 or so to be efficient, compared to at least 50 in =20=

C.  Of course, Haskell has even nicer syntax for this, but it looks =20
good in O'Caml too.

As for conceptual features, O'Caml is, as far as I know, the only =20
functional language with OO, even if it is somewhat limited OO (due to =20=

type-system constraints).  For industrial projects, this enables =20
programmers to work together more easily (or is intended to, anyway), =20=

while writing much less code than for most imperative languages.  For =20=

academics, it has been said that programmers, especially =20
mathematicians, find functional programming very intuitive.

Just some suggestions,
Mike Hamburg
