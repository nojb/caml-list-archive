I would ask that question again, but miss out the "with OCaml" part,
because really the choice of language doesn't matter very much.

Or if you prefer think of it this way: People are using really
unsuitable languages (PHP) and really slow languages (Ruby, PHP,
Python, Perl) on some massive websites out there.

So look for books about the general subject: minimizing calls to the
database, scaling with Apache and memcached, the right layered
architecture to use, what to cache, optimizing HTML.

Here are a couple I like:
