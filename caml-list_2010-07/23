For lua-ml this is a new development.  The site was there within the
last few months, albeit with the last release some years ago (2007 or
so, I believe).  The domain must have lapsed.

On OCS, it looks like a temporary failure from here.  I do not know what
its development status is; it was a fairly young project last I looked
at it, IIRC.
