uh… did you try to submit patches or report bugs against the package?

pycaml is known to be dead upstream. We¹ do our best to keep it in a good

by only one package… that makes bug fixing not easy :)

Is this released/linked/advertised somewhere? (other than this mail).
It would be nice to have your fixes packages so that others can benefit
from your work.

¹: I'm not aware of any pycaml user among Debian OCaml Maintainers.
