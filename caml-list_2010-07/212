   IWIL 2010 - The 8th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics
   ==========================================================================
            http://www.eprover.org/EVENTS/IWIL-2010/iwil-2010.html

IWIL has been unusually sucessful in bringing together many talented 
developers, and thus in sharing information about successful implementation 
techniques for automated reasoning systems and similar programs.  We are 
looking for contributions describing implementation techniques for and 
implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem provers for various 
logics, logic programming systems, and related technologies. 

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a position 
statement (2 pages), a short paper (up to 5 pages), or a full paper (up to 
15 pages), in EasyChair format. Submission is via EasyChair ...

        ============================================================
              http://www.logic.at/staff/chrisf/ws/LPAR-AS-5.html

Analyticity is a topic that connects foundational issues in logic with 
applications, mainly in automated deduction and analysis of proofs. The 
workshop is primarily intended to enhance awareness for its topic and to 
promote corresponding discussions and contacts between experienced experts 
and younger colleagues. The submission deadline is 10th September.

Submissions are 1-2 page abstracts. Submissions must be emailed to ...
