I have no clue about cygwin, but there is a branch of the mingw32-ocaml=20
crosscompiler package for Debian where ocaml 3.12.1 is ported and that=20
is waiting for some testings:
  http://git.debian.org/?p=3Dpkg-ocaml-maint/packages/mingw32-ocaml.git;a=
=3Dshortlog;h=3Drefs/heads/3.12.0%2Bbeta1

Maybe this can be useful to you ?
