I thought ocaml's "threads" are meant to solve the I/O problem.
Doesn't it use native pthreads for each OCaml thread, and prior to
performing I/O it releases the mutex allowing other threads to run?
Of course you'd still have to wait for the I/O to complete to serve the
file to one particular user, but in the meantime you could serve some
other (already cached) file to another user, generate some dynamic
content, etc.

Lwt's Lwt_preemptive seems to allow one to use 'preemptive
threads' (which I assume are just usual OCaml threads).
So would it be possible to put the file I/O on Lwt_preemptive.detach
threads? Has anyone tried to measure the performance of doing that?

Best regards,
