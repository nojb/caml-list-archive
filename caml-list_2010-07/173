Really ? What is the difference between -annot and -dtypes. To me
-dtypes only help to print type information under the cursor (With C-c =
C-t).
It does not help to find the definition of a name (like otags).

This looks really useful. Any chance of this being integrated in the =
official
OCaml distribution ? I don't feel comfortable overwriting my current
ocaml binaries. Also how does it interact with previously compiled =
object files ?
I am using godi so once I have overwritten the ocaml binaries from godi, =
do
I have to reinstall all the libraries ?
