Well, 3.12 hasn't been officially released yet. There is strong
intention to upgrade to 3.12 once the release dust settles.

The byte-code BER MetaOCaml should work on all architectures supported
by OCaml. Native-code BER MetaOCaml will come after the port to 3.12.
It would be at first for i386, since that is the system I have access
to. Generally once native BER MetaOCaml is done, it should work on all
architectures that support dynamic linking; that claim has to be
experimentally confirmed though.
