I don't see where that helps at all. I don't want to offload the IO into
threads and schedule them and Duppy seems to only handle IO tasks.

Except if I pick Solution 1 and then it still doesn't help anything
since I can already run select in every thread. The IO should not be
scheduled by priorities and isn't the bottleneck anyway. Seems this
would just add overhead.
