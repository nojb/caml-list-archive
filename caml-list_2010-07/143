Hi,<br />
<br />
My name is Chris and I came across http://caml.inria.fr/<br />
<br />
today while searching in Google.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Your site is easy to read, has good info,<br />
<br />
and so it prompted me to write to you.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I work with fiddlewiddle.com , and I'm hoping you'll consider<br />
<br />
linking to my site in return for me offering you a custom-written,<br />
<br />
400+ word, unique article to include on your site.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The article will be well-written, interesting, and relevant<br />
<br />
to what you currently write about on your website.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Most importantly, it will be 100% unique (never copied from another<br />
<br />
site on the internet, and never given to anyone but you.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A well-written article will provide you with additional quality<br />
<br />
content for your readers and give you a boost in Google rankings.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I ask for only 2 text links within the article to<br />
<br />
help promote my site in Google.<br />
<br />
(NOT to draw visitors away from your site - inconspicuous links only)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
If you are not interested in an article exchange, it is also possible to do a link exchange instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please contact me anytime<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and attention,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Chris Ellis<br />
