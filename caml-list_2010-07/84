Thanks for the insight David.

I also found this email from Xavier Leroy
(http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2002/11/64c14acb90cb14bedb2cacb73338fb15.en.html).
I will start with a single context (eventually built from several
scripts). If someone ever needs distributed computing, it's easy to
run several instances of Rubyk passing messages.

Just a final question on the topic: has JoCaml anything to do with
this concurrency (shared memory) question ?
