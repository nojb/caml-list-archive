Well, things have happened on this front so far. And a few people have=20
the code that I've written. Unfortunately, for rather awkward reasons, I=20
am not in a position to release it. But hope to be in the rather not=20
distant future.

It's basically a rewrite. It works, but isn't fully featured yet. I=20
believe memory management is done properly. There are also some C=20
varargs functions in the Python API that have been properly binded with=20
the libavr library (or something called like that). A (yet basic) syntax=20
extension allows to write things like:

	module X =3D python module mypython module

It does introspection and dumps the OCaml code needed to access values=20
of the module. I've been hitting type inference issues in Python for=20
this. But there is some work (like shedskin) to capitalise in order to=20
make the syntax extension more interesting when it comes to typing.

And there's a Debian package, also.

Do not hold your breath on this code, as a release might take a while.

But if someone is willing to carve out of shedskin the code needed to do=20
type inference and bind it to OCaml, that would be a nice contribution=20
to the syntax extension.

I do not have much time available on this one, and I currently have=20
other interests. But if someone is interested in the code, please email=20
me to see what is possible to do...

All the best,

Guillaume Yziquel.
