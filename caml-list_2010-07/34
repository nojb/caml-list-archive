3RD CALL FOR PAPERS and 1ST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

22nd Symposium on Implementation and Application
of Functional Languages (IFL 2010)

Utrecht University
Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands
http://www.cs.uu.nl/ifl2010

**********************************************************************

**         Submission closes July 25, Registration closes August 1  **
**********************************************************************

** If you intend to participate in IFL 2010,
** help us by registering as soon as possible.

After a first successful visit to the USA, the Symposium on
Implementation and Application of Functional Languages returns to
Europe for its 22nd edition. The hosting institution is Utrecht
University in the Netherlands, although the conference itself will
take place in the ornithological theme park Avifauna in Alphen aan den
Rijn, situated conveniently close to Schiphol (Amsterdam Airport). The
symposium dates are September 1-3, 2010.

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged in the implementation and application of functional and
function-based programming languages. IFL 2010 will be a venue for
researchers  to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in
progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation
and application of functional languages and function-based
programming.

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2010 will use a post-symposium review
process to produce formal proceedings which will be published by
Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All
participants in IFL 2010 are invited to submit either a draft paper or
an extended abstract describing work to be presented at the
symposium. At no time may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously
submitted to other venues. Here we follow the ACM Sigplan
republication policy as defined on
http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm.
The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to
make sure they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the
draft proceedings distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing
in the draft proceedings are not peer-reviewed publications. After the
symposium, authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the
feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to
submit a revised full article for the formal review process. These
revised submissions will be reviewed by the program committee using
prevailing academic standards to select the best articles, which will
appear in the formal proceedings.

INVITED SPEAKER

Johan Nordlander of Lulea University, the designer and developer of
the Timber language, is the invited speaker at IFL 2010. Timber is a
functional programming language that draws some of its concepts from
object-oriented programming, and has built-in facilities for
concurrent execution. The language is specifically targeted at
implementing real-time embedded systems.

TOPICS

IFL welcomes submissions describing practical and theoretical work as
well as submissions describing applications and tools. If you are not
sure that your work is appropriate for IFL 2010, please contact the PC
chair at jur@cs.uu.nl. Topics of interest include, but are not limited
to: 

language concepts 
type checking 
contracts 
compilation techniques 
staged compilation 
runtime function specialization 
runtime code generation 
partial evaluation 
(abstract) interpretation 
generic programming techniques 
automatic program generation 
array processing 
concurrent/parallel programming 
concurrent/parallel program execution 
functional programming and embedded systems 
functional programming and web applications 
functional programming and security 
novel memory management techniques 
runtime profiling and performance measurements 
debugging and tracing 
virtual/abstract machine architectures 
validation and verification of functional programs 
tools and programming techniques 
industrial applications of functional programming

PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended
abstracts to be published in the draft proceedings and to present them
at the symposium. All contributions must be written in English,
conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS series format and not exceed 16
pages. The draft proceedings will appear as a technical report of the
Department of Computer Science of Utrecht University.

SPONSORS

IFL 2010 is sponsored by Microsoft Research. As a result we can offer
decreased participation fees for Master students and PhD students who
plan to attend or present at IFL 2010.

PETER LANDIN PRIZE

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the
symposium every year. The honored article is selected by the program
committee based on the submissions received for the formal review
process. The prize carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
