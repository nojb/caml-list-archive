Dear list,

I would like to know how do you think Camlp4 and Camlp5 compare in terms =
hacker-friendliness. About three weeks ago I linked in a PoC the Ocaml =
file parsing loop and the Ocaml pp mechanism I found in Camlp5. I =
learned that Pcaml is an interface file that binds together parsing and =
pp for Ocaml, but I wish they were separated one from the other. At some =
point in the future I will recode my PoC into stable code, so I wonder =
if you think I should stick to Camlp5, have a look to Camlp4, or go back =
and figure it out by myself.

Best regards,
Ruslan.=
