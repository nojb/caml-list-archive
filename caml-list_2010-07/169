I've successfully recompiled (almost) all (relevant) Debian packages
with this new version. The only package that needs more work is jocaml,
and I've been told that mingw32-ocaml has been ported but remains unteste=
d.

A list of bugs related to this new version is available at [1]. The
titles of the bugreports should give an overview of practical sources of
incompatibilities (these are not Debian-specific). Some of them are
already fixed (either in upstream repository, or with a home-made
patch). Feel free to steal/ask patches from me :-)

I've made a (unofficial) repository of binary packages for the amd64
architecture, available at [2]. All sources and build logs are available
as well, so you can pick patches or just recompile them if you are on
another Debian-based system. It might progressively get populated by
binary packages for other architectures. The binary packages should work
with current Debian unstable, and people using testing or unstable can
easily test them. However, please note that OCaml 3.12.0 will most
likely not be updated (and supported) in the official repositories
before the next release of Debian (Squeeze).
