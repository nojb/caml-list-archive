I think Guillaume is refering to me. I am indeed quite interested in
this kind of binding, especially to measure the performance of the Lua
language interacting with OCaml. I would use Lua to create functions
to process huge amount of data and to replace a DSL I created.

So far, we have:
http://bitbucket.org/dpowers/luacaml by David Powers
a prototype by Paolo Donadeo
lua-ml by Christian Lindig

Maybe we can join our forces to create a common binding to Lua from
OCaml.

I propose to host it at http://forge.ocamlcore.org, we can even have an
hg repository if needed.

If anyone is interested, I think more forces to this effort are welcome.

I would be glad that at least David, Paolo and Christian join ;-)

Regards,
Sylvain Le Gall

ps: right now I can provide some time to setup the forge account and web
pages, but I will have to dedicate a lot of time to real life starting
on Friday (or before -- depending the time my daughter will choose to
born).
