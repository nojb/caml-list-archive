Hello,

So I've updated my Debian a few weeks ago and it updated tuareg-mode. 
It's great to know that Tuareg is still maintained. I remembered seeing 
a thread here with some reproaches, about colors or something. Well I 
don't really care about colors, they have always been ugly anyway. 
However I do care about indentation and there was a modification that I 
don't really like. The following code:

let f = function
   | A ->
       1
   | B ->
       2

match x with
   | A ->
       1
   | B ->
       1

is now indented like this:

let f = function
   | A ->
     1
   | B ->
     2

match x with
   | A ->
     1
   | B ->
     1

I find it less readable. I don't care about indenting too much on the 
right : if the indentation is too large I can simply cut the code into 
several functions. Which is good practise anyway.

Problem is, I can't find a way to configure Tuareg to indent 
pattern-matching the way it did before. I tried to change everything 
related to |, with, and -> with no success.

Note that I would probably be fine with:

let f = function
| A ->
     1
| B ->
     2

match x with
| A ->
     1
| B ->
     1

although I prefer the original version.

Any idea? Now, I now that it's just a matter of taste and that it's not 
really important, so if nothing can be done, so be it.
