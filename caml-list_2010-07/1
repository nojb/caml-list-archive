Hi,

I am trying to rebuild ocaml-expat in Godi after upgrading to Lucid Lynx  
and have encountered some problems. The build process in the Godi console  
fails with the message:

> ===> expat not found
>      Consider adding GODI_BASEPKG_EXPAT=yes to godi.conf
> Error: Exec error: File  
> /opt/godi/build/conf/conf-expat/./../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk, line 1022:  
> Command returned with non-zero exit code

I hade some look at the problem and found the following. The configure  
script from godi is trying to compile a small c-program to test for the  
existing of libexpat. The program compiles fine and even runs, when I  
execute it directly. However the directories do not match the patterns  
desired by the configure script.

All development files are laid out in the following way under Lucid Lynx:

Headers of expat in:
/usr/lib/expat.h

Libraries:
/lib/libexpat.so.1.5.2
/lib/libexpat.so.1 -> /lib/libexpat.so.1.5.2
/usr/lib/libexpat.a
/usr/lib/libexpat.so -> /lib/libexpat.so.1.5.2

running ldd on the binary tells me, that the libexpat.so.1 from the  
directory /lib is used in this program. The script however expects the  
libdir to be /usr/lib (which would work with one of the links). Because of  
this mismatche it keeps on trying other directories and eventually fails.

Any ideas on how to work around this in a simple way? Right now my  
solution will probably be to install an aditional copy of libexpat under  
/opt and use that one for ocaml. However I don't really want to keep  
duplicate packages around all the time, just to make it work.


On the other hand I am not really happy with the way the expat binding  
works in Ocaml, so I might just switch to another XML parser for my code  
soon. Any good suggestions for a simple to use XML parser library for  
OCaml?

Thanks,
   Till
