The authors of C-- have implemented a Lua engine in OCaml, with a good,
high-level, type-safe interface for embedding it.  Look for 'lua-ml'.
There is also an OCaml implementation of Scheme called 'ocs'; I do not
have experience with it, so I cannot speak to its API style.  Finally,
there are OCaml bindings to the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.

So, it has been done, and ocs is probably closest to what you're looking
for.
