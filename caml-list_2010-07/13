Hi, thank you for your interest :)

A few days ago, I updated the web site. It is now minimal (almost all in =
a single page) but shows the project status on the top of the page (and =
is easier to maintain).

Currently, the last entry is
[[=20
  2010 spring-summer (current work, in progress) : (ocaml-3.12-svn) =
=93from scratch=94, making the runtime library fully reentrant, first =
without threads preoccupation
]]

This means that with the very little man-power we have, we are currently =
concentrated on making the runtime library fully reentrant (while =
relying on the past experience).
This work currently does not address parallel threads, which have become =
a secondary issue.

I may detail the motivations later, if they don't appear evidently...

Cheers,
