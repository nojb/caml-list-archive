So I&#39;ve updated my Debian a few weeks ago and it updated tuareg-mode. I=
t&#39;s great to know that Tuareg is still maintained. I remembered seeing =
a thread here with some reproaches, about colors or something. Well I don&#=
39;t really care about colors, they have always been ugly anyway. However I=
 do care about indentation and there was a modification that I don&#39;t re=
ally like. The following code:<br>


<br>
let f =3D function<br>
 =A0| A -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A01<br>
 =A0| B -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A02<br>
<br>
match x with<br>
 =A0| A -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A01<br>
 =A0| B -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A0 =A01<br>
<br>
is now indented like this:<br>
<br>
let f =3D function<br>
 =A0| A -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A01<br>
 =A0| B -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A02<br>
<br>
match x with<br>
 =A0| A -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A01<br>
 =A0| B -&gt;<br>
 =A0 =A01<br>
<br>
I find it less readable. I don&#39;t care about indenting too much on the r=
ight : if the indentation is too large I can simply cut the code into sever=
al functions. Which is good practise anyway.<br>
<br>
Problem is, I can&#39;t find a way to configure Tuareg to indent pattern-ma=
tching the way it did before. I tried to change everything related to |, wi=
th, and -&gt; with no success.<br></blockquote><div><br><div>
