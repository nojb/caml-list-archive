I'm using 32 bit ocaml because my program uses too much memory in 64
bit mode.  If there were an ocaml that used 32 bit words in 64 bit
mode, I would use that instead.

Early 32 to 64 bit transitions offered 32 bit pointers with 64 bit
registers, called TSO on Alpha and n32 on MIPS.  AMD and Intel did not.
