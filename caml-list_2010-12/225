Apache is probably handling the concurrent writes itself.

If you want to use syslog, you will need to use appropriate syslog ident
and facility and configure your syslog daemon to filter those log
messages to a separate file.  It won't do that automatically (and
doesn't let you log to arbitrary files).

Otherwise, I think you'd need to write your own log daemon.
