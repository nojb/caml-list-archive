CiE serves as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects
of computability and foundations of computer science, as well as the
interplay of these theoretical areas with practical issues in computer
science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics,
philosophy, or physics.

The Programme Committee (Dag Normann and Ivan Soskov co-chairs)
cordially invites all researchers in the area of the conference to
submit their papers (in PDF-format, at most 10 pages) for presentation
at CiE 2011 to http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cie2011. The
best of the accepted papers will be published in the conference
proceedings within the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series
of Springer, which will be available at the conference. Other accepted
contributed papers together with abstracts of informal presentations
will appear in our local pre-conference proceedings volume.

We particularly invite papers that build bridges between different
parts of the research community. Since women are underrepresented in
mathematics and computer science, we emphatically encourage
submissions by female authors (see below for the 'Women in
Computability' grants).

IMPORTANT DATES:
Submission Deadline: January 14, 2011
Notification of Authors: March 12, 2011
Final Version: April 2, 2011



Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the
conference. Submitted papers must describe work not previously
published, and they must neither be accepted nor under review at a
journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings. All
papers need to be prepared in LNCS-style LaTeX. Papers should not
exceed 10 pages; full proofs may appear in a technical appendix which
will be read at the reviewers' discretion.

Submissions authored or co-authored by a Programme Committee member
are not allowed.

GRANTS:

Women in Computability:

In 2011, we continue the programme "Women in Computability" (funded
from 2008 to 2010 by the Elsevier Foundation) now supported by the
journal "Annals of Pure and Applied Logic" (Elsevier). As part of this
programme, we can offer four modest "Elsevier Women in Computability
grants" for female graduate students or junior researchers. These
grants will be paid as a reimbursement of up to 200 EUR of travel and
accommodation expenses. More information about deadlines and the
application procedure will become available from the CiE 2011 website
in March 2011.

ASL Student Travel Grants:

CiE 2011 is sponsored by the Association for Symbolic Logic. All
student members of the ASL can apply for travel funding. To be
considered for a Travel Award, please (1) send a letter of
application, and (2) ask your thesis supervisor to send a brief
recommendation letter. The application letter should be brief
(preferably one page) and should include: (1) your name; (2) your home
institution; (3) your thesis supervisor's name; (4) a one-paragraph
description of your studies and work in logic, and a paragraph
explaining why it is important to attend the meeting; (5) your
estimate of the travel expenses you will incur; (6) (for citizens or
residents of the USA) citizenship or visa status; and (7) (voluntary)
indication of your gender and minority status. Women and members of
minority groups are strongly encouraged to apply. Applications should
be sent to asl@vassar.edu before March 27 2011.

EMS grants for Young East European Researches:

Thanks to the generous support from European Mathematical Society,
CiE 2011 is glad to be able to offer partial or total fee waivers for
a small number of Eastern European researchers and researchers from
the former Soviet Union member states, whose work has been accepted
for presentation at CiE2011. Preference will be given to young
researchers and researchers with papers accepted for publication in
the LNCS proceedings. To apply, please send an application to
cie2011@fmi.uni-sofia.bg before March 27 2011. The application should
include the applicant's name, affiliation and the title of the
submission for CiE 2011.

Best student paper award:

Papers that have only student authors are eligible for the "CiE 2011
Best Student Paper Award”. The Programme Committee will select the
best submission among these after acceptance.
Springer will sponsor the Best student paper award - a Springer book
voucher for the winner.


All questions about the conference could be send at 
cie2011@fmi.uni-sofia.bg
