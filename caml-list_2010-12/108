Scope
~~~~~

ICFP 2011 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional
programming.  Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to
practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to
application.  The scope includes all languages that encourage
functional programming, including both purely applicative and
imperative languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency,
or parallelism.  Particular topics of interest include

* Language Design: type systems; concurrency and distribution;
 modules; components and composition; metaprogramming; relations to
 imperative, object-oriented, or logic programming; interoperability

* Implementation: abstract machines; virtual machines; interpretation;
 compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory
 management; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces
 to foreign functions, services, components, or low-level machine
 resources

* Software-Development Techniques: algorithms and data structures;
 design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof
 assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling

* Foundations: formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type
 theory; mathematical logic; monads; continuations; delimited
 continuations; global, delimited, or local effects

* Transformation and Analysis: abstract interpretation; partial
 evaluation; program transformation; program calculation; program
 proofs; normalization by evaluation

* Applications and Domain-Specific Languages: symbolic computing;
 formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming;
 distributed-systems and web programming; hardware design; databases;
 XML processing; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user
 interfaces; multimedia programming; scripting; system
 administration; security; education

* Functional Pearls: elegant, instructive, and fun essays on
 functional programming

* Experience Reports: short papers that provide evidence that
 functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have
 kept it from working in a particular application

Abbreviated instructions for authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* By 17 March 2011, 14:00 UTC, submit a title, an abstract of at most
 300 words, and keywords.

* By 24 March 2011, 14:00 UTC, submit a full paper of at most 12 pages
 (6 pages for a Functional Pearl and for an Experience Report),
 including bibliography and figures.

The deadlines will be strictly enforced and papers exceeding the page
limits will be summarily rejected.

* Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a submission,
 on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at it.

* Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as
 explained on the web at
   http://www.acm.org/sigplan/republicationpolicy.htm

 In addition, authors of resubmitted (but previously rejected) papers
 have the option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their
 previous submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these
 previous reviews in the present submission.  If a reviewer
 identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and
 wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the program
 chair will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of
 his/her previous review.  Otherwise, no rewiewer will read the
 annotated copies of the previous reviews.

Overall, a submission will be evaluated according to its relevance,
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity.  It should
explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly
identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work.  The technical
content should be accessible to a broad audience.  Functional Pearls
and Experience Reports are separate categories of papers that need not
report original research results and must be marked as such at the
time of submission.  Detailed guidelines on both categories are on the
conference web site.

Proceedings will be published by ACM Press.  Authors of accepted
submissions are expected to transfer the copyright to the
ACM.  Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the
presenter consents by signing an additional permission form at the
time of the presentation.

Formatting: Submissions must be in PDF format printable in black and
white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by Ghostscript.  If
this requirement is a hardship, make contact with the program chair at
least one week before the deadline.  Papers must adhere to the standard
ACM conference format: two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point
baseline, with columns 20pc (3.33in) wide and 54pc (9in) tall, with a
column gutter of 2pc (0.33in).  A suitable document template for LaTeX
is available from SIGPLAN at
 http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

Submission: Submissions will be accepted electronically at a URL to be
named later.  Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any
point before the submission deadline using the same web interface.

Author response: Authors will have a 48-hour period, starting at 14:00
UTC on Tuesday 17 May 2010, to read reviews and respond to them.

Special Journal Issue: There will be a special issue of the Journal of
Functional Programming with papers from ICFP 2011.  The program
committee will invite the authors of select accepted papers to submit
a journal version to this issue.
