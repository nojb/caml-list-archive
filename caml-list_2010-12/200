oprofile is quite nice.

However, systemtap is really interesting.  [From a language
perspective ...] it's a type-safe language with type inference that
compiles down to C, compiles the C into a kernel module which is
injected into the Linux kernel and lets you do all sorts of amazing
stuff.  The fact that it's a mainstream tool that uses proper type
inference is significant alone, the fact that it's seriously useful is
icing on the cake.
