If a machine has been compromised, or even if you suspect it has, you
can't trust anything about it anymore.

Someone could have used the exim exploit to install a rootkit, a version
of sshd with a backdoor, etc.  And sure, maybe you can take the sha of
sshd and compare it to a known source, but maybe sha256 has been
replaced with a version that tricks you.

So you patch exim, think you're good, and they come back to your machine
six months later.

You have to rebuild from scratch.
