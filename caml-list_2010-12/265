The   method  set_timeout           and
the   method  set_connecttimeout,
what are they for and which value do they use?

I would assume to set one timeout, not two.

Is it in milli-seconds?


btw: I didn't found the docs for the OCaml-bindings of above mentioned methods.

Also in the curl-lib-binding it's mentioned that only the "easy-interface" is bound,
but the OCaml-bindings offer much more functions than those some of the easy-interface
(http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-easy.html => 26 functions, the mli contains a lot more) .
So, somehow at some place the docs seem to be outdated (?).
If you have a link to a more up-to-date documentatiopn, if this exists,
could you sent me a link to that?!

Ciao,
   Oliver

P.S.: Does the   method  set_followlocation
      set, if that curllib-connection is follwoing a redirect?
