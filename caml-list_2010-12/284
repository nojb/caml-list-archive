I think the solution (use of functors) is worse than the problem.
Like OO style, functors make it very hard to examine code and
understand which piece of code is going to run when you call some
function.

Just preprocess your code with /bin/cpp, using #include to include a
common file.  Or don't worry about the repeated code too much.
