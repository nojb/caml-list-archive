Subject: Re: [Caml-list] PCRE: Invalid_argument("Pcre.get_offset_start:
 illegal offset")

Hi,

yes, you are right, and I had tomatoes on my eyes...
I looked for "get_offset_start" as exception
and had Failure as thrown exception in mind,
even "Invalid_argument" is the exception,
which of course is documented ...and that I already wrote
some lines below...

It seems I had to less sleep during the last days...

Sorry for the traffic that my messed tired mind created. ;)

Ciao,
   Oliver
