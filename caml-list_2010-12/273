I feel like saying that people tend to be lazy, especially ml-programmers ;-)
So, unless they are forced to press 'shift' key when giving a name to
a new file, they usually won't.
I believe OCaml will never force programmers to give capitalized
source file names (I might be wrong).
The only way I see for that to happen would be to provide a new
Caml-frontend, which would force that. But then, nothing guarantees
that it'll be used...

Oh, another idea: ask **teachers** to teach this practice! :-)
(I'll try to teach this practice if I teach Caml again, which might happen)
