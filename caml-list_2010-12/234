Subject: [Caml-list] Ocamlnet and sending Referrer

Hi,


for a simple script I used
Http_client.Convenience from ocamlnet.

This module is really convenient and I enjoyed to have it
for some simple get-calls. I'm quite happy with this.

But now I need to send a Referrer, and this seems not to work
with this module.

What module must be used for sending a Referrer?
And... just in case I may later will need Cookies also...
...what module can handle this?

Can this all be done with ocamlnet-stuff?
If there are more than one possibility, which module
would you recommend me (and why)?

Ciao,
   Oliver
