There shouldn't be.

In my experience, it is quite reasonable in its memory use (particularly
compared with a Java library I tried).  The ultimate test, though, is
your application.  Can you do the computations you need within the
resources you have available?  I'm guessing it'll be pretty hard to beat
ocamlgraph, though, except with a very tight array-based implementation
with integer nodes.
