I sure will.

The thing is in my last example, there is no warning from the nvidia driver
anymore, so I'd think the bug must be in the sdl part. I should also check
if this doesn't come from the touchpad driver, using a real mouse on the
same system.
Anyway thanks for your comments !

Did you tried another X-driver?<br>
<br>
In your valgrind printout there was mentioned &quot;libnvidia&quot;.<br>
And a crash seems to have been occured at that part:<br>

If you update your kernel, then you might also need to update the<br>
