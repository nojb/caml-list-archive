I beg to differ. In my experience, the Graphics module is a wonderful tool
to get non-programming beginners interested in OCaml. I have been in the
position of teaching OCaml to beginners, and the single thing they remember
and found *fun* was displaying the mandelbrot fractal, and then playing wit=
h
different color functions to get fancy results.

I absolutely agree that Graphics is not the most important thing in OCaml,
and would be very happy to have a decent OCaml installer without it, but
still I think in a second time making it work would be well worth it.

In most French "classes pr=E9paratoires", students learn programming by --
after a quick exposure to Maple, to be sure they don't risk learning too
much functional programming -- typing code directly in the toplevel.
Advanced software engineering there means "writing code in a notepad so tha=
t
the work isn't lost when the toplevel crashes". But it's not directly
relevant, as they still use Caml Light.

I agree that an Emacs integration would be useful, but maybe it could also
provide an ocaml-mode for one of the simpler, less powerful editors with
syntax highlighting and a shortcut to call the compiler. In GNU/Linux land,
those would be Gedit and Kate; I'm not sure what Windows people use now.
(There was also a discussion of Eclipse plugin, but I suspect this isn't
ready and would be a lot of work, so it's probably better to separate the
two efforts)
