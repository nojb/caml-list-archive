The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint
programming.  It is concerned with all aspects of computing with
constraints, including theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models,
systems, and applications such as decision making, resource allocation, and
agreement technologies.

CP 2011 includes a technical program, where presentations of research and
application papers as well as invited talks aim at describing the best
results and techniques in the state-of-the-art of constraint programming.
One day of Workshops precedes the conference.  Tutorials and the Doctoral
Program will form part of the main conference.

Papers are solicited from all disciplines concerned with constraints.
Reports on successful applications of constraint technology are
particularly encouraged and are subject to special Applications track
acceptance criteria.  The conference proceedings will be published by
Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Full
paper submissions are limited to 15 LNCS pages, while Short paper
submissions are limited to 8 pages.  Short papers will be reviewed to the
same standards of quality as full papers, but will naturally contain less
quantity of new materials.  Short papers will have the same status as long
papers and be eligible for the best paper prize.

Further information is provided on the conference webpage.
