Subject: [Caml-list] Capitalized source file names

Traditionally, OCaml source files have been named to start with
lowercase letters, even though they define modules whose names begin
with uppercase letters: the definition of module FooBar goes in
fooBar.ml. This has always seemed unintuitive to me.

I'm not sure if this convention has been forced in the past, but
nowadays the entire toolchain seems to support capitalized filenames:
you can put the definition of FooBar in FooBar.ml, and everything just
works. This seems much more natural.

As things stand, is there any reason (besides uniformity with existing
code) why one shouldn't use capitalized source file names nowadays?
