Do you plan to support ocamlopt?  If yes, the users will have to install 
a toolchain (at least, an assembler+linker). Mingw has the advantage of 
producing binaries that depend only on msvcrt.dll (available on any 
fresh Windows installation), not on a specific version of 
msvcr80.dll/msvcr90.dll. But Windows users might prefer to install a 
version of VS Express or a Windows SDK.

Not building labltk seems ok. As for the graphical toplevel, I think 
there are some pending bugs (random crashes) with the current version 
under recent versions of Windows, so it's probably better not to include 
it. Some support for installing the emacs mode automatically and/or a 
version of ledit would be useful replacements.
