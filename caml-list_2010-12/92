We will provide ocamlopt (32/64 bits). But indeed, the toolchain can be
an issue (esp. masm). I plan to use VS2008.

Maybe the native Lexifi's amd64/x86 backend is a better option. If we
are able to use this backend, we still have to use a linker ?

I didn't known this fact. This is another reason for not building
labltk. Since I almost never use it, I don't think it will be a big
loose.

I will probably look for ledit (or lwt toplevel) which seems a better
alternative to emacs (too heavy too install).
