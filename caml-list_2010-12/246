Subject: [Caml-list] Re: Unimplemented modules as top-level signatures

I don't think so. Right now:
1) 3.12 is not yet used by everyone
2) its new features are still studied (at least by me)
3) style is really a matter of taste
4) it is in the language, so no problem using it

So basically, go on, test it and give us your feedback. I doubt there
are thousand people already using this, so you will define yourself
what is right or wrong...

AFAIC, I think it is great and that you should use it.
