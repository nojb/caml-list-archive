Dear all.

I have a big program using ocaml graph and ocaml batteries.
When I was improving performance of the program, I was curious about=20
the performance of those library.

I use old version of ocaml batteries (maybe beta version?) and the =
latest version of ocamlgraph.
And I just use PMap and PSet among ocaml batteries.=20
(now those are changed to BatPMap and BatPSet as I know).

I want to know=20
1. Is there a big difference in memory consumption between old and new =
version of ocaml batteries?
2. Generally, is the memory consumption of ocamlgraph is effective?

Please let me know.

Best,

- Kihong Heo=
