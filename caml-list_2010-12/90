Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming =

(RDP 2011), together with the International Conference on =

Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2011), and several =

workshops. =

RDP 2011 will be held at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  Abstract Submission:  January 7, 2011 (Friday)

  Paper Submission:     January 14, 2011 (Friday)

  Notification:         March 4, 2011 (Friday)

  Final version:        April 3, 2011 (Sunday)

  Conference            May 30, 2011 (Monday)

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of rewriting. Typical areas of interest include (but are not limited
to):

* Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;
  rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and
  algebraic computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and
  verification; proof checking; reasoning about programming languages
  and logics; program transformation; XML queries and transformations

* Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion
  techniques; strategies; rewriting calculi; constraint solving; tree
  automata; termination; complexity; combination;

* Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus and
  higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction; categorical
  and infinitary rewriting; integration of decision procedures; net
  rewriting; binding techniques;

* Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution;
  rewrite tools; termination checking; abstract machines; explicit
  substitutions;

* Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models of
  programs.

INVITED SPEAKERS:
Ashish Tiwari (SRI,USA) and Sophie Tison (Univ. Lille and LIFL,
France) will be invited speakers at RTA.  Stephanie Weirich,
Univ. Pennsylvania will be the invited RDP speaker.

BEST PAPER AWARD:
A prize of 500 Euro will be given to the best paper as judged by the
program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award
or may split it among several papers.

PUBLICATION:
RTA proceedings will be published by LIPIcs (Leibniz International
Proceedings in Informatics). LIPIcs is open access, meaning that
publications will be available online and free of charge, and authors
keep the copyright for their papers.  LIPIcs publications are indexed
in DBLP.  STACS, FSTTCS and ICLP proceedings also appear in LIPIcs.
See
 http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics =

for more information about LIPIcs.

Printed proceedings of RTA will be provided to the participants at the
conference.

SUBMISSIONS:
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Submissions must fall into one of the following categories
(to be indicated in the title page):

1. Regular research Papers: describing new results; they will be judged=

   on correctness and significance.

2. Experience papers: describing the experience of applying rewriting =

   techniques in other areas; they will be judged on relevance and =

   comparison with other approaches.

3. Problem sets that provide realistic and interesting challenges in
   the field of rewriting.

4. System descriptions; they should contain a link to a working system
   and will be judged on usefulness and design.

All submissions will be judged on originality and quality of
presentation. Submissions in the first three categories can be up to
15 proceedings pages long, system descriptions up to 10 proceedings
pages.  Additional material, for instance proof details, may be given
in an appendix which is not subject to the page limit.  However,
submissions must be self-contained within the respective page limit;
reading the appendix should not be necessary to assess the merits of a
submission.

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the
EasyChair system at:
 http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Drta2011

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS: =

Submitted works are limited to 15 pages, including references.  An
appendix may or may not be part of the submission, which will not be
included in the proceedings. Submissions must use the LaTeX class
lipics.cls, and should take the information on the LaTeX formatting
into acount. LaTeX files and formatting information is available for
download at:
 http://www.rdp2011.uns.ac.rs/rta/index.html

Questions concerning submissions may be addressed to the PC chair,
Manfred Schmidt-Schauss <schauss "AT" ki.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de>.
