No crash happened.


Normally I'm very gifted to crash software.... by just looking at it.

If there is a bug, it will find me  ;)

Did you tried another X-driver?

In your valgrind printout there was mentioned "libnvidia".
And a crash seems to have been occured at that part:

So, please chack this. Maybe one of the free drivers does work better,
or maybe an update could help.

If you update your kernel, then you might also need to update the
X-drivers, because the nvidia stuff is non-free binary stuff,
and maybe some bindings don't work correctly with a new kernel.


I once experienced problems the other way around: crashing blender
with the free drivers, just by scaling into a view more and more,
and no crash with the non-free drivers.

This X11-driver part is really a desert...

...and even if you don't use OpenGL commands... the driver that you installed
and configured will be used nevretheless, and if there is something wrong, you
will get your crashes.

Look if the X11-driver-bindings are all up to date for the driver you use now,
and also try another X11-driver...



Ciao,
