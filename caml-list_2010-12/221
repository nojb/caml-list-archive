To be more verbose, I have two processes with two different effective
uid and I would like them to be able to log in the very same file and
not in /var/log/user.log but /var/log/my_project.log. That's why it's
convenient to call a daemon like syslog which handles the permissions
itself.

It seems that Lwt_log provides functions to call the syslog daemon to
log (which the other module also does) or logs itself. In which case,
I'd have the permissions problem because the log file would have the
identity of the running process which created it. Please correct me if
I'm wrong about Lwt_log.

How does Apache proceed ? You can specify where to log in the config
file and set it to /var/log/apache.log and it works while the process
runs with www-data identity.
