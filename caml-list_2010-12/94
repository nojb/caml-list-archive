Probably a good item for documentation/installation screen/link on the
future website of ocaml-installer.

You mean like ld.ocaml:

Thanks for the clarification. I didn't made a clear answer, but I know
that labltk and OCamlWin are 2 separate things.

You are right, in this case I will probably take into consideration this
project:
http://ocamleditor.forge.ocamlcore.org/

It has started on Windows ;-)
