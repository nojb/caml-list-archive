I'm wondering about the same question :-)
I got to ocaml two weeks ago and the first thing I realized was that due the 
the functional programming style and the module system the need for 
oo-programming is much lower than with imperative style languages (at least 
for me).
Has somone found a *best* solution (for his tasks) to combine them (classes 
und modules) or is it really just a matter of taste?
