To me too: I just needed 5 years to set up and publish the theory and
Jun Furuse needed 6 years only to write a thesis with full proofs.

So you're right, it is indeed trivial.

Yes, they are papers on it (to start with, read my POPL'95 paper with
François Rouaix and Catherine Dubois). You may also have a look to
Jun's thesis http://pauillac.inria.fr/~furuse/thesis/.

Have fun!
