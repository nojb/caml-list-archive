Hi.
Some time ago, when looking at Ocaml for the first time, I got baffled by the 
lack of operator overloading. I am still wondering why this is the case. 
Could someone please point me to more information about this?

I remember reading something about operator overloading and type inference 
beeing hard to combine. A little googleing brought me, amongst many things, 
what seems to be a paper about the subject:
"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/581478.581495"
(No I haven't read the paper yet, but it seemed ontopic)
