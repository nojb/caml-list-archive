In my understanding, and from the few times i had interaction with
bugzilla, in its gnome incarnation, it really is not as nice as you
think it is :

  o you have to create an account.

  o you cannot use a mail interface.

Both of these are possible with the ocaml BTS, and altough it would be
nice to have some feedback when the bug report is processed, it works
rather nicely, without the added complexity of bugzilla, which will, in
my opinion, add more confusion than other thinks.

But then, maybe i have been spoiled by the debian BTS.
