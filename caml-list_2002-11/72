You should perhaps consider packaging your Delphi GUI into a DLL with
exported function and then have the OCaml Runtime be your startup. It seems
easier because of the following :

- if you want an ocaml interpreter, you have to link your Delphi with the
ocamlrun.lib file, which is a MSVC one so not compatible with Borland
compiler and linker : you need to rebuild it with Borland tools and nobody
seems to have already done it

- there was some issues in 3.05 when you wanted to have a C "custom"
application running ocaml bytecode which was using a C DLL ( because the DLL
was calling OCaml C API function from ocamlrun.exe, which wasn't your main
interpreter ). I haven't check if this is resolved by the usage of
ocamlrun.dll in 3.06
