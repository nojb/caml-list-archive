In response to my own post, if someone has the same problem ... I simply
used Cash. Here is the result:

let pid, pin, pout, pty_name = Cash.fork_pty_session (fun () -> Cash.exec
"/usr/bin/telnet" [])
in
let str = String.create 1024 in
let res = input pin str 0 1024 in
print_int res;
print_newline ();
print_endline str;
flush stdout

compiled with:
ocamlc -I +site-lib/pcre unix.cma str.cma camlp4/camlp4.cma pcre.cma cash.cma main.ml -o test

I get:
schmitta@localhost:~/SpeedTouchPro> ./test 
8
telnet> 

which is what I wanted ;-)

I still have a couple other small issues, but it feels like a giant leap
;-)
