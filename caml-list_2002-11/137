No, don't do that.  It kills searching -- vi refuses to find the tag.
Apparently a more restricted search is used when searching for tags.

Also, source rpms are a bit annoying for those of us who don't use an
RPM-based distribution.  A tarball would be nice to have on the side as
well, or at least downloadable patches.
