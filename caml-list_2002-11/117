My personal hatered aside, its slow(sluggish if you wish), has terrible 
keyboad/focus problems. And on Windows all the problems feel ten times
worse (Modal dialogs anyone? Underlining? Etc etc) Another point is that
under Windows you have to either live with multimegabyte executables or 
redistribute gtk dlls, cause virtually no one has them installed. 
Certainly not my idea of fun.

Perhaps some of the shortcomings are fixed with 2.x, but i doubt it,
after poking at the sorces a while back it felt horribly misdesigned, 
but i wont elaborate on this.

P.S. But it has all those themes and looks so lovely at times, well duh
id rather live without them.
