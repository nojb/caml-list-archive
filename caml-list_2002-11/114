Ok, no problem, it was just one thing that came to mind when thinking
about this, since i recently read of Appeal's demise and remembered this
discution. That said, i believe that their rendering engine could have
easily been ported, more easily that other hardware accelerated engines
of that time at least.

That said, jean marc asked if it wasn't fine to have ocaml used
*natively* on the win32 plateform, and i believe it would be nice, but
would create the risk of win32 only ocaml programs, which is IMHO not a
nice thing to contemplate.

Mmm, i see it uses GTK+, it would run on linux too then ?
