ocaml-http is a library inspired from perl's HTTP::Daemon that permits
to write simple HTTP daemons in OCaml, main module is named Http_daemon.

Currently GET only HTTP daemons are supported.

You can define the behaviour of your daemon defining a callback that is
invoked each time an HTTP request is received.
A simple OO interface that abstracts over HTTP requests and responses is
provided.
A set of facility functions for writing callbacks is also provided (e.g.
functions to send headers, files, and so on).

Regarding daemons' "social life" is possible to specify address and port
on which the daemon will listen to, whether or not a child is forked for
each request and a timeout after which client connections will be
closed.

A preliminary release (0.0.3) of ocaml-http is available for download
at:
