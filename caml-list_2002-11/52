I'd like to do GUI and other interfaces with one of the Windows RAD
tools (e.g. Delphi) that is well-developed for such things and do 
back-end algorithms in OCaml.  For this to work the Windows way,
the OCaml should probably be packaged as a COM server or DLL.  Is
anyone doing this with good success?  Any details on how would be
welcome.

TIA
