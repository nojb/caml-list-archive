Hi,
I've put up a preliminary binary distribution of Ocaml for OS X, at
http://home.att.net/~scharris/OSX/

It appears as a single icon, just drag it wherever you want it and 
you're set.
I've tried to do it the "OS X way" by putting everything that's needed 
within the application itself,  which like all OS X apps is really a 
directory "<app-name>.app" in the unix filesystem.  So the ocaml files 
which ordinarily would be installed into  e.g. /usr/local/{lib,bin} are 
within the application itself, in directories 
<app-name>.app/dist/{lib,bin}.
The gui application itself is the toplevel wrapper that was announced 
earlier. By default it now uses the ocaml toplevel it includes within 
itself (so the user doesn't have to configure the path to the 
interpreter now), but that's configurable and you can download it with 
or without the ocaml distribution within it.

Some things still aren't fully worked out in the gui toplevel wrapper, 
such as how best to recognize termination of input.  You can tell it 
whether to look for ;;'s or ;'s (in case you like revised syntax) as a 
terminator, but if that's not the real end of input *and* it happens to 
end the line (except for whitespace), then it will be confused for end 
of input.  The confustion is more likely in revised syntax I guess 
since ;'s are also list separators.  But you can always put it in the 
mode where shift-enter ends the input.  I do wonder if anybody has any 
better ideas though, short of putting a full parser into it.


PS: at least look at  the image at the top of the page, "lambda leading 
camel", which is also the app icon.

Thanks
