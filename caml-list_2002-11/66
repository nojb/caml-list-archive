IIRC stdio/stdout use different buffering strategy (line-buffering vs. 
fixed size buffer) depending upon whether isatty(0) is true or false. If 
this is the case, there is nothing you can do to force telnet into 
line-buffering mode except using pseudo-ttys (pty), which is what programs 
like "screen" and "except" do.
