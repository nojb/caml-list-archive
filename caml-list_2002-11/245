Let's suppose wy have module with such interface

module X =
 type t (*big data structure*)

 add : string -> t
 delete : t -> ()

And in the other module i keep X.t list, and i want to keep with each of 
them additional data of unknown type [at time of X compilation]

One solution is to have a hash from t to additional data in 
external module, but this would be slow, because of size of t.

Other is to keep with every t int identifier as small as possible, to keep
additional data in array, but this solution isn't very good.

Any ideas?
