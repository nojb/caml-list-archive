Ensemble is a group communication system written by Cornell, and the Hebrew
University.
It allows the creation of process group wherein reliable communication
is supported. The system core is written in ML, with wrappers for
C/C++/Java.

A new Ensemble release, version 1.39,  is now available, below are the
release notes.

RELEASE_NOTES

  This distribution includes ports to HPUX and Solaris donated by
Bernd Harries (bha@gmx.de). The socket library has been reworked,
generic code was split away from platform specific code. The five
supported total ordering protocols have been brought up to date. A
document describing the Ensemble lower-level transport and io-vector
system has been added to the tutorial.

  A bug affecting use of gossip on win32 systems using UDP has been reported,
and has not been fixed in this distribution. The next distribution will
include a fix for it.

   IBM research has been added to the list of copyright
 holders along with Cornell and the Hebrew University. This does not
 change the terms of the licence, the system remains free of charge
 in the spirit of its BSD licence.

A more specific list of changes:
1. Port to Solaris and HPUX, donated by Bernd Harries (bha@gmx.de).
3. Improved SEQBB performance.
4. Fixed ref-count and correctness bugs in SEQUENCER, TOTEM, TOTAL.
5. Reworked the socket library
   - Use the new ocaml-3.06 Unix setsock calls
   - split between the Unix stuff and win32 stuff, this gets read of the
     all the #ifdefs.
   - Rewritten the makefiles
   - Improved the exported .H files
   - cleanup
6. Improved safety of reference counted buffers.
7. Added a first version of a document describing the Ensemble lower-level
   transport and io-vector system. It can be found in the tutorial.
8. Removed the need for the ENS_ABSROOT environment variable. This was
   previously needed on win32 systems for 'make clean' purposes.
9. Bug effecting gossip on win32 systems. When an application using a
   gossip server dies, the gossip server goes into an infinite loop
   due to an endless sequence of socket errors. We are working on
   fixing this behaviour.


OCAML COMPILER VERSION
  We are using version 3.06 for this version.

PORTABILITY
  This version was tested on Linux, and WIN2000. It was also used on Solaris
(with a gcc system) and HPUX.
