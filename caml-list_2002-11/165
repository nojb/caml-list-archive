Ok, so using the X server on mac OS X is the best alternative for doing
ocaml GUI's.

Is the X server difficult to install ?

BTW, you seem to have access to a OS X/Darwin box, would it be possible
to make the corresponding pre-built package available for download on
the lablgl/lablgtk pages ?

Also, am i right in thinking that if i develop a non-custom bytecode
program under linux, it will run just fine on a OS X box provided i have
the lablgtk and ocaml installed ?

Mmm, i would much prefet a lablgtk solution anyway,
