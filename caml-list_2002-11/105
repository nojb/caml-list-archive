I wrote the Osiris library, a native Win32 GUI 100% OCaml which is built on
top of the OCaml Win32 API . This enable you to easily create and manipulate
GUI components ( as easy as Borland VCL but still incomplete ). Then I wrote
and XML toplevel so that you can write your interface in xml ( this took me
only two days, and the result is far more readable that any C equivalent
would have been ). This done, I created a tool called "Dragoon3" which was
designed to be a multi user resources sharing platform for the 3D game my
company was planning : Virtual file system, duplicate data stored in DB,
check in & out, and plugins enable.... all in Ocaml. Then I finally wrote
the 3D Engine for the game ( DirectX based ) and interfaced it with OCaml so
I could instanciate and manipulate 3D objects with it.

The results have been very good :  2x speedup in development process,
shorter code : easier to maintain, and great perfs.
