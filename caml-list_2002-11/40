Originally I thought that there are no quotation expanders
defined in the bare camlp4 executable. Therefore I suggested that
quotation expansion should be off by default.

By grepping for Quatation.add I learned that camlp4 contains at
least two quotation expanders: "id" and "string". Are there more?
Where are they documented? (I would also be interested in why
they are included in camlp4?)

   What I could do, if you want, is to add an option of the command
   line of Camlp4 setting it to true. You could use it like that:
          ocamlc -pp "camlp4o -no_quot" ...
   
An option would be fine.

Bye,

Hendrik
