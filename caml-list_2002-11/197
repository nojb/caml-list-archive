> Why does ocamlc load dlls during linking?  

Just to make sure that all external C functions referenced from your
Caml code are indeed defined in the DLLs you provide.  Otherwise, the
error would only be detected at run time, and earlier is better.

I agree b) is a bit of a problem, but I don't know of any portable way
to test whether DLL x.dll defines symbol "foo" than to link x.dll and
query the address of "foo".

Sure: ocamlopt links statically the Caml/C stub code.  It doesn't use
the DLLs.
