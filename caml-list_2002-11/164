Actually, I've only been able to use those 3 with an X server.
(Xdarwin is very easy to install, and supports the 3 interfaces
perfectly well, and even lablgl)
Since I don't see any Aqua code in otherlibs/graph, I suppose that
there is no support for direct Aqua graphics in Objective Caml.

In theory it should be possible to use labltk with the Aqua version of
Tk. However, there seems to be an issue in how you link your
application. At least, it will not work if you link it as a BSD
command-line application (the application starts, but does not react
to events). And I don't know how you link a normal OSX application
without starting ProjectBuilder.
