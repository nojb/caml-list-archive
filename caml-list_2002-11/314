Hi Manuel,

As you should have noticed, I did not try to optimize anything in the
Caml code: I just tried a litteral translation from Scheme to Caml. In
effect, the original Caml code was not optimally clear (difficult to
read and difficult to compile) and was compared to a (relatively)
clear Scheme code. Mere translation of the Scheme code to Caml just
improves the runtime by a factor of 2 or so. As you surely know
already, I was obliged to change the initialization, since

   (mx (make-vector rows 0.0))

is ill-typed in Caml.

This is amazing that now this well-typed Caml version, once translated
back to Scheme, improves the original Scheme version!

I think that this proves, once more, that our languages are not as
different as people think they are :)

Cheers,

Pierre Weis
