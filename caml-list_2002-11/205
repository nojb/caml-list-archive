Some time ago, I ran into problems with dll checking. I tried to
embed the ocaml interpreter into another environment by loading
ocamlrun as dll. Unfortunately, I got a loop:

other_environment
  loads: ocamlrun.so
     loads: other_environment_stubs.so
            (to access functions of other_environment)
         uses symbols of other_environment

>From the dll side, there is absolutely no problem, you have only to
ensure that other_environment exports all its symbols to 
subsequently loaded dlls. However, it is not possible to create
an ocaml bytecode executable for this special construction,
because ocamlc cannot load other_environment_stubs.so which
depends on symbols that are only dynamically available. I solved
that by playing with LD_PRELOAD, but this is really not nice.

A switch that turns dll checking off would really have helped me.
I know that embedding ocamlrun as shown is not officially supported,
but it is absolutely cool to dynamically load the whole interpreter
into any program.
