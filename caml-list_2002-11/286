Yes, valgrind is an excellent tool.  As for the memory leaks, there
are things that are not freed on exit (heap, stack), but that's
intentional (the OS is goign to free everything itself).  Bug reports
for other leaks are most welcome.

The best way is to submit bug reports to caml-bugs.  Attach a patch if
you wish, but that's optional (we may want to fix the bugs differently).
A patch without a bug report is useless.

Bugzilla has a reputation of being awfully hard to install.  Other bug
tracking systems are better alternatives.  Jitterbug (what we
currently use) is indeed simplistic, but fits our needs well.
