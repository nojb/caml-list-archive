No it is not:

implementation A.ml:
let f x y =3D x + y
let g x =3D if x =3D 1 then fun y -> y else fun y -> y - 1

interface A.mli:
val f : int -> int -> int
val g : int -> int -> int

usage (somewhere outside A):
let k =3D (A.f 1) (* this application is partial *)
let r =3D (A.g 1) (* this application is not partial *)

Compiler cannot distinguish between those two cases
(knowing only A interface).

BTW a GRAB/RESTART trick is very cool IMHO.
My students always "Wow!" at it. Any references as to
where it comes from (or was it a Xavier's own clever idea?)

Cheers,
Dmitry
