I just noticed that it's not safe to use really_input with nonblocking
operations.  In particular, as is clear from the source, if really_input
fails in the middle of a read due to a Sys_blocked_io, it ends up
discarding the what it's read so far.  It seems like this should be
noted in the documentation.

Another documentation problem:  the docs susggest that various unix
errors will be thrown on blocked IO, but in my own experiments, the only
exception I've seen thrown is Sys_blocked_io, which is not as far as I
can tell mentioned anywhere in the docs.
