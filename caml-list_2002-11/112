Yes, but that would mean that the apps developped for it will only be
usable for on windows only, which let many people out in the cold. In
particular, i would love to play a ocaml based games, not that i have
time for it but still, but since i don't have windows, ...

Also, i remember when i was some time back at the AFIG conference, there
where the people making the outcast games explaining how they did their
software rendering and all, and i asked them about a linux port, since
they software was not using any hardware acceleration, in these pre-DRI
times it would have been a good candidate for a linux port. They
esquived my question, and look where they are now ? Maybe the publicity
coup they would have made with releasing a linux games would have saved
them.
