It's not really equivalent. Consider my present work. I have 
three ongoing projects: one named afo, one named lib, and 
one named vsg. It would be natural to have a means of 
identifying my company first, and subsequently identifying 
each single project. Your proposal would be to use such 
namespace ids as Com.Baretta.VSG, Com.Baretta.Lib and 
Com.Baretta.Afo. There's nothing wrong with this, but it is 
much less intuitiva and comprehensible than 
"http://priv.baretta.com/afo", 
"http://priv.baretta.com/lib", 
"http://priv.baretta.com/svg". This latter schema allows for 
the identification of a URL -- in this case a private one on 
an intranet -- associated with the project. Further, such a 
schema allows for multiple versions of the same sw -- i.e. a 
private alpha such as the above, and a public release -- to 
coexist without interfering with each other.

Your schema is viable, and it is good to have your proposal 
around. Hopefully, the developers will take a stand on the 
issue and propose a standard themselves, in which case it's 
likely to resemble what you submitted. Yet, I still advocate 
the use of the XML single layered namespace schema as a 
simple, flexibile and effective solution.
