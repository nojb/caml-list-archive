There is no difference between "load" a module and "start" it: the fact
of loading it is starting it.

In some cases, you could resolve your problem with Camlp4, if your
computation can be done at parse time. We can imagine a syntax
extension, e.g. "compute" followed by an expression, ask the
preprocessor to evalutate it and build the syntax tree of the
result. For example:
    compute (2*2)
would generate at parse time:
    4

But this could not work:
    let x = 2 in
    compute(x*x)
because the preprocessor does not know what is "x".

On the other hand, if "x" is defined as a directive to the preprocessor,
for example with "DEFINE x = 2" (new syntax extension pa_macro.cmo), it
could work.
