I think the last time this subject came up on the list, it was said that
the bytecode does not contain as much information as is needed by the
native code compiler, in particular, i think the bytecode does not
contain any kind of type information.

That said, i guess you could store some kind of intermediary
representation instead, and compile from that, but it is worth it ?
