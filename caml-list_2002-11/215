Subject: [Caml-list] ocamldep and [O]OCAMLLIB dependencies
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


Is there any way to force ocamldep to include dependencies on standard
library files as well as non-standard files?  It appears to ignore
anything below the [O]CAMLLIB directory.  Perhaps a command line
switch to toggle this behavior would be good.  It's useful when you're
building new versions of the compiler and you want your test programs
to auto-recompile.

Thanks,
Chris
