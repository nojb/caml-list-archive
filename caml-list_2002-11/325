I have installed it before and it was not hard at all.  I did it one
afternoon on a Debian system, using MySQL as the database backend.  It
worked fine.  Going into the project, getting the database installed
was the scariest part of it, but Debian's package installation is
smooth enough that installing MySQL is not a problem at all.

I don't know much about other good bug tracking systems.  I've
encountered a few bad ones, but that doesn't help much.

I've also hacked a Bugzilla implementation to change the form for
submitting bugs, add fields to bugs, and make other changes.  It's
just a bunch of Perl CGI scripts.  If you aren't concerned with being
prepared to accept some future Bugzilla upgrade, there's no special
problem with adapting it to your purposes.

On the other hand, I'm not hearing interesting-enough specific
problems with the present Jitterbug implementation, so I can't
advocate switching to Bugzilla even if it's trivial.  There would at
least be work to migrate the existing bugs to the new system.
