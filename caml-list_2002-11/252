This probably has more to do with your ocamlc, ocamlopt and VIM versions th=
an=20
with your Windows version (although I'm shocked to learn that people are=20
using Win95 for development). I would suggest checking that you have=20
ftplugin/ocaml.vim, indent/ocaml.vim and syntax/ocaml.vim in your VIM=20
installation.
