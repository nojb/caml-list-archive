Sorry I don't have any suggestions for Delphi or COM.

Personally, I would do the GUI and everything else (optimize later, if 
needed) in Python (works great on Windows), GUI toolkits include Tkinter 
(ugly, and missing some good widgets, though add-ons are available), 
WxPython (wrapper around WxWindows, fully-featured, though a bit overly 
complicated with a big memory footprint), PyGTK (Yes it runs on Windows, 
fast and featureful, not sure about stability),  PyQt (stable, native 
look'n'feel, fast, featureful, "free" and commercial versions 
available), those are the biggest ones, though there are a few others.

The only thing I'm not sure about is interfacing with OCaml.  SWIG has 
good Python support, and it also claims Ocaml support, so that's 
something to check out.
