I decided to run valgrind against the bytecode interpreter and it
found a memory leak, which fixed.

By the way, valgrind is this really cool memory leak and access
detector for Linux.  It doesn't require any modifications to any
binaries.  See

    http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/

Anyway, I have a patch for the memory leak and for a couple of
other minor things I saw in the C code.

What's the best way to get these into the CVS tree?  Should I
send the patches to caml-bugs?

Regarding the bug tracker, I noticed that it doesn't do any
tracking of the people that respond to or categorize bugs.
It seems pretty feature short compared to Bugzilla.  Would
there be any way to get Bugzilla installed at Inria?

Best,
Blair
