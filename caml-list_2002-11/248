I agree. This method is only useful if computational 
complexity is much greater than space complexity. Besides, 
even complexity is actually a fairly volatile concept in 
this case, because we are talking about computing a constant 
function (no input).

To be honest, I can't think of a situtation where I'd use my 
own hack. I wonder what was Jakob's reason for posting 
originally.
