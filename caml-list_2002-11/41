No, there are no more predefined quotation expanders than the ones
you cite (if you don't load other cmo files, of course).

Why these ones are included? Well, there is no reason, it was just to
test that it works, a very time ago. But they are not used (not by me,
in any case), I can remove them if it is a problem.
