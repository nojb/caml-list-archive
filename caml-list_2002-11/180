Subject: [Caml-list] int32/int64 literals in next release?
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


Is there any chance some way of inputing int32/int64 literals can be
added to the compiler for this next release?  It's a pain in the rear
to convert them from strings and whatnot, and as they become more and
more usable (unboxing optimizations, used in more apis, work in
printf/scanf, etc.) it becomes relatively more of a pain to initialize
the damn things.  And, I'd say it's more likely that you'll use
int32/int64 with constant bit patterns in source because they're
full-width and useful for interfacing with the outside world.  It
would also eliminate the need for the really silly part at the top of
the two interfaces with the "chosen constants":

<<
  val zero : int32
>>
                The 32-bit integer 0.
<<
  val one : int32
>>
                The 32-bit integer 1.
<<
  val minus_one : int32
>>
                The 32-bit integer -1.

There have been a bunch of syntax proposals on this list before.  I'd
be happy with any of them as long as there was some way to do it (in
hex,dec,bin,oct of course, and with the new _ separator :).

Thanks,
Chris
