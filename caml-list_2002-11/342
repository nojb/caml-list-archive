Hi again.
Now I found a previous thread about this
"http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200104/threads.html#00028"
I still don't understand why overloading isn't doable, (not only operator 
overloading)
And I wondered if any projects work on this?

There are three schools of magic.  One:  State a tautology, then ring the
changes on its corollaries; that's philosophy.  Two:  Record many facts.
Try to find a pattern.  Then make a wrong guess at the next fact; that's
science.  Three:  Be aware that you live in a malevolent Universe controlled
by Murphy's Law, sometimes offset by Brewster's Factor; that's engineering.
