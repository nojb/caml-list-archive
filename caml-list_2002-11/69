I've already thought of it and have an idea how to resolve
this problem. It is basically matches yours (something
like local-proxy). In fact, since a lot of my development
goes at my home PC w/ only dialup, it is a very important
thing for me, so this problem will be resolved at the best
way :)

Well, I like and will implement it soon.
