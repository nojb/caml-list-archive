I haven't read the link you suggested, but I can assure you 
that I have a couple multigigabyte files on the dark side of 
my computer, and both Windows explorer and unix cp and tar 
fail to copy it elsewhere. I thought I might try writing my 
own cp in Ocaml with the LargeFile module. But you tell me 
that FAT is incapable of large files. Then, my attempt would 
be doomed to fail. Curiously enough, the video capture 
application that made those files in the first place and 
other video editing and playback applications are perfectly 
able to read and use those files.
