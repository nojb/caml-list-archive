That's an OT subject... almost troll :)

Back to the thread, I would say that to port of such a game would only need the 
port of the C 3D functions DLL based on the OCaml interface which could be 
disclosed without the need to release the entire game source code ( often a 
problem for us industrials - no flames please ). And actually only people 
building the game care about the R&D tools, which can also be built by porting 
Osiris to *Nix systems ( eg by using GTK ).

OCaml so is really useful because you only need to take care of the low-level 
library port ( which can be open sourced if you release only the interfaces ) 
which is a pretty good compromise for both industrials and end users.
