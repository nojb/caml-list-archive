Yes, you're right. After reading through the vim docs I found that tags
are searched with 'magic' option off, which means only '^' and '$' are
magic. '.' is not. Also '\' as quote character and '/' as a search string 
delimeter needs to be quoted. Therefore current version of patch quotes
any of '$', '\', '/', which seems to work fine.

Sure, please check ftp://ftp.kernel.pl/pub/People/malekith/ocaml/ for
