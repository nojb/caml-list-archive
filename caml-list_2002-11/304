I've looked at several BTS and decided to use it at several different
companies for internal use, so I've been quite happy with it.

The first thing I noticed browsing the Caml bugs was that there was
no mention of who categorized the bugs and who wrote any comments in
response to the bugs.  I always find this good info to have when
browsing bugs.

With an account you get to attach your email address to a particular
bug if you want to watch it.  I've done with with one bug on Mozilla
that I've been waiting forever to finish (uploading bookmarks, history,
etc), and don't have to subscribe to a mailing list to see it's
progress.

True.

I think each BTS has things that others are missing.  Having used
Bugzilla in many projects, I've come to look for those pieces of
information.
