I think this is a very cool feature. It has some interesting 
  implications which must be worked out first. Consider the 
case where the user is not connected to the same service 
that provides the package. A portable computer user, for 
example, or simply someone wishing to install from 
disk-based source distribution. There must be an alternative 
way of resolving packages. One solution might be defining a 
CAMLPATH environment variable à la Java CLASSPATH, and 
looking for the modules in 
<camlpath_directory>/<ns_url_path> before actually 
attempting a network connection.

Finally, a really cool, cool, cool feature would be dynamic 
linking of Ocaml modules from their namespace URL, with 
static typechecking at compile time against the 
corresponding .mli files. How do you like this idea, Yurii?
