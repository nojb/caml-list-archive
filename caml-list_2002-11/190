Subject: [Caml-list] ocamlc linking loads dlls?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


Why does ocamlc load dlls during linking?  From reading 
bytecomp/bytelink.ml it doesn't seem like it does much with the information 
except for getting paths (which you could do without loading the dll), yet 
this is a big problem for a) dlls that aren't in the path during build, and 
b) dlls that do complex stuff in their dllmain.

Am I missing something and this is really necessary?

ocamlopt doesn't do it, for what it's worth.
