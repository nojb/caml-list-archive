Thanks.  I'll have to give this a try.  I took a look at it a while
back and saw that there was C code to translate between OCaml types 
and C types.  I didn't go very much farther, because I didn't want
to mess with a 3-language solution, Delphi <-> C <-> OCaml, which
could be way too much work for me.  Reading a little more of the
docs today, I see that the C code gets automatically generated and
that there is a tool to link it into the server automatically as well,
so my previous negative impression was likely ill-conceived.   

Can't wait to get time to give this a try.  While I'm waiting, back
to the original theme of this thread.  Can anyone offer tales of 
(impressive) success or gotchas doing such things under Windows
with OCaml?
