Call for Papers:
11th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering
(SLE 2018)
co-located with SPLASH 2018
November 5-6, 2018
Boston, Massachusetts, United States
https://conf.researchr.org/track/sle-2018/papers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are pleased to invite you to submit papers to the 11th ACM SIGPLAN
International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE 2018), held
in conjunction with SPLASH 2018 at Boston, Massachusetts on November 5-6,
2018.

---------------------------
Scope
---------------------------

With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating
intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software
languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to
describe its environment, and the languages driving its development
process. Given that everything depends on software and that software
depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to
come, everything will depend on software languages.

Software language engineering (SLE) is the discipline of engineering
languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It
abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling
languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the engineering
facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the
scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is
certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are
engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope
extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything.

Like its predecessors, the 11th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2018,
will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common
interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It
overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of
programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction,
and emphasizes the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE
traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only
temporal overlap occurring between co-located events.

---------------------------
Topics of Interest
---------------------------

SLE 2018 solicits high-quality contributions in areas ranging from
theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools, techniques, and
frameworks in the domain of software language engineering. Topics relevant
to SLE cover generic aspects of software languages development rather than
aspects of engineering a specific language. In particular, SLE is
interested in contributions from the following areas:

* Software Language Design and Implementation
      - Approaches to and methods for language design
      - Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints)
      - Techniques for specifying behavioral / executable semantics
      - Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation)
      - Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches
* Software Language Validation
      - Verification and formal methods for languages
      - Testing techniques for languages
      - Simulation techniques for languages
* Software Language Integration and Composition
      - Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools
      - Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages)
      - Traceability between languages
      - Deployment of languages to different platforms
* Software Language Maintenance
      - Software language reuse
      - Language evolution
      - Language families and variability
* Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design,
implementation, validation, maintenance)
* Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools
      - User studies evaluating usability
      - Performance benchmarks
      - Industrial applications

---------------------------
Important Dates
---------------------------

All dates are Anywhere on Earth.

* Fri 29 June 2018 -  Abstract Submission
* Fri 6 July 2018 - Paper Submission
* Fri 24 August 2018 - Author Notification
* Fri 31 August 2018 - Artifact Submission
* Fri 5 October 2018 - Camera Ready Deadline
* Wed 10 October 2018 - Artifact Notification
* Fri 12 October 2018 - Deadline for Artifact-Related Paper Updates
* Sun 4 Nov 2018 - SLE Workshops
* Mon 5 Nov - Tue 6 Nov 2018 - SLE Conference

---------------------------
Types of Submissions
---------------------------

* Research papers
These should report a substantial research contribution to SLE or
successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions
must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography.

* Tool papers
Because of SLE=E2=80=99s interest in tools, we seek papers that present sof=
tware
tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include originality
of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the SLE
topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations.
Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages excluding
bibliography, and a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6
pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords =E2=80=9CTool Demo=E2=80=
=9D or =E2=80=9CTool
Demonstration=E2=80=9D in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if t=
he
demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-page
demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for
evaluating the submission.

* New ideas / vision papers
New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE research
approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to
describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of
investigation. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories
about existing SLE research that can lead to the development of new
technologies or approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4
pages excluding bibliography.

Workshops: Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and
contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of
interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be
found at the SPLASH 2018 Website:
https://conf.researchr.org/track/splash-2018/splash-2018-Workshops.

---------------------------
Artifact Evaluation
---------------------------

For the third year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the
quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of
experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to
submit artifacts. More information will be announced on the Website.

---------------------------
Submission
---------------------------

Submissions have to use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format "acmart" (
http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format); please make sure that
you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template (
https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-t=
emplate/acmart-master.zip),
and that the document class definition is
\documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}. Do not make any changes to this
format!

Using the Word template is strongly discouraged.

Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white
printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font
sizes in figures and tables are legible.

SLE follows a single-blind review process. Thus, you do not have to blind
your submission.

All submissions must be in PDF format.

Concurrent Submissions:
Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for
publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN=E2=80=99s Republication Polic=
y (
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication). Submitters should
also be aware of ACM=E2=80=99s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism (
http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy). Submissions
that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.

Submission Site:
Submissions will be accepted at https://sle18.hotcrp.com/.

---------------------------
Reviewing Process
---------------------------

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee.  Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated
concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment
with the conference call. New ideas / vision papers will be evaluated
primarily concerning novelty, significance, readability, and alignment with
the conference call.

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above
instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected
without review, at the discretion of the PC chairs.

---------------------------
Awards
---------------------------

* Distinguished paper: Award for most notable paper, as determined by the
PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee.

* Distinguished reviewer: Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined
by the PC chairs.

* Distinguished artifact: Award for the artifact most significantly
exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the
recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee.

---------------------------

---------------</div><div>Types of Submissions</div><div>------------------=
---------</div><div><br></div><div>* Research papers</div><div>These should=
 report a substantial research contribution to SLE or successful applicatio=
n of SLE techniques or both. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 page=
s excluding bibliography.</div><div><br></div><div>* Tool papers</div><div>=
Because of SLE=E2=80=99s interest in tools, we seek papers that present sof=
tware tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria include origina=
lity of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to SLE. Any of the =
SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submi=
ssions must provide a tool description of 4 pages excluding bibliography, a=
nd a demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 6 pages. Tool dem=
onstrations must have the keywords =E2=80=9CTool Demo=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C=
Tool Demonstration=E2=80=9D in the title. The 4-page tool description will,=
 if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 6-p=
age demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for ev=
aluating the submission.</div><div><br></div><div>* New ideas / vision pape=
rs</div><div>New ideas papers should describe new, non-conventional SLE res=
earch approaches that depart from standard practice. They are intended to d=
escribe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investiga=
tion. Vision papers are intended to present new unifying theories about exi=
sting SLE research that can lead to the development of new technologies or =
approaches. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 4 pages excluding bib=
liography.</div><div><br></div><div>Workshops: Workshops will be organized =
by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would =
like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on=
 how to submit workshops can be found at the SPLASH 2018 Website: <a href=

div><br></div><div>---------------------------</div><div>Artifact Evaluatio=
n</div><div>---------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>For the th=
ird year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of th=
e artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental=
 reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifact=
s. More information will be announced on the Website.</div><div><br></div><=
