I use CamlP4 for different for of the "syntaxic sugaring" (for example -
for list comprehension syntax) and for incapsulations of some patterns in
matching.

I have a following question about camlp4 distribution: I failed to build
Windows version of camlp4. May will be better to include camlp4 in binary
Windows distribution of OCaml?
