Native compiler: when we find the time to do it.
Ocamllex and ocamlyacc: they work perfectly well right now.
Profiler: Real Soon Now for the execution-count profiler, I don't know
for the time profiler.
Debugger: that's really tricky, because it's very much Unix-dependent
(it has an essential need of the fork system call).  Maybe someday
without the replay features.

The other thing that's missing is an interface to the OS and toolbox,
but I'm afraid we don't have the manpower to do it.

Of course, you're welcome to contribute anything you want.
