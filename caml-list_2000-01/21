I've been going nuts copying record-type definitions, and then Benjamin Pierce
showed me a trick.

Please tell me where in the OCaml manual I could have discovered
the ability to write

  tm.Unix.tm_hour

as in

        let tm = Unix.localtime (Unix.time()) in
        sprintf "%02d:%02d:%02d " tm.Unix.tm_hour tm.Unix.tm_min tm.Unix.tm_sec


Norman

P.S.  just writing let tm = ... in ... tm.tm_hour ... etc causes ocamlc to barf.
