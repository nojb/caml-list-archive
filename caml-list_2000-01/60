I did one a while ago, but never polished it up.  It was based on the CuDD
package.  It may be useful as a starting point.

Perhaps BDDs should come as part of the standard distribution, as they do
with Mercury.  OCaml could then easily become a standard platform for
implementing hardware verification tools.  Does any one else have experience
as to which would be the best C package to lift to the OCaml level, or if
the performance gained by using C is worth it or not?

Cheers,
Don
