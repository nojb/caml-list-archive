LablTk is not O'CamlTk, which explains this lack.
Applications written for O'CamlTk will not work with it, and you
should get and compile O'CamlTK for them.

I plan to include LablTk in the windows version of ocaml 3.00.

LablGTK is still beta, so do not expect a full replacement too soon.
It should also be ported to windows, when I get some time (or somebody
does it for me...). Since mlgtk was ported to windows, this should not
be too difficult.

This could help, certainly...
