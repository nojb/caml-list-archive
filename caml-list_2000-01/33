The main big user of Camlp4 is the program Coq (from the project Coq
of INRIA). The revised syntax seems to have very few users.

Hmmm... I don't know wether people use it. Actually I don't use it. It
is just a program extracted from the technology of Camlp4, but not
specially dedicated to Ocaml programs. You can just use quotations and
the rest of the input text is not parsed at all.
