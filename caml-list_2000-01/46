This sounds interesting! List comprehensions would definitely be a neat
thing to have in OCaml. Would you mind explaining more about this?  How
does this look like in the code and how is it implemented?

This would also be one of my feature wishes for OCaml, because this
technique can really cut down code size and improve readability
significantly...
