                       INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL
                          ON APPLIED SEMANTICS
                            ---APPSEM'2000---

                  Caminha, Portugal, 9-15 September 2000

            http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/Caminha00/index.html


OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND

Programming languages are the basic tools with which all applications
of computers are built.  It is important, therefore, that they should
be well designed and well implemented. Achieving these goals requires
both a good theoretical understanding of programming language designs,
and practical skills in the development of high quality compilers.

The summer school is addressed to postgraduate students, researchers

and industrials who want to learn about recent developments in programming

language research, both in semantic theory and in implementation.

The programme will consist of introductory and advanced courses on the
following themes: 


- description of existing programming language features;

- design of new programming language features;

- implementation and analysis of programming languages;

- transformation and generation of programs;

- verification of programs.

LOCATION

The summer school is located in Caminha, a picturesque village by the

sea and on the Rio Minho, on the northern border between Portugal and

Spain.
