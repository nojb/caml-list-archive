Hi, 
 I am trying to port OCaml to a custom operating system which is tailored
to my needs. I wish to know what things to be taken care of. I would be
specifically interested to know which parts of the code I may be required
to modify? 
  What are the interfaces OCaml uses to talk with the OS ?

Thanks,
Ravi
