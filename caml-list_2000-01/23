I didn't find it.  I tried it on a whim and was very glad that it
worked.

If you wander through the BNF grammar in the reference section, it
does show it as being possible.  A label can either be a label-name,
or a  (module-path '.' label-name).  It might be helpful to mention
this somewhere in the tutorial, or in some kind of FAQ, since it is
very handy.
