Subject: LablTk not in MS Windows O'Caml 2.99?
Sender: weis

[I apologize for the lack of a French version of this message.]

Hello!

It looks like the precompiled binaries for O'Caml 2.99 for MS Windows
don't include LablTk, although the Redhat binaries did include
LablTk.  Earlier versions of O'Caml for MS Windows included O'CamlTk.

Was this omission intentional?  
Result of not enough manpower?

Has anyone gotten LablTk to work on MS Windows?

Is the TK interface eventually going to be replaced by a Gtk+ interface?
Has anyone gotten LablGtk to work on MS Windows?

Does all of this depend more people helping with O'Caml development?
(:-)
