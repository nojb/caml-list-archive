Hello All and best wishes to everyone and to Ocaml for the year 2000
(last of the century)

I am asking who is using the Camlp4 as an Ocaml preprocessor (the
Revised syntax is another legitimate use of Camlp4, as is its pretty
printing facilities) and why?

I am considering use Camlp4 to code a C++ code generator (sadly I
cannot code in Ocaml my applications). My ideas are very fuzzy today,
but I consider coding a generator which represents all of the
generated C++ syntax tree as Ocaml values and using camlp4 to
translate

  CPPCLASS picture ... END

as

  let picture = make_cpp_class "picture" in 
  ...

Alsom did anyone use ocpp (in camlp4)? I did not understand what is it
and why is it useful for?
