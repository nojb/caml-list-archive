I'm finishing up getting ocamlbuild to work with the dypgen parser, but I
can't yet figure out how to get ocamlbuild to automatically list the .ml
and .mli of the .dyp parser as microbes to be cleaned in sanitize.sh. It
doesn't look like the hygiene or fda modules are exposed in the plugin. Is
there any way to do it other than manually replicate the functionality in
the {Before,After}_hygiene dispatch hook?
