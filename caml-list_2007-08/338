For the record, this idea isn't mine.  I'm stealing the idea (immature 
artists immitate, mature artists steal) from Stephen Weeks and David 
Powers here, and I think they're stealing the idea from somewhere else.

Of course, this requires programmers to *think* differently.  Not 
something many programmers are willing to try (thinking, that is), in my 
experience.  Especially not blub programmers.

While we're trading blog posts, I'd also point out:
