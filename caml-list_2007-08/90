I don't believe the Debian packages for 3.10 have filtered through but I was 
so desperate to use the awesome new natdynlink branch that upgraded to that 
from CVS and rebuilt almost all packages from the existing Debian source 
packages with:

  apt-get --build source foo

Most packages work like this right out of the box.
