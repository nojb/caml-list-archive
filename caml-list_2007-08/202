The Convenience-Module is very convenient for simple
things, IMHO.
I have tried it and found it very funny to use.

But I think for more sophisticated things you have to use the
other modules. I'm not sure, but I think (as far as I have
seen it) the Convenience-module is not powerful enough for
special things.

There are a lot of other modules that can do what you want.
(No example here, because for my simple needs when I have
looked at it, I was happy enough with the Convenience module).

Ciao,
