You seem to be asking for trouble here. From what I read in your code
this *should* work. It is however highly dependent on the garbage
collector implementation: the first bit contains tells it whether this
is a block or not.

I would recommend using options instead (and again you might just use
my library but that shameless self promotion). Using options will have
a performance impact. You can can see your solution as a clever (yet
brittle) optimization hack.
However if you are hellbent on performances you might also consider
having direct access to your keys (fore quality) and collisions stored
in another table.
