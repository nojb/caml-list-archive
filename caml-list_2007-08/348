I'd like to announce the formation of the Bay Area Functional 
Programmers group.  This group is for anyone using or interested in 
functional programming and functional programming languages, 
particularly strongly typed languages such as OCaml, Haskell, SML, etc.

The first meeting will be Thursday, September 13th at 7:30pm somewhere 
in San Francisco.  Please join the mailing list at 
http://groups.google.com/group/bayfp 
<http://groups.google.com/group/bayfp> and suggest a location. The 
initial meeting will be a casual pizza and beer get together, although 
going forward we'd like to also include speakers, reading and discussion 
of technical papers, and some hands on coding.  Future announcements and 
the location of the first meeting will be posted to the mailing list.

More information will be available on the website: http://bayfp.org/.

Many thanks to the NYFP meetup for the inspiration:

Mike (+ Keith Fahlgren)
