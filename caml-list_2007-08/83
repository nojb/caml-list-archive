That doesn't make the idea wrong. As I said in another post, I have
major philosophical differences with some of the Ocaml standard libs--
Str being mentioned with considerable distaste. I add the lexing
system to that too, and probably more.

My point being: it isn't just 3PLs, but also the Ocaml standard
libs, that can have problems: this shouldn't stand in the way
of improving and augmenting the library.
