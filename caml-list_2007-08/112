It depends what would be considered as distribution, but revision
control systems like git essentially operate on pristine sources +
patches, and you could easily set it up so that one branch was the
pristine source and another branch contained your changesets (branches
are virtually free in git).

Again, I'm not suggesting that we fork OCaml.
