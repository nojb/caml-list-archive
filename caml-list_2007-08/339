Since we're dealing with analogies, you could say Perl is like some
hideous disfigured mutant leper. Really, who is going to notice a
few warts on that? OCaml is a puclchritudinous visage pocked with
some blemishes.

Minor for you, but for less expert programmers, or those new to or
infrequent OCaml users, they weight the decision "OCaml or Other"
in the wrong direction.

Note that none of your issues are about the language itself, except
(1.b).

Different industries have different priorities, and a few of your
annoyances are  of no concern to me, as I imagine some of mine don't
bother you.
