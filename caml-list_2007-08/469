As a side note, this is why I think the x86 should have gone 64-bit a 
decade ago now (and was saying that then).

Apparently, 2G should be enought for anyone.

I had the same sort of problem with the Unix.stat function and the
st_size member being an int while it is a 64 bits int on recent systems
(including some 32 bits one). The maximum size that can be stored on 32
bits system, 1Go, is much too small for this function.
