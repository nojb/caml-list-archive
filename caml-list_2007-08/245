As others have said, Joel wants to write a JIT in OCaml rather than for OCaml. 
Although the OCamlJIT project was a nice idea, it is based upon the now-dead 
GNU Lightning library and its functionality was more recently displaced by 
the much more performant ocamlnat.

However, I think tools to enable JIT writing using OCaml would be most 
welcome. Not only the safe staged metaprogramming approach of MetaOCaml but 
also direct code generators.
