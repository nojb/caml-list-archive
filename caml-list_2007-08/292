OCaml has a badly designed syntax processed by a badly implemented
parser feeding into a backend that generates poor error messages.
All this makes the language hard to use.  Anybody else learn C
using pcc on Unix?

Unfortunately, I didn't think to start cataloging compiler error
messages and their causes when I started learning the language.
I did send one anomaly to the list about parsing of semicolons.
