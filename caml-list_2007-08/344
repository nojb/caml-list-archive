I am trying to use ocamlp3l to parallelize some code.  Using the skeleton
paradigm was a lot of fun and quite easy, but I am stumbling on the easiest
of issues...

My code needs some command-line options, and I am processing them with the
Arg package.  The ocamlp3l manual does not anything about what to do for
command-line options.

I cannot simly run:

./foo -p3lroot -i blah -o boink

because Arg tells me that it doesn't know what to do with -p3lroot.
Fine, but, then how do I do?  It's not really feasible for me to do without
command-line options...

Many thanks in advance,

Luca
