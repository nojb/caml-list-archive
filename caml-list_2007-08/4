Do the examples included in rocaml work for you? In particular "oo", where an
abstract type is used from Ruby, and "simple", which passes tuples to a
function returning a tuple.  If you could pinpoint the conversion that's
triggering the problem (and it's indeed a problem caused by a Ruby <-> OCaml
conversion) we'd be one step away from fixing it.  Have you tried to
disassemble the extension and see where caml_tuplify2 is being called?
