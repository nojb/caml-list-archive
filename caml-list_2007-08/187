It is definitely the connect(). I've put calls to
prerr_endline() calls in each with case.

38 is EINPROGRESS. I've verified this in a couple
of ways. First, the simple client (that works)
causes the first with case to be entered (because
the socket is set to non-blocking, this is the
usual case). The print there outputs 38. Second,
I put a try-with block in xmlRPCClient.ml, around
the call which causes connect_server() to be
invoked. The with case there is written EINPROGRESS
and it catches this exception.

I'm at a loss. I would suspect the code generated
to match the with patterns but this is in a library
and it works with one client and not another.

Any chance this is because of namespace conflict?
What else could cause this behavior?
