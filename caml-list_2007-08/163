http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/expr.html - although the Record
section doesn't state that the order of evaluation is unspecified, the
section on Function application does: I think it's safe to assume that the
order of evaluation for record construction is similarly unspecified and so
could, in theory, change.

Although it looks neat in this instance, in general relying on evaluation
order is risky and potentially unclear (which is one of the reasons that the
order of evaluation is left unspecified in the language specification).

Exactly - so here, even a change in the type declaration could have broken
your code (even without a compiler change!).
