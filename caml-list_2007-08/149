Excerpts from skaller's message of Mon Aug 06 01:19:37 +0200 2007:
> Does Ocamlbuild work on Windows *transparently*?

We  tried  to  do our best at the design step of ocamlbuild to avoid as much as
possible problems with windows and especially with pathname quoting.

Ocamlbuild  helps  you  to  keep  your  command structured to enforce a correct
escaping.  But  it's still up to the user that customize ocamlbuild (by writing
a  plugin;  this  is  needed  for  adding  new rules, flags...). There is still
problems with some standard rules that use some unix commands.

So,  ocamlbuild  is  still  partially supported on windows and therefore is not
ideal  solution  for  building  ocaml  code under windows. However we hope that
this kind of problems will be solved in a future version.

We're  aware  of  that.  However  if  someone have a clear specification of the
quoting  system  on  windows  (the recomended one at least) and the one used by
Cygwin I'm interested.
