Is this machine really x86-based?  32-bit x86 machines have at most
36-bit addresses (through PAE), although that is only usable through
page tables, not to ordinary user processes.  64-bit x86-64 machines
have 48-bit addressing in current incarnations so if they are running
a 32-bit kernel or a 32-bit Xen domain they may fit the description,
but the original poster is still s.o.l.  My bet though is it's not x86
at all.
