Yes, but ignore ignores the value,
and my question was regarded to THIS CERTAIn aspect:
if it INTERNALLY would mean that the arguments will not be created,
then nothing must be given back and if no further commands are
following (read the "..." under the ignore-call as the next
pattern of a pattern match, not as a command that follows the ignore(..)).

Ignoring a result in a way that it will never be created, would mean
to have no result => this would be tailcall-equivalent.

And that was my question! Would ignore throw away the
created results, or would it suppress creating results?!

Now some answers wer: results will be treated and thrown away afterwards.

Then a next question could arise: could it be implemented in a way, that
creating the results would be blocked from the beginning on (so that nothing
must be thrown away, because nothing would be created)?

This is not really an urgent question, only something,
that during the last two days sometimes came to my mind.
