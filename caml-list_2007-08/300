I would just like to know, what exactly do you think is badly designed, and
what would be a better alternative? Mind that I am not defending OCaml's
syntax here (I have grown accustumed to it, but I do not find it superb...
probably...), I just think that all criticism should be constructive (that
is, shut up unless you've got a better idea). I would also like to hear some
improvements that could be made to the syntax (of OCaml or possibly some
future functional language), as I think that currently, OCaml syntax is
better than both SML and Haskell.

One possible complaint I see here is too many parenthenses and therefore
confusing eror messages, however I prefer denser code to the way it was
"fixed" in the revised syntax by adding more closing terminals...
