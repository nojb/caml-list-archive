I would think this is only a joke from an american person about
french cars?
On which side do they drive in USA, and on which in french?
So the controls are on the other side.

But possibly this also was meant on the Stdlib's
order of arguments in functions like List.map, List.iter and so on.
Some people meant that the order of the args were wrong,
making complex code some more complicated (for partial application
orsimilar techniques).

But I really enjoy OCaml all the days again.
It seems to me, that the people here on the list
have a funny live to choose the langauge they want,
and because of that they have forgotten, how cool OCaml is,
compared to so mancy other languages.

When I remember Perl, which I often have to work with,
because there are a lot of Perl projects but no Ocaml projects
outside on the amrket, I always know, how ugly langauges
can be.

So, the problems with which OCaml comes along are really minor
to what languages in IT-business offer....

Maybe in universities or at home you can choose
any language you want, but a lot of money-projects
need to be done in ugly langauges.

So, that's the reason why I don't forget, which advantages
OCaml offers.

So, if you see only the holes inside the cheese,
can you enjoy eating the cheese?

I enjoy it. And: OCaml-cheese IMHO tastes good and does NOT stink,
even if the people on the list here talking about it as if it would
stink.

If you want to have a strange smell, look for what languages
have to be used in so lot IT-projects. The peoples even don't know what OCaml
is!

When I mention it, I got strange look from people,
they maybe think I'm like a script kiddie with a new toy.
But they want that one uses ugly languages.

Compared to that the discussions on OCaml's defficiencies are
incomprehensible to me.

Ciao,
   Oliver
