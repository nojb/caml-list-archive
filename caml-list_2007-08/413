Hi Caml riders,

I'd like to ask wether anybody knows about the status of using the
native Win32 port built with Mingw with the standalone MingW compilers
instead of the Cygwin/MingW compilers.

Until recently my state of awareness was what's been written in
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.10/notes/README.win32:

   "Do *not* install the Mingw/MSYS development tools from www.mingw.org:
   these are not compatible with this Caml port (@responsefile not
   recognized on the command line)."

Rather accidentally (sourced wrong paths :-) I recently used MinGW
compilers with ocamlopt -- and it worked! I was only partially
suprised, since I've seen patches to MingW gcc floating around
(something like one and a half year ago) that added the
"@responsefile" feature.

Since then I tested a bit more (only with relatively small programs
but also with lablgtk) and it worked for me every time.

Now the question: Would I see the "@responsefile" problem on the first
attempt or are response files only used in certain situations I
perhaps haven't met yet? Can anybody say anything on wether ocamlopt
now works with the MingW compilers (or better wether the MingW
compilers now work with ocamlopt)?

If on the other side problems with "@responsefile" are only occuring
in more rare situation -- can anybody tell me how to provoke the
problem? (Then I'd perhaps be suffieciently interested to try in the
long run to port the missing features from CygWin/MingW to standalone
MingW).

Regards - Markus

PS: I'm using a recent "stable" MingW and the MingW build of ocaml
    3.09.
