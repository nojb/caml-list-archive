The only thing about Ocaml I mind, is that it a bit like German is, in that
all the verbs at the end come.  And there nothing wrong is, but it for some
strange reading makes, and it strange is that this from France comes.

I still somewhat puzzled am, at reading:

let f x =3D
  [humonguous definition 50 lines spanning]
in List.iter f l

because the only way I make sense of this can, is by first looking at where
f used is, and only then reading its definition.
I much rather write would:

do List.iter f l
where f x =3D [humonguous definition]

Maybe this problem with Ocamlp4 solvable is?

PS: Yes, yes, I know why the let comes before the use, but it would still b=

handy to have a pre-processor implement this do...where... construct.  Has
anyone done it already?
Yes, I also know that in German, unlike in Ocaml, the verbs do not always
come at the end... :-)
