Yes, I wrote a very long message telling you exactly this (that you needed to
use CAML_LIBS so that -output-obj could work correctly) late at night but
forgot to send it :)

I think you have to wrap the LIST(t) in a TUPLE():

  value = sym_variant("value") do |t|
   non_constant :Vstr, STRING
   non_constant :Vtup, TUPLE(LIST(t))
  end

I'll try to either auto-detect this or perform a compile-time check.

Chris Waterson has kindly sent me a patch fixing the problems you saw; I've
just pushed it to the online repository, along with an example of the above
TUPLE(LIST(t)) in examples/variants.

I'll work on the INCFLAGS issue so there's no need to hand-edit the generated
Makefile/wrappers.
