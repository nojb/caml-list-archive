Hi,

I've been using ocaml under mingw for some time now and haven't
encountered problems with the compilation and installation of ocaml
(3.09). The vast majority of modules and programs can be compiled and
used directly but of course, some needs modifications which are
usually trivials.
I've had problems with findlib installation which is used for many
modules though. In fact, they're not big deals, just a sum of small
problems : quoting a filename and having proper environment variables
among and a third one I can't remember.

I really want ocaml to run at 100% under mingw (I've had traumatizing
experiences with cygwin ;p ) but I don't have time right now and I
first need to format my computer in order to reorganize the partitions
(moreover I just killed my mingw...).

If there's anything I can check, tell me too. =)
