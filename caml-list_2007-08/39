Well, I thought the problem was with the buffering, but as Alain made me 
realise, the standard input channels are buffered (of size 4096 if I 
understand well what I read). The documentation wasn't really clear at this 
subject (at least not the description of the Pervasives module), and I had 
not enough courage to read the C code of the implementation. I should. So my 
very bad performances don't come from there !

Thanks for the very quick answers

Alexandre
