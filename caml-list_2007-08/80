I am quite half-hearted about the idea of an Inrians' veto,
despite the fact that, they sure know how to select.
However if this could allow extra-Inrians to actually contribute to
(and learn) the jewelery, in a more _visible_ and _fast_ way,
which is _hardly_ the case currently, why not!  Let us be pragmatic.
That said... do they have enough manpower for such a peer-review task?

Amen.
