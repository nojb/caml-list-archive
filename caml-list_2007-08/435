I have to say that French student in Mathematics are learning OCaml
(in fact caml light but it is somehow ... the same). Of course there
is the mathematical aspect but also that its syntax is simple and the
rules are precise. That makes it easier to learn but as you
mentionned, "At least for non-FP-programmers", though in fact I
personnaly started with C but I'm not the only person out there.

OCaml and FP in general is probably easy only for people with a
mathematical background even if pointers and not being able to pass a
function as a parameter just like one passes a value can actually slow
courses as it needs more explanations.
In fact I think I'll force some friends to follow an ocaml course by
me to check that. =P

And for the rest, I'd say I'm not qualified. =P
