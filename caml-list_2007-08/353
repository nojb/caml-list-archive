Backward compatibility is of the UTMOST importance.
Developers tend to assume that people who wrote package X can always adapt
it to new conventions, but often this is just not true: the developers may
be working on other things now, their interests may have shifted, and great
packages get left behind and are eventually lost.

Let's make an example: George Necula in Berkeley wrote (with his students)
CIL, a superb front-end to C code analysis.  Suppose the Ocaml syntax
changes in a non-trivial way.  Would he be willing, and have time, to fix
CIL?  To spend his time in a job with zero innovation content, and lots of
frustration?  It is anyone's bet.  And what about in five years from now?
Who knows?

There is a point in which people move on, and it is very important that
software continues to work in a stable way, or we are losing great work all
the time -- and there is some great work that is not easy at all to redo.
Yes, the language survives, but the software not always.
