In a program compiled to bytecode that requires complex setup and gobs of
input data, I get a segfault in

String.create n

where n is 1024.
This both in Ocaml 3.09.2 and 3.10.

I then tried to run the same code compiled to native code, and it seems to
work.
I guess I am exceeding some limit somewhere for bytecode code; can anyone
tell me how to run the code under bytecode?  (I guess there may be some
options to tweak...) it is slower but useful to use the debugger.
Also, it would be great if Ocaml gave some kind of understandable message,
rather than segmentation_fault...
