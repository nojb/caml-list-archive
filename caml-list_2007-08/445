Again I'm not interested in stopping IO but I just note that if the =20
user gets bored because its app hangs on IO, he will kill the process =20=

and the effect on files will be the same.

I still think -- despite the caveats one needs to be aware of, e.g. =20
about IO -- the feature is worthwhile and essential for ui programs =20
that can trigger expensive computations. But since it seems to be =20
seen more as a curse than a blessing I think I'll forget about the =20
wish and try to get around with Gerd's hack.

Thanks for the discussion,
