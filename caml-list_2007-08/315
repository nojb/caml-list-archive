For Camlp5, and Camlp4 (before it was integrated into OCaml), I had to
"hard copy" this code, like you say, since it is not exported indeed.

Notice that you have the same problem with the definition of the
abstract syntax tree, since is not exported either.

Perhaps convice the ocaml team to do it, in a specific sub-directory,
since I see that there are already: "ocamldoc", "camlp4", "labltk",
"threads", "vmthreads", "stublibs".

A new installed directory, named, e.g. "syntaxtree" would be great,
containing "parseetree.mli", "parsetree.cmi" and all its dependencies,
as well as this "pconfig.ml" and its object file or a subpart of it,
containing at least these "ast_impl_magic_number" and
"ast_intf_magic_number".

I can do it in the ocaml compiler if I have the permission.

Xavier ?
