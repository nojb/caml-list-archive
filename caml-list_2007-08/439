Hi Caml riders,

Since my last request didn't get any answers or pointers to other
information so far, I'm taking the liberty to repost the central
question with a subject more to the point.

As I already wrote:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.10/notes/README.win32 says:

   "Do *not* install the Mingw/MSYS development tools from www.mingw.org:
   these are not compatible with this Caml port (@responsefile not
   recognized on the command line)."


So there is purportedly a problem using ocamlopt with MingW/MSYS. It
might be that the problem already "went away" in the due progress of
MingW development, or maybe id didn't.

How can I reproduce the problem if it still exists with current
MingW/MSYS? Is trying to ocamlopt-compile a hello_world.ml enough?

Regards -- Markus

PS: Sorry for my impatience. It occured to me that the subject might
    have been misleading since it doesn't show that I really have a
    question to ask.
