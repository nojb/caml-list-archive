Friends,

The program for the 2007 Commercial Users of Functional Programming worksho=
p is now published.

        http://cufp.galois.com/

The workshop is co-located with ICFP, and will be held in Freiburg, Germany=
, on 4 October 2007.  We had a terrific response to our call for talks, and=
 there are twelve (!) speakers describing commercial applications,  various=
ly written in
        Caml
        Erlang
        F#
        Haskell
        ML
        Scheme

The talks are informal, and there are no proceedings.  We'll just have fun =
learning about functional programming used to solve real problems.  Do come=
!
