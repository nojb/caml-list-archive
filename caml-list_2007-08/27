Hello Everyone,

This is what I have found:

1. The segfault is eliminated if I use position-dependent machine code
(-fno-PIC), which is the main difference that I can see in the
generated code for amd-64 between 3.09.3 and 3.10.0 (-fPIC is the
default now). When using -fno-PIC there was little difference between
the code spilled using -dlinear between the two versions. (I could not
get my program to compile with the branch release310 (3.10.1+dev0
(2007-05-21)) due to a type error that ... ehm ... isn't really a type
error ;-) ).

2. The bug occurs even when I have removed all calls to my C wrappers.
Therefore, I believe this an OCaml issue.

3. The segfault always happens when switching between a pair of
modules that come from the same functor with slightly different
paramenters.

I will continue trying to produce a small example to report to INRIA.

Finally, I have received some very nice suggestions in private and I
would like to thank those who have kindly sent them.

best,

Andres

I was hopping it would be the case ,but no, I don't have
