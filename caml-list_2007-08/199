  Dear Lionel,
 Thank you so much for your detailed instructions and help! And indeed =
you are completely right, it's not a x86, I don't know what led me to =
believe it was. And yes, we are talking about elephant here :-). All in =
all, thank you so much for your time and help. I'll try to apply your =
hints tomorrow and see whether I can get a 64-bit ocaml application up =
and running.

  Best wishes,
   Adam

Is this machine really x86-based?  32-bit x86 machines have at most
36-bit addresses (through PAE), although that is only usable through
page tables, not to ordinary user processes.  64-bit x86-64 machines
have 48-bit addressing in current incarnations so if they are running
a 32-bit kernel or a 32-bit Xen domain they may fit the description,
but the original poster is still s.o.l.  My bet though is it's not x86
at all.

Rich.
