Now that I think about it in more detail, this would probably require deeper 
compiler changes than I had thought. You wouldn't need to alter the run-time 
but you'd need to emit different load and store code for unboxed float32s, 
tagging and untagging them, and do arithmetic in 32-bit registers.

I'm not sure Marshal would need changing though. The representation would be 
embedded in nativeint so it would just be a type difference.
