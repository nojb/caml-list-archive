Just been having a rummage around on the Hump and came across OCaml'OLE - a
glance at the sample code suggests that it wraps COM interfaces quite
elegantly (not as transparently as VB6 did, but somewhere close). The snag
that I've hit is that I use the MinGW version of O'Caml built from source
and don't really want to install the MSVC port alongside... has anyone
managed to build OCaml'OLE using gcc+MinGW and if so do they have a
Makefile? :o)

The prospect of liberating a large application from VB.NET to O'Caml is very
tempting - but I've got to be able to manipulate Word and Excel via their
COM interfaces in order to have any hope!

TIA,


David

PS. I'm aware that F# would be a sensible alternative... but I'm interested
to see if O'Caml could do it too!
