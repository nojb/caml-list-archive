I'm afraid not, but I have done OCaml'OLE with MSVC and that was
pretty easy.

Well, except for a number of bugs in the M$ toolchain, like one where
the linker just didn't bother to link parts of the generated code (I
had to edit down the OLE-generated code by hand to get around that
one...).  So you'll be better off with the MinGW chain probably :-)
