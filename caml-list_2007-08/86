Well you don't need to use those bits.  I use ExtList and ExtString
mainly.

Well, Windows is a world apart.  It has no packaging system to speak
of, no versioning, no centralised repository, no installation policies
of note.  In other words, it's where Linux was circa 1993.

Linux distros on the other hand have all of the above, so it's just a
matter of doing 'apt-get install felix' and in a few months, 'yum
install felix'.  All dependencies on whatever esoteric libraries
required are resolved automatically with no user intervention.  If
that's too hard for users, they can click Applications -> Add/Remove
Software and pick and hunt for the package they require, and the
package + dependencies get installed.
