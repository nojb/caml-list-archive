Oh, now you got me all curious. What architecture is it then? Sparc,
maybe? I had assumed it was an amd64/x86-64 and that the GNU/Linux
installed on it was a 32 bit one. Make me drool a bit, show me
/proc/cpuinfo .

Ah yes, it makes sense now. Contrary to amd64, as far as I know most
GNU/Linux sparc64 installations have a 32 bit userland, but 64 bit
kernel, libraries and compilers ready for programs that benefit from
it.
