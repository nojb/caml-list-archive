I am actually an extlib developer :)

The community can self-organise, but that won't get extra
components in the standard distro.

In the case of adding functions to existing modules,
a separate distribution isn't even possible.

Extlib tried both these things already. It may be a good
or bad library, but it failed in its goals; none of it
has got into the standard distro, not even the ideas.

No, but the priests let the people use their courtyard
to run them, happily accept contributions, and provide
blessings occasionally :)
