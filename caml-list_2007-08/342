This might come back and bite you in a couple of years you've got 16-
and 32-core processors and you find your parallel GC / operating
system really don't scale.

I certainly won't argue on this count.  I've been chasing the libvirt
API for a few months and even though it only has 50 or so functions,
it's more painful than it should be.

Of course GTK _has_ been wrapped, thanks to the tireless efforts of
the lablgtk team.  And the binding is a good one too.

One interesting thing I've learned from working with people on the
GNOME team is that in fact there is no shortage of manpower in the
free software world (people prepared to do repetitive grunt work,
reimplement stuff endlessly and so on), but there is a big shortage of
people who understand anything beyond C and maybe Python.  Python is
the Visual Basic of the free software world, believe me.

As I've said before, this is a packaging problem.  Can you not bundle
private copies of the libraries you need in with felix?

Hum, well.  Perl is far more widely used than OCaml.
