Indeed. I didn't work with camlp* before, so the learning curve may be
a problem, I don't know.

I have already read "parsing/parstree.mli", so I assume half the work
is done! (well, I hope so, for I don't know .mly files...)

That, is what I need. Thank you. I'll notify the list once I managed
to produce some output.

I have still one problem, though : how should I access this code? It
is not part of the standard library, so I can't just "open Config;;".
I can't hard-copy this code, either, that is too ugly. Maybe there is
a way to install a "development package" of Ocaml so I can link it?

Thanks,
Loup
