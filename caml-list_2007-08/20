A solution could be to create an lexbuf from a function with
Lexing.from_function.
This function has to manage a stack of open channels and positions. It
has to=20
scan for "#include"-statements and copies instead of these statements
the contents
of the corresponding files into the buffer.

Just an idea, I haven't done it yet.
