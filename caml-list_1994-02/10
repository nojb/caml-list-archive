                   Last CALL FOR PAPERS --- ML'94

          ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML and its Applications

                      June 25-26, 1994
                      Orlando, Florida
	      (Held in conjunction with PLDI and LFP)

Short abstracts of no  more  than four  pages in length are sought on
topics relating to the ML language.  Contributions on applications,
programming methodology, and system-building experience are particularly
welcome, but the workshop will also cover issues of language design,
semantics, implementation, programming tools and environments for ML.

Authors are encouraged to submit their abstracts to the Program Chair
via electronic mail; either Postscript or a self-contained TeX or LaTeX
file is acceptable. If electronic submission is not possible, then
please submit 6 printed copies of the abstract to the Program Chair
at the address below.  The deadline for abstracts is February 25, 1994.
Authors will be notified  of acceptance or rejection by April 8, 1994.
Final version  of accepted papers must be received in camera-ready form
by May 6, 1994.

This is the fifth in a series of workshops on ML, and the second sponsored
by SIGPLAN.  The workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN '94
Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI'94) and
the 1994 ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming (LFP'94).
