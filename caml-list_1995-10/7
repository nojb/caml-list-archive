Subject: Version 1.1 of the bindlib package: a library for abstract syntax
Sender: weis
Status: O

with binder.


I am please to announce the release 1.1 of the bindlib library for
Caml-Light:

THE BINLIB PACKAGE
------------------

  This is a library for the Caml-Light (and Caml-Special-Light) languages (and
  Sml-nj soon ... may be) providing reasonable tools to write programs
  manipulating data structures with binders (like lambda-terms or quantified
  formulae). It is quite efficient and not too difficult to use (at least for
  me).

  I do not know of any available alternative to this package resulting
  in a code as small, and as efficient (both in memory and speed) ! 
  So give it a try !

The change from the version 1.0 are:
------------------------------------

  - Correct a MAJOR BUG: when more than one variable is bound outside
    of the current sequence of binding, then the version 1.0 does not
    work at all. This bug has now been corrected.

  - The library now raises the exception "Binlib_error" instead of
    "Invalid_argument".

  - The memory usage has been optimised to take in account binder
    which binds a variable with no occurrence. In the benchmark this
    is not visible, but other examples shows an improvement of a factor
    greater than 2 !

  - The library only works for terms with less than 32768 free
    variables in each sub-term. An exception is raised if you
    use too many variables.

  - The library has now been tested on a bigger scale and should be
    more reliable (I hope).
