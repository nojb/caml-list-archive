An alpha release of Caml Light for MS Windows is now available.

It provides a graphical user interface for the Caml Light toplevel,
similar to that for the Macintosh, with editor windows and a command
history, but no graphics primitives yet. The system runs in 32-bit
mode under MS Windows 3.x (with Win32s), Windows 95, and probably NT
as well (untested).

The release is available by anonymous FTP from ftp.inria.fr, directory
/lang/caml-light, files:

    cl7windows-a1.zip	the Caml Light application
    win32s.zip		the Win32s installation kit
			(needed only for Windows 3.x)

Please report any problems and suggestions to caml-light@pauillac.inria.fr.
