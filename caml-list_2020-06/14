Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] First release of Monolith


Dear OCaml users,

It is my pleasure to announce the first release of Monolith.

Monolith offers facilities for testing an OCaml library (for instance, a 
data
structure implementation) by comparing it against a reference 
implementation.
It uses a form of black-box testing, and relies on afl-fuzz for efficiency.

The user must describe what types and operations the library provides. Under
the best circumstances, this requires 2-3 lines of code per type or 
operation.
The user must also provide a reference implementation of the library.

Then, like a monkey typing on a keyboard, Monolith attempts to exercise the
library in every possible way, in the hope of discovering a scenario 
where the
library behaves incorrectly. If such a scenario is discovered, it is printed
in the form of an OCaml program, so as to help the user reproduce the 
problem.

At this time, a tutorial is not yet available. There is however an API
documentation and a number of demos.

Repository:
   https://gitlab.inria.fr/fpottier/monolith

API Documentation:
 
http://cambium.inria.fr/~fpottier/monolith/doc/monolith/Monolith/index.html

Installation:
   opam update
   opam install monolith

Happy testing,
