Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 4.11.0, second alpha release

Dear OCaml users,

A new alpha version of OCaml 4.11.0 has been published.
Compared to the first alpha version, this version contains the following 
new bug
fixes:

+ #6673, #1132, +#9617: Relax the handling of explicit polymorphic types
    Fix an issue with recursive polymorphic function and constrained types.
    (Leo White, review by Jacques Garrigue and Gabriel Scherer)

+ #7364, #2188, +#9592, +#9609: improvement of the unboxability check 
for types
    with a single constructor. Mutually-recursive type declarations can
    now contain unboxed types. This is based on the paper
      https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02300

- #7817, #9546: Unsound inclusion check for polymorphic variant
   (Jacques Garrigue, report by Mikhail Mandrykin, review by Gabriel 
Scherer)

- #9549, #9557: Make -flarge-toc the default for PowerPC and introduce
   -fsmall-toc to enable the previous behaviour.
   (David Allsopp, report by Nathaniel Wesley Filardo, review by Xavier 
Leroy)

- #9320, #9550: under Windows, make sure that the Unix.exec* functions
   properly quote their argument lists.
   (Xavier Leroy, report by André Maroneze, review by Nicolás Ojeda Bär
    and David Allsopp)

- #9490, #9505: ensure proper rounding of file times returned by
   Unix.stat, Unix.lstat, Unix.fstat.
   (Xavier Leroy and Guillaume Melquiond, report by David Brown,
    review by Gabriel Scherer and David Allsopp)

- #8676, #9594: turn debugger off in programs launched by the program
   being debugged
   (Xavier Leroy, report by Michael Soegtrop, review by Gabriel Scherer)

- #9552: restore ocamloptp build and installation
   (Florian Angeletti, review by David Allsopp and Xavier Leroy)

Entries marked with "+" were already present in previous alphas, but
they have been complemented by new bug fixes.


The compiler can be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the 
following commands

opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+alpha2 
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

or

opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.11.0+alpha2+<VARIANT> 
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

where <VARIANT> is replaced with one of these: afl, flambda, fp, fp+flambda

The source code for the alpha is also available at these addresses:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.11.0+alpha2.tar.gz
  https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.11/ocaml-4.11.0+alpha2.tar.gz
