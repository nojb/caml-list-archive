Sounds like your advisor never had a real job :-)

Debuggers are very useful indeed for tracking down logic bugs in real
world (ie. large, convoluted, badly written) programs.

I've found ocamldebug to be very painful to use, compared to, say,
gdb.  That's when it works at all.  For reasons I don't really
understand I've found that ocamldebug doesn't work very reliably,
often showing the wrong line numbers or losing the connection to the
debugged process.

One of the features I'd really like to see for ocaml would be proper
support for stabs / gdb.  At the moment I'm mainly relying on
inserting eprintf / prerr_endline into the code.

Rich.
