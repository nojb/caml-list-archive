You can use XmlLight if you need something... light. If performances and
memory are not critical (only DOM), it should be enough for most of your
usages, and is a good way of starting with XML since it's very easy to use
and manipulate, and support DTD (but not schema). If you need more features
then PXP is your friend, but is a lot more difficult to handle.
My advice : first experiment XmlLight and then switch to PXP if you lack
features.
