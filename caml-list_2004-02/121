This is from the man page for GNU ld:

    The  linker will search an archive only once, at the location where
    it is specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a sym-
    bol  which  was  undefined in some object which appeared before the
    archive on the command line, the linker will include the  appropri-
    ate  file(s)  from the archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an
    object appearing later on the  command  line  will  not  cause  the
    linker to search the archive again.

    See  the -( option for a way to force the linker to search archives
    multiple times.

    You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.

I didn't know about the "-(" and "-)" options.  Perhaps the ld
commands generated by the ocaml tools should use this to make library
order less error-prone?
