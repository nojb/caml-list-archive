Thanks

Actually i checked mod_caml and used many great ideas from it. I have my 
module
working fine and actually i do not use separate executable as mod_caml 
does. i was able to put Caml bytecode
runtime into shared library and give that shared library to caml_main on 
startup, so Dynalink is happy as well.
I have douts about multithreading, source code does not have anything, 
so mutex around callbacks the only solution,
which means it cannot be used in very busy web servers because 
concurrency will be an issue.
