Judging from answers I've received, I've probably been not clear
enough. I know that the security topic is large but I've explicitely not
mentionned cryptographic issues (authentication, information hiding,
etc.). I just want to secure my server enough so that a bad guy can't
crash it or launch a shell with it. I've left other security topics to
the near future.

I'm not the first one to write a server in OCaml, so I wanted to use
experience of previous work. If nobody has written such a document, I'll
might give it a try.

Any useful comments still appreciated,
Yours,
d.
