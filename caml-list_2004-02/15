i have a lot of "R" and C/C++ code, where (especially at 
math prototyping phase) i used text ascii files to I/O 
with matrices/arrays.

Now I try to use ocaml a bit. I don't want change old code.
I'd like to use the same format. For example for matrices
I use format like here:

2 3
a b c
d e f

you are right, and I have posted this code in previous mail.
but i am not happy:

 1. with error-proness of my code and
 2. that these simple things kill that much time :)

no-no. I am already stuck to my old format.

?

any link?

I was thinking about perl/python scripts.

conversion with spreadsheets is not reproducible and doubles 
the number of files. not good.

thanks.
