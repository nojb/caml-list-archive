If you need (or anyone else does) a more complete and correct Scheme 
interpreter in OCaml that implements almost all of R5RS (basically 
everything except transcripts), I've written one some time ago.

It has been stable and untouched for quite a while, it's under a 
two-clause BSD-style license, but I currently don't have time to find a 
location or maintain a network presence for the package.

I can send it to anyone interested privately, or if there is interest 
in putting it up for broader distribution or further development (e.g. 
implementing SRFIs), volunteers are welcome.
