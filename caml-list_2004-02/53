My biggest ocaml program is a DSL compiler that's about 6000 lines long, 
and has been gradually written over the past 5 years or so.  I've been 
pretty good about placing assertions in the code - particularly 
"assert(false)" in branches that I don't believe should be taken.  This 
has been very helpful, because when the world proves my opinion wrong, 
which it often does, I can just run in the debugger until the assertion 
trips, and then back up until I see what happened to produce the 
situation I thought was impossible.
