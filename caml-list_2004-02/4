Markus and I discussed the issue.

I'll continue to maintain my library, but it is very stable (no bug
reported in 3 years), so in practice, it only means that the package will
remain available. However, it is considered deprecated: new users should
better use Markus' revision.  Existing users can continue with my version
if they are happy with it, or switch to the new interface (the transition
should be easy; OTOH it will mainly bring an aesthetic improvement).

For distribution package maintainers, I think the best thing is to keep my
library available and provide Markus' one under another name.
