Yes, very. Especially in OCaml for its ability to step backwards as
well as forwards in the program execution. And I use it in completely
functional code.

Personally I'd say that I use the OCaml debugger more often for OCaml
code than gdb for C code - but less often than I use the perl debugger
for perl code.

I have no idea.
