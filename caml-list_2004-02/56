Yes, definitely.  The ability to run programs in reverse is especially
useful.  Using it, I removed a bunch of bugs from my Delaunay
triangulator yesterday.  It would have been much harder to find the
problems some other way.

That said, the debugger would be even better if it had conditional
breakpoints, the ability to change variable values, and the ability to
call functions.
