Howdy,

In tracking down a little bug yesterday it would have been really nice 
if I could have printed out a value like the top level prints out the 
value returned. Basically I want the "Print" function from the classic 
read-eval-print loop.  Is such a function available and would I access 
it?  I have done a bit of searching through the ocaml documentation and 
found things related to printing and pretty printing but nothing which 
really looked like it would work for this purpose.

Thanks,
-Eric
