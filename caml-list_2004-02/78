I debugged the following when getting a version of Unison running in 
Aqua:

     /* When you click-start or use the open command, the program is 
invoked with
        a command-line arg of the form -psn_XXXXXXXXX.  The XXXXXXXX is 
a "process
        serial number" and it seems to be important for Carbon programs. 
  We need
        to get rid of it if it's there so the ocaml code won't exit.  
Note, the
        extra arg is not added if the binary is invoked directly from 
the command
        line without using the open command. */
     if (argc == 2 && strncmp(argv[1],"-psn_",5) == 0) {
         argc--;
         argv[1] = NULL;
     }

I just put that in main before calling caml.  (I am calling caml from 
ObjC.)
