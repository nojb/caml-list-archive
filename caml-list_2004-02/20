Perhaps you should switch to ocaml-3.07, which is the current release,
which have new interesting features IMHO (but won't solve this
particular problem).

The only reasonable way to run your code without changes is to change
your machine to a 64 bit architecture, like AMD64 (aka x86_64) ie
Athlon64 processors or Alpha (or Sparc64).

The maximal array length is wired in a lot of places, and changing it
is not easy, because it is related to the layout of the header word
inside the heap (see the comments inside <caml/mlvalues.h> for
details).


I tend to believe that dealing with very big arrays or strings may
indicate that some parts of your algorithms should be rethought. But I
may be really wrong....

Perhaps you should consider using caml bigarrays (with the ability to
map a file - see documentation of function Bigarray.Array1.map_file at
http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/libref/Bigarray.Array1.html
etc....), or representing your huge data otherwise, eg as lists (or
tuples or arrays) of smaller arrays.

Consider changing some of your datastructures to deal with smaller
arrays! Tell us about your experiments!

Regards.
