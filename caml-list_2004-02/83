I have a few ideas, but I'm sure you already know them. First, I
assume you have (and target only) a Unix-like system. All tricks below
are probably non portable to Windows (an OS I never coded for, which I
don't know).

The first trick would be to call the C function getpass (which,
according to its man page, is obsolete).

You could also use the [in]famous GNU readline C library.

You could also use the ncurses library.

If you have an X11 server (but you apparently want a textual only
interface), you might use (shameless plug) my GUIS gtk "server"
program from http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/guisdoc.html You'll just
have to code a few lines of Python or Ruby code creating a simple GUI
interface. The ocaml application communicates with it using textual
protocols. Of course, you could also run some tiny command which ask
for your password.

You might also issue the ioctl (that you need to code in C and call
from Ocaml) which supress the echo and make the keyboard working in
raw (non cooked) mode. I forgot the ugly details. You have to reset
your tty to its previous state before exiting (or just after having
got the password)

I belive this should work if it where boxed by appriate ioctl removing
the echo.

I believe that you cannot do anything without a little C code (because
ioctl or fcntl are not available to Ocaml, mostly because typing it is
a nightmare)
