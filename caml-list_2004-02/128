Does this indicate an error in the O'Caml manual, section 18.5.1, where

  void foo(value v1, value v2, value v3)
  {
    CAMLparam3(v1, v2, v3);

    CAMLreturn0;
  }

is used, in addition to a paragraph preceeding it in the same section saying 
"If your C function is a procedure you must insert CAMLreturn0 at the end"? 
In fact, CAMLreturn0 existing at all seems to imply the fact that 
unit-returning functions (from O'Caml's point of view) can be void in the C 
implementation.
