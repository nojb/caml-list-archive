Hi,

Does anyone know of CORBA support for OCaml?

I can find references to IDL, but they seem to be C++ and MS COM related. 
There's also mention of work in progress related to the ORB in Gnome. 
However, I can't find any working code that lets me interoperate with an
ORB and interface to remote code written in arbitrary languages.

A non-commercial licence is OK.

Alternatively, if there is some other technology that is supported, that
allows inter-language and inter-machine operation, I would be interested
in knowing about that.

Thanks,
Andrew
