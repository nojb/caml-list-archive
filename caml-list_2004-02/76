Following Trevor's suggestions (see 
http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200211/msg00163.html) I am now able to 
get *my* labltk programs to run in native Mac OS X Aqua mode (using 
TclTkAquaBI-8.4.5.0.dmg from 
http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/TclTkAqua/). Thanks, Trevor!!

What follows is what I did to get ocamlbrowser to run as a native Aqua 
app. First I followed Trevor's suggestions. That did not work if I 
double-clicked on Ocamlbroswer.app. I then tried from the command line

open -a Ocamlbrowser

That at least let ocamlbrowser display its error message that the 
options to the command line were at fault. All the Console showed in 
the log was a dreaded "RegisterProcess failed (error -50)" message.

So I edited the source file ..../otherlibs/labltk/browser/main.ml and 
essentially commented out the command line argument parsing step. I did 
"make" and moved the new binary into OCamlbrowser.app/Contents/MacOS/ 
and everything works pretty nicely now. The only problem I have noticed 
is that clicking in the scroll bar does not work. You have to catch the 
scroll-button and move it with the mouse. Everything else seems to work 
too.

If somebody needs the modified source I can email it. I hope some 
similar hack can make labltk work too.

To make this complete we must find some way of passing the command line 
options, but that is for somebody else to do.
