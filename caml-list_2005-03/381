64-bit data structures (due to bigger pointers, alignment, and in OCaml
bigger default integers) are bigger, so things that are constrained by
memory bandwidth are obviously going to be faster as 32-bit.

On other architectures where you can use 32-bit or 64-bit that are
otherwise identical, 32-bit is generally faster.
