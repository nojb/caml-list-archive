Perhaps his program is not good.
But he made a point. His experience say something
and I agree with many stuff he said.

In the ICFP 2000 contest, the mercury team advocated that
their program was very fast and so implicitly claimed
that logic programming was very fast, but if you look at
their code they mostly used a functionnal style,
not a logic style.


I think it is a bad idea to call "troll" someone who is
against ocaml, especially when he says something true.
Perhaps the webpage of ocaml should put a warning
 "ocaml can compete against C, but it is not magical,
  a beginner will certainly make very inefficient program".


PS: I am a big fan of functionnal programming, and I try as much
as possible to make functionnal code, but it is true that sometimes
I have to renounce to this and go back to imperative style because
it would be inefficient.
