Ah, obviously! But this seems to imply that a 32-bit machine/compiler 
couple would be generally faster on symbolic processing algorithms, 
which generally require a good deal of memory allocations/deallocations. 
Since this is the kind of code which seems to be most idiomatic in 
Ocaml, I wonder how well or how badly 64 bits will actually impact all 
our software.
