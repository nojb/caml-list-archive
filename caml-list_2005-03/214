In particular, the previous FAQ will not be transferred as is. Instead, only
really relevant questions will be answered, so as to trim down the length of
the pages; for the others, references to the manual/tutorials will be
supplied.

As a consequence I would be very interested in hearing about your experience
with the old documentation: 
- what did you find to be lacking? 
- would you prefer more "easy" or "difficult" questions?
- which questions did you find answered?

Please reply to me directly, so as not to clobber the list.
