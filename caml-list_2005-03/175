I don't think he says _anything_ correct except trivial facts (like
his OCaml program is very slow:-) - but this is because it is written
_extremely_ poorly).

As we can see from the careful wording at caml.inria.fr (both the new
one and the old one), OCaml is *not* defined as a functional language.
In fact, it is good even at imperative/OO programming thanks to
garbage collection, parametric polymorphism, data types, pattern
matching, etc.!
