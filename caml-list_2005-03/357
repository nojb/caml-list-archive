Thanks, Damien!  The new distribution source tree now has the same 
counts for the files and directories as 3.08.2 - but is a little 
larger, as you say...

As for why no one else commented on this, maybe it was because they 
were waiting (hint, hint) for the Windows binary distribution(s)? :)

But seriously, it has been more than a week now - the MacOS X binary 
distribution is even there already...
