ESSLLI 2005
17th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information
The annual summer school of FoLLI, 
the Association for Logic, Language and Information.
Heriot-Watt University
Edinburgh, Scotland
8-19 August, 2005 


--------------------------
|REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN|
--------------------------

Go to http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/esslli05/
and follow the registration page.

(Note, this is during the Edinburgh famous international festival,
so accommodation must be reserved promptly to guarantee accommodation).

The main focus of ESSLLI is on the interface between linguistics,
logic and computation. The school has developed into an important
meeting place and forum for discussion for students, researchers and
IT professionals interested in the interdisciplinary study of Logic,
Language and Information.

ESSLLI courses cover a wide variety of topics within six areas of
interest: Logic, Computation, Language, Logic and Computation,
Computation and Language, Language and Logic.

Foundational courses aim to provide truly introductory courses into a
field. The courses presuppose absolutely no background knowledge. In
particular, they should be accessible to people from other
disciplines.

Introductory courses are intended to equip students and young
researchers with a good understanding of a field's basic methods and
techniques, and to allow experienced researchers from other fields to
acquire the key competences of neighboring disciplines, thus
encouraging the development of a truly interdisciplinary research
community.

Advanced courses are intended to enable participants to acquire more
specialized knowledge about topics they are already familiar with.

Workshops are intended to encourage collaboration and the
cross-fertilization of ideas by stimulating in-depth discussion of
issues which are at the forefront of current research in the field. In
these workshops, students and researchers can give presentations of
their research.

In addition to courses and workshops there are evening lectures, a
student session and a number of satellite events (to be announced
later). The aim of the student session is to provide Masters and PhD
students with an opportunity to present their own work to a
professional audience, thereby getting informed feedback on their own
results. Unlike workshops, the student session is not tied to any
specific theme.


Looking forward to seeing you at ESSLLI 2005 in beautiful Edinburgh
during the impressive Edinburgh international festival (see
