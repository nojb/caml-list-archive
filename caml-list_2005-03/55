Well, there is *one* thing I have always wanted from my mail system - 
and never seen implemented: I basically like to save *all* emails from 
and to anyone I have a business relationship with... BUT, sometimes 
these mails have large (hundreds of KB -> a MB) attachments, which are 
not really important.  The mail itself, along with a small "ghost" of 
the attachment (name and size) would be enough.

I use Mozilla mail which I believe does use the mbox format, along 
with its own indices which it builds as required.  So, if using a 
utility once in a while to surgically remove some attachments means I 
would have to delete the indices and let Moz mail rebuild them, no 
problem.

So, as long as your module and its interface make it "easy" to write 
my own Higher Order Mail Functions (HOMFs) to accomplish tasks like 
the above, I will be happy to test it for you. :)

More seriously, it does seem as if something like the tasks I outline 
would exercise a goodly fraction of your proposed functionality.
