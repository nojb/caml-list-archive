I agree with that, and it's true that nobody is happy with the current
caml.inria.fr site.

A complete redesign and reimplementation of the caml.inria.fr is in
progress, and should be completed Real Soon Now.  That should provide
a Web site (for caml.inria.fr, www.caml.org and www.ocaml.org) that is
both reasonably modern looking and kept up to date.

There is room for volunteer's efforts in parallel with our efforts, so
if someone wants to resurrect the old ocaml.org, or build a Wiki-based
site for OCaml, you are most welcome and we'll link to your site.
