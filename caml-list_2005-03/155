Hello,

a small tool I wrote (mbox-cleaner) was mentioned in
the current BraveGNUWorld.
OCaml was mentioned there too and it was written,
that "for a scripting language it's fast". ;-)

So maybe OCaml will be more known in the future, if people
would do more marketing on it. ;-)

(But other things written in that article were not all correct :(
 but ... well...... )

(in german only)

(I don't know why since many months there are no english translations of the BraveGNUWorld ...)...)


Ciao,
   Oliver
