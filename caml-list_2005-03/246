Hi again,

I've written a simple OCaml script (using OCurl) that detects
seat/schedule changes of your flights on one particular airline (guess
which:-).

  http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sumii/united/

In case anybody (other than myself) uses this program, please let me
know whether it works - it is a little hard to test because it
requires real reservations and changes!  (It worked for me at least a
few times in the last several months.)

If you don't understand why such a thing is useful, either (A) you
don't fly much, (B) you are _so_ patient that you don't feel much pain
when sitting in a non-bulkhead economy-class seat for 14 hours, (C)
you are rich enough to fly in business/first class without winning the
waitlisting competitions for free upgrades, or (D) you haven't yet
discovered the crazy world of frequent flyers.;-) In the last case,
you would have some fun by taking a look at

  http://www.seatguru.com/

and

  http://www.flyertalk.com/

for example.
