                     Preliminary Call for Papers

                 The 2005 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

                http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~blume/ml05/

               To be held in conjunction with ICFP 2005
                          September 29, 2005
                           Tallinn, Estonia

The ML family of programming languages, whose dialects include
Standard ML, Objective Caml, Alice ML and nML, has inspired a
tremendous amount of language research, ranging from type inference
to module systems to operational semantics and implementation.
Languages from the ML family have alse been successfully applied in
areas ranging from compilers and theorem provers to low-level system
software, web applications and video games.

The goal of the Workshop is to provide a forum for researchers,
developers, and users to hear about and discuss the latest work on the
use, design, and implementation of ML-like languages.  Previous ML
Workshops have been held in Edinburgh, Pittsburgh, San Francisco,
Orlando and Baltimore.

The 2005 Workshop will be held in conjunction with the ACM SIGPLAN
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in Tallinn,
Estonia. We seek papers on any ML-related topic, including (but not
limited to):

* applications
* extensions: objects, classes, concurrency, distribution and mobility, 
    semi-structured data handling, etc.
* type systems: inference, modules, specification, error reporting, etc.
* implementation: compilers, interpreters, partial evaluators,
    garbage collectors, etc.
* environments: libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, 
    cross-language interoperability, etc.
* semantics

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results, or
informed positions regarding proposals for next-generation ML languages.
In order to encourage lively discussion, submitted papers may describe
work in progress.  Proceedings will be published as a volume of
Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS).
