But RFC 1123 says as below, for example...?  For more details, see
also

  http://www.exim.org/pipermail/exim-users/Week-of-Mon-20030203/049446.html

for instance.  In short, it does no "harm" in _most_ environments, but
affects many systems at least.  (I wonder what Dmitry meant by
"webmaster@caml.inria.fr is not routable"...)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2.2  Canonicalization: RFC-821 Section 3.1

         The domain names that a Sender-SMTP sends in MAIL and RCPT
         commands MUST have been  "canonicalized," i.e., they must be
         fully-qualified principal names or domain literals, not
         nicknames or domain abbreviations.  A canonicalized name either
         identifies a host directly or is an MX name; it cannot be a
         CNAME.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As explained above, they were illegal in MAIL and RCPT commands of
SMTP, at least.  Of course, you could argue that bodies (From: and
To:) may be different from envelopes (MAIL and RCPT), though.

The bottom line is that it is still a bad practice to use aliases in
mail address domains for these reasons.  Instead, we can just use A
records in most cases.

Grrr...:-)
