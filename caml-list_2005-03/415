It seems that this problem may be related with Accept-Language HTTP 
header what is set
by browser according to the user language preferences. I'm using Firefox 
1.0.2 (Windows XP),
and when I add English or French to the list of preferred languages, 
OCaml site works very
well. But if I don't specify none of these, I get 'unknown/unknown' 
content type.

It seems that caml.inria.fr web server can't handle the situation where 
none of supported
languages (English, French) is specified in Accept-Language header. 
Maybe the best solution
would be to change web server configuration and to make it behave just 
like Accept-Language="en"
when Accept-Language is not specified or does not contain 'en' nor 'fr'.

As a workaround, it is easy to us users to set up our browsers to 
request content in
English or French in addition to our favorite languages :). This 
workaround works not
only for Mozilla Firefox, but for MS IE too (at least version 6.0).

Thank you for the excellent work you do!
OCaml is a very good and useful language, and new OCaml site looks 
really nice!
