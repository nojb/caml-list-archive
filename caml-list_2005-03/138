Hello,

for records it is possible to say "mutable" to change a normally
non mutable value into a mutable one.

It would be nice to have the possibility to turn on
immutability fpr strings with a keyword like "immutable"
or so.

So it could be forbidden to modify strings in cases,
where it makes sense; otherwise it must be provided
String.copy at a lot of cases in a program, that
want's to forbid modyfiing the original data.

And disallowing a modification is much stronger/more strict
than only allowing modyfiing a copy.
So, it would be nice to have such a feature in newer versions
of OCaml.

Ciao,
   Oliver
