I completely agree.  As someone who makes extensive use of OCaml in a
business setting, the fact that the standard libraries throw
exceptions on large data structures is a real pain.  It's a violation
of the principle of least surprise, and I've run into it in practice
quite a few times.  Our solution was to just rewrite the list module
with tail-recursive versions.  We're happy to make the performance
tradeoff.  If we really want things to be fast, List.map is no good
anyway, due to the lack of inlining of the function parameter.

I do think that it would be a great thing if the tail-recursive list
functions were moved into the standard library.
