Would be nice if the old pages could be "preserved".
I do not mean archive it, but use the same layout of the page.

The www.ocaml.org was nice. Just yesterday I wanted to show that
page to other people, and it was not available.

Instead I went to the inria-pages, which are, well...
... very academic in layout.

Could it be possible to maintain the www.ocaml.org with the
pagelayout it has before it was gone?

Would be fine.

Many thanks,
        Oliver
