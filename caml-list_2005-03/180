You're right, it looked something like this to me:

Hi! I'm new to OCaml, and my first attempt and making something like I
would in C++ failed miserably. I didn't used standard library
functions, because I didn't know they existed. I also went ahead and
compiled things in a rediculously unoptimized fashion. Finally, I
didn't bother comparing how my noobie code scaled against the C++.
LIKE OMG OCAML SUX0R!

People post similar things for C#, PHP, any language really. Besides,
it is VERY VERY simple to troll slashdot.
