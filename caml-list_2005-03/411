Hmmm, it's good to know that not every version of IE
is affected. I don't know the exact version of IE on
each machine I've tried, but something like:

* IE on English Win2k pro, recently installed and
updated.
* IE on Swedish WinXP home, couple of weeks old Dell.
* IE 6.0.2900.2180 on Swedish WinXP home, recently
updated. Tried changing the web language preferences
on this machine to no avail.

On all these machines I got the "unknown file
type/save/abort" dialog. On the last machine, if I
save the file as a .html file and view it I can see
the text unformatted (I guess the CSS document isn't
loaded).
