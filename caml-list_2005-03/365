Indeed I was fooled by perl's behaviour since I made test with it and I
managed to have an effective user id of 0 on setuid perl scripts. Since
I managed to do so without passing "-U" to the interpreter I assumed
that was the "normal" behaviour. Now I've just tried with python that
works as ocaml indeed.

Yes, it would be cool.

Thanks to who replied.
Cheers.
