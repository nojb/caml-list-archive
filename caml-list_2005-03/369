The "caml_" prefix was added in 3.08.0 to avoid name conflicts when 
linking with other libraries.  I believe the relevant entries in 
compatibility.h are there so the Caml developers were not forced to 
edit all of the sources... but you should use the new "official" 
naming in code you write that needs to reference the affected C 
globals. :)
