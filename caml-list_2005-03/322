X-Spam-Level: 

I noticed that the [BZIP2] source tarball was slightly smaller than 
that for 3.08.2... how often does software get smaller? :)

So I looked over the two trees, and immediately saw that there are 
almost 400 *more* files in the newer source tree... but that almost 
all of them come from the CVS directories being present in the 3.08.3 
source.

Is this intentional?  I note that the "Root" files do not appear to 
contain the correct data for external anonymous access...
