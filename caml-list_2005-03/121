                     First Call for Participation

                          COORDINATION 2005
  7th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages 

                            Namur, Belgium, 
                           20-23 April 2005
                           
                   http://www.coordination2005.org

======================================================================


		       SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE

Modern information systems  rely increasingly on combining concurrent,
distributed, mobile,  reconfigurable and heterogenous  components. New
models,   architectures,   languages,   verification  techniques   are
necessary  to cope  with  the  complexity induced  by  the demands  of
today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a
successful approach,  in that  they provide abstractions  that cleanly
separate behavior from communication, therefore increasing modularity,
simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.

Building  on the  success of  the previous  editions,  this conference
provides  a  well-established  forum  for  the  growing  community  of
researchers  interested  in   models,  languages,  architectures,  and
implementation techniques for coordination.



			      PROGRAMME

The program of the conference can be found at

           http://www.coordination2005.org

It  includes two  invited talks  by  T. Lehman  (IBM Almaden  Research
Center, USA) and J. Misra (University of Texas at Austin, USA) as well
as  three   workshops  on  Coordination   and  Organisation,  Database
Interoperability, and  Methods and Tools  for Coordinating Concurrent,
Distributed and Mobile Systems.



			 CONFERENCE LOCATION

The  conference  will  be   held  at  the  Institute  of  Informatics,
University ot Namur, Belgium.

Capital of  the Walloon  Region, Namur is  a beautiful city  of 80.000
inhabitants.  Its position  at the  confluent  of two  rivers gave  it
military and  economic appeal,  exploited by the  Roman Empire  and by
many others since  then. Much evidence of Namur's  past can be visited
nowadays, including the citadel, one of the greatest in Europe.

Close to Brussels (60 km) and at the intersection of European railways
and highways, Namur can be easily reached by road, train, and plane.
