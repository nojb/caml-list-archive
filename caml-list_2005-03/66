I'm not sure one should think of it as a "poor man's" solution or an
"alternative to GC". An indication to that could be the inclusion of
"using" into C#. Another indication could be the inelegance of
finalizers (or as well the trouble people seem to have using them -- I
wouldn't blame a wrong (read: C++) context as a cause for that).
