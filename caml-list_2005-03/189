Lists and arrays.  Each where it's appropriate.

To which, I'd assume the majority response would be, "So?"  And to 
which I might add Benjamin Pierce's comment, "Most arguments about 
'What is the essence of...?' do more to reveal the prejudices of the 
participants than to uncover any objective truth about the topic of 
discussion.  Attempts to define the term 'object-oriented' are no 
exception."  Sure, he wrote it in regards to object oriented 
programming, but it fits functional programming very well (a 
polymorphic comment, indeed).

Well, a five minute glance at the code seems to indicate a very shallow 
understanding of OCaml.  He might be a wizard in other aspects of 
programming/CS, but dollars to donuts he's very much an OCaml newbie.

I dunno.  A couple of days ago there was a /. story about the new 
Randal Schwartz book, and at least one person was complaining about the 
perl newsgroups/mailing lists being full of unfriendly, unhelpful folk.
