Dear Caml List 

I think that AXMEDIS conference could be a good occasion to share and 
work together on a set of very hot topics. 

http://www.AXMEDIS.org/axmedis2005

The conference has the support of a very strong committee 
and of several prestigious industrial
partners and research institutions, such as: COMVERSE, CPR, CRS4, Univ. Firenze,
DSI Univ. Firenze, EPFL, EUTELSAT, FHGIGD, FUPF (Univ. Pompeo Fabra),
Giunti ILABS, HP, OD2, SEJER, TISCALI, ICSRiM Univ. Leeds, Univ. Readings, etc.
with the Support of the MUSICNETWORK and the European Commission.

Market leaders and the strongest research institutions will be present 
at the conferece. 

Current developments in the cross media domain require innovative and new
technologies to meet the challenges of the marketplace. The AXMEDIS conference
combines the activities of the WEDELMUSIC conference series (www.wedelmusic.org)
with the AXMEDIS consortium. 
The AXMEDIS consortium consists of leading European digital content producers,
integrators, aggregators, distributors, and information technology companies and
research groups involved in content production, protection and content distribution
via different channels including interactive TV (i-TV), DVBT, DVBS, personal computer,
kiosk, mobile phone, PDA and others.

I hope you may be interested in participating in the event contributing with a paper,
or proposing a workshop or symply directly attending it.

The final programme will include: tutorial on innovative technologies,
industrial presentations, scientific papers, workshops, panels, presentation of a
call for take up actions (see for details www.axmedis.org), MUSICNETWORK Open workshop,
poster sections, social activities, etc.

Please also note that we are also organising a workshop in conjuction with the MUSICNETWORK:
www.interactivemusicnetwork.org.
the workshop will be Vienna next 4-5 July 2005:

Best regards,

(General Chair)

ps: please sorry if I have contacted you with this email, i hope to have given
information on a conference on topics related to your work. You are free
to distribute this email to colleagues you retain interested.
