Thanks.

> Are you using the same monad we used in the FFT work?

Yes.  For those on caml-list, the paper Walid refers to is
@inproceedings{KiselyovSwadiTaha2004,
	author =3D {Oleg Kiselyov and Kedar N.~Swadi and Walid Taha},
	title =3D {A methodology for generating verified combinatorial
circuits},
	booktitle =3D {ACM International conference on Embedded Software
(EMSOFT)},
	year =3D {2004}
}

> Also, can you either get rid of the ";" after the "in" or the "in" =
before
the ";"?  :)

See the comments in pa_monad.ml.  Unfortunately we cannot easily do =
that; in
fact the required amount of work to achieve this might be quite large!  =
It
would be by far easier to integrate this right into the grammar rather =
than
to post-facto extend the grammar via camlp4.  At least, as far as my =
current
understanding of camlp4 goes -- maybe if a lot more of the tricks of the
camlp4 Masters were documented, it would not look so hard anymore!
