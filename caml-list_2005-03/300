                 Grant support for the participation to

                          COORDINATION 2005
  7th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

                            Namur, Belgium,
                           20-23 April 2005

                   http://www.coordination2005.org

======================================================================


                       SCOPE OF THE CONFERENCE

Modern information systems  rely increasingly on combining concurrent,
distributed, mobile,  reconfigurable and heterogenous  components. New
models,   architectures,   languages,   verification  techniques   are
necessary  to cope  with  the  complexity induced  by  the demands  of
today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a
successful approach,  in that  they provide abstractions  that cleanly
separate behavior from communication, therefore increasing modularity,
simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.

Building  on the  success of  the previous  editions,  this conference
provides  a  well-established  forum  for  the  growing  community  of
researchers  interested  in   models,  languages,  architectures,  and
implementation techniques for coordination.



				GRANTS

Thanks to the sponsoring  of MicroSoft Research Europe, several grants
are offered in order to allow promising PhD students working on topics
related to coordination models and languages to attend the conference.
The grant  will cover, on the  basis of receipts,  the registration to
the  conference,  hotel accommodation  in  Namur,  and travel  to/from
Namur.
