For an unknown reason, my answer (message-id:
<87r7ieuf54.dlv@vanicat.homelinux.org>) that have been post on the
neuf.fr news server does not appear on google, so I will suppose that
it hasn't propagate, and I will re-answer here

In ocaml, you can only call a private method on self. super#forward
is not self, so you cannot call the color_forward method on it. Then
as a private method can be made public latter, ocaml make the method
public to make the code correct, and give you this warning.
