Has anyone managed to use oprofile with ocaml effectively?  I've been
playing with it lately, and it works fine except that oprofile doesn't
seem to understand ocaml call graphs, and so can't tell you things
like, how much time was spent in a given function and its children.

Has anyone had some luck with this?  It would be nice to get oprofile
and ocaml to play nicely, since oprofile seems significantly
preferable to gprof, for a variety of reasons (lower overhead, no need
to instrument binaries, whole system analysis, etc.)

Yaron
