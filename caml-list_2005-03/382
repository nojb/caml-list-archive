I believe Jon was alluding to the issues that would be encountered on 
any structure that is pointer-heavy - every pointer is now 8 bytes 
long - you just get *killed* on the [extra] memory accessing, and your 
L1/L2 caches holding "less".  This effect will be more pronounced for 
tasks that are mostly pointer-shuffling...
