I spent a little time on it but some Anonymous Coward has already done a much 
better job and posted the resulting code on Jacques Garrigue's website. ;-)

I also posted the resulting timings on slashdot. IIRC, OCaml was less than 
half as much code and ran in 1.66 times the time (if you unroll the most time 
consuming function a little). That's pretty much what I'd expect given that 
the problem is too simple and array-based to take much advantage of OCaml and 
functional programming.
