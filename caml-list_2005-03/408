Of course the new site was tested with IE, and it works just fine on
my Windows installation.  Something is happening that 1- we don't
understand, and 2- we can't reproduce.  Another user suggested this
might have to do with language preferences in the browser, which could
expose a problem in content (language) negociation between the browser
and server.  Any constructive advice on how to attack this problem is
most welcome.

Concerning 3.08.3 binaries for Windows, please keep the following in
mind.  We have volunteers who do a great job of packaging binaries for
various flavors of Linux.  Other Unix users just compile from sources
and don't complain.  Doligez does the MacOS X binaries, but that's
because he uses MacOS X for all his computing.  It's only for Windows
that I haven't found anyone to prepare the binary packages in my
place.  So, yes, you'll have to wait till I don't have anything more
urgent to do, and that will probably take several weeks.  If you're
unhappy about that, why don't you build a binary distribution
yourself?  I'll be extremely grateful.
