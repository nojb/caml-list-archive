It just occurred to me that the ability to run an interactive top-level to 
write and test OpenGL programs would be quite alluring. In particular, this 
would be a great way to introduce students to ocaml and graphics.

However, I'd like to use lablglut, which requires execution to be handed over 
to glut via a final call to glut.mainLoop. So, what would be the best way to 
get glut and the ocaml top-level to interoperate?

I guess you could write a glut idle function which provokes the top-level into 
asking for more input, but the display wouldn't be updated in the mean time.

Any ideas?
