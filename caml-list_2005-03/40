I think it has not yet been mentioned in this thread, but as far as I
understand it, the java Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) do just that. It
acts as a thin layer above the native toolkits (in fact it seems above
the simpler widgets like buttons, labels, etc, others like menu bars are
re-implemented in java). It already supports an impressive set of
backends: gtk, windows, carbon, photon, and motif. I don't know how well
the API compares to wxWidgets', I have never used any of them, but it
seems quite popular.
