Yes indeed! :-)

Are you interested in commercialising this project? I think that many 
companies would be interested in a mini compiler which they could customise 
themselves, e.g. to create JIT compilers, or to have a decent embedded 
language.

Obviously this would require more work but I do not believe it would take 
someone (suitably talented, such as yourself) very long.

I'd prioritise data types next, and pattern matching (of course) if that is 
not implemented already.

Amazing!

Might I suggest an OCaml byte-code back end? Then you could "borrow" the OCaml 
GC.

Marvellous, thank you. :-)
