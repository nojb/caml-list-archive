Let me add my voice to this.  I have at various points been in the
position of advocating ocaml to non-technical types, and having a
credible web page to point them to is a big help.  The old ocaml.org
site looked ok, even if it's content was hopelessly out of date. I'd
personally advocate having a nice looking site hooked up with a wiki
along the lines of the cocan wiki, which looks really sharp to me, and
seems to have a lot of good content.
