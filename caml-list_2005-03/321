To all vimist-ocamlers around here,

Something I find rather useful when programming in ocaml with vim, is to add all 
the .cm* suffixes to your suffixes variable, eg:
set 
suffixes=.bak,~,.swp,.o,.info,.aux,.log,.dvi,.bbl,.blg,.brf,.cb,.ind,.idx,.ilg,.inx,.out,.toc,.cmi,.cmo,.cma,.cmx,.cmxa,.omc

(The .omc is only useful when using omake as a [great!] building tool).

This line is both useful when using vim's file explorer or the tab completion. 
It would be nice if something similar could be included by default in David's 
omlet or Markus'  ftplugin/ocaml.vim file.

Best,

	Olivier
