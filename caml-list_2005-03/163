Its not looking quite so nice for me. At http://caml.inria.fr/ I get
a file with mime type unknown/unknown which my browser (Galeon) refuses 
to display.

At http://caml.inria.fr/index.html I get:

    [an error occurred while processing this directive] The requested 
    URL was not found on this server. If you entered the URL manually 
    please check your spelling and try again. [an error occurred while 
    processing this directive] 

Small problems that I'm sure will be fixed real soon.

Erik
