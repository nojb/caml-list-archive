Yes. The linux kernel (and maybe other unices but i'm not sure) disable
the setuid bit for shell scripts since it's really unsecure. Perl
circumvents this by having a setuid binary wrapper that does some extra
security check and launch the scripts (which inherits the privileges of
the setuid wrapper). See perlsec documentation for more details.
(This explain why the custom byte code works, since it's a binary that
embeds both the script and the interpreter).

Indeed. Maybe the ocaml distribution could provide such a wrapper.

Hope this helps,
