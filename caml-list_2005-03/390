Hi all,

Sorry to to harp on this, but the main ocaml web page still doesn't
render with some web browsers, for instance Galeon 1.2.5 and Galeon
1.3.20.

Going to http://caml.inria.fr/ results in the browser being served
a file with MIME type unknown/unknown. Since the browser doesn't
know the file type it offer me the option of saving the file 
rather than viewing it.

This is an problem with the setup of the web server itself. It
often means that the /etc/apache2/mime.types is missing or 
has no entry for the file type being served.

Erik
