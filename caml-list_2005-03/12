I think this would be the wrong direction to go.

What I think would be useful is an OCaml wrapper around Gtk, Win32 and
Aqua/COCOA.  The idea would be for the OCaml wrapper to abstract away
the differences, allowing cross-platform programming with native
widgets.  WxWidgets fits the bill here, but the actual API is clunky.
I have a feeling that something could be done better with a functional
programming approach.

Of course it's a lot of tedious engineering work.  I'm not
volunteering!

Rich.
