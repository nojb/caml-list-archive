I also use and like the OCaml Lua implementation. I think there is something
to the approach of having a separate simple configuration language. I'd
probably have chosen Python, but Lua and Scheme were the ones I wouldn't have
to write, and often users don't like Scheme.

One petty complaint I have is that I'm not a fan of literate programming, and
while it's just a bit of grunt work (same kind of grunt work converting SML to
OCaml :) to deliteralize it, I'd appreciate it more if it were just a plain old
OCaml source distribution.
