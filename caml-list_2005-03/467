Everything now seems to work just fine. Congrats to a
much better web presence than previously! The
integration of the Humps is, among everything else, a
nice improvement. If future plans allow it I'd be
interested in having one of those nice little boxes on
the right with the latest Humps material as well as
the latest news. Makes the language seem more vibrant
when the first page has new stuff at tighter
intervals:)

And the concerns I expressed in my first post in this
thread turned out to be mostly unfounded and have now
all been put to rest. Thanks for straight answers, and
as always, fantastic work.


Martin
