CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

The biennial European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) is 
Europe's premier venue for presenting scientific results in AI. Under 
the general theme "Paving the way towards Human-Centric AI", the 24th 
edition of ECAI will be held in Santiago de Compostela, a UNESCO's World 
Heritage City which is the destination of unique Routes that cross all 
Europe since the Middle Ages. The conference dates are 10-12 June 2020, 
with the workshops taking place on 8-9 June. Save these dates!

The Program Committee of the 24th European Conference on Artificial 
Intelligence (ECAI 2020) invites the submission of papers for the 
technical programme of the Conference. High-quality original submissions 
are welcome from research results and applications of all areas of AI 
including the following ones:

- Agent-based and Multi-agent Systems (MAS)
- Computational Intelligence (CI)
- Constraints and Satisfiability (CS)
- Games and Virtual Environments (GAME)
- Heuristic Search (HEU)
- Human Aspects in AI (HAI)
- Information Retrieval and Filtering (IRF)
- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Multidisciplinary Topics and Applications (MULT)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Planning and Scheduling (PLAN)
- Robotics (ROB)
- Safe, Explainable, and Trustworthy AI (XAI)
- Semantic Technologies (SEM)
- Uncertainty in AI (UAI)
- Vision (VIS)

TYPES OF PAPERS
---------------
Two types of contributions are admitted in ECAI2020:
- Scientific papers, which report novel research in AI and must not 
exceed seven pages plus one of only references
- Highlight papers, which are two pages abstracts (including references) 
that highlight your favorite recent technical work (possibly appeared 
elsewhere), position, or open problems with clear and concise 
formulations of current challenges. The aim of these papers is 
highlighting important results to a wide audience.

All submissions will be subject to peer review by the ECAI 2020 
Programme Committee. Scientific papers will be evaluated based on 
relevance, significance of contribution, impact, technical quality, 
scholarship and quality of presentation. During the rebuttal phase, the 
(primary) authors of submitted papers will be offered the opportunity to 
respond to the reviews for their papers before the final decision on 
acceptance or otherwise is made. Highlight will be reviewed following 
guidelines specifically tailored to their special nature.


The Full Call for Papers is available at
