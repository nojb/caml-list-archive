Our build system is portable, we need Ocamlbuild code to also be
entirely portable. We know at present it doesn't work on Windows.
But the problem is on Linux.

Now, I have no idea what the problem was because I deleted the entire
workspace and re-created it from the repository and it went away.
We don't make any symbolic links because the script is portable,
and you can't make them on Windows.

So just keep an eye out for someone having a similar problem.

Erick reports another issue: ocamlbuild tries to rebuild 
libraries a code depends on -- but not the system libraries.

The idea of building a library is to *avoid* having to do
any dependency checking on the module level. Is there some
way to fix this? I.e, to 'make' a library, and then have
it treated as a 'system' library.
