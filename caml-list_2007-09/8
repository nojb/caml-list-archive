Is there a reason why, in gl.mli, point3 is defined as a tuple, and not a 
structure or array or other datatype that holds floats unboxed?  Having it 
an unboxed type would be a double advantage- unboxing in Ocaml, and the 
ability to call the vector vectors on the openGL side of things without 
having to copy the data.

Just wondering...

Brian
