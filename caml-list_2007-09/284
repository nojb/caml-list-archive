The purpose of this letter is to briefly introduce myself and request for your services in acquisition of business interests.

As a first step in my request for your services, I would like you to inform me on your area of expertise and explore the opportunity of you meeting with my associate to 
discuss legal and contract concerns. At the same time, I will also like to inform you that your ideas and real estate advice or any other viable profit oriented business will 
be most welcomed as we are new to investments in your location.

As a prospective client, I strongly believe that my paramount concern is how best I can maximize your services to the fullest in achieving my investment goals.

I do hope my request is acceptable to you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this proposal by sending a response email, so that I may proceed with arrangements. I 
would greatly appreciate if you send your response mails to my personal mailbox jonathan_lloyd011011@yahoo.com  I look forward to meeting with you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Jonathan R. Lloyd
