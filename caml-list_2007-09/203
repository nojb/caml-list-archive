  Thanks Jon, happy to read you,

 So, do you think that (<<<) could replace (<<) as a function composition operator ?

Things must keep consistent, you're right. So, ( <| ) instead of ( << )
can't be used.
Julien proposed ( @@ ).

However I saw it was used this way :

let rec ( @@ ) l1 l2 = List.rev_append l1 l2;;  ( Why rec ? )

here :

  It would be useful that experimented OCaml people suggest a replacement for the heavily used composition operator ( << ) that is now reserved for camlp4...

Fabrice
