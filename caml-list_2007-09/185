everyone--

This is to announce the release of the OCaml Network Application  
Environment (OCaml NAE) Core Foundation library version 0.9 (cf-0.9).

Download the source and ocamldoc output from the project page on  
SourceForge:

	<http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocnae>

This is a maintenance release to fix bugs and improve compatibility  
with OCaml-3.10.0.


===== OCaml NAE Core Foundation (cf) library =====

This distribution is the Objective Caml Network Application  
Environment (NAE)
Core Foundation library, which is a collection of miscellaneous  
extensions to
the Objective Caml standard library.

Highlighted features include:

- Functional streams and stream processors (extended).
- Functional bootstrapped skew-binomial heap.
- Functional red-black binary tree (associative array).
- Functional sets based on red-black binary tree.
- Functional real-time catenable deque.
- Functional LL(x) parsing using state-exception monad.
- Functional lazy deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
- Functional lexical analyzer (using lazy DFA and monadic parser).
- Functional substring list manipulation (message buffer chains).
- Gregorian calendar date manipulation.
- Standard time manipulation.
- System time in Temps Atomique International (TAI).
- Unicode transcoding.
- Universal resource identifier (URI) manipulation.

Additionally, the following noteworthy features are provided for  
compatibility
with earlier versions of this library.  Further developments to these  
features
are expected to move to a new, separate [Nx] library.  These features  
are not
expected to improve in the [Cf] library for the version 0.x series,  
and they
will be removed in the 1.x series.

- Extended socket interface (supports more options, and UDP w/ 
multicast).
- I/O event multiplexing (with Unix.select).

Note: see the ISSUES file for a list of open problems in this release.

===== Version 0.9 =====

Highlights of the changes:

+ Compatibility with OCaml-3.10+beta.
+ Fix bug in Cf_rbtree.nearest_(incr|decr) functions.
+ Minor performance improvement.
+ Minor bugs in tests fixed.
+ Noted that socket extensions and event multiplexing are moving to the
   forthcoming Nx library.

===== Required Components =====

This library requires the following external components:

- Objective Caml (v3.10.0 or newer)
- Findlib (tested with v1.1.2p1)

Principal development was on Mac OS X 10.4 w/ XCode 2.4.1 using GCC  
4.0.  Other
platforms with POSIX-like environments should require a minimal  
porting effort.

One major open issue: the extended socket interface is broken under  
WIN32.
(The author invites help porting the library to other environments.)
