Hello (Nicolas),

Is it possible to specify build flags and deps in a compositional  
way ? That is I have C bindings in a libdip/ dir, I would like to  
specify the additional flags and dep there, not in the toplevel  
myocamlbuild.ml. I tried to make the toplevel plugin refer to  
external modules but it seems to be compiled in a restricted  
environement. I also tried to define a myocamlbuild.ml in libdip/ but  
it seems to be ignored. Is there something like a plugin hierarchy as  
with the _tag files ?

Best,

Daniel

P.S.

By the way I couldn't find it in the documentation but ocamlbuild  
ignores any directory starting with an underscore even if you include  
it explictly with a tag, is that right ?
