You probably mean "imperfect English". The phrase "naughty English" makes i=

sound like you've only mastered the phrase "sucky sucky ten dollar". ;-)

To the best of my knowledge, my book is only resold in France by Le Monde e=

Tique, as Dominique mentioned. However, you mention taxes and, although I d=
o=20
not understand exactly what you have written, I do not believe any taxes ar=

incurred because we are both within the EU.

As an aside, OCaml for Scientists is still our best-selling product and we=
=20
shipped =C2=A31,000 worth of OCaml for Scientists a single week last month=

following this wonderful blog post:

Sounds like an OCaml in Finance book is sorely needed! :-)

Let me know if you need any more specific OCaml resources and I'll do my be=
st=20
to create them.
