Yes. Change Http_client so it can make use of Uq_ssl. This is, however,
not so easy.

A proxy doesn't work here, because encryption is end-to-end. What you
need is a tunnel endpoint like stunnel. I think that a few changes of
Http_client are still necessary since there is currently no way to
inject an already connected socket into it.

I guess this is the simplest part of the change.
