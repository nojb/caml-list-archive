Being  able  to specify things like syntax extensions in the same place can be
very  precious  and not incompatible with an "in the file itself" way of doing
so.

This  sounds  like  a  good  idea.  That's  not a new one and it was our first
choice  when  designing  ocamlbuild. However after some reflections we decided
that  one  can  first do _tags method and then provide a way to read tags from
the file itself.

The  main  problem  with  the  solution with embedded tags is that one must at
least  define  a  how to read these annotations. This is not that easy since a
.ml  file  can  be  a  pre-processed file with a totally different syntax. One
moreover  don't  want  to  only  focus  on  OCaml  files  but also C files for
instance.

I hope this makes our first decision clear...
