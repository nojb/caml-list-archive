On Unix, file-descriptors are identified by integer-values.

In OCaml, you have abstract types for file-descriptors.
So, how to convert them? I think, officially there is no way.

But if you like the concept of completely using files,
Plan9 as operating system would make sense to you. :)

Something like Sys.max_open_fd would be fine,
and I think there should be a way to make it cross-platform-available.

getrlimit seems to be a Unix-only thing.
I don't know if this is also available on other systems, like Windows or so.

So, if it is Unix-specific, this only would make sense in the Unix-modlue.

But something like the maximum number of open files / max-num of
used filedescriptors would also make sense on unix.

So, I would ask for something like a Sys.max_open_fd.
This owuld be a cross-platform thing.


> I wonder if /dev/fd is more or less portable...

Will this be available on non-Unix and non-Linux systems?

You also mentioned Win-systems?
If you also need that portability, you should not look for
Unix-only features.
