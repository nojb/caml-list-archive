Ok

Your second attempt is good you need the camlp4o tag.

You absolutely need to wrap this flag declaration to avoid order of initialization problems (see below).

Ok

That's due to the order of initialization.

$ cat myocamlbuild.ml
open Ocamlbuild_plugin;;
open Command;;
dispatch begin function
| After_rules ->
    flag ["ocaml"; "pp"; "use_openin"] (A"pa_openin.cmo");
    dep ["ocaml"; "ocamldep"; "use_openin"] ["pa_openin.cmo"];
| _ -> ()
end;;

Yes you're right!

I've quickly added a page on that:
