This is one of the things about the OCaml Visualization Toolkit
(one of the Jane St. summer projects).  It is built around
cairo-ocaml, which in turn supports SVG output.

OVT is still somewhat incomplete, but its output is already quite
attractive thanks to the Cairo backend.  SVG output is one of the
items still missing from OVT, and I do not know what plans exist to
maintain this library.  But with that addition it would be an
immensely useful tool for scientific plots, among other things.
I've already used OVT for a few simple presentation figures.
