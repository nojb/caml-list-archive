Have you try this, since this part can be very time consuming.

Is you source tree very big?

Yes it even don't know that's system libraries.

Yes you can do it by showing it the directory with compiled files.
Then you have to explain it that all these .cmo,.cmi... are not junk files.

Example of using a library in /usr/lib/ocaml/foolib

$ ln -s /usr/lib/ocaml/foolib foolib

$ cat _tags
"foolib": include, precious

The first tag (include) is equivalent to a `-I foolib' given to ocamlbuild. The second tag (precious, also known as not_hygienic) tell him to don't report these files as junk and propose their deletion.
