                           ECOOP'2008
        European Conference on Object Oriented Programming
                 July 7 - 11, 2008,  Paphos, Cyprus.
                    http://ecoop08.cs.ucy.ac.cy

                         CALL FOR PAPERS

The ECOOP 2008 conference invites high quality papers presenting
research results or experience in all areas relevant to object
technology, including work that takes inspiration from or builds
connections to areas not commonly considered object-oriented.  ECOOP
wishes to embrace a broad range of topics, so the following list of
suggested topics is by no means exclusive.

* Analysis, design methods and design patterns
* Concurrent, real-time or parallel systems
* Databases, persistence and transactions
* Distributed and mobile systems
* Frameworks, product lines and software architectures
* Language design and implementation
* Testing and metrics
* Programming environments and tools
* Theoretical foundations, type systems, formal methods
* Versioning, compatibility, software evolution
* Aspects, Components, Modularity, Reflection
* Collaboration, Workflow

Research papers should advance the current state of the art.  Many
different research methods can be applied, e.g., both experimentally
based work and mathematical results are welcome.  Experience papers
should describe novel insight gained from the practical application of
object technology, in such a way that it is of interest to a broad
group of researchers and practitioners.

The program committee will evaluate each contributed paper according
to the following groups of criteria: relevance; originality and
significance; precision and correctness; and presentation and clarity.
The importance of each group of criteria depends on the nature of the
paper in question.

FORMATTING

Papers must be written in English, and be no longer than 25 pages,
including references, appendices and figures.  For more information about
formatting please consult the Springer LNCS web site at
