Using pp(...), is not the best way to use preprocessors.

Try the camlp4r tag:

"test.ml": camlp4r

You  certainly don't want to add these flags to any commands that treat a file
that  is  tagged  use_openin.  You  certainly  want to add them only for ocaml
preprocessing.

flag ["ocaml"; "pp"; "use_openin"]
     (A"pa_openin.cmo");;
