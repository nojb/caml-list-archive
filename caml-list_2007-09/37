No, you showed two examples.
Did you tested other systems/implementations also?


Even if all results are the same, it doesn't matter,
because you compare things that can't be compared.

Switch on your mental type checking ;-)

Yes, and you asked for the behaviour of the OCaml function,
so I did read the right documentation.

You preassumed, that OCaml's Filename.basename has to implement
a basename-function that you want, but this is nonsense.

it seems, that you want to cintinue this.
But it's better to stop it.

You better should open your eyes and see that a video camera is not a car.
And that you looked into the wrong manual.

This is a C-function. Filename.basename has the same name,
and does a similar thing, but it's an OCaml-function that implements a behaviour
that is described in the OCaml-manual.


If you want the behaviour of
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/basename.html
then use it. But you have to program in C for that.

BTW: In your examples you used shells, not C.
This again is wrong, when you compare it with C.

It's more likely to assume that a shell (which shells did you use?
different shells might also bring different results)
is intended to offer the behaviour of the C-functions,
than to assume that OCaml re-implements the shell-behaviour.

================================================
# Filename.basename "/usr/lib";;
- : string = "lib"
# Filename.basename "/usr/";;
- : string = "."
# Filename.dirname "/usr/lib";;
- : string = "/usr"
# Filename.dirname "/usr/";;
- : string = "/usr"
#
================================================

"/usr/" is a directory. So, Filename.dirname should give "usr".

The behaviour of OCaml's
  Filename.concat (Filename.dirname) (Filename.basename)
makes sense to me. IMHO it should be done the way OCaml does it.
And the documentation and the Implementation do not differ.
So, this is fine.
If you mean a directory, append "/", if it is a file, not use a "/" at the end.

So, the OCaml-behaviour IMHO makes sense wonderfully.

Ciao,
