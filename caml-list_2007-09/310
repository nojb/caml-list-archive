Embedding source is generally better, unfortunately,
if you're distributing a product for other people to use.

This is because 

1. people use crappy build systems 
2. have unnecessary dependencies
3. don't maintain their code 'reliably' and/or don't provide
  repository (write) access

Apart from Python and Ocaml itself (and an unfortunate need for
a C++ compiler) my product has no external dependencies,
and it builds on all platforms I know about *as shipped*.

My rule for Ocaml code is simple: either it is shipped in the 
standard distro or it is shipped in mine. People have enough
problems getting Ocaml and C++ to work without adding second order
dependencies.

Hopefully (1) will eventually be solved by ocamlbuild, however
it still isn't really reliable/do the right thing, and doesn't
work on Windows. We provide it as an option: if ocamlbuild is
found it is used -- I have to keep turning it off though,
because it isn't compatible with our other build scripts 
(fails sanitise checks, probably our _tags etc aren't right yet).
