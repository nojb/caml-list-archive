To make it easier, that's all some people are reluctant to use non
supported tools (this joins a recent discussion about extending
standard library or keeping other libraries aside). And you can't blame
them for that.

Ocamlbuild is here and you're still free to choose...
However it's good to have a default when you are a beginner or don't =20
want
to mind yourself with "which one should I choose ?".
Those kinds of question are undesirable side-effects that you don't care
when you want to concentrate on thinking the architecture of your code.

No. Saying this is an excuse for people who don't manage to make it
accessible. Ask yourself why ocaml is not as popular as so many other
languages. It is not far most complicated that many other ones. Why
do you think F# is gaining in interest for many people ? It is not
(only) the language...
