Yes, he is right. What you're thinking about is the networker engine. It is not
available for now but planned for the future. You'll still be able to have
shared memory through STM, though the communication cost will be larger. 

The implementation is no more difficult than the process engine, on the
contrary it can reuse most of the techniques developed with process
engine. But I'm kind of busy in this period, and won't be able to start the
implementation right now.
