I believe the main point here is that you are bending what I consider
best practice for felix because it is still in development and you want
to speed its adoption.  I do understand that.

You should no more expect them to build the reins library then for the
gcc authors should expect you to build all of the dependencies of
gcc/g++ (of which there appear to be >40 in the debian/control file for
that package).  When you distribute the felix binary, all of its ocaml
libraries are statically linked in, so they don't have to download
anything outside of your binary (which is the downside of your choice to
do source releases).

I haven't tested it, but I would be very surprised if they didn't.

And I am relying on that fact.  Good thing I didn't just cut and paste
the relevant omake code to compile my stuff on linux. :-p
