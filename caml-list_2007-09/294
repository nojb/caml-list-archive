I use it for a lot of genome sequence processing, comparative genomics
and phylogenetic modeling. Algorithmically this involves conditional
random fields (for which I have my own library) and some linear
algebra and numerical optimization (for which I use Lacaml and
ocamlgsl). I had a lot of frustrations at first, but it's been better
since we got exception stack traces and ocaml+twt.

For numerical computing, I wish ocamlopt would do at least basic loop
optimizations, like hoisting invariant values -- this type of stuff is
easily done manually, but often at the expense of code readability. I
can see how this may be a bottomless pit for the dev team though,
since I would probably always feel like we are one crucial
optimization short of not having to rewrite that tight loop in C.

In any case though, I work in a group where everyone else uses Python,
so I'm already beating their pants off :o)

Mike
