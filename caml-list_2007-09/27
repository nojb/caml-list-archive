Which is exactly what I said later in my email.

Your documentation documents the Ocaml function.

We are not talking about GPS systems or video cameras or vacuum cleaners,
but if you want we can continue; I would be complaining if I was sold
a video camera that didn't record video but did suck a lot of air.

The function is called basename just like the IEEE Std 1003.1 standard
function specified by The Open Group:

    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/basename.html

In the examples section of that document they give these examples:

    Input String    Output String
    "/usr/lib"      "lib"
    "/usr/"         "usr"
