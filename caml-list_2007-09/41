(This question may not be OCaml specific, but I guess it is not specific at
all, and there are quite some people here that have implemented compilers,
so I post it here...)

I was thinking about compiler implementation recently, and figured that it
is difficult to design the compiler for a variable number of hardware
registers - compared for designing a compiler witha fixed number of
registers.

However, would it be possible to "emulate" cpu registers using software? By
keeping registers in the main memory, but accessing them often enough to
keep them in primary cache? That would be quite fast I believe...
