Is anybody else having difficulty downloading this? I have tried 
a large number of different sourceforge mirrors and none of them
seem to have this file whic means I re-directed back and forth
across the net til one of these things redirects me to this:

    http://.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/cothreads/cothreads_0.10.tar.bz2

which isn't even a legal host name.

I've also tried wget with no success.
