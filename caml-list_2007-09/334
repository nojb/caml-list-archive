This is true .. but you're missing something, which is slightly
surprising considering you're the maintainer and DD manager
of the Debian package for Felix ..

None of my clients will be needing this library to use it,
because they're not (using Felix as) Ocaml programmers.

If I used it, it would be used ONCE by users to build the 
Felix executable and discarded. Already, Python, Ocaml 
and C++ are needed for this single build.

Anyhow, that's why I would not want to ask MY clients to
have to install these dependencies AND THEN your library:
that adds 4 more dependencies and places where things can
go wrong .. will your build scripts work on Windows?
Will Omakes and findlibs and Ounits build scripts build
transparently on Windows?

My build script do -- they're platform independent.

[Yes, I know Omake is designed specifically to work on Windows
to enable platform independent builds]
