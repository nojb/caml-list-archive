Is OCamIL still alive? Is there any interest in a verbatim OCaml port to .NET?

The .NET platform seems to be the future on Windows and writing a .NET port 
rather than a native port of OCaml seems like a better way to get OCaml 
running under Windows. Although a couple of people have told me that their 
OCaml installations run perfectly under Windows I'm an MS newbie and have no 
end of trouble getting it to work (compared to F#, for example).

In fact, now that I have a Windows box I should probably add Windows 
executables for all of our demos...
