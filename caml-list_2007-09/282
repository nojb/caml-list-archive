Dear all,
I am wondering is anyone using Ocaml for scientific computing? I didn't
mean parsing, but for number crunching applications, like signal/image
analysis. Is it suitable for this kind of tasks in general? I would like
to hear from someone practically using it, not just theoretical
possibility.

I have read "Ocaml for Scientists" and although it gave me some very
good ideas, I didn't manage to repeat a number of examples with modules
from this book. I had a problem compiling or using scientific modules
(lacaml, fftw, some others) on linux and macosx and since some of these
modules look like someones graduate project, I would like to hear from
people practically using ocaml for mathematical simulations or analysis.
Preferable with OS, modules, problems encountered. 

Regards,
Alex
