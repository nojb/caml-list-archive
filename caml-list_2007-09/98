I remember doing this in a daemon I wrote years ago in C but didn't
do it for a daemon I wrote recently in Ocaml (much nicer for daemons
than *any* other language).

My curiosity was piqued, so I did a bit of a search and found the
rational for this here:

    http://cloud9.hedgee.com/scribbles/daemon

in particular the fghack tool which prevents a daemon that doesn't
close all file descriptors from going into the background :

    http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/fghack.html

One possible solution to this would be a function written in C and
wrapped in Ocaml that does the same as the Obj.magic hack above.

"I have long argued that the entertainment industry doesn't want
people to have computers. Computers give users too much capability,
too much flexibility, too much freedom. The entertainment industry
wants users to sit back and consume things. They are trying to
turn a computer into an Internet Entertainment Platform, along the
lines of a television or VCR. This bill is a large step in that
direction."  -- Bruce Schneier
