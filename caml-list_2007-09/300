I've deliberately tried to unify many of the conventions that people 
have used to allow users to easily change between data structure 
implementations.  A major goal of the project is that you don't have to 
rely on downloading some random .ml/.mli from someone's webpage and 
embed it your project.  Instead you just use the reins library and only 
have to worry about updating one piece of software for updates/ bug fixes.

As for being a cathedral vs bazaar, I am very open to (and hoping to 
receive!) contributions from others.  There have been several 
interesting data structures developed by members of the OCaml community 
and I would happily give any developer access to the project that wished 
to contribute their work.

Oops, thanks for reminding me.  The code is under the LGPL v2.1

Cheers,
