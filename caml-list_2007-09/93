XenSource is a dynamic, fast-growing software company that develops
Linux/Windows virtualisation products on top of the open-source
Xen hypervisor. Our most recent product, XenEnterprise v4, sports a
high-performance, fully-featured virtualisation control plane implemented
in OCaml. To help us achieve our goal of delivering high-quality,
exciting features and supporting an ever-growing customer base, we are
looking to hire black-belt OCaml programmers to join our established
team of talented and motivated engineers.

Our code base is significant: over 100,000 lines of OCaml which solves
problems ranging from the low-level (Xen hypercalls), to the high-level
(resource pool management), to the compiler-driven (generating language
bindings for our Xen datamodel).

Our ideal candidate will have:

* significant experience of OCaml programming

* an aptitude for implementing (and reasoning about) complex concurrent,
distributed systems

* the skills required to contribute to both the architectural design
and day-to-day development of a large code-base

* strong communication skills and problem solving ability

* a determination to deliver great products that perform brilliantly
and meet our customers' needs

So if you want to hack OCaml professionally, tackle interesting and
challenging programming problems and contribute to an innovative product
that is already used by thousands of customers across the world, please
don't hesitate to contact us. We are interested in applicants from both
research and industrial backgrounds.

XenSource has also joined the Caml Consortium to underline our committment
to using state-of-the-art languages such as OCaml in a wider industrial
context.
