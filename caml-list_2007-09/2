OK. So it seems, @responsefile is only used sometimes, not
always. That makes it difficult to see wether the situation actually
persists. When was that you got the problem and (if you remember) with
which version (approximately at least) of MSYS/MingW). As I said, I'd
be interested in the long run to get a distribution of OCaml that is
independent of Cygwin and Visual C++.
