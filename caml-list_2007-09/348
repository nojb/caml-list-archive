I'm not a big fan of yum, but one thing it does well is the
'createrepo' command which lets you effortlessly create a repository
from a collection of RPMs.  So RPM + createrepo + a CD burner would do
what you want on Fedora.

I think the bigger problem is that certain Well Known Operating
Systems don't come with any package management to speak of.
