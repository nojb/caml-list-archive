I think you should take a look at godi! (which allow you to
download/install all your dependencies at once).

There is also linux distribution which have a good support of ocaml
languages (debian/redhat...)

I hope that a debian package will be released soon!

Anyway, embeding any external code into your project is a nightmare for
security/maintenance in the long term... I would avoid this solution if
i want things that doesn't have problem.
