Actually no, I tried this. I used gvim and ignored the difficulty
of entering the Unicode characters I wanted.

The problem I found was that the fonts were such that the
character was almost unreadable. And I think i tried,
for example, the high school division sign.. 

If you tried that with a 'small o' it would just look like a
small 'o' and not the composition operator.

I think this problem might be fixed with lexical coloring though!
