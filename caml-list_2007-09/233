There was a discussion ten years ago or so, perhaps on the cross-gcc
list, that Stallman joined.  He said something to the effect that if you
provided object code in a linkable format (even partially linked) so
that a user could link in the library in question, you'd satisfied the
license.  You didn't have to provide instructions, guidance, or help.
If the binary then had to be embedded in a masked ROM in the middle of
your giant ASIC, that was the hacker's problem, not yours.
