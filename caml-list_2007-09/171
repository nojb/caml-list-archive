This might be, or might be not. "The standard has nothing to say about
this, but usually it's at least long int whatever that is at the
corresponing platform. In contrast, I find in unix.ml

   external lseek : file_descr -> int -> seek_command -> int = "unix_lseek"

but also in otherlibs/unix/lseek.c

  ret = lseek(Int_val(fd), Long_val(ofs),
                       seek_command_table[Int_val(cmd)]);

(see the Long_Val).

Am I only imagining potential problems with variable width here?
