Yes. I'm working on code for audio digital signal processing and 
function optimisation. I also wrote my own simple computer algebra
system.

Much better than C or C++ or GNU Octave.

I've looked at lacaml and didn't find any particular problems. The ocaml
fftw module was a little more problematic but I resolved the problem in
the end.

 I would like to hear from

I'm doing this on Ubuntu Linux, I usually use package distributed by
Ubuntu but will compile my own from source if I need to.

HTH,
