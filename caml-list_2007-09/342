Actually no: IMHO 'best practice' is that programs are *source code*
and that is the only way they should be distributed. Binaries
should never be installed or distributed: they're just a 'cache'
and should be invisible.

Felix is designed to work that way: you execute script directly,
the same as Perl and Python.

Other systems, such as C, are so utterly plagued by design
faults and portability issues that systems like Debian were
designed to do this caching in a reliable way and distribute
the binaries .. but this is simply a consequence of the poor
engineering of C.

But that's because it is written in C. For Ocaml code
I expect .. and indeed demand .. to build from source.
That is possible because of the superior design of the
Ocaml programming language. 

That is how Godi manages things -- and there's a good argument
Debian Ocaml 'binary' packages should ACTUALLY contain source
code which is built on demand: it would be a whole lot more
portable and easier to maintain, since upgrades to Ocaml require
modifying ALL the dang binary libraries, but very rarely
any change to sources.

Binary distros suck because user code not part of the distro
isn't handled. 'Execute source' is the way to go, because
it rebuilds everything, including user code, automatically
as required. IMHO of course :)

Yes, this is true, however I don't own a compile farm to build
all the binaries.
