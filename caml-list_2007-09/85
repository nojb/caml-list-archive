      The Fifth Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems

                      November 29 - December 1, 2007
                               Singapore

                    http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~aplas07/
                    http://flint.cs.yale.edu/aplas2007/


Scope of the Conference
-----------------------

APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of recent results and the exchange of ideas
and experience in topics concerned with programming languages and
systems.  APLAS is based in Asia, but is an international forum that
serves the worldwide programming languages community.

The APLAS series is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation
of Software (AAFS), which has recently been founded by Asian
researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the
USA.  The past formal APLAS symposiums were successfully held in
Sydney (2006, Australia), Tsukuba (2005, Japan), Taipei (2004, Taiwan)
and Beijing (2003, China) after three informal workshops held in
Shanghai (2002, China), Daejeon (2001, Korea) and Singapore (2000).
Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in Springer-Verlag's
LNCS 2895, 3302, 3780, and 4279.


Conference Location
-------------------

APLAS'07 will be held at Kent Ridge Guild House, National University

Singapore, located in the heart of fascinating Southeast Asia,
continues to embrace tradition and modernity today. Brimming with
unbridled energy and bursting with exciting events, the city offers
countless unique, memorable experiences waiting to be discovered.
