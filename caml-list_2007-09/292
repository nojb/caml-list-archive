Nothing against Smoke, but on a Unix/Linux platform it might just be
useful to use Ocaml to calculate the graphics data and pipe that to
another process, e.g. one of the well known scientific visualization /
graphing packages (starting with gnuplot, but there have been others
too). For practical work (not advertising), that spares one to do all
that tricky stuff like placing labels or ticks on the axis yourself.

BTW: What I'd consider a boon for scientific visualization, actually,
would be to output SVG to a file. Such an SVG file could be annotated
with a usual graphics editor like inkscape for publication: Very
valuable (if you don't need interactive visualization).
