Then this is probably not the problem from
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-3.09/notes/README.win32 I'm
referring to? I'm a bit confused here, because, AFAI understand, Ocaml
only uses the C-compiler as a backend and that C-Compiler comes from
MingW? So where does MSYS come in?

Or did I get everything wrong and it is OCaml that doesn't understand
the @responsefile generated by MSYS tools?

In this case, can anybody see a reason why it should not be possible
to use the MingW compilers as a backend to OCaml and compile from
CMD.EXE?
