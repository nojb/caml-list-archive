There is many ways to do this kind of things.

1/  Rename your main.ml into xnuncc.ml and then accept to keep xnuncc.byte and
xnuncc.native names.

2/  Add  a  rule  to  myocamlbuild.ml  to  say  that  on can build xnuncc from
main.byte and that's just a copy.

...
copy_rule "The xnuncc binary" "main.byte" "xnuncc";;
...

The  problem  with this method is that the xnuncc file only live in the _build
directory. You have to manually copy it to install it.

3/  Use a script around ocamlbuild that make a link or a copy for you.

It's  mainly  a  matter  of installing things with ocamlbuild, that is a point
not really treated for now.
