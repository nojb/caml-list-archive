Ok, there is camlget, ok there is ocamlfind, ok there is godi.

Maybe if there were some 'Inria'-made tool (seems camlget is starting  
point for that ?) that be settled in the standard ocaml distribution  
would help to make everyone agreed, don't you think ? This does not  
solve intrinsic problems such as "I prefer dynamically linked" vs "I  
prefer statically linked" but at least that would be a tool everyone  
could rely on. Then everyone is free to use it or not. It would even  
simplify the task for library-writers.

BTW isn't it the same with ocamlbuild ? Before there were Omake and  
others. Now it seems to settle some kind of standard.

My 2cents.
Vincent
