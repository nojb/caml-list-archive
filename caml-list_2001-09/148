Hi!

Could anyone explain me why "parser" was introduced in Ocaml?
As you know, "function" is using in the caml light-instead of "parser".
"parser" must be a reserved word like "let" and "function", right?

I reviewed  "The Objective Caml system release 3.02", specially
  1.8 Pretty-printing and parsing
      it introduces lex and parser.
  7.1 Streams and stream parser
      it shows the syntax of parser and stream matching.

But I don't know why "parser" was introduced.
Here is an example.

# let next = parser
  [< 'x >] -> x
  | [<>] -> raise (Failure "end of stream")
  ;;
val next : 'a Stream.t -> 'a = <fun>

Thanks in advance for your help.
