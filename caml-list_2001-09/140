Hello list,

Is anyone here using FORT? Does anyone have any examples or
documentation for it? 

I've read, and I thought understood, the source, but I can't get a
testscript to run. 

If I just pass it to the 'fort' executable (i.e. 'fort testsuite.ml'),
the Fort module and its functions are not available to the script. 

I can compile the script, and link to fort.cmo and fortmain.cmo, and
this executable produces a report, but it shows no tests were run.

If I don't link fortmain.cmo, nothing happens at all.

What am I doing wrong?
