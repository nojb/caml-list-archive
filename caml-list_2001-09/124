Hi!

I'm very interesed to use Caml for educational purpose
in multibyte environment such as CJK.
So I'd like to know whether Caml supoprt Unicode or not?
(Unicode (ISO 10646) is the character coding (or character set) standard.)
Many people forsee that Unicode is going to replace all older lagcy
encodings in a few years
and many languages such as C, Java, Perl, Tcl, C# and Python support it
already.

If Caml doesn't support unicode, could you give me any clue
from which part in caml source I should start in order to support unicode?

More question,
Which form is better for processing unicode in Caml, UTF-8 or UCS-2 (or
UCS-4)?
