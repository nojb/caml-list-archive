Hi,

We did this for the enlightenment lists, because some developers were
getting bothered with all the newbie questions, so we created an
enlightenment-users mailing list. This means that some developers, or
people who know a bit, subscribe to this list to answer questions. I
found out that subscribing to both list is fine, traffic has increased a
bit (newbies seem to be less frightened, and the people who subscribed
to the user list are ready to read faq, so they don't scare newbies away
;-), and the general impression is positive. The only requirement for
this to work is to ensure that some people who know about ocaml are
ready to subscribe and answer to questions.
