ocamlopt -o rex -I /usr/lib/ocaml/contrib pcre.cmxa /tmp/rex.ml

SHOULD suffice. Perhaps you need the -ccopt and -cclib options, too, that
depends on how clever pcre is installed (can't remember) (oh, and it's -lpcre,
not -llibpcre.a, if you need it).

You seem to be confused because there are two .a files, arent't you:
libpcre.a and pcre.a. Actually, both are needed in the final executable, i.e.
both contain necessary machine code. Fortutately, there is also the .cmxa file
which only contains management information, and no machine code, and if you
put it onto the command line the compiler will always be able to find the
pcre.a file at least, and if you are lucky, it will also find libpcre.a. (The
latter works only if pcre is installed with "automatic linking", I don't know
whether the current release supports it.) pcre.a contains compiled ocaml code,
and libpcre.a contains compiled C code.

ocamlfind makes only a difference if the pcre installation contains a so-called
META file, and in this case you could do: ocamlfind ocamlopt -o rex -package
pcre -linkpkg /tmp/rex.ml. That's for people who like it comfortable (here in
Germany we say "Warmduscher", don't know how to translate it).
