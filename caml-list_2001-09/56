Mmm, this is the second notice of the next release of ocaml i am having today,
which makes me ask myself if there is already a approximative date planed for
it ? As debian/woody is in the process of freezing, it would be nice to have
the latest version of ocaml in the next release, so that we don't have the
current situation, where debian/potato, now almost 1 and a half year after
it's freeze, has only ocaml 2.04.
