No problem - it's already adapted for MSVC and can be directly compiled
with mingw because mingw uses just the same clib (msvcrt.dll). What should
be done to compile OCaml with mingw:

1. Manually create proper config/Makefile config/m.h config/s.h (configure
script won't work for mingw).
2. Update many makefiles to sync them with MSVC port (add necessary
conditionals etc.)
3. win32unix library uses undocumented _dospamerr() function that is
available only in the static MSVC runtime. You should exctract it from
Microsoft RTL sources.
4. gcc does not understand  __declspec( thread ), so you need somethere

#ifdef __GNUC__
#define TLS __attribute__((section (".tls$")))
#else
#define TLS __declspec( thread )
#endif

5. something else, that I've forgotten to mention...

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
