	Stop worrying.

	1. You can do what other games do: use fixed mutable
data stores. 

	2. The GC will be much faster than other storage
management techniques used by games.

	3. The GC can be tuned.

Just don't overdo the 'functional' programming. Use imperative
data structures where they're appropriate. 

	It's my guess that, unlike most games, your game might actually WORK. 
This would be a pleasant change from the beautiful, high quality
graphics
games around, with utterly broken game play engines. Hopefully,
using Ocaml will allow you to concentrate on design and balance.
