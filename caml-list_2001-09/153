There have been a lot of beginner questions on this list of late and, though
there are still peaks and troughs, the traffic has increased noticeably. I
have no problems with beginners asking questions, and indeed I have answered
at least one such post myself at length, but I think perhaps the rest of us
might be better served if a separate list were established for them, say
`caml-newbie' or `caml-cafe'. `caml-list' would remain the default list for
announcements and general discussion.

Does anyone favor such a proposal?
