Subject: [Caml-list] How to use pcre

I have had very limited exposure to Perl and would like to use pcre
after reading much about it on this list.

I have looked in the documentation that comes with it, but can not
find simple examples on how to use it.  The example programs are very
impressive, but do not help me a lot to know how to use simple things
like string substitution.

Can somebody please give me a simple example on how to do the following:

How do I change a string (let s = "abcde";;) to "abcDe"?

In other words what would be the pcre equivalent of python's 

>>> t = re.sub('d','D',s)
>>> t
'abcDe'

Regards.

Johann
