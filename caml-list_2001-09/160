But "parser" is like "function", not like "match".

Same problem with "type": in my parsers, I would like to have "expr",
"patt" and "type". I named it "ctyp", ugly too. And "constraint"...
which is named "constrain" in the OCaml parser. It has been the
problem with keywords since the Pascal language...

Well, there is some syntactic preprocessor for OCaml - I don't
remember the name - which can do that...
