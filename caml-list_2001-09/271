Cool! :-)

Finally, OCaml could get a reasonable regexp-library!

It would be really nice if there were ways to call OCaml-native code
from OCaml-byte code. This question has popped up in the past, but it's
not an easy thing to do due to issues with the runtime:

Any news in this respect? A toplevel that could run a high-performance,
OCaml-native code string matching engine would give a terrific scripting
environment!
