Ocaml:
# let mul a b = a * b;;
val mul : int -> int -> int = <fun>
As Ocaml is strong typed function mul is resolved
to be an integer function (denoted by operator * only
valid to integers).
# let mul (a:int) (b:int) = a * b;;
val mul : int -> int -> int = <fun>
same result as above but here integer type is 
explicitly annotated. As Ocaml do not do implicit
data type coercions the compliler checks that arguments
passed to mul function must be allways of integer type.
So your concerns with 'pure' Ocaml code will never
occur, because compiler will catch these issues.
The only way to cheat compiler is to provide mul as
an external 'C' function that return other type during
run-time. For run-time debugging Ocaml also provide
assertion checking (see documentation chapter 7.3)

Ocaml:
# let ( &&& ) x y = if x >= y then x else y;;
val ( &&& ) : 'a -> 'a -> 'a = <fun>
# 3 &&& 5;;
- : int 5

So I think that your needs are yet fullfilled in actual
Ocaml implementation.
