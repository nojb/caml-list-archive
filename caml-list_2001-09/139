It's certainly not a style I would consider using in SML itself.  I
haven't written enough OCaml code to say how I would write this in
OCaml.

My preferred solution would be simply to allow a "local" prefix to any
declaration, which would indicate that that entity would not be visible
outside the current scope.

I've been hacking a bit with SML lately and I notice that a lot of
SML code uses the local <private fundefs> in <public fundefs> end
construct. Do SMLers who like this and wind up writing OCaml use
modules for this? Something like

module SomeDefs : sig
  <public fundecls>
end =3D struct
  <private fundefs>
  <public fundefs>
end
(* <open or include> SomeDefs, or just use SomeDefs.f ... *)

or is the slight extra verbosity a disincentive?

It seems to me that all of the uses of local in SML can be handled can
be
handled by the module system in OCaml, and I don't even find the
unsugared
forms to be bad at all.
