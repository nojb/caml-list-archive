My wish may not fit well into the current workflow of the OCaml-team,
but anyway, I feel it would save you some work overall:

Would it be possible to get access to a snapshot version of the
documentation, too? To be useful, this would require that you update it
incrementally in accordance with the compiler sources.

I don't mind working with CVS-snapshots (sometimes I have to), but I'd
need more information (= documentation) when trying out new features,
e.g. about the way that dynamic loading is supposed to work, etc. This
might help you in getting faster feedback on the state of your sources
and could significantly cut down the beta-testing time.

Some publically available regression test suite would also be fine if
you want to have people try snapshots on their platforms. Delegating
part of the testing process to the community is likely to save you time
and would thus benefit the community, too.

Regards,
Markus Mottl
