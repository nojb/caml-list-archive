Thanks, this is important to know! I don't want to have nasty side
effects when using a non-standard suffix so I'll stay with ".ml" and
".mli" and scan the file for suitable preprocessing options.

Ok, I had something like this in mind. Good to know where to find an
example implementation.

Nice! Though, if I already have to check for a preprocessing tag anyway,
I could also do things as follows:

The topmost line in a file could read like this:

  (*pp camlp4o -I some_dir some_quots.cmo some_more_quots.cmo *)

Then I just check for the 'pp' tag, and if it's there, I just take the
contents of the comment as parameter for the -pp option. This could then
also be a completely different preprocessor (cpp? ;).

Please tell me, if there is any hidden catch with this approach.
Thanks for the hints!

Regards,
Markus Mottl
