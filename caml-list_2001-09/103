Hi,

The assert primitive of Ocaml 3.02 (windows version) seems to print the source
file location as an offset from the beginning of the file rather than as a
line number and column.

Is there a particular reason for this?

The reason why I'm asking this is that it makes it much more difficult to find
the right assertion on most editors.

Is there a simple way to overcome this limitation?

I was thinking of the possibility of preprocessing the source code with some
simple preprocessor and using a home brewn assertion procedure, but I'd like
to hear about simpler solutions.

Regards,
  Vesa Karvonen
