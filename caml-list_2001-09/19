Subject: [Caml-list] flushing stdout with flush stdout not good?

I'm programming a realtime bot (as you may know :) and using printf with a
newline terminated format string followed by a call of fse ( short for
"flush stdout" in my prog) really doesn't work very well at flushing
stdout -- commands don't get read properly by the system, and get processed
in chunks, rather than as sent.  For some reason calling print_newline is
amazingly more effective, i.e. leaving the newline out of the printf format
string, and letting print_newline () take care of it.

Is this a known feature, or does it have to do with the indirect call of
flush stdout?
