I could modify the installation to default to a subdirectory, but I'm not
sure that it offers much benefit.  For large packages that install many
modules, it might help to be able to easily uninstall by deleting a
directory. 

Until Caml has real package support, installing into the OCAMLLIB
directory is probably the best policy.  This will find conflicts between
module names sooner rather than later and makes the use of the modules
easier.  Installing non-INRIA modules into a single subdirectory like
'contrib' might be a reasonable alternative though.
