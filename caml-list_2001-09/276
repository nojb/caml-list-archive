After I fired off my last message, I started to wonder if that's what you 
did, so I tried it myself under cygwin. Copying libncurses.a to libpdcurses.a 
still works (though this may need to be changed to use the regular ncurses 
which is part of the standard cygwin distro). I ran into some other problems, 
and here's what happened.

(first untarring the ocaml source, then patching, then untarring the boot 
stuff...)

1) make
First break is at utils/misc.mli, where it says cannot open pervasives.cmi. 
The only thing that worked for me here was to...
2) make world
which exits shortly with a cryptic (at least for me) error at [coldstart], 
but then
3) make
seems to be happy until it gets to bigarray. It needs bigarray.cmi but 
doesn't have it since it doesn't have big_int.cmi.  Making the 3 cmis you 
mention in otherlibs/num (int_misc.cmi, string_misc.cmi, and arith_flags.cmi) 
may be the first step, but it doesn't fix it. The only way I could build 
big_int.cmi was to cd to "otherlibs/num" and type "make big_int.cmi" there, 
after building nat.cmi as well.  Two more tries indicated that "ratio.cmi" 
and "num.cmi" also have to be built in the "otherlibs/num" directory. THEN, 
we have to cd to "otherlibs/bigarray" and do "make bigarray.cmi" there. Then,
4) make
goes all the way to ocamldebugger where it exits with "Uncaught exception: 
Not_found." I can't figure out how to fix it, so I do your next steps of "rm 
byterun/io.h", "make -C asmrun depend", and "make -C byterun depend". These 
last two have many warnings, most of which seem tied to redefinitions in 
fail.h.
5) make opt
then says I need arith_status.cmi in otherlibs/num, but once that's built it 
finishes without further error.

However, after doing "make install" and "make installopt" and trying to run 
ocaml.exe, I get "Cannot exec /usr/local/ocamlrun". In fact, all of the 
executables return that error.

And now I don't know how to fix that...

Oh, and as long as we're working on it, it would be VERY nice if we could get 
labltk to build as well.
