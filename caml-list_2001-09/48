That's wonderful. I suspect that much of the heat you're getting right now
is because people are confused or don't really understand what the plans
are for CamlP4 and OCaml. Maybe that roadmap isn't such a bad idea?

I prefer recursive descent, but my big gripe with yacc(s) is that they
always seem to be stuck in the original 70s BNF. Can't someone just write
an upwardly compatible yacc clone that supports a rich BNF?
