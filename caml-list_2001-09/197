Doesn't look like it's possible now. Here's what I tried. I compiled 
"hello_world.ml" with the "-output-obj" option to produce "camlprog.o". Next, 
still under cygwin, I tried "gcc -o hello_world camlprog.o -lgdi32 
-L/usr/lib/ocaml -lasmrun" and it worked! So, I could manually link a 
complete ocmal program without wrapping with a C program. Next, I exited from 
cygwin and opened up my dos-box for mingw (which doesn't have the cygwin bin 
directory in it's path, so there's no conflict). I used the "camlprog.o" 
which was created under cygwin and directed the linker to the ocaml libs. 
Unfortunately, the linker now complains with, among other things, 

/cygwin/lib/ocaml/libasmrun.a(signals.o)(.text+0x17):signals.c: undefined 
reference to `sigemptyset'

If I'm not mistaken, these are references to some of the more "unix-like" 
functions that cygwin provides and mingw doesn't so it can avoid using the 
cygwin1.dll. So it looks like even a simple "hello world" program need things 
from the ocaml libs that call the cygwin1.dll.

This is unfortunate. I think support for mingw would be a big plus for ocaml. 
Not only is mingw easier to install and use under Windows than cygwin, it 
doesn't require the pesky cygwin1.dll.
