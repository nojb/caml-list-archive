And what is the problem?

Camlp4 fixes the implementation. It is complicated to add the same
code in OCaml because it is about manipulatation of pieces of program,
which is very easy and simple in Camlp4 and very complicated with
OCaml. If you are not happy, implement the optimization yourself in
OCaml. Good luck.

The point is *not* to remove streams!!!! Streams and their LL1 parsers
remain!!! I just ask people to preprocess by "-pp camlp4o". Is that
so complicated? Are you allergic to my program?
