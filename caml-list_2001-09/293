It should work if:
- the Caml code doesn't use threads itself;
- you call it via callback_exn rather than callback (to make sure you
  always get control back from the Caml code);
- you protect the call to callback_exn by a mutex, to make sure that
  no two threads can call into Caml simultaneously.

In all other cases, and especially if the Caml code is multithreaded,
you would probably break something in the Caml runtime system.
