I want to re-iterate this.  I have several 10's of lines of caml code,
and probably 1/2 of the programs I write use the [< >] parsing.

Honestly, I don't really understand the implications of the
preprocessor.  If that is literally all I have to do and then I can
use the syntax, that is probably fine (and if it's just as easy from
the command line and for ocamlopt).  But I guess I don't understand
why it won't be the default if it's really that trivial.

I don't think anyone is arguing against fixing the implementation, but
the [< >] parsers are much more convenient/natural than yacc-like
parsers for many people and purposes.  Even a switch that let me
choose LALR or LL parsing but used the same syntax (as some C-based
tools do - see (I think) ANTLR) would seem to address this.
