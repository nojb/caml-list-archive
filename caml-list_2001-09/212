ocamlc -a can do that in the case of .cma libraries.  ocamlopt -a
could do it also if it were not for the stubbornness of the underlying
"ar" command (which is used to group together the .o files containing
the actual code for the Caml modules in the library): "ar" cannot
combine several .a files into one.

So, currently, I don't see how this can be done, save by significant
hacking in / around "ar".
