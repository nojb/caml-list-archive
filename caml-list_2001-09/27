I generally prefer using ".ml" and ".mli" because some tools of the
compiler does not accept different suffixes (e.g. the debugger). For
the rules, there are two methods:

1/ add in source files comments specifying how compile the file; in the
   Makefiles, call a shell script reading this comment and launching the
   good command; it is the method I use in the sources of Camlp4 (see the
   files tools/Makefile.tpl and tools/camlp4_comm.sh in Camlp4 sources) and
   in GeneWeb (same kind of shell script): this shell just calls ocamlc
   without -pp parameter if the comment is not found.

2/ compile all files with "-pp camlp4o" (or "-pp camlp4r" if you prefer
   the revised syntax) and use "#load" in your files: this has been possible
   (however not yet documented) since some versions of Camlp4. For example,
   if you use to compile "foo.ml" by:
        ocamlc -pp "camlp4o pa_extend.cmo q_MLast.cmo" -c foo.ml
   you can add in the beginning of foo.ml:
        #load "pa_extend.cmo";;
        #load "q_MLast.cmo";;
   and compile with
        ocamlc -pp camlp4o -c foo.ml

   (double semicolons at end of #load are mandatory; in revised syntax
   use simple semicolon)

   You can also use "#directory" in your source files, doing the same
   thing than the option -I of camlp4.
