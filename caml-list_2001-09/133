The sequence operator ; (semi-colon) is used for composing expressions
that may perform some side-effects. This is the typical construct of
imperative languages like Pascal. In Caml, such expressions are given
the type unit, and the only value of type unit is noted (). It
is generally considered as good practice to:

  (1) make sure that the expressions are of type unit, except maybe
      the last one, ie. given <e1>; <e2>; .... ; <en>; <e'>, then
      <e1>, <e2>, ..., <en> should have type unit;
  (2) use keywords "begin" and "end" to enclose your sequence:
      begin
        <e1>;
        <e2>;
        ...
        <en>;
        <e'>
      end

So, in your example, 1 is of type int, not unit (hence the warning).

For historical reason, this behaviour is not mandatory, and you can
turn off this warning in batch mode usign the -W s command-line
option. Please refer to
http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual021.html for other warnings.

As far as I am concerned, all warnings are turned into errors:)

Hope this helps,
