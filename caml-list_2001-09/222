here #b is a pattern, it is the same as
let h1 (`B as x1) (`C as x2) = `A [x1; x2]



> let h2 (x1 : #b) (x2 : #c) = `A [x1; x2]

but here it is a type expression, and is the same as
let h2 (x1 : [< `B]) (x2 : [< `C]) = `A [x1; x2]

and in a list, all argument must have the same type, tou take the
intersection of both and obtain [ ]
