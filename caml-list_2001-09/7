Subject: [Caml-list] merging .cmxa files?

I apologize if there is an obvious answer to this question somewhere,
but I couldn't find it in the documentation or the archive:

Is there a way to merge two .cmxa files into a single .cmxa file?  I'd
like to combine my library with someone else's to simplify the linking
procedure.
