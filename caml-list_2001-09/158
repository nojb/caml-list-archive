I might subscribe to the newbies list and answer questions myself. The reason
I want a separate newbie list is that I can unsubscribe from it when I get
busy without missing the other discussions and announcements.

Also, I at least might be more inclined to answer newbie questions on a
separate list because such a list would be specifically set up for that
purpose. To be honest, I am a little uncomfortable posting such messages here,
because I know that for most, or at least many, subscribers they are
superfluous, and may be regarded as a nuisance.

Finally, newbie questions often get many similar replies, and partly because
of the delay between posting and bouncing, I don't know that my post won't be
redundant; on a newbie list I might be less worried about that.
