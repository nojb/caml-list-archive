Sorry, should have said 10's of *thousands* of lines.

Please don't get defensive, I'm not meaning to attack you!

You omitted the part of my original email where I said that I honestly
don't know how easy it is to use this through camlp4o.  If it's
trivial (i.e. just add ``-pp camlp4o''), I don't understand why it
won't be the default, and if it's not trivial, I (and several other
people) will be unhappy.

I get the sense, from your apparent upset, that it really is that trivial.

Thanks	../Dave
