There must be a past history, or otherwise you would not be able to implement
function application.

Let's make a distinction between continuations and tail calls. Really, it
sounds like you are only _representing_ continuations in the source language
as tail calls in the target language. So in the target language, the two are
identified, but when you are compiling the source, you know which
continuations are tail-recursive calls in the source language, and which are
only functional returns. In the code you emit, i.e., in the target
language, you can thus distinguish these two types of continuations, and when an
error occurs, traverse the continuations which represent functional returns,
which should eventually lead to the prime mover, the entire program's
continuation.
