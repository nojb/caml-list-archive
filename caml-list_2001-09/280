I looked thru the documentation, but FGL doesn't seem to be any operations
like closures and topological sorting in fgl, it mostly seems to be about
traversing the structure. Have I missed something?

When I look at one of the papers, you get the impression that an imperative
implementation is one to two magnitudes faster, is that right?
(Speed is irrelevant right now for me.)

I ported part of Martin Erwig's Functional Graph Library to OCaml, the
part that uses functional maps as arrays. I used a hacked version of
Jean-Christophe Filliatre's Patricia tree implementation for that. I
haven't yet written the version tree code. If you don't mind its
incomplete state and would like to help complete the port I can wrap it
up and e-mail it to you.

See http://www.cs.orst.edu/~erwig/fgl/ for the original.

You might also consider porting a more imperative library, like the one in
SML for MLRISC, if you are comfortable with SML too. FGL is cool but I'm
not confident that the performance will match a tuned imperative
implementation :-).
