I guess you are using the Format-module, not the Printf-module. The
latter works directly on the stdout buffer, whereas the first maintains a
"pretty-printing buffer" where it can break lines as required.

You can use "print_flush" or "@?" within the format string to flush
things. But be careful: the latter closes all open pretty-printing boxes
as is logically necessary for this operation so better do this only when
all boxes are closed anyway (or you are sure that you want to have them
all closed).

If you don't need automatic line-breaking functionality, the
"Printf"-module is just fine.
