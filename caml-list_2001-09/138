We used phantom types extensively  for exactly this purpose -- a typed
wrapper around a low-level interface. It seems that the trick has been in
use
already in the 80's for ML libraries that accessed sockets (allthough it
didn't
had a sexy name in that time). We tried to describe the general use pattern
in detail in the paper "domain specific embedded compilers" which can be
found at:

http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/pubs.html

We also used phantom types to encode single type inheritance for the
H/direct frame work (described in "calling hell from heaven and heaven from
hell")

All the best,
