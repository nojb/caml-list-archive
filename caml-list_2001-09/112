I have written a little tool that takes a stack trace on stdin,
annotates it with line numbers, and writes the annotated stack trace to
stdout. It also honors #line directives in the source file and thus can
deal with ocamlyacc and the OCaml preprocessor sources (I guess). Here
it is called with a list of directories to search for sources on the
command line. Errors in files that it fails to find the source code for
come out un-annotated. If I had included /usr/local/lib/ocaml in the
list of directories on the command line, the locations in the library
files would have been found, too.

The tool is part of a larger project and not polished for publication.
It comes with a shell script to build it, a man page and a BSD style
license.

Would this be useful for the next release? I could do some polishing if
people think so.
