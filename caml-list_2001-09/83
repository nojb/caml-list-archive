I'll take a stab at it...

Parentheses in OCaml aren't used like they are in function calls in C or
Perl; in OCaml they cause what's in them to be evaluated, as if you were
merely grouping expressions.  Then the druk_ry function gets applied to the
value of the expression in the parentheses, but since that expression...
well, isn't an expression, 'cause maand isn't a function, that doesn't
happen.   Function application happens w/o the parentheses.  So, I think
you want:

druk_ry maand hoofsom rente afbetaal;
