Subject: [Caml-list] ocamldebug any want to print abstract values in functor?

Trying to debug something the other day I ran across the problem
that the bug was occuring inside code in a functor, and I was unable
to print values from the debugger for types that were abstract from
the point of view of that code, even when there was a user printer loaded
for that type in terms of outside code. I didn't manage to get anything
to work by including the print function in the functor argument signature
either - was I missing something there?

Is there any way around this, or does the debugger need an additional
command to print a value using a particular printer? It looks like it
would be relatively easy to add something like that, but it would
be dangerous (not type safe)

PS - I also failed to use camldebug with lablgtk - should I disable
checkpointing? I don't get any uncaught exception backtrace from code
inside C callbacks either -- been working around things to provoke
bugs outside the gui
