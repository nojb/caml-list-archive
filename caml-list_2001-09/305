I'm not very experienced with make, so I've been using Markus Mottl's 
OcamlMakefile in my projects so far.  In one of my projects, I use source 
files from two other small libraries I've written; at present, I just have a 
whole lot of files in my SOURCES and a bunch of symlinks to the proper files 
in the proper directories.  However, I'd really like to be able to improve 
my build process, and I think a good way to do that is to isolate in 
directories the other libraries I've written.

The only catch is that I have no idea how to do so :)  If anyone has any 
examples of multi-directory projects, or projects that come with separate 
libraries they depend on, I would really like to find out how to clean up my 
build process.

Thanks,
Jeremy
