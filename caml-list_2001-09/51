Hi Daniel,

As you may remember, I wrote a fairly complex and big parser (~4000
lines) using the streams [< >]. The story is that I first computed by
hand the EBNF grammar, and then the streams [< >] were of great help
because their syntax is close to the BNF one. This made maintenance
easier too.

As an aside: the performance of my parser was not a concern,
feasability was the main challenge. I nevertheless understand it can
be an important issue. I understood there was a plan to remove the [<
>] from OCaml, and to request users using camlp4, is it correct?

Best regards,


Christian
