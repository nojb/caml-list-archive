It seems to me that the current continuation in a CPS program should
contain the same information as the stack in a stack-based program.
You have the problem of losing information on a tail-call in both
systems, for example.  So you should be able to do as well as a stack
crawl with a "continuation crawl".  Of course, this will depend on the
data structure used to represent continuations, and if you use normal
closures for that, you will be compiler-dependent, but again this is
no worse than the stack-based case.

Or am I missing something ?
