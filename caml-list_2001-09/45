I'd also say that having one distribution for OCaml and Camlp4 would
lead to fewer hassles for developers. Everytime I upgrade OCaml, I have
to upgrade Camlp4, too, because the byte code formats usually become
incompatible.

Nobody will feel hurt by the few extra bytes that Camlp4 adds to the
distribution, even if users don't need it.  The size of the distribution
is really not an argument anymore considering that most internet traffic
probably already consists of multi-megabyte MPEGs and videos, anyway.

CamlIDL could then also be added. I'd say that both of these tools are
so "standard" that they'd deserve a place in the main distribution.
Finally, I'd only have to issue one command then when I want to upgrade
to a new distribution... :-)
