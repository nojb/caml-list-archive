everyone--

I've come to the point where I better start caring about how I will go 
about deploying my software.  My preferred development environment is 
Mac OS X, which already has a convention for deploying software 
applications, bundles and frameworks.  I have no need (or burning 
desire) to deploy on any other platforms.

On the other hand, I see Gerd Stolpmann's findlib tool, and I see this 
is a popular package management system for Ocaml software.  
Unfortunately, it's not obvious to me how best to use findlib on Mac OS 
X.  Of even if that's the right thing to do.

Has anybody given any thought to integrating findlib with the Mac OS X 
framework system?  If so, I'd like to have a back channel discussion 
about what's involved.
