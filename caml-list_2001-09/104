Actually, Matthias gave a very interesting talk on the Babel workshop in
Florence last Saturday where he showed how to encode the complete C type
system in ML (including functions, pointers, constness, bitfields, and
all dark corners - the only bit still missing is varargs), using even
more phantom type trickery. Unfortunately, the paper is not yet
available online, but as his work is part of the new FFI of SML/NJ you
can read about the encoding in its documentation (inside the
ml-nlffi-lib.tgz of the latest working version).

Cheers,

	- Andreas
