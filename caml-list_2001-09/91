I had feared that your working style does not differ so much from the one
most people (including me ;) prefer ... who likes writing documentation
anyway?

It is already a start and does not cost too much time if any major changes
are reflected in the Changelog as soon as they are made so that people
at least know what they can expect. When people experiment with changes,
they can always ask here for advice. Luckily, it seems that the Changelog
has been updated more often and accurately during recent development.
