I've been hacking a bit with SML lately and I notice that a lot of
SML code uses the local <private fundefs> in <public fundefs> end
construct. Do SMLers who like this and wind up writing OCaml use
modules for this? Something like

module SomeDefs : sig
  <public fundecls>
end = struct
  <private fundefs>
  <public fundefs>
end
(* <open or include> SomeDefs, or just use SomeDefs.f ... *)

or is the slight extra verbosity a disincentive?

It seems to me that all of the uses of local in SML can be handled can be
handled by the module system in OCaml, and I don't even find the unsugared
forms to be bad at all.
