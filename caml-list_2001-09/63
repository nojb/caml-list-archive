Thanks Markus.

OK.  But this was just an example.  I wanted to get the usage of
Pcre.replace. Your map-function is fine as long as the replacement and
the pattern has the same length.

I suppose one can write an map function for a case where there
replacement has a different length, but why should I if I can use
pcre?  Maybe I will try some day to get some more insight into ocaml;)
