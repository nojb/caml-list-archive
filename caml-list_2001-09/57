Hi,

I'm currently a master student studying in Canada. I'd like to apply
for PhD in the field of functional programming, particularly ocaml, in
north America.

Does anything know any specific universities, research groups,
professors, conferences... relating to ocaml that I should be aware
of? Specifically, I'm interested in compilation of and system
programming using ocaml.

Anything link or source will help. Thanks in advance.
