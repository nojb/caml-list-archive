The problem is that you have to add pcre.cmxa (or pcre.cma for byte code)
before your /tmp/rex.ml. It's not enough to link against the C-library,
or better: you don't even have to do this.

This should suffice:

  ocamlopt -o rex -I /usr/lib/ocaml/contrib -ccopt \
    -L/usr/lib/ocaml/contrib pcre.cmxa /tmp/rex.ml

I don't know ocamlfind, because I usually use OcamlMakefile for just
about anything. If you want to try the latter, you'd write a Makefile
that might look like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOURCES = rex.ml
RESULT = rex
LIBS = pcre
-include OcamlMakefile
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'd only have to set an environment variable (e.g. either in
the Makefile itself or globally in you .bashrc or similar) named
OCAML_DEFAULT_DIRS, which can be any number of paths that contain your
favourite OCaml-libraries.

I usually define a shell alias that just copies a suitable template of
such a Makefile into the current directory so that I can experiment fast.
OcamlMakefile is somewhere in my home directory and is automatically
loaded if you start make as "make -I {path to generic Makefiles}". The
latter can, again, be aliased.

Once I find a bit more time, I'll explain such small (but
useful!) development speedups on my upcoming OCaml hint page...

Markus Mottl
