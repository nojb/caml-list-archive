I would say these two distribution formats have very different
purposes.  Apple's bundles and packages are most useful for easy
installation of stand-alone applications.  findlib is for managing
libraries that are going to be used by programmers.

I think you should use an Apple-style package if you're distributing
an application targetting the end user (in which case ease of
installation is very important), and a findlib package if your product
is a library to be used by other programmers (in which case reading
the docs and typing a few command lines to a shell prompt is not a big
deal).
