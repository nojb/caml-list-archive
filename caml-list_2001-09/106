It is not exactly sugar since you can express things with local that you
cannot with signatures - but all of them are pretty useless. My personal
opinion is that using modules is preferable even in SML, its local being
an anachronism from the pre-module days, just like abstype. I almost
never use it. It only comes in handy in conjunction with open:

	local open M in
	...
	end

Of course, in OCaml this is solved by having open vs. include.
