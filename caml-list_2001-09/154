A very difficult question indeed: if we do this, the advanced users may
find more time for productive development work, but who would answer
the newbies' questions then? OTOH, it might be very effective to let
the newbies teach themselves in a kind of "caml-cradle". Knowledge
(and lack thereof) is usually distributed so newbies are not unlikely
to solve most basic issues in cooperation.

Since I am always eager to experiment, it might be worth a try to create
special lists for special purposes (like teaching newbies). If things
don't work as intended, we can always merge the lists again.
