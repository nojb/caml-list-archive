Subject: [Caml-list] Use of Fileevent from labltk

I noticed today that labltk includes a Fileevent module and was interested
in testing this to see how well it works.  So far, I have not had much
luck. Registering the same file descriptor for reading/writing events
seems to cause an access violation on NT.

I've submitted a bug report for the access violation but I would like to
know if anyone has any working examples of a simple socket program using
labltk? Cross platform support for both Windows and Unix is crucial.

Thanks,
Patrick
