It's nowhere near done.  I hope to release it next year sometime, maybe end of summer.  It's going to be a small independent game, shareware and possibly RealArcade or another independent distribution mechanism.  The hope is that no end-user will be able to tell it's written in OCaml (unless they look at the credits, where I'll definitely mention it :).
