I would expect this to work... have you installed the executable? The
'fort' executable will need to find the bytecode data for the Fort module
and will search in the OCAMLLIB directory.

Also, inside testsuite.ml you will need to refer to the Fort functions
with a qualified prefix (e.g. Fort.test) or include an 'open Fort;;'
directive at the top.

It may be worthwhile to think about linking Fort into an application, but
there is currently no way to separate the report generation from script
execution.

If you're still having problems, feel free to e-mail me.

Thanks!
