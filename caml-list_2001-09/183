Being a quasi-newbie also, I agree with this sentiment.  I enough people ar=
e out there who would not only benefit from being able to post less complex=
 questions to such a list, but who have also had enough experience to answe=
r a lot of such questions themselves.  Personally, about half the newbie qu=
estions posted here are ones I feel I might be likely to ask, and the other=
 half are ones I feel I could answer.

It also wouldn't take a great number of developer-types to support this lis=
t, since a fair amount of the questions would probably be able to be answer=
ed by a single person who is very experienced in OCaml.  And there are obvi=
ously a lot of helpful people around here. :)

Just my two cents,
Felix Terkhorn
