What is wrong with:

  - Including camlp4 in the standard caml distribution
  - Modifiying the caml compilers to always use camlp4 for preprocessing.

To the user, this fixes the implementation without any modification to
how they use their tools. 

BTW, it has been my impression that the Caml team is not too interested in
external development, so implementing the optimization without camlp4 is
not much of an option.

I'm not allergic to your program, but other people may be.  Until camlp4
is part of the caml distribution, the proposal is still to remove streams. 
For developers who distribute source code, we now have to demand that
another package be installed on the user's system.  Caml will be for the
better when these two tools are merged.
