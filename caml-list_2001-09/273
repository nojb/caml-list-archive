Actually, my thought was to build with cygwin itself at least in the
short term.  The important thing (to me) is the ability to write nice
software and distribute it without the cygwin dll.  It's a bonus too
that ocaml.exe works properly without it too, but the main thing was
the ability to run ocamlopt and get an exe out that you can pass
around easily.  I built with cygwin's gcc (-mno-cygwin), tho.  I think
that it may not be realistic to build ocaml otherwise given that it
uses unix tools to create the prims list, however it can easily be
used without cygwin.

I should've made it more clear that you need cygwin gcc as yet to build.
The important point was that it's possible to get it away from
dependence
on cygwin1.dll...

Good to know it got that far with the mingw compiler by itself.

Sorry, I should've mentioned that I used a small public domain curses
that
was different from the mingw one.  I meant to change that back but
didn't.

It at least needs a little I'm sure...  Even if just to get rid of the
-mno-cygwin part.
