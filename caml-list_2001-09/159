Your experience seems to indicate that we should try out creating a
specific list for newbies. It's probably to the better for all sides:
newbies won't be afraid of joining this list and asking "stupid" questions
(only unasked questions are stupid, IMHO), and more experienced developers
won't get distracted while discussing more hard-core issues.

Though I guess that many people use mail clients with threading
capabilities, it still seems better to have separate lists: this way one
could automatically sort mails from both lists into different folders
and thus prevent cluttering one's inbox (or caml-list inbox). When I
don't have time to answer basic questions, I'd simply not look at the
caml-newbie folder. It's difficult to resist, when all mails go to the
same folder (I am not very disciplined ;) ...
