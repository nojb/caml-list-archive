I have a petty complaint. Another name would have been better, say "parse"
to match "match" since "parser" is a good name for a type and at least in
English there are no good synonyms. If you start writing combinator
parsers you have to hack the keyword parser to be parser_t or _parser or
somesuch, which is a little ugly.

Hey, I said it is a *petty* complaint! ;-)
