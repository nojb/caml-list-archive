I've only seen some of the more bizarre uses (like coding dynamics using
"polymorphic" local exceptions) as stupid pet tricks. But I've read lot's
of SML code that makes heavy use of local to hide function names. I almost
never see an abstype.

Good! Your code should port easily then.

Right, but I assume you know the workaround, since you decribe it in a
followup, and I assume you've read this page

I just wish the author would update the section on localdecs to mention
using modules instead of local open :-)
