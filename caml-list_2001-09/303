The Mac OS X framework system (actually, it's Darwin's framework system) 
is intended for distributing libraries used by programmers.  Apple 
modified the GCC compiler to add support for searching and linking with 
frameworks in a manner somewhat reminiscent of the way findlib does it 
with Ocaml for its own framework system.

I hold to the philosophy that programmers are every bit as intelligent 
as end users.  They ought to be treated like human beings, and with the 
same level of respect.  Ease of use is important to everyone.

Do you think modifying findlib to understand the layout of Mac OS X 
frameworks is too hard, or a bad idea for some other reason?

I haven't looked at the code for findlib yet.  I suppose it could make 
sense to dispense with findlib on Mac OS X and go straight for 
developing a framework search, link and construction system from 
scratch.  But I hate reinventing other people's wheels.

I was hoping to find out if anyone else had given this problem some 
thought before I started in on it.
