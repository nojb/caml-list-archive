Hello,

I want to refresh my OCaml knowledge after
I (again) paused for a while.

I want to know, when certain parts of the code are executed,
for example if I have more than one   let _ =3D ...
statement in my code (for example in different comp0ilaion units each =20
one of them).

I also found an old code snippet with the following parts:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
let fnames =3D List.tl(Array.to_list Sys.argv)

(* some more code *)

let _ =3D
   List.iter print_days_old fnames
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

So, the value fnames contains the args from the command line
and can be used in the first statement of the code.

Is there some documentation on the details of which things
are executed/evaluated at which point of the execution phase
of the program?

I don't want to rely on weak knowledge (because some things I've =20
forgotten... jzst have done C, Python and even Assembler (!) during =20
the last years...
just some snippets of OCaml in that time.)

Ciao,
    Oliver


P.S.: After coming back to OCaml (what I do mostly in privat projects,
       at work it's very unlikely to have the possibility) I'm again
       even more convinced that it is the best language for most problems. :=
)
       And it's so much fun using it. :)
