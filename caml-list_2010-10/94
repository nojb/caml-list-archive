I think it's mostly a question of getting used to the new features of oasis.
Oasis much more things than with a META (configuration, compilation, etc.),
so the downside is that there are more things to specify in a _oasis file
than in a META file.

During my work with various such tools (Makefile, META, etc.), I found out
that I rely strongly on example files that I can copy/paste and
modify/adapt. With time I have accumulated some templates for
Makefile/META/_tags/myocamlbuild.ml covering my basics need, and I know
where to look for more advanced things to imitate. I have not yet
accumulated a comprehensive set of reusable _oasis files (though the
documentation is certainly in the good direction), but I think it's just a
matter of time.


And before OASIS-DB, there should be "oasis bundle", that should do

Certainly I'd be glad to give it a try.
