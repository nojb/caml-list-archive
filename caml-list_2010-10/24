[I'm sorry this isn't really the right place to bring this up, but
since I can't communicate on IRC, there wasn't much alternative]

I've been banned from #ocaml for some time, for no reason that I know
of.  So have some other people.  Can whoever did this un-ban me (and
the others).

18:03 < rwmjones> [I said something here]
18:03 -!- #ocaml Cannot send to channel

Rich.
