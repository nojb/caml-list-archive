Hmhh, a while ago I tried around with menhir, but did not really used it.
I have that in mind for cases, when ocamlyacc would become too annoying,
but at least at the moment I'm fine with ocamlyacc.

I thought menhir is necessary for more complex grammars; don't know if it
helps me here.

As this is used for a private project and I have many things that take my attention,
I would like to only change to other tools, if necessary.

Maybe the separate compilation unit approach would be easier in limited time.

But thanks for the hint.

Ciao,
   Oliver
