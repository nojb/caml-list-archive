Subject: specific ocaml software dependency question

Hi, I want to install Coq 8.3 + CoqIDE on my office's openSUSE Linux
machine (to which I do not have root access).  It depends on camlp5,
which was no problem for me to install in my home directory.  It also
depends on lablgtk2, which our sys-admins have installed on our
machines, but they or openSUSE must have screwed it up because
"dlllablgtk2.so" is nowhere to be found (I've looked), and this causes
my Coq compilation to fail.  I grudgingly decided to try to compile
and install lablgtk2 myself in my home directory, but its "configure"
script fails with the error "Cannot find camlp4o."  So I guess I need
to find camlp4 now, but Google has been of no help -- when you search
for camlp4, you only get pages talking about camlp5 (which, of course,
used to be called camlp4).  This is seeming WAY harder than it should
be.  Can anybody help?
