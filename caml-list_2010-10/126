                           COORDINATION
 13th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

COORDINATION is the premier forum for publishing research results and
experience reports on software technologies for collaboration and
coordination in concurrent and distributed systems.  Its distinctive
feature is the emphasis on high-level abstractions that capture
interaction patterns manifest at all levels of the software
architecture and extending into the realm of the end-user domain.
Social networking, Internet technologies, wireless communication, and
inexpensive multicore processors altered fundamentally the computing
milieu and the way one thinks about the development of modern software
systems.  Coordination techniques seek to enhance our ability to
develop software that is responsive to emerging societal demands and
changing application needs and exploits effectively recent advances in
computing and communication technology.

Coordination 2011 seeks high-quality contributions on the usage,
study, design and implementation of languages, models and techniques
for coordination in distributed, concurrent, and multicore software
systems.  The focus is on languages, formalisms, models, middleware,
patterns, and algorithms that conceptually separate behavior from
interaction.  Research results should demonstrate an ability to
increase modularity, simplify reasoning, and ultimately enhance the
software development process. The conference is concerned with the
design and implementation of models that allow compositional
construction of large-scale concurrent and distributed systems.  Both
practical and foundational perspectives are of interest.  Given the
increasing importance of concurrency and distribution in almost every
domain of our existence, the organizers of Coordination 2011 are keen
to provide a forum for studies that address practical concerns and
industrial grade solutions, e.g., the introduction of concurrency and
distribution concepts to novel domains, comparative evaluations of
programming models on important problems, and the adoption of
domain-specific languages.  Experience reports should describe lessons
learned from the application of proposed models and techniques to
problems in the real world.

* Publication *

Each paper will undergo a thorough process of review and the
conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS series.

* Program Committee Chairs *

Wolfgang De Meuter            Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium
Catalin Roman                 Washington University in Saint Louis, USA

                               DAIS
               11th IFIP International Conference on
         Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

The DAIS conference series addresses all aspects of distributed
applications, including their design, implementation and operation,
the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering
methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and practice
reports. This time we welcome in particular contributions on
architectures, models, technologies and platforms for large scale and
complex distributed applications and services that are related to the
latest trends towards bridging the physical/virtual worlds based on
flexible and versatile service architectures and platforms.

* Publication *

Each paper will undergo a thorough process of review and the
conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS series.

* Program Committee Chairs *

Pascal Felber                 University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland
Romain Rouvoy                 University Lille 1, France

                          FMOODS & FORTE
               13th IFIP International Conference on
     Formal Methods for Open Object-based Distributed Systems
               31th IFIP International Conference on
     FORmal TEchniques for Networked and Distributed Systems

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

The joined conference FMOODS & FORTE is a forum for fundamental
research on theory and applications of distributed systems. The
conference solicits original contributions that advance the science
and technologies for distributed systems, in particular in the areas
of:

  * component- and model-based design
  * object technology, modularity, software adaptation
  * service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid and mobile
    computing
  * software quality, reliability and security

The conference encourages contributions that combine theory and
practice, address problems from the development of distributed
systems, and present novel solutions with formal methods and
theoretical foundations. FMOODS & FORTE covers distributed computing
models and formal specification, testing and verification methods.
The application domains include all kinds of application-level
distributed systems, telecommunication services, Internet, embedded
and real time systems, as well as networking and communication
security and reliability.

Each paper will undergo a thorough process of review and the
conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS series.
