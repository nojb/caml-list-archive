Very nice OCaml extension. It indeed solves my problem. I was aware of private
type, but don't yet know how to use it.

That is perfect. If I add the following call, with your solution:

 (Install.act pkg.plugin_build) []

I get this error:

ocamlc -o test test.ml
File "test.ml", line 84, characters 14-30:
Error: This expression has type [ `Build ] plugin = [ `Build ] * string
       but an expression was expected of type
         [ `Install ] plugin = [ `Install ] * string
       These two variant types have no intersection
make: *** [all] Erreur 2

This is exactly what I want.

Thanks,
