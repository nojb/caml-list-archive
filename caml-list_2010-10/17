I believe it is considered as good practice in F# to use the forward type
operator, only because of visual-studio "intellisense", ie. tab completion
using types information available at write-time.

So suppose you a variable x already typed in your environment, if you write :
$ x |> map (fun elt -> elt.
at this point visual studio can infer the type of elt and show to the
programmer which 'methods' he can call on it.

if you do the normal way, you can't infer the type of elt at write-time.
imho, the impact on style and readability is only a fortunate side-effect
:-)
