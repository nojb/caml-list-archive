Hi Aaron!

If you have ocaml, you should have camlp4 since it's part of the
standard distribution.

For all "manual" installation of common ocaml programs, you should
really look in the direction of godi (http://godi.camlcity.org). You
should be able to install lablgtk2 from here without big difficulties.

Good luck anyways

Alexandre
