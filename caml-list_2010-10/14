Subject: why is the forward pipe operator (>|) so little used?

hi
Reading a few introduction F# articles and presentations I made the
observation that the forward pipe operator is widely popular. Its also
a language feature that, when it comes  up on blogposts or on
stackoverflow, its  presented as a special F# feature.
In the Ocaml world the pipe doesn't have a special place. I doesn't
come up in any of the Ocaml Books (print or pdf) and hardly any
internet articles or blog posts. For example Jon Harrop mentions the
pipe in one of his F# books but not in the Ocaml for Scientists book.
Looking at the mentioned F# code, I think the usage of the pipe has an
( imho positive) impact on the style and the readability of the code.
But obviously the proficient Ocaml folks don't use it - could someone
may explain the reason(s)?
thanks
ben
