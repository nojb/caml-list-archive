I just had this same problem, and after some debugging, realized that
the problem is that over time, as gcc has added in more optimizations
(remember, cl75 was originally using gcc 2.x) life has gotten worse.

So in the Makefile in cl75/src/runtime, change CFLAGS =-O2 $(OPTS) -I.. to

CFLAGS =-O0 $(OPTS) -I..
(That is big-oh zero above, replacing big-oh two)

Then make clean, make configure in cl75/src, make world. Should work.

This fixed it for me. I suspect -O1 would work as well, but who needs
compiler optimizations for performance? :)

I understand that this advice is most like a tad too late to be useful
to you, but there are no solutions out on Google, so I'll try
archiving my solution to this problem.
