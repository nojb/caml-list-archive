          CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                             ICFP 2011
 16th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                      September 19 - 21, 2011
                           Tokyo, Japan
               http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2011

The 16th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Tokyo, Japan on September 19-21,
2011.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2011 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be more informal and focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and be fairly low-cost.  The preference is for one-day events, but
other schedules can also be considered.

NEW THIS YEAR: The workshops are scheduled to occur on September 18
(the day before ICFP) and September 22-24 (the three days after ICFP).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission details
 Deadline for submission:     November 19, 2010
 Notification of acceptance:  December 17, 2010

Prospective organizers of workshops or other co-located events are
invited to submit a completed workshop proposal form in plain text
format to the ICFP 2011 workshop co-chairs (Gabriele Keller and Derek
Dreyer), via email to icfp11-workshops at mpi-sws.org by November 19,
2010.  (For proposals of co-located events other than workshops,
please fill in the workshop proposal form and just leave blank any
sections that do not apply.)  Please note that this is a firm
deadline.

Organizers will be notified if their event proposal is accepted by
December 17, 2010, and if successful, depending on the event, they
will be asked to produce a final report after the event has taken
place that is suitable for publication in SIGPLAN Notices.

The proposal form is available at:
