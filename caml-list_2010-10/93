Have you tried the "revamped" quickstart subcommand. I am trying to make
the creation of _oasis as easy as possible...

If you have any suggestions to help make "lighter", I'll be happy. BTW,
when you say "heavier", is it in term of complexity, of size of the
generated setup.ml or something else?

And before OASIS-DB, there should be "oasis bundle", that should do
exactly what you ask me.

I can try to create an experimental oasis-bundle-0.2.0.tar.gz. Will you
test it?

All this seems quite reasonable. May I ask you to submit feature
requests about this on the BTS?
