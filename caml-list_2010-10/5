Thanks Alexandre!

Well, it appears that, either due to openSUSE or our sys-admins,
camlp4 is actually *not* part of the installation of OCaml 3.11 on our
workstations.

The need for GODI has always baffled me.  There's plenty of OCaml
software available in good system-wide package managers (e.g.,
macports, which I use on OS X), and, at the same time, there are
always going to be *some* packages or software versions that are not
in GODI and so I'll have to end up manually installing those anyway.
If I use GODI too, then there would be at least three different places
my OCaml software might be living, at which point I start getting
confused.

That being said, the OCaml packages on my office machine are
sufficiently screwed up that starting from scratch with GODI may be my
best option in this case.
