I think there is promise in adding such functionality to Batteries'
BatFile module, particularly if we adopt a design similar to that of
Glib's filename support:

* An abstract (or private) type 'filename': on Win32, this is a UTF-8 or
UCS-2 Unicode string; on Unix, it is a string in the locale encoding
(which is the best you can do, unfortunately).
* Functions to convert to UTF-8 and the current locale for printing and
display.
* Idempotent conversion to/from UTF-8 for portable storage.  Glib
implements this with file:/// URLs, so that the non-ASCII characters can
be URL-encoded and thus preserved.
* Conversion from UTF-8 to handle user input, with the caveat that
converting to UTF-8 and back will not necessarily result in the same
filename.

There might be types and definitions in lablgtk2 that we could try to be
compatible with (particularly so you can use the results of a lablgtk2
file chooser as a filename to open).

OTOH, Qt seems to get along using Unicode strings for filenames, so the
encoding issues might not be that big a deal in practice.  The easy path
of just adding UTF-8 file open functions to BatFile (taking BatUTF8.t)
might be OK.
