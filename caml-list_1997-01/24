  I certainly don't want to make a big issue out of it, but the question is
begging to be asked. :) Has anyone ever compared the time performance of
interpreted (O)caml and Java, or (O)caml/Tk and Java+AWT?  I expect no one has
translated a test suite into both languages, but it would be amusing even to
hear informal accounts...
