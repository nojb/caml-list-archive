This is exactly what is possible with LablBrowser for O'Labl !
(Or OCamlBrowser for O'Caml)

You load a file in the editor, typecheck it, and then you can see the
type of any identifier, expression or pattern, by just clicking on it.

If typecheck fails, you can see types for all expressions preceding
the one that caused the error.
