The current model can, inasmuch as you can create a dummy package whose pur=
pose is to express what ">=3D 3.18" actually means for each individual pack=
ager. You can imagine that if you were talking about the Linux kernel, you =
may well have > 4.xx.yy for a stock kernel but a special case of > 3.10.x f=
or RHEL, because the thing you want is backported (obviously a slightly ban=
al example, because you'd never determine a kernel feature by version numbe=
r, but hopefully it serves the point - there are other libraries where you =
might).

The current model can deal with packages A and B neatly, yes - what's not n=
eat is that two separate packages get installed (conf-at-least-gtk-3-18 and=
 conf-at-least-3-20). The build instructions for those two conf packages wo=
uld include Debian-specific strings to test for the -x part. It's definitel=
y not a perfect solution, but your proposal of versioned depexts I think si=
mply moves the trade-off to be considerable complexity in the depext code f=
rom having a relatively small number of these dummy packages.

I'm sorry, I'm still not following the comparison here. Having 1 conf- pack=
age for each depext sounds entirely correct, in terms of the "database" of =
OS-specific package names for that depext.

Indeed - but the user experience is entirely correct to say "we can't insta=
ll conf-gtk3 because you don't have the system libraries for it". It would =
then be correct to say "we can't install conf-at-least-gtk-3-18 because you=
 have GTK3 < 3.18".

Not likely for gtk3, but imagine you were installing lablgtk3, marialablgtk=
3, librelablgtk3 and lablgtk3Org all of which, despite disagreeing with Jac=
ques on how lablgtk3 should run as a project, all definitely agree that the=
y depend on the underlying GTK3 binaries - the conf-gtk3 package gives a mu=
ch better user experience if the GTK3 package is < 3.18 because it's the si=
ngle failure, as opposed to all of them failing individually.

The conf-at-least-gtk-3-18 package would be able to display a very clear op=
am error message explaining the problem as the only error which can occur i=
s that.=20

So provide the two packages in separate opam repositories? Yeouch. The user=
 experience for the -conf version is capable of being slightly clearer, ina=
smuch as on a build error you can be reasonably sure that the error is the =
lack of GTK3, whereas a build error in lablgtk3 could be other things - opa=
m's own error messages (in post-messages) are much clearer to consume than =
trying to read the build output, which is all you'd have in the other case.

If there are 8 distinct depexts, then there should be 8 distinct conf- pack=
ages - I'm sorry if your library is complicated :o)

But look on the other side - these conf packages are only normally updated =
to include package names missing for other distributions - in other words, =
other contributors quietly improving them. It seems to be me that you're an=
ticipating a maintenance burden which won't exist here, and doesn't exist f=
or the conf- packages already in opam-repository.

This is almost entirely separate - at present, Dune doesn't care about conf=
- packages, and you don't need to specify them. Dune also has no knowledge =
of depext, so even in a multi-project tree you're still responsible for ens=
uring that your system libraries are present, not Dune. The work going on i=
n Dune to be able to generate opam files automatically is already aware of =
the need to support them.
