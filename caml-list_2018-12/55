Ah, indeed sorry I was not clear; indeed what I was thinking is about a
model where the os-dependent information is centralized, but not by
using a package, but a proper database of mappings / recipes.

So indeed maybe the core question is whether using "dummy" package for
capturing this is the best abstraction.

Indeed that's a problem; I would say that OPAM could talk about upstream
version, but in some cases that may not be enough. But this is something
the current model cannot do very accurately either, right?

[Like if for example two packages A, B depend on gtk where A needs GTK >=
 3.18-4 and B needs 3.20-2 where -x is the Debian version]

I meant that depexts are not, however the `conf- package is. So if we
need 1 conf- package for each depext that doesn't seem to be a huge
improvement right?

Sure, I was being concerned for user experience with `conf-gtk` where
the package can be installed but the bounds are not the right ones.

Sorry for the bad explanation. I meant to provide them "in parallel",
like I could package lablgtk in this way or in that other way. Both of
them would fail in the same way.

I am still not sure the release workflow is superior: we'd have to
introduce 8 additional conf- packages, and we'd have to maintain the
OS-dependent info in the repos anyways.

I am trying to move all the OCaml software I work on to Dune +
dune-release, thus in the future indeed packages will be maintained
in-tree [by however takes care of the build system]

Best,
E.
