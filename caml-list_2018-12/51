Hi David,

Well, to me it means more like two solutions with different tradeoffs,
and I think the no-conf package solution seems to have a better one
IMVHO.

A kind of "warning light" for me is that none of the packaging systems I
know [admittedly little more than Debian] have this notion of
"conf-package", but rather, packages do depend on what they need.

This approach is well-tested and understood thus I feel more confident
with it, but of course I have a Debian background.

What does this mean in practice? Is there some official policy [such as
the Debian Policy] to follow?

I guess that the dependency on system vs opam packages seems a bit
artificial to me. If a package depends on "foo", it should not matter
much to the declarative package specification where is "foo" coming
from.

I don't see where the duplication is. In one case you do:

depends: [ "conf-gtk3.0" >= ... ]

and in the other

depext: [ "gtk3.0" >= ... ]

Indeed the depext repository should contain a centralized database of
depext mappings.

In Debian-based systems getting a new release of GTK usually involves a
new major OS version; minor upgrades may be possible tho but they are
tricky.

However if the GTK version you want is ABI compatible you can indeed
backport the package without too much trouble, tho something as complex
as GTK is likely to create "suprises".

The thing is then what's the point on having a conf package. It seems
like an unnecessary indirection layer. I'd rather depend on GTK itself,
as this way I get a full automated release/management workflow.

As we discussed in the other thread, conf packages seem to have a very
unpleasant property if coupled with something such as lablgtk; if they
are not 1:1 then a change in lablgtk may require a change in conf-gtk
which may in turn break an unrelated, depending package.

If they are 1:1, then the indirection seems unnecessary [at the package
level]

Well that seems even worse I'd dare to say; more coupling and more
packages is going to be worse, I think.

Having dependencies on depext would be a cool improvement, but that's
not necessary to have today IMHO in order to have a self-contained
lablgtk package.

Removing duplication of dexpext mappings would indeed be an extremely
welcome thing. [I was under the impression that this was already
implemented but I am not sure anymore]

Cheers,
E.
