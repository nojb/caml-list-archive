My opinion is less humble - unnecessary duplication and having to maintain =

This is an apples vs oranges comparison - Debian (i.e. apt) only has to wor=
ry about what apt can install. Imagine instead an apt package which has to =
depend on being able to install a dependency from either yum, nix, brew, ch=
ocolatey, ... oh, and they put your dependency in different combinations of=
 packages *and* use different version systems... oh, and on Windows, opam m=
ay choose to download the C sources for GTK3 and build them (in opam)...

I don't think there's (yet) a formally written down policy - but there is t=
he existence of those conf- packages (i.e. the chameleon principle - "do it=
 like everyone else seems to be doing") and the comments of the maintainers=
 expressing the desire for their use (and occasionally editing packages the=
mselves to do it...)

The solver needs to be aware of the universe of possible versions in order =
to be able to select (more below). It's not artificial - it just depends on=
 how big you want your package universe to be and, rather more importantly,=
 where you get the details of it from.

Your centralized database literally is the conf package - it already exists=
, there's no need for a change. You are proposing replacing the multiple en=
tries in depext filtered by os-distribution with a single entry called gtk3=
.0 and having a central repository which has the os-distribution specific m=
eanings of "gtk3.0" - it's the same thing.

The mistake in what you're describing is *how* it is possible to map a vers=
ion constraint.

This confirms my original suspicion - the conf-gtk3 package should absolute=
ly not be encoding the version test of GTK3, it should simply install it an=
d just have an ultra-simple check that it works (like the other conf packag=
es).

In terms of the versioning problem, opam has two notions for selecting betw=
een different packages - dependency and availability. Availability is thing=
s about your environment (e.g. os, architecture and, prior to opam 2, OCaml=
 version). Availability is a static check, used to eliminate packages from =
consideration by the solver. Dependency is dealt with by the solver, and re=
sults in a choice between multiple *buildable/installable* packages. It mak=
es no sense for conf-gtk3 to have multiple versions of the package (i.e. fo=
r dependency) if you cannot actually install them - this is the problem des=
cribed in the thread, but the conclusion should have been to stop trying to=
 put the version test in conf-gtk3, not accuse conf- packages of being a br=
oken concept.

What is really needed is a hybrid kind of availability test which could ind=
eed be encoded as a version on the depext specification (that version check=
 would still need to be os-dependent). This I know is being considered alre=
ady, but it is quite a large change in the solver architecture, since as fa=
r I can see it either requires multi-stage solving (which is something we'v=
e really tried to avoid in opam) or much deeper querying of the OS package =
manager to get what is available and what could be available. Essentially, =
this would generalise even further the configuration which exists to detect=
 your system OCaml compiler's version.=20

In order to depend on GTK you need a notion, in opam, of what "depend on GT=
K" means, and that notion is OS-, and even distribution-, specific - so it =
gets wrapped in the conf-gtk3 package. We can now say "in opam, to depend o=
n GTK you depend on the conf-gtk3 package", and you no longer have to worry=
 about OSes beyond your own (knowledge).=20

As far as I can see, this is based on an incorrect notion of where lablgtk =
should be detecting the version of GTK which is installed - it should not b=
e encoded in the conf-gtk3 package, as I elaborated below...

Again, I'm not very clear on what about the conf-gtk3 package makes you fee=
l that lablgtk3 then becomes less "self-contained".

Again, duplication of depext mappings is already removed - that's what we u=
