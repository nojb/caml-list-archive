LOCATION

Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital - a city, whose name means `The beloved',
is a great place to visit, although you will not find world renowned
attractions here. Nevertheless, it has history, tradition, style, arts
& culture, an atmosphere that is both Central European and Mediterranean;
many also add the adjectives multilingual and hospitable. Being close to
many of the major sights and attractions of Slovenia, Ljubljana can also be
your starting point to discover the country's diversity.

Ljubljana is situated about halfway between Vienna and Venice. Its
character and appearance have been shaped by diverse cultural influences
and historical events. While in winter it is remarkable for its dreamy
Central European character, it is the relaxed Mediterranean feel that
stands out during summer.

Ljubljana is a picturesque city full of romantic views, with a medieval
castle towering over its historical city centre and a calm river spanned by
a series of beautiful bridges running right through it. It's a city with
a medieval heart, a city of the Baroque and Art Nouveau, with an old castle
resting above it like a sleeping beauty.

In Ljubljana eastern and western cultures met; and the Italian concept of
art combined with the sculptural aesthetics of Central European cathedrals.
The city owes its present appearance partly to Italian baroque and partly
to Art Nouveau, which is the style of the numerous buildings erected
immediately after the earthquake of 1895. 

The central point of interest in Ljubljana is the Ljubljana Castle,
watching over the city from the centrally located castle hill. The
beginnings of the medieval castle go back to the 9th century, although the
castle building is first mentioned only in 1144. It gained its present
image after the earthquake of 1511 and following further renovations at the
beginning of the 17th century. At present, a funicular connects the Old
Town to the castle hill, adding an even more convenient access alternative
to the tourist train.

Ljubljana lies at the centre of Slovenia. In the morning you can visit the
stunningly beautiful Lake Bled, Lake Bohinj or Soca Valley in the high
mountainous region of the Alps, and in the evening enjoy the sunset in one
of the charming little towns on the Adriatic coast. 
It only takes minutes to reach the peaceful and unspoiled countryside of
the city's green surrounding areas, which offer endless opportunities for
hiking, cycling, fishing and horse riding.

We are very excited of the fact that the TSD conference leaves the Czech
Republic for the first time within its 22-year history and that the TSD2019
is going to take place in such a wonderful location as Ljubljana.
