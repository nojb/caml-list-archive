Subject: [Caml-list] Second  CFP: Term and Graph rewriting, special issue of MSCS


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second Call for Papers

    Special Issue of Mathematical Structures in Computer Science (MSCS) on

    "TERM and GRAPH Rewriting"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rewriting techniques constitute a foundational theory of computing
science. They are being investigated for several structures such as
lambda-terms, first-order terms or graphs and have been successfully
used in many areas such as programming languages, automated
reasoning, program verification, security, etc. This is witnessed by
the leading international events ICGT, RTA or TLCA among others.

During the last decade, a particular interest has been devoted to the
study of the impact of shared structures in term and graph rewriting
through the international editions of TERMGRAPH series of workshops.
Sharing is indeed ubiquitous in several research areas, for instance:
the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting by (acyclic or
cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical
abstract machines, the implementation techniques of programming
languages. Term and graph rewriting are also used in automated theorem
proving and symbolic computation systems working on shared
structures...

This special issue is devoted to recent developments in all aspects
of TERM and GRAPH rewriting. This includes (but is not limited to):
term rewriting, graph transformation, proof methods, programming
languages, infinitary rewriting, rewrite strategies, semantics,
properties of rewriting ...
