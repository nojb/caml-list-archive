Subject: [Caml-list] Ad-hoc component system with a plug-in architecture

Hello,

=46rom the arcticle 'OCaml, the ultimate refactoring tool' [1] written by
Yaron Minsky, he writes :

"So, I replaced this ad-hoc component system with a plug-in architecture
where every component registered itself in a uniform way, with a flexible,
type-safe way for the components to communicate."

I am curious to know how you would build such a component system ?

I have tried to use dynlink library but found it difficult to deal with
because of dependencies. I have ended up using cppo as a macroprocessor and
ship various versions of my binary.

Cheers,
R=C3=A9mi
