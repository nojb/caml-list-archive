Batteries works for me under Windows, although it's not heavily tested.  
It's pure ocaml (no C stubs), and the build system is a thin `make` 
wrapper on top of ocamlbuild.

I agree there's a need for a good conversation about what a good 
standard library should be, and am interested in hearing more your point 
of view.
