Subject: Re: [Caml-list] How to fail to install Ocaml in 18 steps

Switching to a different operating system, or running a different
operating system in a virtual machine is NOT the most obvious solution
to normal people (everyone on this mailing list excluded). While I
agree with what Dario says in principle, I am convinced that people
aren't that keen on using Gnome/GTK gui inside Virtual box running on
a Windows 7.

Realistically, there is just no easy way to install Ocaml on Windows
from what I've learned.

With kind regards,

Andrej
