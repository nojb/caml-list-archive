One solution is to put the ocaml toolchain somewhere else and set the
OCAMLLIB environment variable to the new PATH.
While you're at it, you can also use forward-slashes in paths: c:/foo/bar/baz.
This issues mostly happen with shell scripts and not programs which
have been made with greater care (actually they're probably the same
class of bugs as SQL injections).

Hope this helps.
