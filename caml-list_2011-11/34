Thomas, add it to the features list ! ;-)

First, we don't have so many of them, we only put there what we needed
for our set of tools. Some of them are really close to the compiler, and
we might submit them for inclusion in the official distribution, so we
didn't want to add a dependency to Batteries or Core too early.

The other reason is that we haven't tried Batteries or Core enough yet,
we have constraints, and we must make sure that if we rely on the some
library, the library fit these constraints. For example, I know that
Core has not been tested on Windows, and I don't know for Batteries.
Also, we want to separate between "lang" and "system", i.e. modules that
can be implemented with the core language, and modules that have system
dependencies.

Finally, unlike other companies using OCaml, we want to provide support
on the language itself, which means the compilers, other dev tools, and
also basic libraries. So, at some point, we will have to contribute to
either Core or Batteries, or both, but before that, we need to think
more about our own idea of what a good standard library should be, to
choose the best candidate from our point of view.
