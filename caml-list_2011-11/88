Subject: Re: [Caml-list] New GADT iteration

I've added a port "ocaml-devel" to MacPorts that builds the gadt-devel branch (checked out from svn, revision 11273);
so for users of MacPorts you can simply deactivate your current ocaml installation and install ocaml-devel to give it a try.

$> sudo port -f deactivate ocaml
$> sudo port install ocaml-devel 

The ocaml libraries from MacPorts will not accept the development snapshot though.


Best regards

-Markus
