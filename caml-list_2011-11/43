Thanks for all the links.

That's the problem. I tend not to rely too much beyond what is
provided by the standard distribution.

Well I'm really not fond of IDEs. I usually find them very invasive
and bureaucratic and I'm not productive in them. So far emacs is the
only system that works really well for me (it's also an "IDE" that
works everywhere, even in the terminal). But I have to admit that some
IDEs provide features that I would like to have in the emacs modes I
use.

Best,

Daniel
