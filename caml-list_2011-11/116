Subject: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild/ocamlfind weirdness

Hi all,

I'm trying to roll a Debian package (on Ubuntu Lucid) for the latest
version ocaml-cairo which uses ocamlbuild. The debian/rules file,
boiled down to the core commands looks like this:

    ocaml setup.ml -configure --prefix /usr
    ocaml setup.ml -build
    prefix=$(pwd)/debian/tmp/ ocaml setup.ml -install

with the idea that the software is configured to install in /usr
but that is actually gets installed in $(pwd)/debian/tmp/usr from
where it will get pulled into the package.

The problem is that ocamlfind which is not called directly from my
debian/rules file spits out the following error:

    ocamlfind: /usr/local/lib/ocaml/3.11.2/cairo2/cairo.mli:

even though I specified /usr/ as the prefix.

Any clues to get me going in the right direction?

Cheers,
Erik
