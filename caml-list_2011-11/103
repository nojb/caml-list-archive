Subject: Re: [Caml-list] How to fail to install Ocaml in 18 steps

Hello.

> Realistically, there is just no easy way to install Ocaml on Windows
> from what I've learned.

  Can ever exist any easier way than to download a windows
installer, run it, follow the usual "next->next->next->finish"
procedure and use OCaml with findlib, oasis and many
useful libraries contained in the overbld package?

  If this way does exist, can you please tell me, what it is?
Except a strong telepathic desire "I want OCaml
on this windows box, install it somehow!", please.


  (of course, overbld works on unix too, I use it on some
linux distributions that does not provide the packages
I need, and it's easier to maintain a specified set of
software for all OSes I use than to require bugfixes
for all OCaml packages on every platform.
The "real work" requires bugs to be fixed as soon
as possible, and it's easier to fix bugs with simple
patches right now (hour/day), than to talk with all
maintainers of all OS packages/ports (days...),
and then let them talk with upstream (more days...),
then waiting for the upstream fix (weeks...), then
waiting for new package version in OS
(weeks/months...).  Even in the ideal conditions,
it tooks at least 2..10 days, it's unacceptable for
some kinds of OCaml developement.)
