                      SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

               Automated Reasoning and Mathematics:
                 Essays in Memory of William McCune

               Submission Deadline: March 1st, 2012
  <http://profs.sci.univr.it/~bonacina/McCuneBook/McCuneBook.html>


  AIM

  This is a book of collected articles presenting research in
  all aspects of automated reasoning and its applications to
  mathematics to honor the memory of William W. (Bill) McCune
  and contribute to preserving his legacy.

  Bill McCune (http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/) had an enormous
  impact on automated reasoning, especially with the development
  of a series of systems of astounding power, robustness, and
  portability, including the theorem provers Otter, EQP, Prover9,
  the parallel prover ROO, the proof checker Ivy, and the model
  builder MACE, preceded by the prototype SAT-solver ANL-DP.

  Bill McCune applied these systems to solve open problems in
  mathematics and logic, culminating with the fully automated
  solution in 1996 of the Robbins problem that had challenged
  mathematicians for over sixty years. This result brought
  unprecedented visibility to the field of automated deduction.
  For all his achievements, Bill McCune received the Herbrand
  Award in the year 2000 (http://www.cadeinc.org/).


  SCOPE

  We invite high-quality submissions on the general topic of
  automated reasoning and its applications, especially but not
  exclusively in mathematics, with connections to any of
  Bill McCune's research areas:

  * Automated theorem proving
  * Automated model building and constraint solving
  * Implementation of and practice with automated reasoners
  * Algorithmics for automated reasoners: unification,
  matching, rewriting, indexing
  * Inference control, search plans and semantic guidance
  for automated reasoners
  * Proof checking, proof presentation, proof explanation
  * Application of automated reasoners in mathematics,
  logic, combinatory logic, many-valued logic, algebraic
  structures and their axiomatizations, set theory
  * Applications related to formal methods


  PUBLICATION DETAILS

  It is planned that the book will be published as an LNAI Festschrift
  with Springer.


  SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

  While it is expected that most of the papers will be regular
  technical papers, a few papers that combine scientific content
  with recollections of Bill McCune's work and personality,
  as can be written by those who worked with him, are also sought.

  All papers will be refereed by anonymous peer reviewers, and
  read by the editors, according to the highest standards in terms
  of originality, significance, technical quality, and readability.

  Submissions must be in English and standard conforming pdf
  format. They must be unpublished and not submitted for
  publication elsewhere. However, significantly extended versions
  of papers published at conferences are welcome. Submissions
  of any length will be considered, but final versions may be
  limited by the editors depending on the totality of submissions.
  Authors are strongly encouraged to produce their papers in LaTeX.
  Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained
  via http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.
  Electronic submission via EasyChair is open at
  https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=mccunebook2012
  also reachable from the book website.


  SUBMISSION DEADLINE: March 1st, 2012

  In order to facilitate the planning of the book, authors are
  invited to notify the editors as soon as possible of their
  intention to submit with proposed topic and length. Early
  submission would be especially helpful for completing the
  review process sooner.
