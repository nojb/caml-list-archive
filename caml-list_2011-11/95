OcaIDE requires Cygwin? I'm not seeing that anywhere on the OcaIDE page...

So that's one of the pain points that I wanted to alleviate with the 
OCaml installer. I (honestly) think it does solve some problems already 
by making sure ActiveTcl is installed, and by also installing Emacs if 
wanted. I never use Eclipse and I'm more used to the French education 
system where Emacs is somehow advocated because of its caml-mode, which 
explains the stance I took on Emacs.

What would be an ideal experience in your opinion? Have the installer 
prompt the user if he wants to install mingw/msys as well? Please keep 
in  mind that the windows installer (at least the one I provide) will 
remain based on msys/mingw.

Cheers,

jonathan
