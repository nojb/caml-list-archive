It's all pure HTML/CSS. The wonders of the Twitter Bootstrap framework :-)

Thomas also prototyped a searchable version for the CUFP Mirage tutorial:
e.g.: http://www.ocamlpro.com/mirage/xen/ 

but the search view does need some optimisation with a large number of modules, as in the standard library.  The new version he's doing in HTML is far slicker and faster.

Citrix have a really useful JSON output to ocamldoc in the XAPI tree that is very handy for anyone else who wants to do something like this:
