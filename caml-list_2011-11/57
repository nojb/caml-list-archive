Thanks a lot everyone for all the tips and info -- it's working like a charm!


Best regards

More precisely: if there is no or very few common (simple) functions between Ast.statement and Cfg.statement functions, don't bother with polymorphic variants (you can still get rid of the copy pasting by defining your function only on one of the types, and then using translation to the other type to lift your function).
