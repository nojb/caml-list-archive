Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild, ocamldoc and module packs

Hello.

As far as I know ocamldoc doesn't play very well with -pack. There is 
a very old bug on mantis about this.

I'm in a situation that is worst then yours where I use pack to hide
modules with the same name as in ModuleOne/A and ModuleTwo/A and
ocamldoc refuses altogether to generate doc for both modules.  I've not
found a solution neither for my problem, or more in general for the one
you describe below.

I think the good ppl that put Batteries together had similar issues.

If you look at the Batteries source there is a lot of code aimed at
solving this problem by effectively creating new source files that can
be properly digested by ocamldoc. For what I gathered is pretty specific
to their case, but probably you can use it as an example to write an
appropriate ocamldoc plugin.

Maybe the recent release of Argot by XC solves some of these problem
(just a wild guess, I didn't look at it very carefully).

Hope this helps.
