I agree that the name of the module is too big :)

On the other hand, I would advise to be cautious about the fixed width 
thing. I find it quite annoying when a website only uses 1/3 of my 
browser window and the rest is filled with blank space. Sure, if a line 
is too long then it's less readable blablabla. But forcing a fixed width 
is not a good solution in my opinion. Too often have I increased the 
font size, only to find out that either:
- it did not resize the containers as well,
- or the website did not allow font size changes (probably because of 
the above).
In both cases, the user is screwed, especially on small monitors with 
big resolutions. The user should be able to change the font size and use 
as much space as he wants. If you find that lines are too long, just 
resize your window.

Sorry for being off-topic ;)
