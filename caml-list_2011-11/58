Subject: [Caml-list] WST 2012: First Call For Papers

======================================================================
                      First Call for Papers
                            WST 2012
              12th International Workshop on Termination

                Feb 19 - 23, 2012, Obergurgl, Innsbruck
        http://cl-informatik.uibk.ac.at/users/georg/events/wst2012/

======================================================================

The  goal  of  the Workshop  on  Termination  is  to  be a  venue  for
presentation and  discussion of all topics in  and around termination.
In this way,  the workshop tries to bridge  the gaps between different
communities  interested   and  active   in  research  in   and  around
termination.

We will  work very hard to  attain the same friendly  atmosphere as in
past  workshops, which  enabled  fruitful exchanges  leading to  joint
research and subsequent publications.

IMPORTANT DATES:
   * submission     December 18, 2011
   * notification   January  15, 2012
   * final version  January  29, 2012
   * workshop       February 19 - 23, 2012

TOPICS:
The 12th International  Workshop on Termination welcomes contributions
on all aspects of termination and complexity analysis.

Contributions from  the imperative, constraint,  functional, and logic
programming  communities,  and  papers investigating  applications  of
complexity or  termination (for  example in program  transformation or
theorem proving) are particularly welcome.

Areas of interest to the workshop include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      * Termination of programs
      * Termination of rewriting
      * Termination analysis of transition systems
      * Complexity of programs
      * Complexity of rewriting
      * Implicit computational complexity
      * Implementations of termination and complexity analysis methods
      * Certification of termination and complexity proofs
      * Termination orders, well-founded orders, and reduction orders
      * Termination methods for theorem provers
      * Strong and weak normalization of lambda calculi
      * Termination analysis for different language paradigms
      * Challenging termination problems/proofs
      * Applications to program transformation and compilation
      * Other applications of termination methods
      * Comparisons and classification of termination methods
      * Non-termination and loop detection
      * Termination in distributed systems
      * Proof methods for liveness and fairness
      * Well-quasi-order theory
      * Ordinal notations
      * Subrecursive hierarchies

PROGRAM COMMITTEE:
   * Ugo Dal Lago (University of Bologna)
   * Danny De Schreye (K.U. Leuven)
   * Samir Genaim (The Complutense University)
   * Nao Hirokawa (JAIST)
   * Georg Moser (University of Innsbruck, chair)
   * Albert Rubio (Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya)
   * Peter Schneider-Kamp (University of Southern Denmark)
   * Rene Thiemann (University of Innsbruck)

SUBMISSION:
Submissions are short papers/extended abstract which should not exceed
5 pages. There will be no formal reviewing. The accepted papers will
be made available electronically before the workshop.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission page:

      http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wst2012

Final versions should be created using LaTeX and the style file
LIPIcs (http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors.tgz).
