I wrote one a long time ago for the Harmony project. I think the version in the svn has been improved from the one that I wrote. You can find it in the "boneyard/focal/extern/iCalendar" subdirectory of the svn (instructions on how to access it are here: http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~harmony/, in the Download section).

If it does not work, please contact me directly and I'll send you the code I have here.
