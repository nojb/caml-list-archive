That was intended as a joke. Sorry if that's not obvious.

I tried native compilation before releasing the installer. Could you 
tell me precisely what kind of command results in gcc being called with 
-mno-cygwin? Basic native compilation tests (ocamlopt) seemed to work. 
Also, please create an issue at 
https://github.com/protz/ocaml-installer/issues so that I can fix it for 
the next version. Thanks!

Isn't it more of a mingw issue?

As Sylvain said, there's the issue of c:/foo/bar vs /c/foo/bar vs 
c:\foo\bar. One of them always work, it's just hard to know which one :).

I haven't tried this, as I merely tried to provide a bare ocaml. If you 
have suggestions as to how I could make that easier for you *in the 
installer*, I'm all ears :).

Thanks for the feedback,
