You were out of luck.
I tried a windows install some months ago since I had the
opportunity to use a window for some days (was a v7 I guess)
and despite my complete ignorance of this system I managed
to get godi installed in N steps: first cygwin, which I
recalled was the first thing to install on windows, then some
dependencies, then godi. I do not remember the details because
it went quite smoothly.
So, this is not that bad.
Maybe you should give it another try, starting from cygwin?
