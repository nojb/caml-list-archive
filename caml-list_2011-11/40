Well, regarding search by name, I consider that the only advantages upon
browser search are:
   - simultaneous search on several pages;
   - regular expression search (although some browser may support it).

To be clear, I implemented search by type in order to understand a bit
more the book of Roberto Di Cosmo about type isomorphisms. Whether it
can be a useful tool remains to be determined. The tool now exists,
let's see if there is a usage for it.

I do agree that there is often not enough semantics in OCaml types, but
please notice that the order of arguments and whether the function is
currified is not relevant. Indeed, doing type search up to isomorphisms
allows to get rid of these details, all of the following queries will
answer with "String.sub":
   - "int -> int -> string -> string"
   - "string -> (int * int) -> string"
   - "string * int *int -> string"
while the actual signature is "string -> int -> int -> string".
