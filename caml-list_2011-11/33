Hi,

Currently, it generates only raw HTML files. The goal is to be able to browse it locally (it's a bit awkward to have to run a webserver to read documentation).

The searching tools are quite limited currently, I'm just re-using standard JavaScript libraries for auto-completion. I had a quick look at Argot, and if I understand correctly, it is generating data and javascript code to enhance the search. So, I think it is possible integrate both tools nicely.

That's true, we have developed internally some limited extensions to the standard library; that's because we didn't want to have external dependencies for our tools and because the amount of extensions was very small (so it was quicker to write the extensions than to modify an external library) However, we don't plan to release yet-an-other-standard-library, so I guess than we could later participate and switch to more widely-used standard library extensions.
