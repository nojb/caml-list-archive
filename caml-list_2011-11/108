Your singling out of "OS packages/ports" here is misleading. Your whole
paragraph applies to all software distributions as well, be it OS-level,
domain-specific or a single project, and including your own: a user of
your software will be subject to the same frustration that you are
describing here with "OS packages/ports"... even (and I would even say,
especially) if you are upstream.
