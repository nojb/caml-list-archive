This looks very promising.
Will the tool generate mere html files or is it intended for an ocaml
web framework such as ocsigen ?

Also, apparently one cannot search by type. It would be a nice feature
to have.

Last thing, unrelated: from the search box one can see you have many
modules extending the stdlib (the Ocp* modules). Why another stdlib
extension instead of, say, contributing to batteries ?

Thank you very much to make such tools available, though!
