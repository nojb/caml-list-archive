Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Participation: APLAS+CPP

                     CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                           APLAS+CPP
                        Kenting, Taiwan
                     December 4 to 9, 2011


APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas
in topics concerned with programming languages and systems. APLAS is
based in Asia, but is an international forum that serves the worldwide
programming language community.

CPP is a new international forum on theoretical and practical topics
in all areas, including computer science, mathematics, and education,
that consider certification as an essential paradigm for their
work. Certification here means formal, mechanized verification of some
sort, preferably with production of independently checkable
certificates. CPP targets any research promoting formal development of
certified software and proofs.

For the first time, APLAS and CPP will be held together in Kenting,
Taiwan from December 4 to 9, 2011. The six-day event includes two
tutorials, six invited talks, and two conferences. We offer a special
rate for participants who register to both conferences. For the
detailed program of each conference, please go to their respective web
sites:

http://formes.asia/cpp/                           (CPP)

Early Registration (until November 12, 2011)

APLAS only: TWD 16500  |  TWD 13500
CPP only:   TWD 16500  |  TWD 13500

Location

The conferences will be held in Kenting, a seaside resort and national
park in Southern Taiwan. Temperatures in Kenting averaged at 21.4 C in
December 2010 (high: 29.5, low: 14.3). It can be a bit windy, but the
weather probably is the best in Taiwan in December. You can find more
information about the Kenting National Park at Wikipedia and
Wikitravel. The conference venue is Howard Beach Resort Kenting.
