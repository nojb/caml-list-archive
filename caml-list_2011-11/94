I was shocked to learn that you cannot set it so that it only warns
about suspicous files. It actually instists on deleting them! I asked
my student what Norton will do with his Ph.D. dissertation if it is
judged to have too low a reputation, and he just faintly smiled. I
will try to get his boss to buy him a Mac.

With kind regards,
