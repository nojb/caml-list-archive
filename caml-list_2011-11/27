                           COORDINATION
 14th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

As ICT technologies and software-intensive systems are increasingly 
embedded  into the fabric of everyday life, effective coordination 
techniques are needed to enhance our ability to develop software that 
is responsive to emerging societal demands and changing application 
needs, exploits effectively recent advances in computing and 
communication technology, and is capable of adaptive behaviour in the 
short and in the long term. COORDINATION is the premier forum for 
exposing innovating research results and relevant experience reports 
on software technologies for collaboration and coordination in 
concurrent, distributed, and socio-technical systems. Its distinctive 
feature is the emphasis on high-level abstractions that capture 
interaction patterns manifest at all levels of the software architecture 
and extending into the realm of the end-user and social domain.


Coordination 2012 seeks high-quality contributions on the usage, study, 
design and implementation of languages, models and techniques for 
coordination in distributed, concurrent, pervasive, and multicore 
software systems. The focus is on languages, formalisms, models, 
middleware, patterns, and algorithms that conceptually support a proper 
engineering of the interaction dimension. Research paper should 
demonstrate an ability to increase modularity, adaptivity, simplify 
reasoning, and ultimately enhance the software development process and 
its integration into a socio-techical context. Both practical and 
foundational perspectives are of interest.Given the increasing importance 
of coordination models and technologies in almost every domain of our 
existence, the organizers of Coordination 2012 are keen to provide a 
forum for studies that address practical concerns and industrial grade 
solutions, e.g., the introduction of concurrency and distribution 
concepts to novel domains, comparative evaluations of programming models 
on important problems, and the adoption of domain-specific languages. 
Experience reports are thus welcome that describe lessons learned from 
the application of proposed models and techniques to problems in the real 
world.In addition, the conference this year will welcome short "Visions 
in Progress" papers that tries to look far ahead into the future of ICT 
and society to expose innovative - though preliminary - ideas on highly 
innovative models, technologies, or applications, related to coordination 
models/languages/technologies.

* Publication *

All Research and Experience Papers must report on original unpublished 
work and cannot be under review for publication elsewhere. Innovation, 
scientific and technical soundness, and the capability to prove the 
advantages of the proposed techniques, other than their potential for 
applicability, will be the key criteria for evaluating submissions. 
Maximum length: 15 pages.

Visions in Progress papers can report on work that has already been 
presented elsewhere, but the paper in itself must be a new synthesis and 
must clearly outline the motivation for the vision and the path that can 
eventually lead to its realization. Solid motivations, radical innovation, 
capability to look far beyond the state of the art, and feasibility of 
the proposed vision, will be the key criteria for evaluating submissions. 
Maximum length: 5 pages.

All contributions should be submitted electronically as postscript or PDF, 
using the Springer LNCS style, via EasyChair. Submissions exceeding the 
state length will be rejected without reviewing.

Each paper will undergo a thorough evaluation and the conference 
proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. 
Proceedings will be made available at the conference. Submission is a 
firm commitment that at least one of the authors will attend the conference, 
if the paper is accepted.

* Scope *

The joint conference FMOODS & FORTE is a forum for fundamental
research on theory and applications of distributed systems. The
conference solicits original contributions that advance the science
and technologies for distributed systems, with special interest
in the areas of:

* component- and model-based design
* object technology, modularity, software adaptation
* service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid, cloud and mobile
  computing systems
* software quality, reliability, availability, safety and security
* adaptive distributed systems, self-stabilization, self-healing/organizing
* verification, validation, formal analysis and testing of the above

The conference encourages contributions that combine theory and
practice and that exploit formal methods and theoretical foundations
to present novel solutions to problems arising from the development
of distributed systems.  FMOODS & FORTE covers distributed computing
models and formal specification, testing and verification methods.
The application domains include all kinds of application-level
distributed systems, telecommunication services, Internet, embedded
and real time systems, as well as networking and communication
security and reliability.

* Publication *

The FMOODS & FORTE 2012 conference calls for high quality papers presenting
research results and/or application reports related to the research areas 
in conference scope.

Like in the past, the conference proceedings will be published by Springer
in the LNCS Series.  Proceedings will be made available at the conference.

All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication
elsewhere.  Contributions should be submitted electronically in PDF via the
EasyChair system. Each paper will undergo a peer review of at least 3 
anonymous reviewers. The papers must be prepared using the SPRINGER LNCS style.

Research papers, experience reports as well as tool or system description
papers are all encouraged.  Papers must not exceed 15 pages in length,
including figures and references.  For referees' convenience, any 
additional material that may help assessing the merits of the submission 
but not to be included in the final version, like some detailed proofs, 
may be placed in a clearly marked appendix (not to be counted in the 
page limit). Referees can ignore the appendix, and papers must be 
understandable without them.

Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may be rejected
immediately, without review.

    * Rui Oliveira, Universidade do Minho, Portugal (workshops chair)

   
Acceptance is based on an evaluation of the workshop's potential for 
generating useful results, the timeliness and expected interest in the 
topic, the organizer's ability to lead a successful workshop, and 
potential for attracting sufficient number of participants.     
      
* Workshop Publicity *

Workshop publicity is responsibility of the organizers. In particular they 
are responsible for the following items:

   1. A workshop description (200 words) for inclusion on the DisCoTec site.
   2. Hosting and maintaining of web pages either on the DisCoTec website or 
      linked from the DisCoTec site..
   3. Workshop proceedings, if any. If there is enough interest, the 
      organizer of DisCoTec 2012 may contact the editor-in-chief of the 
      Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science 
      (http://info.eptcs.org/) for having a common volume dedicated to the 
      workshops of DisCoTec 2012.
   4. Publicising the event. 
   
* Budget *

DisCoTec will provide registration and organizational support for the 
workshops. Registration fees must be paid for all participants, 
including organizers and invited guests.

To cover lunches, coffee breaks and basic organizational expenses, 
all workshops will be required to charge a minimum participation fee 
(the precise amount is still to be determined). Each workshop may increase 
this fee to cover additional expenses such as publication charges, student 
scholarships, costs for invited speakers, etc. All fees will be collected 
by the DisCoTec organizers as part of the registration, then additional 
funds will be redistributed to the individual workshop organizers.
