Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] PlasmaFS, PlasmaKV, and MapReduce, version 0.5

Hi,

I've just released Plasma-0.5. Plasma consists now of three parts,
namely PlasmaFS, PlasmaKV, and Plasma Map/Reduce:

      * PlasmaFS is a distributed replicating filesystem. Unlike other
        such filesystems, it is transactional and exhibits transactions
        to the user. Also, it implements almost all of what is known as
        POSIX semantics, and it is mountable.
      * PlasmaKV is a key/value database on top of PlasmaFS. It is
        designed for ultra-high read workloads, and offers interesting
        properties borrowed from PlasmaFS (e.g. replication and ACID
        transactions).
      * Plasma Map/reduce implements a variant of the popular
        computation scheme.

The real major change in version 0.5 is the addition of PlasmaKV.
Because PlasmaFS offers a richer API than is normally available from a
filesystem, the implementation of this NoSQL db takes less than 2000
lines of code. Nevertheless, it has properties most other NoSQL db's
cannot fully implement, like complete isolation between readers and
writers (i.e. they do not lock each other out). A description of the
concept can be found here:

http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/dl/plasma-0.5/doc/html/Plasmakv_intro.html

The extremely simple API:

The other major change in version 0.5 is the implementation of parallel
commits in PlasmaFS. A test deployment showed that it is now possible to
get around 500 commits/second.

All pieces of software are bundled together in one download. The
project page with further links is

http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/plasma.html

There is now also a homepage at

http://plasma.camlcity.org

THIS IS NOW A BETA RELEASE! I'm searching for testers. Whoever has
access to a cluster please check Plasma out!

Plasma is installable via GODI for Ocaml 3.12.

For discussions on specifics of Plasma there is a separate mailing list:
