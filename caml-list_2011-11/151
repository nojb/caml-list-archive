  9th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics

       http://www.eprover.org/EVENTS/IWIL-2012.html

The 9th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics will be
held in March 2012 in conjunction with the 18th International
Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and
Reasoning in Merida, Venezuela.

We are looking for contributions describing implementation techniques
for and implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem
provers for various logics, logic programming systems, and related
technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

+ Propositional logic and decision procedures, including SMT
+ First-order and higher order logics
+ Formal foundations for efficient implementation of logics
+ Data structures and algorithms for the efficient representation and
  processing of logical concepts
+ Proof search organization and heuristics for logical reasoning systems
+ Practical constraint handling
+ Reasoning with ontologies
+ Implementation of efficient theorem provers for different logics
+ Implementation of efficient model finders for different logics
+ Implementation of efficient systems for other processes in logic
+ System descriptions of logical reasoning systems
+ Issues of reliability, witness generation, and  witness verification
+ Evaluation and benchmarking of provers and other logic-based systems
+ I/O standards and communication between reasoning systems


We are particularly interested in contributions that help the community to 
understand how to build useful and powerful reasoning systems, and how to 
apply them in practice.

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a position 
statement (2 pages), a short paper (up to 5 pages), or a full paper (up to 
15 pages). Submissions should be made via EasyChair at
  
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwil2012

Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a 
balanced program of high-quality contributions.

Submissions should be in standard-conforming PDF. Final versions will be 
required to be submitted in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class file. 
Proceedings will be published as EasyChair Proceedings.

If number and quality of the submissions warrant it, we plan to produce a 
special issue of a recognized journal on the topic of the workshop.

Important Dates:

  Submission of papers/abstracts:  January 17th, 2012
  Notification of acceptance:      February 13th, 2012
  Camera ready versions due:       February 27th, 2012

Call for submissions:
APS-6
6th International Workshop on Analytic Proof Systems
will be held March 10, 2012 in the context of LPAR-18,
March 10-15, 2012, Merida, Venezuela

Analyticity is a topic that connects foundational issues in logic with 
applications, mainly in automated deduction and analysis of proofs. The 
workshop is primarily intended to enhance awareness for its topic and to 
promote corresponding discussions and contacts between experienced experts 
and younger colleagues.

Topics of Interests include
- Old and new types of analytic calculi: sequent calculi, tableaux, matrix 
  systems, connection method, hypersequents, display calculus, deep 
  inference, ...
- Cut elimination and normalization: new methods, complexity, abstract 
  approaches, ...
- Proof search: modelling proof search, model extraction, disproving, 
  decision procedures, ...
- Relation to other methods: analytic systems and resolution, lambda calculus,
  modal mu calculi, lambda-mu calculus, programming languages, ...
- Extracting information from proofs: extraction of algorithms, constructivity, 
  model construction, Herbrand's theorem, ...
- Proof theoretic semantics and related topics: natural deduction, dialogue 
  games, game semantics, ...
