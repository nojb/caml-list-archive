If so, then my experience is probably irrelevant. But sometimes with
batteries there are "implicit" things. A long time ago I had a problem
which looked similar (output seemed interleaved some strange and very
sparse way). It turned out that the [open_in] function from batteries
was not using the right flags, in particular the "truncate" flag was not
set, so I was only overwriting the beginning of the file, which caused a
problem when a previous and longer version existed. This should have
been corrected now, but as batteries IO are a completely different
implementation, I would check the use of batteries with attention.
