In Async and Lwt I think it quite possible to have this case even if x
was not just giving you a constant value. For example, x could be
read_char (), and if you have buffered input (like Async does, and
probably Lwt) it is quite possible that read_char will be determined
immediately (since there is no need to issue a system call)
