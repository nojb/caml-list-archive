Subject: [Caml-list] CICM 2012: Call for workshops

   CICM 2012 - Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
           July 9-13, 2012 at Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany

           http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/cicm2012/

                 Call for Workshop Proposals
----------------------------------------------------

As computers and communications technology advance, greater
opportunities arise for intelligent mathematical computation. While
computer algebra, automated deduction, mathematical publishing and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we are now seeing increasing opportunities for synergy among these
areas.

Workshop proposals for CICM 2012 are solicited. Both well-established
workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.

Please provide the following information:

   + Workshop title.
   + Names and affiliations of organizers.
   + Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.
   + Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days is  
possible).
   + If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference
     affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new,  
please
     indicate so.

CICM conference fees will be levied on a per-day basis, so that
workshop-only participation is possible. The CICM organizers plan to
make available a small amount towards partial reimbursement for travel
expenses of invited speakers. Also, CICM will take care of printing
and distributing informal proceedings for workshops that would like
this service.

All proposals should be sent via email to m.kohlhase@jacobs-university.de
for consideration by the CICM 2012 organizers:

Serge Autexier (DFKI Bremen): General Co-Chair
Michael Kohlhase (Jacobs University): General Co-Chair
Johan Jeuring (Utrecht University): Program Chair

Important dates:
  Deadline for proposal submissions:			December 7.  2012
  Acceptance/rejection notification:			January 7, 2012
  Workshop dates:					July 9-13, 2012
