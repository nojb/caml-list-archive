Did you mean to say "Lwt interleaves when possible"?

For example

let foo () =
    let r = x >>= bar in
    ....
     r

in Async [bar] will run only after [foo] has completed (therefore
there is no interleaving between [foo] and [bar]), while in Lwt [bar]
can run in the middle of [foo] so there is an interleaving
