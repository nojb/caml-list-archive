Subject: [Caml-list] [Debian users] interested in taking care of ocaml-mysql ?

Hi,

so far I've used ocaml-mysql v1.0.4
(http://raevnos.pennmush.org/code/ocaml-mysql/), it has been brought
to my attention that there is a v1.1.0
(http://ocaml-mysql.forge.ocamlcore.org/).

I've asked the Debian maintainers if they could consider upgrading
from 1.0.4 to this 1.1.0 and apparently they don't have much time to
take care of this and are looking for a volunteer. I don't have the
required time either but I figured it's worth asking the OCaml
community since there are quite a lot of Debian users.

Anyone interested ?
