This is indeed intended behavior, which is unfortunately not yet
well-documented.  The library used to generate code with hard-coded
module paths to the standard conversion functions.  This made it hard
to override them.  The new library therefore requires you to "open
Sexplib.Std" (not Sexplib.Conv btw.) if you are happy with all
standard converters.  The effort is minimal, makes it explicit what
conversion functions are being used, and overriding is as easy as
(automatic) rebinding.

Markus
