Subject: [Caml-list] Bug in sexplib 7.0.4?

I'm trying to build code against sexplib 7.0.4, and the code emitted by
the syntax extension has unqualified references to the base converters
like sexp_of_list and int_of_sexp. The result is that the sexplib-using
code fails to compile with undefined references. I've found this trying
to rebuild rpmdepsize, and also with some test code I have.

Is this a bug in 7.0.4, or are there source-level changes required to
build against recent versions of sexplib? It feels more like a bug to
me, as I shouldn't need to open a module like Sexplib.Conv to make the
generated code work.
