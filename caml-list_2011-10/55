Subject: [Caml-list] PEPM'12 Deadline Extension


Apologies for multiple postings of this announcement.

PEPM'12 - DEADLINE EXTENSION

Due to a number of requests for extensions, the deadline for submission to PEPM'12 has been extended until 23:59 GMT on Sunday 16 October. We would like to remind you about three aspects of PEPM. 

Journal Special Issue

There will be a journal special issue for PEPM'12. PEPM'09 has already appeared in Higher-order and Symbolic Computation (HOSC, online-first edition this year), and the special issue based on PEPM'10 papers has just been delivered to the HOSC editorial team.

Short papers

We're looking for short papers (up to 4pp) and tool papers as well as full research papers. All categories of papers will appear in the formal ACM proceedings. 

Tool papers

The main purpose of a tool paper is to display other researchers in the PEPM community a completed, robust and well-documented tool; more guidance on the format and expected contact is given on the PEPM 2012 web site.

In contrast with regular PEPM submissions, PEPM tool demo papers may include work that has been published elsewhere. In the ideal case, the technical foundations of the tool will have been published previously, and the submitted PEPM tool paper will report on follow-on work that has produced a robust tool that has been applied to interesting examples. The PEPM program committee will consider accepting tool demo papers that describe tools that have been presented at other conferences/ workshops if these conferences/ workshops belong to a different community (the authors should acknowledge the previous demos and justify the benefits of presenting the tool again for the PEPM audience).


Call For Papers

ACM SIGPLAN 2012 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
January 23-24, 2012. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA (co-located with POPL'12)

http://www.program-transformation.org/PEPM12

Paper submission deadline: Sunday, October 16, 2011, 23:59, GMT

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the broad area of program transformation,
which spans from refactoring, partial evaluation, supercompilation,
fusion and other metaprogramming to model-driven development, program
analyses including termination, inductive programming, program
generation and applications of machine learning and probabilistic
search. PEPM focuses on techniques, supporting theory, tools, and
applications of the analysis and manipulation of programs. Each
technique or tool of program manipulation should have a clear,
although perhaps informal, statement of desired properties, along with
an argument how these properties could be achieved.

Topics of interest for PEPM'12 include, but are not limited to:

- Program and model manipulation techniques such as:
 supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program 
 adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, 
 symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

- Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
 manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination
 checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, 
 automated testing and test case generation.

- Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
 metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
 languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged
 computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.

- Application of the above techniques including case studies of
 program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
 projects and software development processes,  descriptions of
 robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
 benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy
 program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, 
 visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, 
 middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and 
 web-based applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will
continue the category of `short papers' for tool demonstrations and
for presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of
interesting academic, industrial and open-source applications that are
new or unfamiliar.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant to
help cover travel expenses and other support.

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal
proceedings published by ACM Press and will be included in the ACM Digital
Library. Selected papers may later on be invited for a journal special
issue dedicated to PEPM'12.


Submission Categories and Guidelines

Authors are strongly encouraged to consult the advice for authoring
research papers and tool papers before submitting. The PC Chairs
welcome any inquiries about the authoring advice.

Regular research papers must not exceed 10 pages in ACM Proceedings
style.  Short papers are up to 4 pages in ACM Proceedings
style. Authors of tool demonstration proposals are expected to present
a live demonstration of the described tool at the workshop (tool
papers should include an additional appendix of up to 6 extra pages
giving the outline, screenshots, examples, etc.  to indicate the
content of the proposed live demo at the workshop).
