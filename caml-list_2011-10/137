Subject: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild circular dependencies

Hi.

I have some weird circular dependencies build issue using ocamlbuild.
Something like:

Circular dependencies: "A.cmo" already seen in
  [ "A/C.cmi"; "A.cmo"; "B/D.cmo" ]

I haven't been able to trim it down to a simpler reproducible example.
How are circular dependencies determined and how are dependency
information managed inside the _build/ folder?

More specifically, A and B are module packs (for-pack tag in _tags) and
I do not see a .depends file for the top pack module, so I'd like to
know where this information is kept.
