I looked, and sure enough there was some old code that was writing the
same file earlier in the program's execution, and it never closed the
channel when it was done. Removing that other code fixed the problem.
So even though the writing was never interleaved, I presume the
buffering of the two channels interfered with each other and caused
the problems I was seeing in the output. Thank you!
