Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] FPish - bridging FP communities

Hi everyone,
 
FPish (http://fpish.net) is a brand new community site for functional
programmers, just launched this week with over 1500 users and growing
fast.  It aims to provide a wealth of information, and to collect and make
easily searchable any FP events (conferences, webcasts, trainings, etc.),
courses, blogs, user groups, companies, developers, jobs, questions and
answers, basically everything we functional programmers and those who are
looking to become functional programmers might be interested in.  There
are a ton of additional features in development - professional networking,
a fast blog engine, community trends based on tweets and blogs, a jobs and
careers section, just to name a few - these are rolled out continually.
 
We have just started to populate the event and group catalogs, and are now
inviting all of you to contribute what you can.  In particular, we are
inviting you to use FPish to share content in the forums (under Answers)
that might help others learning OCaml.	Feel free to post your projects,
or share what you are working on, or simply ask or answer questions -
anything you contribute will help someone.  Be sure to tag your content
with "OCaml" (case insensitive) and any other tag you may find appropriate
- so that others can find it more easily.  Doing so will ensure that your
contributions show up in the OCaml "zone" - basically, a subspace of FPish
dedicated to OCaml.
 
Once you register, you can not only post forum content, you can also
create OCaml user groups that others can join or follow (a good
alternative to meetup.com), organize events such as webcasts or meetups
(you can soon be able to charge and collect money for them too if you need
sponsorship), add and manage conferences (with everything from talk
proposals to adding/scheduling speakers and talks), and add your companies
(with a bit of manual help from us) to gain more visibility.  You can also
create your developer profile, and others will be able to find you under
Developers - this is a brand new feature just released.
 
If you would like to get involved as a FPish OCaml community leader or
moderator please drop me a message directly.  Community leaders shape the
public facing of their communities, and have complete control over the
markup on the OCaml zone (and can use building blocks such as forums,
event listings, etc.) and are in charge of reflecting all the happenings
(events, groups, conferences, etc.) in the community.
 
Your comments and ideas are very welcome.  There will also be an API
available shortly for doing searches and adding new content.  One
intriguing project would be to catalog the full caml-list archives, making
it readily searchable and accessible via the API - anyone interested in
helping out please get in touch.
 
Thanks,
Adam.
