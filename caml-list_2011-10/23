I sincerely believe the article makes some great points.

I would like to do more with OCaml, but I must admit the lack of well
written books available for OCaml has limited the amount of time I've worked
with it. I know that I can expand my knowledge base in Scala and Haskell
quite easily with many great books, but the only book listed in Amazon has
poor reviews.

If a great OCaml guru/teacher wrote a great book, I'm sure it would have
great sales on Amazon (I'd buy it :)
