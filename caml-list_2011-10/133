It's an excellent question, and one I don't yet have a good feel for.  It
would be great to find some kind of modus vivendi which would allow the
libraries to interoperate.

For now, it hasn't been too big of an issus, since the external libraries
we've needed haven't been Lwt-based.  But it would be nice to solve the
problem nonetheless.
