Subject: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild -where on MinGW of Win7 gives wrong path

Hi,

we are trying to get our project compiled with ocaml3.11 under MinGW +
Windows7.

I noticed this is a known bug with ocaml3.10. and according to this

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=4575

it's fixed last year.

but we still have the same problem here, maybe it's a Windows7 issue?
