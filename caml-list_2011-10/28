The inefficiency is in the code translating the semantic value back
into the expression type, not in the evaluation code.
Feel free to add the few lines needed to spot that corner case and
behave accordingly, as I did for the initialization of the sum (to
avoid "+ 0" everywhere).
Note that this doesn't stop the simplification to be involutive, so
still a valid simplification/normalization; whether the normal form
actually respects our sense of "optimality" is a different question.
