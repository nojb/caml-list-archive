I admit to a certain amount of ambivalence to releasing Yet Another Monadic
Concurrency library.  (I don't think Equeue is in quite the same category,
since it has such a different style of interface.)  But I think we had good
reasons for creating Async.  As I said in my blog post, the differences in
error-handling and interleaving policy were enough that we really felt we
needed a different library.

And now that we've created it, there are multiple reasons to release it.
 For one thing, we want it for out own open-source projects outside of the
office!  And it's a precondition for us for releasing other software that
we've developed internally that depends on Async.

As an aside, we use lots of OCaml libraries developed outside our walls:
RES, PCRE, Lacaml, Postgres bindings and OUnit and xml-light, to name some
off the top of my head.
