Thanks for all the responses. The problem turned out to be the simple one
mentioned by Philippe. I just forgot to install PG'Ocaml. It would be nice
if findlib could give error messages about missing packages that are clearly
in the dependency list.

I got this problem a few days ago, and need a quick fix.<br>
Everything was installed but after an upgrade I got the same kind of error.=
<br>
To avoid the problem, i drop the &quot;-syntax&quot; parameter and replace =
it with &quot;-pp&quot; :<br>

What *should* work for me : ocamlfind ocamlc -package js_of_ocaml -syntax c=
