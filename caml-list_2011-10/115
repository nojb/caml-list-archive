I don't think you need that, because you can load compiled OCaml code
dynamically (look into the Dynlink library). This works with both
bytecode and native code (in recent OCaml versions). This way you just
invoke the compiler via the normal ocamlc or ocamlopt executable, and
you don't need to change the compiler (for which you would need the
license).

If you prefer to include the OCaml compiler directly into your
"interpreter", you probably get only a very small speedup when "loading"
code (the overhead of spawning a new process is small). This is IMO only
worth it if you load code very frequently.
