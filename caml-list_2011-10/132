Have you ever seen this outside of using ptrace/strace? If it actually
leaks to userspace when not used on inside those, that would break a lot
of other applications.

Anyhow, directly checking the number is bad for portability reasons as the
ERESTARTNOHAND is a Linux-ism. I'm taking a shot at porting Core/Async to
OpenBSD at the moment, so will patch out that check in our local changes).
