Subject: [Caml-list] Standalone executable

Dear all,

For some days now, I was searching to see if there is any way you can build
an executable from an OCaml project, that can later be run from another
machine that doesn't have OCaml installed on (not even the runtime system).
Same type of Unix based OS, though.

Thanks,
Andreea
