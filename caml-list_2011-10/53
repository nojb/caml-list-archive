Dear all,

We are glad to announce a new major release of the static analysis tool
Frama-C, namely Nitrogen-20111001. Frama-C is fully written in OCaml. You
can write your own plug-in in OCaml too.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
DOWNLOAD
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

You can download the release at http://frama-c.com/download.html .

For now, there is a source tar-ball distribution without the Jessie plug-in,
but including the WP plug-in. Binary versions will be released as soon as
possible. A new version of Why which includes the Jessie plug-in will
shortly be released separately by Inria and will be compatible with Frama-C
Nitrogen.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
MAIN CHANGES
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This new major version includes too many bug fixes and improvements to list
here: the detailed list is available at http://frama-c.com/Changelog.html .

Major improvements benefit:
- Value Analysis plug-in
- PDG plug-in and its derivatives (Slicing, Impact, Scope, Sparecode)
- Aora=EF plug-in
- the GUI
- kernel property statuses

For plug-in developers: this major release changes several Frama-C APIs in
an incompatible way. A subset of the plug-in side changes can automatically
be applied by using the script bin/carbon2nitrogen.sh of the source
distribution. Complex plug-ins should be reviewed for compatibility.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
ENJOY!
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Enjoy this release and do not hesitate to report any issue and/or successes
with this version through the usual channels, listed at
http://frama-c.com/support.html .

Have fun with Frama-C,
Julien Signoles
