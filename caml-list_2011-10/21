Subject: [Caml-list] 'OCaml For the Masses' on Slashdot

Dear caml-list,

I've just noticed that a recent paper by Yaron Minksy "Why the next 
language you learn should be functional" is discussed on Slashdot, in a 
story called "OCaml For the Masses". That's great! And it's probably a 
good time to make some buzz about OCaml there:
