Subject: [Caml-list] Call for IJCAR 2012 Satellite Events

Call for IJCAR 2012 Satellite Events
------------------------------------

The 6th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR 2012) will
be held in Manchester, UK, from June 26th to July 1st, 2012. Satellite events 
such as workshops and tutorials will take place on June 30th and July 1st. 
Competitions may take place also during the main conference.

IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics in automated 
reasoning. IJCAR 2012 is a merger of leading events in automated reasoning:
-  CADE (International Conference on Automated Deduction)
-  FroCoS (International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems)
-  FTP (International Workshop on First-order Theorem Proving)
-  TABLEAUX (International Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic 
   Tableaux and Related Methods)

Workshop, tutorial, and competition proposals on IJCAR-related topics are 
solicited. Proposals that promise to bring new topics of practical or 
theoretical importance into IJCAR, or provide a forum for more detailed 
discussion on central topics of continuing importance, are welcome. Proposals 
that close the gap between automated reasoning and related areas, e.g., formal 
methods or software engineering, are especially encouraged.

Proposals must contain information sufficient to judge the importance, quality 
and community interest in the proposed topic. Each satellite event must have 
one or more designated organizers, and may have a programme committee as well. 
An international composition of the organization team is particularly 
encouraged. Events are strongly encouraged to find external financial support. 
This will be wholly their responsibility. 

The organizers of successful workshops will be responsible for their own 
reviewing process, for publicity (e.g., website), and for publishing electronic
proceedings (e.g., on the CEUR-WS website). In addition to that, joint 
proceedings for IJCAR and all workshops will be made available to all 
participants on a USB stick. Since the joint proceedings will be assembled via 
EasyChair, workshop organisers are encouraged to use EasyChair for their 
submission process. Satellite event organisers will be required to closely 
cooperate with the Satellite Events Chairs and the IJCAR 2012 local organizers 
to finalize all details.

Proposals must be limited to three pages and consist of two parts:
1) A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance,       and the particular benefits of the event to the community. A list of 
   previous or related events, with URLs and submission/acceptance/attendance 
   counts should be included if relevant. 
2) The organizational part must include:
   + Title
   + Intended audience. (From which areas do you expect potential participants 
     to come? How many participants do you expect?)
   + Expected duration (for workshops and tutorials: duration from half a day 
     to two days)
   + For workshops and tutorials: indicate preferred dates (June 30th, 
     July 1st, or both)
   + Organization of the event. (Describe the intended format and schedule, 
     talks, demo sessions, tutorials, running time of the competition, etc. 
     as applicable.)
   + Any special technical or AV needs, 
   + Potential invited speakers (if applicable)
   + Plans for dissemination, if any (for example, special issues of journals)
   + Organizers' affiliations, backgrounds and contact details (email, etc.)

Proposals should be submitted electronically to EasyChair at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijcar2012se
