Mmm, ...

Is there really much people using the .opt compilers ? Does it really make
sense to have them packaged ?

I myself was considering splitting them of into a separate debian package,
since they are big, and most probably not used that much.

I could also simply disable the building of them, but am afraid someone will
need them in the future.
