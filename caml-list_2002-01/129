Sorry, I cannot resist commenting on that particular statement, because
it still seems to be such a frighteningly common misconception.

This statement confuses two issues: portability and availability. C
certainly is available on pretty much every system. But this says
nothing about portability of C code - C and C++ are definitely among the
least portable languages in use today. There effectively is no
non-trivial C program that is portable according to the language
standard (ie. does not explore undefined/unspecified behaviour one way
or the other - most times you are not even aware).

This is in stark contrast to high-level languages like OCaml, which are
clearly not as widely available, but which have mostly
system-independent and fully specified semantics[*]. So portability
rates very high.

Best regards,

	- Andreas

[*] Not completely true for OCaml - consider eg. evaluation order - but
still a vanishingly small issue compared to C.
