Easy: let the program run until it stops on the exception, then use the
"backstep" command to go back in time to the point where the exception
is raised; then do a "backtrace" command to see where you are.

In OCaml 3.04, you can also run the program outside of the debugger
and request a stack backtrace (set the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment
variable to "b").
