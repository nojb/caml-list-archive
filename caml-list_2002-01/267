Why not. I'd need to look at findlib. I should have some time free in a
few months (famous last words ;-)

It's true the cdk needs some way to do package management.

If you're talking about a tool that might use the cdk, it's easy (that's
active dvi case). If you're talking about a library that might be
integrated in the cdk, then I think this is related to the package
management issue, and it's a more difficult problem.
