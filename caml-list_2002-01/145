I've been learning how to use Ocaml for writing scripts, and I've
encountered a small problem.

By "scripts", I mean they have the canonical custom toplevel in the
interpreter line.  They also dynamically load libs.

I had updated one lib and not another that depended on it, so I got a
message like so, to stdout:

 File /usr/local/lib/ocaml/contrib/fs_lib.cma is not up-to-date with respect to
 interface Pcre

The problem was that I piped my ocaml script's output to a file that
was supposed to just contain data, and then I graphed it, so the error
message showed up in a graph, which was kind of funny but not what I
expected. I use pipes and filters a lot, so this could really put a
wrench in my plans.

Anyway, it would be like, cool, if I could get those errors going to
stderr instead, or be enlightened as to the error of my ways. Thanks.

cheers,
doug
