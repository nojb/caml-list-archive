Not sure if this is the kind of game you're thinking about, but I
wrote a couple of card games to teach myself labltk.  (I've since
switched to lablgtk for most things, but it seemed more accessible at
the time.)  One is a blackjack program that's pretty usable; the other
is a set of programs for one small aspect of poker (identifying best
hands in Hold'Em and Omaha).  Let me know off-list if you want the
code, or more info.
