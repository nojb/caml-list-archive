Hello !
I'm having theses functions :

external set_window_data : wnd:hwnd -> 'a -> unit = "set_window_data"
external get_window_data : wnd:hwnd -> 'a = "get_window_data"

I know that's very type-unsafe and all, but i really need the user to be
able to put any kind of data into it. If you got another idea, please let me
know.

BTW, then with my handle i'm doing that :
    (set_window_data wnd 0);
    (print_int (get_window_data wnd));

but it raises (about the call the get_window_data ) :
    This expression has type wnd:hwnd -> 'a but is here used with type int

I've tried to "force" the return value to int but it doesn't seems to work.
Any help welcomed.

Warp
