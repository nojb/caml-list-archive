An usual trick  is to make the bytecode file
start with

#! /path_to_my_mach_type_dispatcher /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun

Executing the file will make the system execute:
"my_mach_type_dispatcher /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun bytecode-file-name"

my_mach_type_dispatcher can be a script as simple as:
#! /bin/sh
$1.$MACHTYPE $2

Another trick is to make each /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun.$MACHTYPE
be a symbol link to a script:
$0.$MACHTYPE $@
