I can add a symlink then, if it is agreable.

Well, but people will look there.

I will have to patch the documentation then, or better yet add a note about

I will add a symlink in the next version of the package.

but will break all those #include <caml/xxx.h> :)))

5BTW, i agree, there are lot of caml left around in the ocaml distribution and

Okay, i appreciate, i maybe don't all the time see things as fully as i
