Even having been shown a fool, I have to disagree with both. :-)

The real root of the inconvenience is that the compiler treats -i runs
as normal compilations with just a silly side task to take care of.

Instead, it should just switch to a mode where generating the
interface is the _only_ thing it does, and overwrite an existing .mli
file if necessary (let user beware).
