A few years ago, François Pessaux wrote two impressive 3D rendering
engines (of the kind found in first-person shooter games) in OCaml:

http://guinness.cs.stevens-tech.edu/~fpessaux/

The first one (OCamlDoom) is entirely software-based and renders
"2.5D" scenes as found in Doom.  The second one (OCamlQuake) is full
3D and exploits hardware acceleration via the Glide library.  Both
deliver very decent frame rates.
