Nope.  It's just that the "conventional wisdom" is that GC will hurt performance, so I'm worried just on principle. :)  I haven't seen any indication that it will yet, however.

As the other poster said, doing full collections between levels seems like a reasonable thing to try.

I'm also slightly worried about the "write barrier" thing, which I've seen posted about but don't fully understand yet.  To avoid GC activity I may want to keep some arrays around and reuse them, but apparently as they migrate into the old heap then you get the write barrier thing going on.  Hopefully this won't be a problem either, but I don't know yet (I don't know if I understand it correctly yet, either).

Lots of fun adventures on the horizon, I'm sure...just hopefully no show-stoppers. ;)

Chris
