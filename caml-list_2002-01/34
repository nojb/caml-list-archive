Hello
I'm trying to dynamicly link a  .cma library which contains externals
references to a DLL.
I'm setting (Dynlink.allow_unsafe_modules true) but it keeps me raise :

error while linking mylib.cma.
The external function '...' is not available.

Although this function is available in the dll, it seems that Dynlink
doesn't manage to load it.
How can I do that ( tip : It's for plugin loading, so I don't want to have
any ref to the DLL into my main build process )

Warp
