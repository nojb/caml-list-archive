Hi,

I am debugging a large OCaml program and am stuck with an exception. The
exception is thrown by a utility function that is invoked several times in
the program. I want to know which invocation of the utility function
throws the exception. I cannot keep a breakpoint inside the utility
function because it is called several times in the program.

Is it possible to make the ocaml debugger stop at the invocation where the
exception is being thrown?

Are there other ways to accomplish the above objective?

Thanks,
Magesh
