I occasionally use them for larger projects - typically noticing a
compilation speed imrovement of about 50-100%.

I've also been trying to represent a DOM like interface in Caml lately
which really benefits from using the .opt compiler.  There are a large
number of cyclic class types and the typechecking can take a bit of time
so I notice substantial improvements with the .opt compilers (more in the
range of 5x or so as a guess).
