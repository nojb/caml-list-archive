Just curious and wondering if anyone is doing (or has links to) games 
coded with OCaml...  looking to get some opinions on overall structure 
and/or feelings as to how well it is working for that.

(I am also reminded, having seen another email by Chris Hecker, that he 
mentioned something along these lines at his talk at the last Game 
Developers Conference.)

I am once again learning good 'ol ML language from college days, and 
thought it might prove an interesting way to implement a game idea I 
have (my idea requires little to no graphics, but IIRC there is a 
ocaml-GL binding somehere).
