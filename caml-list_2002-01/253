Thus. That's the directory where ocaml has installed its library files (It
is bound to CAMLDIR in Makefile.config of advi).  Thus, ocaml should have
copied the files (mlvalues.h, alloc.h, etc.)  in the subdirectory
$CAMLDIR/caml.

These are certainly fatal errors. 
Can you check that the files mlvalues.h, alloc.h fail.h are really in

        /usr/lib/ocaml/caml/

If not, there might be a problem with the ocaml installation.
Otherwise try the simpler command:

        ggc  -I/usr/lib/ocaml/caml -c events.c

on its own.
