Yes, I do recall that. Birkhoff and Mac Lane, among others, discuss it. 
Perhaps he did something a bit different from what I thought. Or, perhaps 
it is a tragedy. The publisher was small and maybe his work was not 
properly reviewed. I just checked and his book title wasn't in my pocket 
computer.

It is also worth remembering that Minsky killed early research into neural 
networks. He proved, correctly, that a (single layer, as it turned out) NN 
could not execute an XOR instruction. His proof turned out to be almost 
irrelevant, because multi-layer NNs can perform XORs.

All sets taken together do not form a set. However, in VGB set theory, they 
do form a class and can be discussed as such. It just seems less nihilistic 
to me.

Thanks for reminding me.

Best,

Byron
