I agree with you , the CDK needs to be more modular, and to use
ocamldoc. I don't know for findlib, I had a very short look at it, and
found that using my own tool was easier at the beginning. However, I
have no time now for such big changes, I keep updating the CDK with
new ocaml versions, but it's the more I can do these days. If you have
patches for particular architectures, I can apply them on the
distribution so it will be at least a little easier to use.


Best regards,
