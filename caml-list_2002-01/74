OK Caml history buffs, I have a question which arose during my
proofreading of a chapter of the forthcoming bestseller "Developing
Applications with Objective Caml" (Stephen King, watch out!).

In the current translation, it is mentioned that "fun" is a legacy of
older versions of Caml and it is insinuated that the "fun" form is somehow
deprecated in favor of fun. What's the straight dope?

I note that in the hypermodern Revised syntax, which I happen to like, it
is actually "function" which is suppressed, and fun lives on.
