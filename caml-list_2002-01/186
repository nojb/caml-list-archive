Subject: [Caml-list] advice on integrating Caml into an algorithms class?

Hello. I am a computer science student with a lot of experience with
procedural and object-oriented languages, mainly C, C++, and Perl.
However I have become increasingly aware of my lack of exposure to
languages from different families.

I read and experimented some with LISP and Scheme, yet they remain
somewhat of an enigma to me. Though I could write small programs to
calculate certain things, I didn't "get it," I didn't learn anything from
these languages like I hoped I would. I still can't put my finger on what
problem domains best suit LISP and why (I kept saying to myself, "this
would be so easy in Perl!").

I want to take a crack at another language that is significantly
different, and Caml seems to fit the bill. Simultaneously, I'm taking an
algorithms class this semester, and I want to somehow integrate my
exploration of alternative programming paradigms with my algorithms
class. Can anyone suggest ways I might approach this? Will the algorithms 
we study have straightforward implementations in Caml?

Any general insights as well as book recommendations appreciated!

Joshua
