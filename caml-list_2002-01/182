Aaargh! No, never use Obj.magic.
And please, never suggest to use it to resolve a type error.
Its only use is in relation to external C code, when you exactly know
what is happening!

Here the problem is that the type of v ends up being "wnd:hwnd -> 'a"
rather than "'a" as you expected. Since you omitted the label on the
argument, and the result type could be unified with anything, the
compiler believed that you were attempting to pass another argument...
By using magic, you are printing the address of a closure as an
integer.

Basic rules:
* a function should never return 'a if it does not also appear in a
  contravariant position (that is, as argument)
* it is better not to put labels on functions of only one argument,
  particularly when their return type is polymorphic (to avoid the
  above confusion)

The right response to your problem was already in other messages.

Cheers,

Jacques Garrigue
