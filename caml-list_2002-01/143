The documentation for custom blocks (section 17.9.1) says that the
compare, hash, and serialize custom block functions must use CAMLparam
for their arguments and CAMLreturn for their return values.  But
elsewhere it says that this is only a requirement for C functions that
can cause heap activity (by allocating blocks), and that certainly
makes better sense.

Is this because of multithreading?  Or what is the straight dope?
