Hi,

I'm considering using ocaml for a project I'm planning.  I plan to use the
object-oriented features of ocaml extensively.  I was wondering: is there
any way to get immutable class fields that are shared by all members of the
class?  I was thinking of a list of strings, and I don't want to have to
have the list duplicated for every instance of the class.

Mike
