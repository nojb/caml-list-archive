Subject: [Caml-list] Request for addition to the standard library.
Message-ID: <20020108134222.A68882@functor.resnet.ohio-state.edu>

Precedence: bulk

It's just a small request, really, but could polymorphic versions of the Set and Map modules be added, similar to what Hashtbl has now?  I've copied and pasted the code into an "Anyset" module which works on keys of type 'a using compare, of course, but that's not really an attractive solution :)

I can't think of any reason *not* to add that to the standard library, and it would make the standard container structure modules that much more consistent...

Thanks,
Jeremy
