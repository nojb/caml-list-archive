More or less I think so. In the industry functional programming is
sometimes something unknown (Java/C/C++/VB?). It's not a mainstream 
language, and when you come from a imperative/OO world, the first step is
really hard. Because you've got to think in a another way.
  Not to mention the fact that in the industry seldom use functional 
programming...
  I don't deny there's documentation (especially in French, merci) but
nothing in comparison with other functional languages (scheme and lisp 
for instance). IMHO, the documentation is not really for beginners.

Right. Could be improved tought. I mean it's not addressing
the problems I had or others newbies had (example of the
record) 
Note that the FAQ (which exist both in french and in english) are not included 
in the sid debian package. (Sven: could you add this to the packages ?)
