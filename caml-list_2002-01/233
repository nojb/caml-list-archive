I received a third part opinion (i.e. not a camlers) from Robert
Bihlmeyer (cc: in this mail, so please keep he in the cc: list) about
the ocaml bytecode executable linked in custom mode.

I report his opinion below, in his opinion that kind of executables
violate the ELF standard.

Who wants to answer to these observations?

TIA,
Cheers.
