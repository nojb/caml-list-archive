Subject: [Caml-list] Compiling lablttk and lablgtk on windows

Hello
    I have two problems. Firstly, I currently have the
3.04 sources compiled on a unix (freebsd) and win2000
machine under cygwin. On the windows machine I am
compiling labltk against the Activestate Tcl/Tk
distribution. The ocaml system appears to compile
correctly and a program that compiles and runs
perfectly on the unix box will compile but will crash
whenever a grid control is accessed on the form with a
'memory cannot be read' error. Does anyone have any
experience with anything similar to this
    Secondly, I want to start using lablgtk on windows
with the cygwin ocaml distribution. Can anyone give me
a step by step guide to getting, installing and
compiling lablgtk on this platform.

    thanks

        Andrew
