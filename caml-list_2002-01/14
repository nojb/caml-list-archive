Okay.
But it's not like I was newbie asking for help each time it comes. In fact, I
have read many many times the full Interfacing C with OCaml documentation pages
to try to figure out what's going wrong. And spend many many ( too much ) hours
debugging. But sometimes you have to say "stop", because YES I'm having trouble
with GC and YES I'm looking for debug help on the list. Am I that stupid ?

I think that kind of GC problems can't be resolved without a solid knowledge of
the GC, especially when the existing support for interfacing with C is only few
doc pages, sometimes foggy (especially concerning globals and how to store value
from ocaml in C).

If one day I manage to understand all theses concepts, perhaps then writing a
full tutorial explaining all C/OCaml interfacing cases will be a good thing for
the OCaml community, and then this list will perhaps have more than 500
subsribers, don't you think ?

About theses fenceposts, I would be glad to have your holy flame lighning my
dark way.
