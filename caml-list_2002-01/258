Do you have any specific thoughts on this that you can share yet? Have you done any tests?

I've been trying to understand of the implications of garbage collection in soft real-time programs.

If the GC is not purely incremental -- if it has to do some sort of full collect every so often -- and if the time needed to do such a full collect is comparable to or longer than one game cycle, then you are stuck, aren't you? Is there anything you can do? 

The time needed to do a full collect is proportional to the amount of live data in the program (right?). The only thing I think that could be done would be to move some of the data out into a C or C++ module.
