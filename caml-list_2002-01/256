Sorry, forgot to attach the man pages.

.SH NAME
mldvi \- a simple DVI previewer written in Objective Caml.
.UR http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/
(http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/)
.UE
.SH VERSION
ActiveDVI 0.3.1 (based on mldvi 1.0)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mldvi
.RI [ options ] " dvifile" ...

.B mldvi.opt
.RI [ options ] " dvifile" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B mldvi and native code 
.B mldvi.opt
commands.

This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.

.SH CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FEATURES:

\- Antialiasing

\- Color (as defined in the LaTeX package `color')

\- Automatic recompilation of METAFONT fonts

\- Automatic reloading of the file after modification

+ Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion (using graphics package)

+ Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change)

Notice that mldvi needs the `kpsewhich' tool in order to find and
recompile PK fonts.  (This program is part of the `kpathsea' library
provided by many TeX distributions.)

.SH OPTIONS
Options are : 

.TP
.B \-g GEOM, \-geometry GEOM
sets the (maximum) geometry GEOM
.TP
.B \-crop
crop the window to the best size (default)
.TP
.B \-no-crop
disable cropping
.TP
.B \-hmargin DIMEN
horizontal margin  (default: 1cm)
.TP
.B \-vmargin DIMEN
vertical margin    (default: 1cm)

.P
Geometry GEOM is specified in pixels, using the standard format
for specifying geometries (i.e: "WIDTHxHEIGHT[+XOFFSET+YOFFSET]").

Dimensions (for options `-hmargin' and `-vmargin') are specified as
numbers optionaly followed by two letters representing units.

When no units are given, dimensions are treated as numbers of pixels.

Currently supported units are the standard TeX units as specified in
the TeXbook (D. Knuth, Addison-Wesley, (C) 1986):

.RS 2
`pt' (point), `pc' (pica), `in' (inch), `bp' (big point),
`cm' (centimeter), `mm' (millimeter), `dd' (didot point),
`cc' (cicero) and `sp' (scaled point).
.RE
      
Notice that dimensions are specified w.r.t the original TeX document,
and do not correspond to what is actually shown on the screen, which
can be displayed at a different resolution than specified in the
original TeX source.

.SH KEYSTROKES

Mldvi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.
Each may optionally be preceded by a number, whose interpretation will
depend on the particular keystroke.

.RS 2
.TP 7 
.B q
Quits the program

.TP
.B n
Moves to the next page (or to the n-th next page if a number is given)

.TP
.B <space>
Moves to the next "pause" in the current page

.TP
.B p
Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).

.TP
.B g
Moves to the page with the given number.  The first page is numbered 1.

.TP
.B c
Center the page in the window, and resets the default resolution.

.TP
.B <
Scale the resolution by 1/1.414

.TP
.B >
Scale the resolution by 1.414

.TP
.B f
Load all the fonts used in the documents.  By default, fonts are loaded
only when needed.

.TP
.B F
Does the same as `f', and precomputes the glyphs of all characters used
in the document.  This takes more time than loading the fonts, but the
pages are drawn faster.

.TP
.B C
Erase the image cache

.RE 
Moreover, the user can drag the currently displayed page in the window
in order to change its relative position.  (This is useful when the
page is displayed at a resolution such that it cannot fit in the
window.)

.SH EYE CANDY MACROS

Using mldvi.sty included this program, you can embed some ActiveDVI
specials into your TeX documents. With ActiveDvi, these specials
provide some eye candy features for your presentation.

.TP
.B \epause
ActiveDvi stops rendering at the point of the document and wait a user key
stroke.

.TP
.B \ewait{sec}
Delay the rendering at the point of the document for sec seconds.

.TP
.B \etag{tag}{text}
Put a "ActiveDVI tag" named tag to the text. This tag can be used to change
the color of the text later.

.TP
.B \ehide{tag}{text}
Same as \etag{tag}{text}, but does not render the text at this point.  You can
display the text later, using \eplay macro.

.TP
.B \eplay{tag}
Display the texts associated with the tag.

.TP
.B \ehilight{tag}{color}
Display the texts associated with the tag, using the color.

.RE
Please look at test/demo.{tex|dvi} and test/macros.{tex|dvi} for
more information and examples.
