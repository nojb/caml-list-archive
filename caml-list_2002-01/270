You need to use 'coe' if you want to pack two different kind of widgets in
the same function call.  For example,

let b = Button.create ...
let t = Text.create ...
pack [coe b; coe t]

You could think of 'coe' as a cast operator to a generic widget object.
That way, all elements in the list have the same type and the typechecker
is happy.

Note that when only widget is being packed, it isn't needed.

Hope that helps,
Patrick
