So has Debian - that's why it exists at all.  It is one thing that
distinguishes it from e.g. RedHat, which generally just takes the
upstream defaults for configurations, and the result is a mess as one
would expect.

Yes, it is: to people with experience on Debian, but none on Ocaml.
Which is exactly the sort of people that would install a binary
package, I think.

The way I did it when I built Ocaml from sources was with a symlink,
so that it existed in both places.

BTW, /usr/include/ocaml (to match the package name) would be a better
name.
