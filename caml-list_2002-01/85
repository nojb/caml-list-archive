I noticed that my bug report was silently moved to 'not a bug'
section. Despite report's subject 'Not a bug, but...' i do think its
atleast an issue. Consider this:

file a.ml:
let a = 1

file a.mli:
val a : int \
val a : int  |
...........  | n times 
val a : int  |
val a : int /


After compilation/linking we will get huge .cmi and binary with data
section (n-1)*4(on 32bit architectures) bytes bigger that it should have
been. Current ocamlopt.opt is 12 bytes bigger due to redundant declartions
in bytecomp/lambda.mli(is_guarded,patch_guarded) and
utils/clflags.ml(dump_scheduling), not a big deal but still anoying.
