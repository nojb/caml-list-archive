itz> Hi, I can hook into the toplevel loop to modify printing of simple

itz> types?

Daniel> For a general printing of all values of all types, use the hook
Daniel> Toploop.print_out_value. You can change it to point to your function.

Daniel> This function must take a value of type Outcometree.out_value and
Daniel> print it. The module Outcometree is in the installed OCaml library
Daniel> directory.

Daniel> The default value of !Toploop.print_out_value is the function "print_outval"
Daniel> located in the OCaml sources file toplevel/genprintval.ml. You can make your
Daniel> own version by copying this function and adapt it for your own usage.

Daniel> Another example is the "revised syntax" of Camlp4 in the OCaml
Daniel> sources, file "camlp4/top/rprint.ml". (use "camlp4r pr_o.cmo
Daniel> camlp4/top/rprint.ml" to see this file in normal syntax, if you
Daniel> prefer).

Thanks.  I take it that your answer is 3.04 specific; actually I am
working with 3.02.  I will just wait with this functionality until I
upgrade. 

Pretty amazing that it _is_ now possible, really. :-)  Maybe because
you needed something like it for p4?
