  I don't even try to justificate me, I'm definitely wrong. But at the
time I was rather upset by the fact that a toplevel was compiled with
a module and just after you couldn't open it !
  My search was rather "caml toplevel Unbound module" because I didn't
even know at the that I had "include directories". Sorry I'm just a
newbie.And the autor of pcre answered to this concern in about 10 minuts
(hat down to him), I wrote him after struggling one hour against
ocamlmktop ;o)
  Ocaml deserve to be used by far more people, it's a really interesting
language. But you will agree with me that it's difficult to apprehend.
It's done by researchers, lack some documentation (especially in English
I can't complain the book on Ocaml in French is on the web). Basically
the first step is the harder.
  So far I had three problems :
1. the toplevel one
2. two records can't have the same label=20
type a =3D {blabla: int}
type b =3D {blabla: int, comment: string)
3. the exceptions are NOT polymorphics=20
exception of 'a list is WRONG.

I think I'm gonna do a gotcha page, but don't you think such
a page deserve his place on caml.inria.fr ?
