Hello Harry !
That's quite a big work, and it's works fine.

You can add theses lines to the Makefile

dllwin32_c.dll : $(MODULES:+=_c.obj)
    -del $@
    link user32.lib kernel32.lib gdi32.lib ocamlrun.lib advapi32.lib
shell32.lib /dll /out:$@ $**

Then , it'll try to build the Dynamic Link Library version of Win32_c, which
is easier to use
with bytecode ocaml.

But I get theses two unresolved externals :

local_roots ( again ! )
atom_table

... which are not referenced in the ocamlrun.lib... have they been forgotten
?

I would also like to share your ideas about a future OCaml IDE on Win32.

Bye
Warp
