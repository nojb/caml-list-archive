Ok I've tried this doing :

 (set_window_data wnd#hwnd 10);
 let v = (get_window_data wnd#hwnd) in
     (print_int (Obj.magic v: int));

But it print a wrong number ( not 10 )
I've tried to trace calls into the C DLL where primitives *_window_data are,
I can see the set_window_data call but the get_window_data call is NOT done
by the interpreter

What's wrong ?
