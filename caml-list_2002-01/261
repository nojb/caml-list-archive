Hi,

Talking of the CDK, wouldn't it be better to move it to a more
standard framework using findlib and ocamldoc ?

While I'm interested in this effort, requiring downloading and
installing of the whole CDK before being able to use any of its
functionality seems an hindrance, particularly when your architecture
is badly supported by the CDK, and you have to patch your way out.

Also, it should be easy to write makefiles that work both with and
without the tools installed. Well, findlib might be a requirement,
since its functionality is basic enough. A patch on the compiler is
completely impractical when I have to recompile several times a week.

Cheers, and hoping for an even better CDK.

Jacques
