You should use the GL libraries comming with your XFree. Look on the
mesa web site for further info.

http://www.mesa3d.org/about/systems.html
 If you download and install XFree86 4.0 you do not need to install Mesa
 separately. All the important parts of Mesa will be installed with the
 rest of XFree86.


By the way, looking at your spinlock problem, what is the version of
your glibc? At least one lock bug was fixed in the latest release.

Hope it helps,
d.
