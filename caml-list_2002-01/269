Hello;

I was trying to pick up labltk and looking at the example code and I'm
confused by this:
Tk.pack [coe b]

When I change it to:
Tk.pack [b]

It seems to work just as before. I see coe preceding the widgets in
pack calls throughout the labltk examples. I looked up coe in widget.ml
and it looks like some really deep manure. I have no idea what it
means. If someone tries to really explain it, I will have no idea what
they are talking about. Perhaps someone could just give me a hacker's
explanation of why it's in the pack calls.

Thank you,
Collin Monahan
