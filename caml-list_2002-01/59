Hi, I remember using the -i option successfully in the past to
generate a fat interface to an existing .ml file.  However, after
upgrading to 3.04 and trying to recompile some of my stuff, I can't
seem to remember how to do without an excessive amount of pain.

I have a file foo.ml, and I want to generate foo.mli.

kronstadt:~$ cat >>foo.ml
let i = 1
kronstadt:~$ ocamlc -i foo.ml > foo.mli
I/O error: foo.cmi: No such file or directory
kronstadt:~$ ocamlc -i -c foo.ml > foo.mli
I/O error: foo.cmi: No such file or directory
kronstadt:~$ ocamlc -c foo.ml
I/O error: foo.cmi: No such file or directory
kronstadt:~$ rm foo.mli
kronstadt:~$ ocamlc -c foo.ml
kronstadt:~$ ls -l foo.cmo
-rw-rw-r--    1 itz      itz           145 Jan  9 13:14 foo.cmo
kronstadt:~$ ocamlc -i -c foo.ml > foo.mli
kronstadt:~$ ls -l foo.cmo
-rw-rw-r--    1 itz      itz           147 Jan  9 13:15 foo.cmo
kronstadt:~$ 

So, it seems that I have to first _compile_ foo.ml to get both foo.cmi
and foo.cmo, and then compile it _again_ with the -i flag to get
foo.mli.  Is that so?  Isn't there a way to generate _just_ foo.mli
and not the object file?
