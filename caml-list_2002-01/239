Hi, I can hook into the toplevel loop to modify printing of simple
types like int with #install_printer, but what about polymorphic
types?  Say I want the toplevel to do this:

# [1; 2] ;;
- : int list = List (1, 2)

so I started to write my printer function:

let list_printer ppf l =
  pp_open_box ppf 6;	(* if break needed, indent to the paren *)
  pp_print_string ppf "List (";
  
  (* now what??? *)
  
Basically, I am looking for a hook into the toploop that I can _call_
(not modify) to make it print a value (of any type) according to its
current printers.  Is that possible?
