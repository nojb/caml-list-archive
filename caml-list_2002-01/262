That doesn't seem to be a good thing to do.
Objective Caml has only one standard: a unique distribution. If you
start to mess around with the directories, this is not very helpful
for anybody. There is no way a library developper can find the path of
the caml include files, other than expecting them to be in the
standard place, under the library directory. Usually you just call
them by <caml/mlvalues.h>, and your scheme with still work, but if
anybody chooses to do -I`ocaml -where`/caml , which is supposed to be
correct, then it breaks.
And what are you doing with caml-light header files ?

By the way, FHS or not, glib puts parts of its headers in
/usr/local/lib/grealizelib/include, which seems to be pretty similar to what
ocaml does (I noticed that righteous FreeBSD mainteners are moving them
back to /usr/local/include/glib12...)
And these headers will only be used by ocaml programs, this is not
just a standard C library.

Just a comment.

Cheers,
