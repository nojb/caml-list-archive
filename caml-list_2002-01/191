Looking at the documentation for the MLast quotations in camlp4
reference manual, the very first node is

<:expr< $e1$ . $e2$ >> : access in records an in modules

Now I understand that camlp4 is all syntax, but even so, aren't these
two fundamentally different things?  In other words, shouldn't there
be 2 distinct nodes like this

<:expr< $e1$ . $e2$ >> : access in records
<:expr< $me1$ . $e2$ >> : access in modules

This is a practical issue when constructing my grammar --- I have
rules that derive module_expr, so how do I put them together with the
core expr rules to derive possibly qualified identifiers?
