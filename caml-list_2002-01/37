Several months ago I wrote to O'Reilly books and asked about a rumour that
they were making an English translation of the aforementioned book.  They
responded that yes, a group of volunteers was working on the project, and
as progress was made, it would be posted to the book's website:

http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/Livres/ora/DA-OCAML/index.html

Does anyone know if the translation is indeed being performed?  I don't
find any information at the above website...

Thanks!

Walter Rader


P.S. I've spent hours making a Babelfish (babelfish.altavista.com)
translation of the book.  Babelfish only translates web pages up to a
specific length, and then stops, so I had to split many of the book's
pages into multiple HTML files, translate each of them, and then recombine
them.  Babelfish also messes up the appearance of the code samples.  I
have corrected all of these problems, as well as fixed many of the
imprecise translations.  If anyone wants some "suggestions" about how they
can do this process "themselves," feel free to e-mail me directly at
wrader@ocf.berkeley.edu.
