They speed up compilations by a factor of 2 or 3.  Some of my
colleagues use them for this reason, but that's because they have
3-year old workstations :-)  With more recent hardware, I've never been
bothered by the compilation speed of the non-.opt compilers, and thus
don't use them except for testing purposes.

That sounds reasonable to me.
