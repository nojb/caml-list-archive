Well, I certainly could do that, but I was hoping to use Ocaml to
replace my bash/awk/sed/perl scripts. For me, the convenience of
having one single source file, and no compilation step, is one of the
attractions of "scripts". As far as I can tell, the extra load time
due to compilation of the script is negligible, and I assume the
run-time is equivalent to a pre-compiled byte-code executable? I have
many scripts that do filtering, so having a clean output stream is
important to me.  It seems to me that if the ability to use a custom
toplevel as a script interpreter exists, then it would be very nice if
it printed all diagnostics to stderr.

Anyway, I have a workaround, I wrote a "trampoline" program that can
be used in place of the toplevel interpreter and does the compilation
transparently for lazy persons such as myself.

It essentially turns any compiled language into a scripting language.
If anyone is interested in it ... I could clean it up for public
consumption.

cheers,
doug
