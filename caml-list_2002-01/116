I tried also installing ocaml from the mandrake rpm.  I then stripped out the
#!/usr/bin/ocamlrun from the lablgltop and ran gdb ocamlrun.  Then I passed the
file name finallablgltop (which was my edited version) and basically ran the
same stuff in gdb.  This is what I got:

Not sure if the spinlock error is gdb or what, but I thought I'd update the problem.
