gcc-2.96, glibc-2.2.2-4, Xfree86-4.0.3, and GL (all from RPMS) came with
Mandrake.  I installed ocaml-3.04 from an RPM and build lablgl-0.97.  I upgraded
glibc to a different build (2.2.2-6), but it sounds like I need glibc-2.2.4, is
that correct?  Does anyone know a way to do this without changing distros, or is
changing versions going to be painful?  Thanks for any suggestions.

Patrick
