Yes, it is.  It was the only way to construct TAGS files for ocaml
before there was otags (which you want to check out, it is in the
ocamltools package).

If I remember right, ocamltags was never installed even if you did
"make install" in the emacs subdirectory.  You have to call a special
target, like "make installtags" or something.  Sven, please look at
the Makefile in the emacs subdirectory.
