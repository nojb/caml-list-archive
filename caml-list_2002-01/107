% ocamlc -thread threads.cma
% ocamlc.opt -thread threads.cma
Error on dynamically loaded library: /usr/lib/ocaml/dllthreads.so: undefined symbol: extern_sp
% ocamlopt -thread threads.cmxa                           
Cannot find file threads.cmxa

Questions:
- in which case are ocamlc and ocamlc.opt not equivalent?

- in which case are xxx and xxx.opt not equivalent? 
At least, it seems camlp4o.opt is pretty useless (one gets "native-code
program cannot do a dynamic load")

I've been trying to reduce the size of the ocaml rpm which is getting quite
huge (27MB), and doing
  for i in /usr/bin/*.opt ; do
    ln -s `basename $i` `echo $i | sed "s/.opt$//"`
  done
helps!

- should threads.cmxa be included somehow/somewhere? The doc says
    ocamlopt -thread other options threads.cmxa other files
  is that wrong?


Thanks!
