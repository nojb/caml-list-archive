For what it's worth, there's a cute little gravity-simulation toy I
coded up for my 4-year old planets-obsessed nephew that I recently
released on to the web.  It's fun to play with, although the simulation
method used to do the physics (a basic 1st order approximation) is
pretty bad.  Still, under most circumstances it works ok.  Besides, you
can do fun things like make planets bounce when they crash, intead of
simply merging.  It's also got planet traces, zooming in and out and
panning.  Lots of cute little toys.

It makes use of labltk, mostly through the canvas widget.  And it works
on Windows and Unix.

I'd be very welcome to contributions, by the way, especially to anyone
who wants to code a 4th-order runge-kutta approximation.
