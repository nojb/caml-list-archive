I've been looking for a good framework to unit-test my software, and Fort seems to fit the bill.  There are, however, a few things standing in my way that I'd like to resolve.

First, I *need* to link against certain C libraries, like Unix and Pcre.  What do I need to do to make a fort executable that allows me to test modules linked with these libraries?

Also, are there any good examples of already-existing testing frameworks that I can base mine on?  The documentation I've found isn't the most extensive, and a good example would go far to help me use it.

If I can get these issues solved, I'd be able to use Fort quite extensively for testing my software, and I'd really like to do that :)

Thanks,
Jeremy
