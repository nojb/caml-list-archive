I beg to differ.  There are a number of implementations
of Standard ML from different "vendors" (e.g., SML/NJ, PolyML,
MLKit, MoscowML, MLton, etc.)  In addition, there are books=20
describing the standard language and library.  The former is=20
relatively formal when compared to most language definitions. =20

In contrast, Ocaml is implemented by one group and has no
"definition".  Rather, the implementation largely defines=20
the language.

I do not say these things with any implied judgment that
one approach is better than the other.  But I do believe
that "standard" is more than a marketing term for SML.
