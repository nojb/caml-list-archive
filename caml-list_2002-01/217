I found the idea of ocaml code in the kernel intriguing enough to do
some digging. It turns out that ocamlopt can compile a viable kernel
if one hacks hard enough, and this allows the C parts of the kernel to
give ocaml code a shot at initialization, including allowing ocaml code
to register callbacks, etc that will be called when the kernel is
running.  The following page describes what's there, which while not
perfectly complete is enough to work with reasonably.  This may be a 
nice opportunity to do a project like foxnet, but to get everything
except the ethernet physical-layer driver into a nicer language.  One
might consider that code thus written would be less exploitable by a
malicious hacker than equivalent C code.

Here is the page with instructions + files.
