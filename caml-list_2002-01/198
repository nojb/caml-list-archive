Hi,

  Sorry I'm still new to Ocaml and sorry if the question is dumb,
but I did looked thoroughly and didn't got it... 
  I don't know whether this is a ocaml problem or a pcre-ocaml
problem, but the point is that although I manage to generate a 
toplevel with pcre-ocaml linked by doing :

ocamlmktop -o ocamlunx -I +camlp4 -I +contrib unix.cma str.cma pcre.cma camlp4o.cma

When I try to do a :
#open Pcre;;
or to use a function with its full-qualified name a "Unbound module" message.

BTW the machine is a x86 debian woody but using the sid ocaml packages,
ocaml 3.04-2 and pcre_ocaml-4.12-1

Any help is greatly appreciated.
