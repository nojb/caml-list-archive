Well, yes, that is the intention.

I think there is a symlink from the old place to there.

You are speaking about  /usr/lib/glib/include/glibconfig.h ?

I don't think this is a header that is supposed to be used for developpment,
is it, while the caml header belong under /usr/include, since they are used in
standard developpment, and you do a #include <caml/mlvalues.h> for them.

Any developper wanting to use C code will need those, thus they go into the
right place, and no need for an additional -I`ocaml -where`/caml, and it will
not break, since the files are where they are supposed to be, in /usr/include.

Just because you are used to doing it like that, doesn't make it the right way
of doing things.

But still, if you have very convincing arguments, i may consider them, i have
not seen such upto now.
