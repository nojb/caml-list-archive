Well, basically, everything is in /usr/lib/ocaml as usual, only i moved the
includes in the more logical /usr/include/caml directory. Which may be one of
the reason of this causing problems. That said, i built activeDVI 0.3.1
without any kind of major problems.

I guess so, will try it out later on.

Cool, ...

BTW, i currently ship both mldvi and activedvi as debian package, mldvi being
1.0 and activedvi being 0.3.1. I think this may be overkill, but since i am
not entirely sure of what you or alexandre have thinked about it, i prefer to
keep it as such (and well, going from 1.0 to 0.3.1 version is not nice for
debian packages, i could manage it, but would prefer not to). 

Also, i have written a small manpage for mldvi (which i send to alexandre i
think) and upgraded it for activedvi. You may want to look at it, change
things as needed, and integrate it into the cvs archive. (attached here).

Also, may you consider adding some small changes to the makefile i need in
order to make debianization of it easier ? It is only the following :

--- activedvi-0.3.1.orig/Makefile
+++ activedvi-0.3.1/Makefile

As you see, i need a install target, which i can modify the directory prefix
with something akin to this $(DESTDIR) variable.

Also we could imagine moving all the debian subdir into cvs, so people could
build packages directly out of cvs, ...

(I still didn't had time to work on the lablgtk frontend to ml/activedvi
wanted to do:((()
