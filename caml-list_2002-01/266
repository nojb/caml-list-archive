Interesting point.  I have hacked on a few extensions, but I _always_
just called gcc directly.  Somehow the fact that ocamlc is a full
driver just like gcc doesn't easily enter one's consciousness, I'm
afraid.  Also, when one uses things like autoconf and hairy makefile
rules, direct use of the C compiler is more conveient (think of all
the -ccopt stuff you'd have to pass...)

I was suggesting that the link be a part of the package.  Users are
not supposed to touch /usr/include on Debian.
