Yes, it is.  Most of the book has been translated and is in the process of
being proofread.  As soon as an initial segment of the book has been
proofread the translation project will release it to the website.  (At

Egad!  Well, we had been aiming for web release in February and it still
seems that is doable.  Sorry you had to go through all this work, hopefully
it will be useful in other projects.
