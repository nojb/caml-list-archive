Probably I miss the point but if your machines have some local disk data
you can install ocamlrun executable locally on each machine but using
the same path. In such a way using "#! /usr/local/bin/ocamlrun" will
work on each architecture.

But, obviously, if all of your filesystems are shared this trick doesn't
work.

Cheers.
