It might be a little harder than just compiling to get the byte code
interpreter working.  It depends on the byte-code interpreters demand
for memory management.  Most VxWorks systems I use just have a single
address space.  VxWorks can be thought of as a single task on a Posix
system with multiple threads.

It also don't have a normal shell and that kind of stuff, so the code
would have to be byte-compiled on one machine and moved over.  It would
probably be easiest to use -output-obj to have the linker include the
object.

Cross compilation didn't look that easy last time I thought about trying
to do it.
