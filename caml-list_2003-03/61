I'm trying to learn LablTk by studying the examples provided in the 
OCaml distribution ... looking at the Tetris game right now. 
Fortunately I have plenty of experience with Tk itself, so most of 
the code is intelligible. But I'm puzzled about the 'coe' function, 
as in:

  pack [coe c; coe r; coe r'] ~side: `Left ~fill: `Y;

Okay, so I dug a little deeper and found that 'coe' is an alias for 
forget_type ... but why? What is the purpose of weakening the widget 
types as they are packed?

And by the way, what does 'coe' stand for? Is it a French acronym?

Thanks in advance for shedding light on this dark corner.
