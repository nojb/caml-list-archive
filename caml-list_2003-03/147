Admittedly, I haven't read the book, but my understanding is that this 
book is based on OCaml 2.x. Is it really such a good idea to publish it 
as is when OCaml has been at version 3.x for quite some time now?

I guess, I'm trying to make a "marketing" (shudder) point. No matter how 
good and useful the book is, it'll be harder to pitch it (and OCaml) to 
people willing to learn a new language, when at the same time you'd 
have to say "it's based on an earlier version of the language, but 
that's not important".
