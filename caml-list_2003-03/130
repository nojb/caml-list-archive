I'm not that surprised.  I got nothing out of the book when I tried to
read it.  It reads like a reference manual, so it may be of more use
once I've learned the language, but it's not an adequate introductory
text IMO.

Despite its brevity, I got more out of:
http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/stephan.html

Then I did the first several sections of the O'Reilly translation.
This clear, explanatory style was much easier to digest.
