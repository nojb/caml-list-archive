Hello Caml riders!

I'm glad to announce the first public alpha release of the 
Xcaml application server for Apache (and other CGI enable 
web servers). You can find it at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xcaml/


Xcaml is a number of things:

1) An XML flavored programming language.

Xcaml scripts compute a text file, generally an XML or HTML 
file. The full power of Ocaml can be unleashed by embedding 
ocaml code within <?xcaml ... ?> processing instructions. 
Other features include $-variables, whereby "$varname" gets 
substituted with the contents of the "varname" CGI 
environment variable); $-expressions, whereby "$( ocaml-expr 
)$" is substituted with the string computed by the 
ocaml-expr; $#-variables, whereby "$#varname" is substituted 
with the contents of the varname session-environment 
variable saved within the xcaml application server.

2) An Xcaml -> Ocaml -> Bytecode compiler

Xcaml scripts get translated to Ocaml and subsequently 
compiled to bytecode object files.

3) A dynamic application server

Xcaml-derived bytecode object files are dynamically linked 
with the xcaml executable to produce the output of the 
associated xcaml-script.

Xcaml is currently being used to develop web frontends to 
mission critical database applications.

Currently, the main limitation of the Xcaml system is the 
total absence of documentation, as the the implementors of 
the Xcaml system are also the only users (up to now).

I plan on working on the documentation, but I would first 
like to estimate how much interest there is in the ocaml 
community for this project.

Of course, contributions and cooperation are more than welcome.

Alex
