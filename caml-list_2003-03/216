> Hello Caml riders!
>
> I'm glad to announce the first public alpha release of the
> Xcaml application server for Apache (and other CGI enable
> web servers). You can find it at:
> http://sourceforge.net/projects/xcaml/
>
>
> Xcaml is a number of things:
>
> 1) An XML flavored programming language.
>
> Xcaml scripts compute a text file, generally an XML or HTML
> file. The full power of Ocaml can be unleashed by embedding
> ocaml code within <?xcaml ... ?> processing instructions.
> Other features include $-variables, whereby "$varname" gets
> substituted with the contents of the "varname" CGI
> environment variable); $-expressions, whereby "$( ocaml-expr
> )$" is substituted with the string computed by the
> ocaml-expr; $#-variables, whereby "$#varname" is substituted
> with the contents of the varname session-environment
> variable saved within the xcaml application server.
>
> 2) An Xcaml -> Ocaml -> Bytecode compiler
>
> Xcaml scripts get translated to Ocaml and subsequently
> compiled to bytecode object files.
>
> 3) A dynamic application server
>
> Xcaml-derived bytecode object files are dynamically linked
> with the xcaml executable to produce the output of the
> associated xcaml-script.
>
> Xcaml is currently being used to develop web frontends to
> mission critical database applications.
>
> Currently, the main limitation of the Xcaml system is the
> total absence of documentation, as the the implementors of
> the Xcaml system are also the only users (up to now).
>
> I plan on working on the documentation, but I would first
> like to estimate how much interest there is in the ocaml
> community for this project.
>
> Of course, contributions and cooperation are more than welcome.
