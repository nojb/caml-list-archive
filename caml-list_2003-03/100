Do you mean that such a book could not be written, or simply that it
just has not been written yet?  I personally would like to see an
``Objective Caml for dummies'' as the available introductory material
(in English) is pretty poor IMO.

In http://caml.inria.fr/FAQ/general-eng.html you said:

``Caml is a programming language, easy to learn, easy to use''.

So is it easy or not easy?
