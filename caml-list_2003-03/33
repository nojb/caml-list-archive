I had exactly the same code to write one year ago, and I simply built
the packet inside a buffer, with a 0 length-field, changed it to a
string, and filled the length-field just before sending, by changing
the chars in place in the string. It only allocates the buffer once,
and then the final string at the end, I cannot believe that using a
list of chars can be more efficient, but sometimes strange things
happen...
