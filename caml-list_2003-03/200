As a former imperative style programmer converted to functional, I should
tell you that once I learned [*] Scheme, picking up any other functional
language was really, really easy.  In fact, the only languages I've had to
spend real time learning since Scheme have been Aldor (getting used to the
type system takes a little time) and Prolog (getting used to relations
instead of functions).

Trust me, if you pick up one functional langauge, picking up another is not
difficult.

[*] By "learned" I mean I can interpret the syntax and I understand most of
the semantics of the language.  I do not mean that I have learned all the
library functions.  That is a different matter.
