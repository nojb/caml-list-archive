I have no experience with VxWorks, but from their Web site it appears
to be POSIX-compliant.  If so, chances are very high that the bytecode
interpreter will compile and work right out of the box.  For the
native-code compiler, the porting effort can range from the trivial
(e.g. one of the supported configurations just happens to work) to the
fairly hard (e.g. a new code generator has to be written).  It's not
possible to say without more details on the target platform and
environment.
