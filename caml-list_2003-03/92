I wonder if anyone has thought about developing an OCaml interface to 
FOX (www.fox-toolkit.org)? Though I haven't done any serious 
programming with it yet, I've tried out a couple of FOX applications, 
and was quite impressed with the quality of the interface. If you 
read the Goals & Approach statement on the Web site, it's also very 
impressive.

I think OCaml + FOX could be a winning combination. Unfortunately, I 
don't know C++, or I'd write the wrapper myself. But if anyone else 
feels like taking it on, I'm happy to help with testing and 
documentation.
