Well, for unpatient people, this is a very long time!
(Even if you have not time to work every day with
that language and that book!)

Yes, I have thought about that too.
Maybe programmers are - when looking at OCaml's
imperative features - not very impressed (namespace
of variables (records,..)).

Well, but on the other side, people are often very unpatient.
If the question is, to spread OCaml more, then people want
to have results fast.

E.G. scripting... some I/O-stuff right from the beginning,
and you can do some things, where you have used Perl before...

So, waiting with this until Chapter 3 may cause people
to stop learning the new language...

Yes. Shure.

But if people have to wait too long - who has the time
today to invest so much time, if not a researcher or
unemployed (or workoholic, who comes home with rectangular
eyes and again take seat in front of the computer?)

Ciao,
