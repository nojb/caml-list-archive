Typically in web applications, connections to the database are cached 
because there is a large overhead in making the connection.  They are 
stored in a pool which is shared among the requests coming in.

More generally, I would like be able to cache data in memory.  When you 
say stateful CGI, does that mean that it reloads its state from disk on 
every request?
