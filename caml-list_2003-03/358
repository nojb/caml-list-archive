Sven, someone on this list wisely pointed out that you buy 
nothing by telling someone else "You don't need that 
feature". We do need namespaces. It might not be paramount: 
I'm pretty sure there is something more important to be done 
at Inria. But, please, don't tell me that -pack will cure 
cancer, promote democracy, establish universal peace, and 
make my teeth look whiter. Packing does not allow 
factorizing your code--bytecode, actually--in small reusable 
units. One big .cmo is not as flexible as a .cma. I simply 
might not want to link all of a library: what if it's 
modules contain side-effects? So -pack is good, but 
namespaces are still a necessary feature to Ocaml as to any 
industrial level programming language.


Cheers to all Caml riders,
Alex
