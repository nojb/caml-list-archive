I have a theory (backed up with a fair bit of circumstancial evidence) 
that a large number of purchasing decisions are influenced by the number 
of running feet of books in the local bookstore are dedicated to the 
topic.  The theory is (as I infer it) 'if I have a problem, I'll simply 
buy a book to tell me how to solve it.  After all, look at all of these 
books!  Surely one of them will be what I need!'

Having *the* perfect introductory book is actually a detriment, as 
it discourages other books from entering the field, thus reducing your 
runnning foot total.  Likewise, being intuitive or easy to understand is 
also a detriment, as this makes both for fewer books and for slimmer 
books.  Much better to have multi-thousand page tomes (tombs?).  And 
naturally, you can't measure running feet of web pages :-).
