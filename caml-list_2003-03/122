This may be a bit harsh, but I understand your sentiment. How about
the group in between the idiots and the language specialists? i.e,
folks who _would_ appreciate OCaml if they were exposed to it and had
some better teaching tools available?

Notoriety leads to a greater userbase which has many trickle-down
effects such as external suggestions and contributions, conferences,
additional funding, etc. all of which improve the language and insure
its future. The benefits of opensource are all about getting the code
into more hands. You lose all of these if OCaml remains obscure and
shrouded in mystery.

Look, I'm not talking about turning OCaml into a commercially driven
behemoth like Java folks. I'd just like to see OCaml get the exposure,
support, credit, etc. I think it deserves.
