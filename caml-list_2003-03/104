Why isn't X more popular?
Why isn't X mainstream?

Such fascinating questions! The many answers often
have as much to do with the specific history of a
language, as they do with language features or design.

Then there's philosophy-
'There are many ways of trying to understand programs.
People often rely too much on one way, which is called
"debugging" and consists of running a
partly-understood program to see if it does what you
expected. Another way, which ML advocates, is to
install some means of understanding in the very
programs themselves.' 
Robin Milner, preface to The Little MLer.

It's the immediate-gratification of getting
"something" to work (and then making it the "right
something") versus the deferred-pleasure of knowing
that you will have a "correct" program.

best wishes, Isaac
