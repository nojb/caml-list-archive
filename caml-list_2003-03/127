What about the O'Reilly book, "Developing Applications With Objective
Caml"?  It's not perfect yet, but the preliminary translation from the
French is available at:

    http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/html/index.html

Is this the sort of thing you're looking for?

The O'Reilly book starts in Chapter 2 with the basics of functional
programming.  This makes sense because that's really what sets O'Caml
apart from other more mainstream languages.

> Start by telling me how to read and write files.

Chapter 3 goes into the imperative aspects, including I/O.

Chapter 5: The Graphics Interface.

Not quite -- but Chapter 6 has several example applications, including one
that models a simple database.

The rest of the book has a very practical feel to it, constantly grounding
itself in real-world examples and applications.


Like i said, it's not quite ideal at this point, but i'm surprised nobody's
mentioned it yet.  Would it help O'Caml's cause, do you think, if O'Reilly
were to polish this up and publish it?

cheers,
William
