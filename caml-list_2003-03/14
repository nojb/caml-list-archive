Well, like said, i never managed to got thing to install/compil properly
on windows (sure, i was trying to build a windows advi, which is not
possible, but still). The biggest help the windows users can do
themselves, is that some of you write an howto on how to do ocaml
developpment on windows, and describe it so that people can give it a
try, without the headache of trying to figure out how it is supposed to
work, and why it is not working, and other such. I myself did give it a
try from time to time, but after the headache that this involves, i just
thought to hell with it, it is not worth the time spent, and abandoned
the whole idea. I guess many other unix developpers think the same, and
windows will be going away anyway in a few years, so ... :))))

Like said, fine with me, but i guess the windows way of thinking is that
it should work out of the box and without many problems. BTW, how do you
do Makefiles with the visual C++ developpment tools ?
