Sorry that I must say that, but these comparisons are absolutely
nonsense. I have some ocaml sources that are _much_ slower (e.g.
2500 lines, but compilations take longer than 20 seconds), and I know
that you can slow down C++ compilers by turning on optimization
switches. So the question arises: which features take which time?

My impression is that some type inference tasks can be very slow
for ocaml, especially if subtyping is involved. This feature is not
available in C++. On the other hand, C++ compilers usually implement
better optimization techniques, and these take time, too.
