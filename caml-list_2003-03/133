Actually, I must say that it does provide THE decisive 
advantage over all other tools I reviewed, at least in terms 
of Web applications. After developing the Xcaml sytem, which 
is currently on Sourceforge--and wanting a little bugfix 
update, coming up--my company is now able to release a new 
custom "enterprise application" to the customer in more or 
less one week's time.

The Xcaml system, which is basically nothing other than 
XML/HTML-embedded Ocaml, is giving us the edge to give our 
customers whatever they ask for the moment they ask for it.

I think that Ocaml is a little more than the "the tool of 
choice for the discriminating hacker": it's tool of choice 
for professional business software development, at least if 
your employees are endowed with a measure of cognitive 
abilities. It does take a little thinking to get the hang of 
Ocaml--and Xcaml equivalently--but not that much after all. 
Hey, it's an imperative language at the end!
