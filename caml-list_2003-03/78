Very briefly, we have a "big" hashtable, where the keys are 
the session handles and the values are the session 
environments. Session environments are hashtables from 
strings to strings. Environment variables must be stored by 
a function call within and <?xcaml ... ?> block but can be 
accessed directly from HTML/XML/whatever with a $#varname 
directive.

It's done automatically for you when you load the page. A 
cache file keeps track of what xcaml pages have already been 
compiled, so that files are not needlessly recompiled on and 
on again. Of course, if you make a change to a page 
on-the-fly, Xcaml notices and flushes it from the cache, 
forcing a recompilation.
