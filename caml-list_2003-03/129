[reposting, as the first one didn't seem to go through]

There seems to me clearly, a lack of a good, tutorial style,
introductory book about OCaml in English.  Something akin to
``Programming Perl'' (as someone mentioned).

I'm talking to a publisher at Manning (http://www.manning.com) about
the possibility of such a book.  They are intrigued, but would like to
see some indication that people are interested.

Would you like to see such a book?  Something you could pick up in the
technical section of your local bookshoppe.  If so, speak up, and I'll
collect the responses to feed back to the publisher.  Thanks.
