There is already the -pack option, and the right thing to solve this
problem would be to build all libraries to make usage of it (if
possible). So you would have a CamlImage.Image module and a Labltk.Image
module, which work pretty well.

Now, library writters just need to modify their build system to take
advantage of it, starting by the INRIA released libraries, especially
the ones provided by the ocaml tarball directly like labltk.
