Hello,


this night I have looked for papers on tail-recursion.
I found some interesting papers. But I also found
books on FP-programming, which are highly interesting
and available in web.


# Recursion, Iteration
# and
# Functional Languages:

    http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~jhowland/ccsc98/ccsc98/ccsc98.html


This author also has written texts about selecting languages
in computer science education, and other interesting texts too.



# Computer Science:
# Abstraction to Implementation

    http://www.cs.hmc.edu/claremont/keller/webBook/index.htm

Contains a Chapter on High-Level- and one one Low-Level-
Functional Programming (Chap. 3 and Chap. 4).
Covers Object-Oriented programming as well.



# LISP Primer:
    http://grimpeur.tamu.edu/~colin/lp/



I have found other interesting material on tail-recursion,
but did not add all these here. If the explanations in the
above-books are not enough, ask me (or google).

But one paper on tail-recursion (forgotten the URL, but the
filename is: "primitive-slides.pdf") I can recommend:

   John Cowles, Consistelntly Adding Primitive Recursive
                Functions in ACL2 

Explains tail-recursion in a more abstratced way, but does
use abstracted formalisms: does not leave the programmers
perspective and therefore is a very good attempt to
do it abstract as well as grounded :)
That's, what I like, and how programmers can learn new
stuff, even if they are not researchers.

(When formalisms are introduced more gently (maybe two-column
 page layout and on one column using this style of "concrete abstraction"
 and  on the other column using formalisms, then you can gain
 more understanding in your readers... so, the mentioned paper can be
 seen as using an "example" as a specification/explanation of a concept.
 This is a very good attempt!  Because functional languages are
 often explained as "executable" specifications, why not using
 this advantage of FPLs to explain the programming concepts? (...) ))



Ciao,
   Oliver

P.S.: It seems to me, that my style of writing texts should be a hint
      to start Lisp-Programming. ;-)
