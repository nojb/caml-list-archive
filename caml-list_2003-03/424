Are you saying because they cross reference each other, or because they are 
the same name?  If -pack was changed to work in the way we've been talking 
about (basically, the submodules are in a cma not cmo), then the user of 
the libraries could just pack them in different outer names, no?  In other 
words, -pack would be able to be used as a namespace renamer, or as a 
library packer, etc., but it has the advantage of being a single solution 
as opposed to having a namespace and a pack syntax/semantic.  If you've 
got  cross referencing, say A uses B version 1 and you want to use B 
version 2, then you pack A and Bv1 into a single ABv1 library, and you use 
B and it should "just work".

Assuming it's not impossible to make -pack work this way (not forcing link 
of all submodules), it seems better to have a single solution as opposed to 
multiple.  Unless I'm missing something?
