Hello to everybody.
I'd like to say a word about the recent thread about "a good introductory 
OCaml book", yet I'm starting a new thread because I don't agree about the 
idea that introduction to Ocaml shall pass through a book.

Personally, I landed on Ocaml with no programming experience other than PHP; 
no math background; the age of 29.

I got the O'reilly book in french and felt the lack of a ocaml-beginners' 
list; I asked Xavier Leroy for his agreement and an ocaml-beginners' list 
could start.

Still now, I think that only the ocamlers can promote Ocaml. In my opinion, 
today it is so easy to set up a users' contributed site (see for instance 
http://www.spip.org) that it is not only old-fashioned, but also harmful to 
think about "closed" books. 

What am I thinking about? 
	1) take the ocaml manual
	2) put it in a SPIP, one article per page
	3) let users contribute for each page, like you can see here: 	
http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php

Why don't I do that? I've not done that YET.

Let me know your advice. BTW, I plan to start mirroring a copy of the manual. 
What is the license for the manual? is it FDL?

Ernesto
