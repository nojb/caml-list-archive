Um, those of us who actually *care* about our craft, and realize that if 
we just learn what our job needs us to know *right now* enough to have us 
take time off to be taught it, we'll become dinosaurs?  And/or 
unemployeed, when we're replaced by someone who *did* go out and learn the 
hot new technology?

I'm assuming you meant this humorously- but it's a serious question I've 
been asked myself.
