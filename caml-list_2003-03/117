In my experience, the term "enterprise application" is not used 
generically for all custom or behind-the-scenes application used in an 
enterprise. Rather, it's used more specifically for applications that 
handle large amounts of data managed in databases; stuffing data into 
and getting it out of a DB and accomodating business processes while 
doing so.

I've been working on this kind of software for a couple of years and 
can't say that I'm particularly attracted to it. To be sure, I 
recognize that there are interesting aspects to it, but it's not what I 
myself find interesting. Also, as I said before, I don't see that OCaml 
provides a decisive advantage for *this* kind of software.
