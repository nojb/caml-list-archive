Having looked at it a bit myself, the fix will probable be *ahem* 
interesting.  Effectively, you have to stop using C's printf.  Either 
that, or parse the format string a second (third?) time to see wether you 
need to do a signed or unsigned int conversion.  Or, I suppose, we could 
completely redesign Ocaml to use 32-bit ints and do something else to 
differentiate ints from pointers :-).

More pragmatically, I think this behavior should just be documented.  
"Broken as designed".  Once you know about it, it's annoying not critical.
