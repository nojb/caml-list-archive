I sincerely doubt it, the debian ocaml-doc package is in the non-free
section, and the copyright file says :

The present documentation is copyright © 2001 Institut National de
Recherche
en Informatique et en Automatique (INRIA). The Objective Caml
documentation
and user's manual may be reproduced and distributed in whole or in part,
subject to the following conditions:

    * The copyright notice above and this permission notice must be
      preserved complete on all complete or partial copies.
    * Any translation or derivative work of the Objective Caml documentation
      and user's manual must be approved by the authors in writing before
      distribution.
    * If you distribute the Objective Caml documentation and user's manual
      in part, instructions for obtaining the complete version of this manual
      must be included, and a means for obtaining a complete version provided.
    * Small portions may be reproduced as illustrations for reviews or quotes
      in other works without this permission notice if proper citation is given.

So, i guess you need permission from the authors for your project.

Friendly,
