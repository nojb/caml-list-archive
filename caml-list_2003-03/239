"Unix System Programming with Standard ML" ( available online at 
http://web.access.net.au/felixadv/smlbook.html ), has a nice writeup on
tail recursion in the "loops and recursion" section.  The book also has
the desirable property that (at least in this section) it compares and
contrasts functional style with imperative style, including
representing the same problem in both C and SML.

I've only read the section on tail recursion, so I can't comment on the
rest of the book, but it looks very promising so far.
