I have a recursive type where I'd like one of the constructors of the
type to contain a set of the type (or something like set).  However, I
can't figure out how to represent this.

For example:

type foo =
  | Integer of int
  | String of string
  | Set of FooSet

module FooSet = Set.Make (struct type t = foo let compare = compare end)

but this obviously doesn't work.

I suspect putting type foo in a functor can somehow make it work, but I
haven't quite figure out how to do it.

Thanks,
Dave Brown
