Hi,

I vaguely remember that the problem was a defiency of the early=20
versions of Tk (you know, back in the 4.x versions). Of course, it=20
would now make sense to have a better interface to the Tcl FileHandler=20=

API.
We could have a camltk_createfilehandler and camltk_deletefilehandler=20
mirroring the Tcl API, allowing for the TCL_READABLE and TCL_WRITEABLE=20=

flags, with backward compatibility for the old API implemented with the=20=

new one (e.g. add_file_input would call createhandler with=20
TCL_READABLE).
Seems possible.
Anyone has the time to write a patch ;-) ?
