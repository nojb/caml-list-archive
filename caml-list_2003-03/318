And making that example_types.ml instead of .mli will allow exceptions (and 
values!), but I'd prefer having a pure .mli file as you suggest, and just 
creating a fourth file example_exns.ml for any example exceptions. 

Is this "extra interface file" trick in the FAQ yet? 

This is one of those things that bugged me a bit when I was first learning 
OCaml, but it's no longer an issue.
