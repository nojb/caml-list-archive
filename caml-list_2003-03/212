If you are really desparate to be able to do this kind of thing, that is, to 
write your programs in a top down fashion, you can do it right now in OCaml, 
sans CamlP4, by writing code like 

    let rec main () = 
       let foo_arg = foo_aux () in 
        foo foo_arg 
    and foo = ... 
    and foo_aux = ...

I agree that "where" is nice, and there are other features of Revised I like a lot 
(I prefer that syntax to the classic one in fact) but it's hard to get too 
worked up about this issue, and I don't find what I wrote above counterintuitive 
at all.
