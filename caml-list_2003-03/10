Personally, I think it is much better to have the sources uploaded to
a central repository.

A couple times I have gone to the Hump, and the link for a package no
longer exists. If that author had uploaded to a centralized server,
the package is not subject to "link rot". I think this kind of problem
becomes much more frustrating for the user when dependencies become
involved, and one of the prerequsites needed by the package you really
want to install has gone missing. A centralized archive is also a boon
to those who do not have easy access to a stable server that can host
their package.

For some time now, I have been thinking about how nice a "COAN" for
Ocaml would be ... I would like to help out.

Cheers,
Doug
