I know a couple of people who work in this field, and from their
experiences the #1 with a bullet delay is the database.  They spend a lot
of time optimizing their queries and table structures (where you put
indexes, etc).  And no time what so ever optimizing their code, because it
just doesn't matter.  If the DB query is going to take 15 minutes, it's
not going to matter much if the code firing off the query takes 1ms or
100ms.  In code, they look for ease of development and maintainance more 
so than performance.

Which is why Java took off *despite* it's earlier (and, to a certain 
extent, continuing) performance problems.

Java is huge, but PowerBuilder (still), VisualBasic, and Perl all have
signifigant market shares.
