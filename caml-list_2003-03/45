I did a lot of work on this a while back, but got bogged down with other
things. I think all that's left in what I was working on is adding
getaddrinfo and getnameinfo support. I might blow the dust off in it in a
bit, but it'll be a while, as I'm very busy with other things, and when it
comes to ocaml stuff, another ocaml-mysql release has priority. That should,
free time permitting, happen next week. Then I can hopefully dig out the
ipv6 stuff.
