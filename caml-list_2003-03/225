Let me recommend: The Little MLer.
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTML/

Mostly as an experienced programmer you can think
through the examples in your mind, or on paper.

If you want to run the SML examples, it includes a
recipe for translating them into OCaml (of course, it
would be better to have a separate version with thie
examples in OCaml, but...)

For experienced procedural or oo programmers part of
the frustration is that we have been spoiled by the
mass of material that is available for procedural and
oo programming.

There are shelf-loads of books aimed at teaching
procedural programmers how to do OO programming
step-by-step (how to structure a problem to match OO):
deciding what objects should exist, deciding what
relationships should exist between them, ...

It's much more difficult to find material that aims to
teach procedural programmers or OO programmers, how to
do functional programming step-by-step.

best wishes, Isaac
