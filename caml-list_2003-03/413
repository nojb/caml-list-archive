How do you make sure that two different libraries never use the same
namespace ?  And if I need to use two versions of the same library
in my program, how do you make sure that two versions of the same
library never use the same namespace ?

You can't avoid renaming of imports unless you have a centralized
allocation of namespaces, and _that_ sounds like an ugly hack to me.
