Actually, appendix A in the English version was updated to OCaml 3.04,
which is 3.06 minus the polymorphic methods and record fields.  It
could be updated to 3.06 without much effort.

Everything else uses 2.04 indeed, but OCaml 2.04 is still a (very
large) subset of 3.06, so everything that is described in the book
still applies to 3.06.  And I like the idea that the body of the book
describes and uses a large, stable subset of the language, while some
of the more advanced, less stable features are described separately in
an appendix.

It's Javascript code, actually, and it is totally impenetrable :-)
Interested Javascript hackers can have a look at
        http://caml.inria.fr/oreilly-book/html/videoc.js
If you manage to get it to work under Mozilla, you'll be thanked
profusely.
