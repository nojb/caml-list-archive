I have experience with VxWorks.  Its "POSIX compliance" is narrow.  
Code is generally cross-compiled and deployment is much more like 
loading a module into a dynamic kernel rather than launching a POSIX 
process.

I would expect that some non-trivial labor would be involved in porting 
the build process for the byte-code interpreter to make it live with 
the VxWorks cross-development tools in $WIND_BASE/host/$arch/bin.  Then 
there would likely be a collection of issues revolving around symbol 
conflicts, i.e. things defined in the byte-code interpreter that are 
provided by VxWorks-- or by whatever other Wind River platform packages 
you're using.  There would finally be issues associated with making the 
VxWorks IPC mechanisms available to OCaml programs.

The native-code compiler could also be a major additional headache if 
the CPU of your target is something weird, like say an ARM processor.

I like OCaml, but I suspect that Lua might be a better choice for 
bringing functional programming to the embedded application world.  It 
would probably be a lot easier to get Lua up and running under VxWorks.
