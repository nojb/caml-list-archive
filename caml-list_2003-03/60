Hello to everybody
 
I've recompiled a copy of ocaml 3.0.6 with the -pthreads option, and then 
tried several times to recompile ocamlfind, but both findlib-0.7.2 and 
findlib-0.8.1 stop seeing META files that are at their level, even after a 
fresh install of the ocamlfind.conf file.
 
I was used to perform installs starting ocamlfind at the place where the META 
of the package to install was, generally the same as the place where I 
compiled from
 
Why so?
 


Here are more infos. I'm running a RH8.0
 
$ which ocamlopt
 /usr/local/bin/ocamlopt
 

$ ocamlfind printconf
 Effective configuration:
 Configuration file:
     /usr/local/etc/ocamlfind.conf
 Search path:
     /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib
 Packages will be installed in/removed from:
     /usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib
 META files will be installed in/removed from:
     the corresponding package directories
 The standard library is assumed to reside in:
     /usr/local/lib/ocaml
 The ld.conf file can be found here:
     /usr/local/lib/ocaml/ld.conf
 

Thank you for any hint
 
Ernesto
