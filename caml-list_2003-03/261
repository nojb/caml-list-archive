I went back to my code and put flushes after all writes. It still did 
not help. Furthermore, once I replaced output_value by Unix.write (not 
followed by flushes) lseek worked perfectly well! So I am not sure 
whether the problem is due to non-flushing or not. Furthermore I 
observed that in the Unix module there is no way to flush/sync a file. 
Is it not needed? Apparently not.
