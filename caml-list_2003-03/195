But it seems to me that the objective of such manual is
to distract the user from the language, not to attract. :)

If you tell the user that the language you are presenting
is very different from those languages that he is used
to respect, I'd bet that he will think you language is
worse. :-)

Any concentration of differences is very dangerous.
