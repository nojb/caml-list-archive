Yes, I agree here fully.

If you had asked me this last week, I would have
a different opinion.

But I now have seen this very impressive.

But on the first view this is not to see!
I often thought, that verbosity is annoying,
and perls "short constructs" are useful
to achieve faster development.

I recently saw that this is not the case.

But I'm shure, that it is a very common
assumption....
