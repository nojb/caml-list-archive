camomile-0.3.0 is released.  camomile is a Unicode library for ocaml.
Currently camomile provides

  * Unicode data types.  (Base, UTF8) the Unicode character type and
  several Unicode string implementations. (abstract type internally
  implemented as int array, resizable character array, and UTF8
  encoded normal string.)  Most string API of camomile is a functor over
  string implementation.  Also it should be easy to add new
  implementation as OS wch.

  * Character info.  (UCharInfo)

  * Code converter. (CharEncodings)
  about 200 encodings are supported.  Conversion is either string to
  string, Unicode string to/from string, OO-channel, and Stream.

  * Unicode normalforms, NFD NFKD NFC NFKC. (Normalform)
  Due to the presence of combined characters such as accents, Unicode
  strings have several equivalent representations.  Unicode standard
  defines several "normal forms" for such cases.  This module provides
  conversion to such normal forms.

  * Case mappings (CaseMap) 
  Internationalised case mapping.  German eszet, Greek sigma, Turkish i
  (for Turkish locale) are correctly handled.  (Azeri and Lithuanian
  supports are implemented but not tested) Behaviour of case mapping
  can be adjusted by locale.

  * String Comparison (UCol)
  Behaviour of comparison also can be adjusted by locale.  By default,
  it uses Unicode collation algorithm.  (I believe it is the same as
  Java.)

Changes from 0.2.x are

* Functor design: OO-design is abandoned.  API taking unicode strings
now becomes functors over unicode string implementation.

* The locale can be specified for case mapping and string comparison.

Still quality of the code is alpha, I think.
