Yes. I'm glad I made my point clear.

It doesn't really matter to me. I don't advocate the 
explicit use of the "namespace" keyword. I don't care at 
all, so long as naming problems are kept at the naming level 
and linking problems at the linking level.

I think this solution is unduly complex to implement, but 
then again, I am a caml rider, not a caml breeder...

This is my suggestion: use a minor backward compatible 
syntax extension to allow for namespace use.

Not that I know of.

Right.

Cheers, Chris.
