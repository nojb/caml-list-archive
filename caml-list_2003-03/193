Thanks again.  I am downloading it now.

No, no.  That was really a tangent.  It would _also_ be
great to have an OCaml cookbook.  But, really, learning
how to program OCaml well is of primary concern.

Excellent.  That is what I'm after.

Sorry I was under the mistaken impression that the first edition
of the book used plain old Lisp, with only later editions using
Scheme.

Yes, I have heard great things about both Lisp and Scheme.
And I would love to learn them, along with Haskell, Erlang,
and Prolog (which I have also heard great things about).
But there are only so many hours in the day.  And right now
my focus is on OCaml.  If I absolutely have to learn another
language in order to master the functional style then I will,
but I would much rather were I able to kill two birds with one
stone and master the functional style just with OCaml, and move
on to other languages at my leisure.

Thank you for your help and recommendations,
