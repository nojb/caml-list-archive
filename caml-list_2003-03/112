Is software development in industry only about GUI screens, web pages 
and database access? Well, from my own experience, I fear the answer is 
mostly yes. That being as it is, would things in industry be that much 
better if OCaml had everything it takes for writing enterprise 
applications? Could OCaml in this area bring such a big improvement 
over, say, Java and J2EE? Or are there other -- niche? -- areas where 
the advantages OCaml provides are far more important?
