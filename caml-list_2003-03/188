The PLT people has done a lot of work on teaching
Scheme (think of it as dynamically typed O'Caml ;-) to
beginner programmers.  I've run some courses teaching
Scheme to programmers with a lot of Java experience
but little FPL experience and it has gone very well. 
I recommend that anyone considering writing an
introductory book on O'Caml take a look at their work:

  http://htdp.org/  is the "how to program" textbook
  http://htus.org/  is the "how to do useful things"
companion (in progress)
  http://teachscheme.org/ is the project

Whilst HtDP doesn't go far enough for the type of book
people on this list are talking about the basic
approach to teaching is well worth imitating.  It's
also worth looking at for anyone trying to learn
O'Caml (don't suffer from Not Invented Here syndrome!)
