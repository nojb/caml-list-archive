 From the labltk README,

"In CamlTk, we have only one widget type, [widget]. This type is equivalent
to the LablTk's type [any widget]. Therefore, if you want to apply CamlTk
functions to LablTk widget, you can use [coe] function to coerce it to
[any widget]."

So it's short for "coerce."  Hope that helps.
