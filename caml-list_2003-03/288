Back from holidays. ;-)

For people who are really interested I put the last version of the 
sources at

   http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~rossberg/hocaml-0.12.tgz

But please be aware that the code is almost 5 years old, was kind of 
work in progress, and must have experienced a fair amount of bit rot by 
now. Last time I checked it still built, though.

I'm not entirely happy with some of the syntactic decisions I made. 
Also, I'm not sure whether the preprocessor approach really is terribly 
useful for this kind of thing. But if somebody feels like digging into 
it, feel free to contact me for questions.

Enjoy,

   - Andreas
