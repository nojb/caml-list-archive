www.dese.org.uk

Proceedings will be published by IEEE

*** Submission Deadline: 30th June 2014 ***


Recent years have witnessed increasing interest and development in computer=
ised systems and procedures,
which exploit the electronic media in order to offer effective and sophisti=
cated solutions to a wide range of
real-world applications. Innovation and research development in this rapidl=
y evolving area of eSystems has
typically been reported on as part of cognate fields such as, for example: =
Information and Communications
Technology, Computer Science, Systems Science, Social Science and engineeri=
ng. This conference, on the
developments in eSystems Engineering will act as a platform for disseminati=
ng and discussing new research

 reviewed by international
experts and accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings publi=
shed by the Conference
Publication Services (CPS) for worldwide presence. The event provides autho=
rs with an outstanding
opportunity for networking and presenting their work at an international co=
nference. The location offers an
especially attractive opportunity for professional discussion, socialising =
and sightseeing.

DeSE 2014 conference is technically co-sponsored by IEEE. DeSE 2014 compris=
