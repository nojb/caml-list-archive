The IEEE WiMob conference is an international forum for the exchange of
experience and knowledge among researchers and developers concerned with
wireless and mobile technology. For nine years, the International IEEE WiMob
conference has provided unique opportunities for researchers to interact,
share new results, show live demonstrations, and discuss emerging directions
in Wireless Communications, Mobile Networking and Ubiquitous Computing.

IEEE WiMob 2014 will take place at Larnaca, Cyprus, between October 8 to
10th, 2014. It will be held at the Golden Bay Beach Hotel, a luxurious 5 st=
