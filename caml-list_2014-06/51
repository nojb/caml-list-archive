Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Thoughts on targeting windows

Core_kernel is pure OCaml, and so should work fine on Windows (and Javascri=

 as others have noted, works out of the box. Usually, I find that the bigge=

asis, OCamlbuild and so on) making na=C3=AFve decisions about Windows but t=
hat doesn't usually take much patching.

Windows or something... that should avoid accidentally selecting a Unix-onl=

 Linux but the reverse isn't necessarily true.
