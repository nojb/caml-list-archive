Subject: [Caml-list] ICFP 2014 Call for Participation

[ Please note that much of the block reservation of hotel rooms
  currently being held for ICFP participants will be released next
  week.  The beginning of September is a very busy conference week in
  G=C3=B6teborg, so there is high pressure on hotel rooms in that period.
  If you plan to attend ICFP 2014, it would be best to make your hotel
  reservations now before the block reservation expires. ]
