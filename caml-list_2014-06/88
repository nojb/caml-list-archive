Thank you for the quick answer. That seems the right transition path for the code of a project, but
I wonder what happen at a bigger scale.

After the transition projects will need to support older versions of ocaml that perhaps don't have
extension points. Moreover every projects will not do the transition at the same time.

It seems, IMHO, that type-conv will have to work for the following cases transparently:

- camlp4 (with ocaml < 4.02 or >= 4.02) old syntax
- camlp4 (with ocaml < 4.02 or >= 4.02) new syntax

- extension point (with ocaml >= 4.02) new syntax


Do you agree with that? Do you think it is doable/maintainable until ocaml < 4.02 are not used anymore?


Best,
