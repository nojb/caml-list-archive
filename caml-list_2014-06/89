We actually had a discussion about this internally, and I was mostly
convinced that my transition plan is the wrong one --- that it's
probably better to leave the old camlp4 based syntax extensions as
they are, and just mothball them; leave them around, but stop
improving them.  And then people who want to use the new and
better-supported extensions will need to flip to using ppx.  And you
can use the camlp4-based solution to straddle the gap if you need to
support both new and old compilers.
