*** FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS  ***

26th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence
ICTAI 2014

November 10-12, 2014, Limassol, Cyprus

http://ictai2014.cs.ucy.ac.cy

*** Extended Submission Deadline: 14th July 2014 ***


Aim & Scope
The annual IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial
Intelligence (ICTAI) provides a major international forum where
the creation and exchange of ideas related to artificial intelligence
are fostered among academia, industry, and government agencies.
The conference facilitates the cross-fertilization of these ideas and
promotes their transfer into practical tools, for developing intelligent
systems and pursuing artificial intelligence applications. The ICTAI
encompasses all technical aspects of specifying, developing and
evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and applied mechanisms
of the AI-based components of computer tools such as algorithms,
architectures and languages.

Paper Submission
The submissions should contain original, high quality, not submitted
or published elsewhere work. Papers should be submitted electronically
through the EasyChair system in pdf format and should conform to IEEE
specifications (single-spaced, double-column, 10-point font size, up to 8
pages).

Paper Presentation
Each accepted paper should be presented by one of the authors and
accompanied by at least one full registration fee payment, to guarantee
publication in the proceedings. All accepted papers will be included in
proceedings of ICTAI 2014 that will be published by the IEEE Computer
Society.

IJAIT special issue

for publication in a special issue of the International Journal on Artifici=
al
Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) (SCI Indexed).

Important Dates
Paper submission: July 14, 2014 (extended)
Paper notification: August 21, 2014
