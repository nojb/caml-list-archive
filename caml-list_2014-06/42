Here is the Windows installer:

http://protz.github.io/ocaml-installer/

This also installs 'ocamlfind', which means that you can download source 
packages for libraries you're interested in, compile them, install them 
and use them relatively easily. Not as convenient as OPAM, of course.

Here is a library for cryptography:

https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/cryptokit/

Here is a library for concurrency which runs on Windows:

http://ocsigen.org/lwt/

Here is a different Standard Library replacement/augmentation:

https://github.com/ocaml-batteries-team/batteries-included

(The software I build for Windows, whilst complex in terms of what it 
does, is just a single statically linked executable which reads a file, 
processes it and writes a file, so I can't tell you anything about 
networking under Windows.)

Thanks,
