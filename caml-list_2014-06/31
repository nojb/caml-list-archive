Subject: [Caml-list] Final call for talk proposals: HOPE'14 (Workshop on
 Higher-Order Programming with Effects, affiliated with ICFP'14)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                     CALL FOR TALK PROPOSALS

                            HOPE 2014

                 The 3rd ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
               Higher-Order Programming with Effects

                         August 31, 2014
                       Gothenburg, Sweden
                    (the day before ICFP 2014)

                   http://hope2014.mpi-sws.org

----------------------------------------------------------------------

HOPE 2014 aims at bringing together researchers interested in the design,
semantics, implementation, and verification of higher-order effectful
programs. It will be *informal*, consisting of invited talks, contributed
talks on work in progress, and open-ended discussion sessions.


---------------------
Goals of the Workshop
---------------------

A recurring theme in many papers at ICFP, and in the research of many
ICFP attendees, is the interaction of higher-order programming with
various kinds of effects: storage effects, I/O, control effects,
concurrency, etc. While effects are of critical importance in many
applications, they also make it hard to build, maintain, and reason
about one's code. Higher-order languages (both functional and
object-oriented) provide a variety of abstraction mechanisms to help
"tame" or "encapsulate" effects (e.g. monads, ADTs, ownership types,
typestate, first-class events, transactions, Hoare Type Theory,
session types, substructural and region-based type systems), and a
number of different semantic models and verification technologies have
been developed in order to codify and exploit the benefits of this
encapsulation (e.g. bisimulations, step-indexed Kripke logical
relations, higher-order separation logic, game semantics, various
modal logics). But there remain many open problems, and the field is
highly active.

The goal of the HOPE workshop is to bring researchers from a variety
of different backgrounds and perspectives together to exchange new and
exciting ideas concerning the design, semantics, implementation, and
verification of higher-order effectful programs.

We want HOPE to be as informal and interactive as possible. The
program will thus involve a combination of invited talks, contributed
talks about work in progress, and open-ended discussion
sessions. There will be no published proceedings, but participants
will be invited to submit working documents, talk slides, etc. to be
posted on this website.


-----------------------
Call for Talk Proposals
-----------------------

We solicit proposals for contributed talks. Proposals should be at
most 2 pages, in either plain text or PDF format, and should specify
how long a talk the speaker wishes to give. By default, contributed
talks will be 30 minutes long, but proposals for shorter or longer
talks will also be considered. Speakers may also submit supplementary
material (e.g. a full paper, talk slides) if they desire, which PC
members are free (but not expected) to read.

We are interested in talks on all topics related to the interaction of
higher-order programming and computational effects. Talks about work
in progress are particularly encouraged. If you have any questions
about the relevance of a particular topic, please contact the PC
chairs at the address hope2014 AT mpi-sws.org.

Deadline for talk proposals: 	June 13, 2014 (Friday)

Notification of acceptance:   	July 4, 2014 (Friday)

Workshop:    	 August 31, 2014 (Sunday)

The submission website is now open:

Verifying Security Properties of SES Programs
Philippa Gardner, Imperial College London


Secure ECMAScript (SES) is a subset of JavaScript, designed in such a
way that untrusted code can safety co-exist with trusted code. We
introduce a program logic for verifying security properties of SES
programs. It follows separation logic in that we can make local
assertions about local state. It is different from separation logic in
that we can also make global assertions about the global state and its
interface with the local state. For example, we can globally assert
that untrusted objects do not contain pointers to local trusted
objects. Such assertions are key for describing security properties of
common SES programs. This logic builds on the work of Gardner, Maffeis
and Smith on reasoning about a core fragment of JavaScript (POPL2012),
and the recent work of Smith on extending the logic to handle
higher-order functions.

This is joint work with Gareth Smith and Thomas Wood, Imperial.
