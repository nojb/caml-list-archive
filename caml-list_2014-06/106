[Please post - apologies for multiple copies.]

Deadline Extension
================================================
SCSS 2014
Symbolic Computation in Software Science   
6th International Symposium 

Gammarth, La Marsa, Tunisia, December 7-11, 2014
http://www.easychair.org/smart-program/SCSS2014/
================================================

Important Dates
---------------
July 7, 2014: Abstract submission deadline (extended)
July 14, 2014: Paper submission deadline (extended)
August 25, 2014: Notification
September 22, 2014: Camera-ready copy deadline
December 7-11, 2014: SCSS 2014 in Gammarth

Scope
--------
The purpose of SCSS 2014 is to promote research on theoretical and practical 
aspects of symbolic computation in software science. The symposium provides 
a forum for active dialog between researchers from several fields of computer 
algebra, algebraic geometry, algorithmic combinatorics, computational logic, 
and software analysis and verification.

SCSS 2014 solicits both regular and tool papers on all aspects of symbolic 
computation and their applications in software science. The topics of the 
symposium include, but are not limited to the following:

- automated reasoning
- algorithm (program) synthesis and/or verification
- formal methods for the analysis of network security
- termination analysis and complexity analysis of algorithms (programs)
- extraction of specifications from algorithms (programs)
- theorem proving methods and techniques
- proof carrying code
- generation of inductive assertion for algorithm (programs)
- algorithm (program) transformations
- formalization and computerization of knowledge (maths, medicine, economy, etc.)
- component-based programming
- computational origami
- query languages (in particular for XML documents)
- semantic web and cloud computing

Submission
----------
Submission is via EasyChair:

 https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scss2014

Submissions are invited in two categories: regular research papers and tool 
papers.

- Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages in the EasyChair Class format, 
with up to 3 additional pages for technical appendices.
- Tool papers must not exceed 6 pages in the EasyChair Class format.

Publication
----------
The proceedings will be published in the EasyChair Proceedings in Computing.
We plan also to have a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation on 
SCSS 2014. The full version of selected papers will be considered for the 
publication of the special issue subjected to the normal peer review process 
of the journal.
