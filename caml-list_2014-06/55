CALL FOR PAPERS

WORKSHOP: Reasoning about other minds: Logical and cognitive perspectives
Groningen, the Netherlands, Monday 4 August and Tuesday morning 5 August,  =
2014

Workshop Goal:
This workshop aims to shed light on models of social reasoning that take in=
to account realistic resource bounds. People reason about other people=92s =
mental states in order to understand and predict the others=92 behavior. Th=
is capability to reason about others=92 knowledge, beliefs and intentions i=
s often referred to as =91theory of mind=92. Idealized rational agents are =
capable of recursion in their social reasoning, and can reason about phenom=
ena like common knowledge. Such idealized social reasoning has been modeled=
 by modal logics such as epistemic logic and BDI (belief, goal, intention) =
logics. However, in real-world situations, many people seem to lose track o=
f such recursive social reasoning after only a few levels. Cognitive scient=
ists build computational models of social reasoning, for example, recently =
an "inverse planning" model based on Bayesian inference frameworks has prov=
en successful in modeling human inferences about the goals and beliefs unde=
rlying other people's observed behavior.

The workshop provides a forum for researchers that attempt to analyze, unde=
rstand and model how resource-bounded agents reason about other minds. The =
workshop is a follow-up on the workshop that was collocated with TARK 2011 =
in Groningen, see http://www.ai.rug.nl/conf/reasoningminds/
(The website of the new workshop will appear shortly at http://www.ai.rug.n=
l/conf/reasoningminds2/ )

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

-Logics modeling human social cognition;
-Computational cognitive models of theory of mind;
-Epistemic game theory;
-Behavioral game theory;
-Relations between language and social cognition;
-Models of the evolution of theory of mind;
-Models of the development of theory of mind in children;
-Models of the neural implementation of social cognition;
-Bounded rationality in multi-agent systems;
-Formal models of team reasoning;
-Theory of mind in specific groups, e.g., persons with autism spectrum diso=
rder;
-Complexity measures for reasoning about other minds.

The Tuesday morning session is organized in cooperation with 'Advances in M=
odal Logic' (see http://www.philos.rug.nl/AiML2014/) and will include an in=
vited lecture by Joe Halpern as well as contributed AiML presentations that=
 are relevant for 'Reasoning about other Minds'.

Invited Speakers for Monday, 4 August: to be announced

Deadline CFP: Please send your extended abstract in PDF format, not exceedi=
ng 4 double-spaced pages (1,500 words) by Tuesday July 1, 2014. The PDF fil=
es have to be uploaded online via the workshop's submission website  https:=
//www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dreasoningminds2014

The author notification date is Monday, July 28, 2014. Authors of accepted =
abstracts will be expected to upload a full version of their paper after th=
e workshop, to be collected in an online workshop proceedings collection th=
at we are setting up. Further details about the proceedings will be made av=
ailable soon.

After the workshop, selected authors will be invited to submit a revised an=
d extended version of their paper for a special issue of a relevant journal=
, to be decided.=20

Sponsor: The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research, in particula=
r the Vici project: =91Cognitive systems in interaction: Logical and comput=
ational models of higher-order theory of mind=92, awarded to Rineke Verbrug=
ge.=20
