CALL FOR PAPERS

C4BD2014

Workshop on COMPLEXITY FOR BIG DATA

Workshop at IEEE BigData 2014, Washington, D.C., U.S.A.
27th, 28th, 29th, or 30th of October 2014 (to be determined)

http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/C4BD2014/

[paper deadline: August 20]

Complexity will lead to both big challenges and opportunities in big 
data research. Complexity in big data can be caused by many factors, 
including:

* large number of features, which are related to each other through a 
rich variety of relationships ranging from simple to complicated;

* a large number of heterogeneous dimensions, which offer a variety of 
kinds of insights and require different treatments, in addition to a 
large number of data records;

* a large variety of heterogeneous types, such as vectors, sequences, 
(labeled) graphs, images, and multimedia, in addition to a large number 
of instances;

* a rich set of logical, semantic, and ontological relationships.

Complexity has often been used to successfully characterize various 
kinds of complicated subjects, for example in computational complexity, 
descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov complexity. Since big data have many 
complicated parts with intricate relationships to each other, the study 
of complexity for big data has potential to be highly successful.

Research on complexity of big data needs to consider the following 
facts, among others:

* Big data can be used for different purposes such as data integration, 
cross domain fertilization, and data mining;

* Structures among various parts of big data can be explicit or hidden, 
and can be described using a rich variety of patterns and models.

The Complexity for Big Data workshop is intended to create an atmosphere 
of exchange of ideas, providing a forum for the presentation and 
discussion of the key topics related to Big Data Complexity, including 
(but not limited to):

* new concepts for complexity for Big Data
* new techniques for handling complexity for Big Data
* analysis of complex relationships
* type logic acquisition
* scalability of type logic reasoning
* dealing with semantic heterogeneity
* dimensionality-reduction techniques
* query and search over multiple data silos
* capture and use of provenance information
* analysis of similarity and differences among heterogeneous parts

SUBMISSION

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit original papers that 
have not been submitted for review or published elsewhere. Submitted 
papers must be written in English and should not exceed 9 pages (IEEE 
BigData Conference foramt) in the case of research and experience 
papers, or 5 pages in the case of position papers (including figures, 
bibliography and appendices). All submitted papers will be judged based 
on their relevance, originality, significance, technical quality and 
organisation. Papers must be submitted through easychair at 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=c4bd.

PRESENTATION

Selected papers will be presented during the workshop. The workshop will 
include extra time for discussion of the presentation allowing the group 
to have a better understanding of the issues, challenges, and ideas 
being presented.

IMPORTANT DATES

Deadline for paper submission: August 20, 2014
Notification of paper acceptance: September 20, 2014
Camera-ready paper due: September 29, 2014
Workshop date: 27th, 28th, 29th or 30th of October, 2014
