Mirage though requires hardware virtualization, which means a quite
recent and powerfull arm board. The Raspberry Pi is way to old for
that (Note: the cpu is way older than what other boards have).

I've written an exokernel that lets me run ocaml barebone on the
Raspberry Pi:

    https://github.com/mrvn/ocaml-rpi

It's at a proof-of-concept stage. You can run simple code with output
on the serial console. The graphics gets initialized too but there is
no ocaml interface for it yet though. I've run into a problem that the
GC will crash after a while that I got stuck on.

The exokernel might be a good starting point for other boards (where
mirage doesn't run) too. You don't need much to get the ocaml runtime
running on some board.

For Arduino the hard part would be to gte ocaml itself build. I don't
think 16-bit values are supported.
