Hi all!

just a small question on how to use the labltk-library :

The manual says :

This interface is generated in an automated way, and you should refer to
Tcl/Tk books and man pages for information on the behaviour of the
numerous functions.

which is okay, but I have the problem that I don't know the
signatures and names of the corresponding ocaml functions.

Is there an uniform way of translating the name/signature of tcl/tk
functions into the corresponding ocaml functions ?

bye,
Axel
