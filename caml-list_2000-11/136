Hello,
         I've been using CAML and PVM for about 5 years now, most recently 
on a cluster of 256 CPUs in 128 boxes.  The code is used for the 
construction of phylogenetic trees from molecular and other data.  All of 
our code is at ftp.amnh.org /pub/molecular/poy. The setup seems to work 
very well, but as mentioned in a previous note, this is message passing and 
has no shared memory among machines.
