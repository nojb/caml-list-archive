Hello,

A quick newbie question:  Is there a way I can print any data type,
like ones I have defined myself?  Something like Lisp's `print'
function would be great.  The OCaml compiler does this when you type
expressions at the toplevel; can I access this from my code?

By the way; I'm surprised that the Caml Hump wasn't prominently listed
on the OCaml web page!  I think libraries and utility software are an
important part of a language's success.  For example, the
OcamlMakefile saved me a fair amount of time.
