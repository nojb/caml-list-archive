List,
    I still cannot figure out why the assert instruction
does not return the line number at which the exception occures.
The characters are no good to me in debugging. I suppose they make
sense from the compiler's point of view, but they are no use to me. 

Suppose one has a LARGE ocaml file, with several "assert" instructions. 
When an assert exception occures, it is not an easy task to figure out
where it came from. 

  Can someone enlighten me on this point?

	Ohad.
