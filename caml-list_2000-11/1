Thanks for the excellent tool!

Another useful variable to check for, in the case of the byte-code compiler,
is whether it was compiled with native or user-level threads, as the Thread
interface differs for each (e.g. user-threads support the kill operation but
native threads don't), and there are some other, more subtle differences.
