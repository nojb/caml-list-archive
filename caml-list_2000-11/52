I will be waiting to see what kind of responses you get but
wanted to add my own feedback.
I got looking at Ocaml because a program I use was written on
it, Unison.

I ordered a book, The Functional Approach to Programming, and
although it does help somewhat it is too theoretical/math
oriented. So are most of the docs and examples I have seen. 

I don't see many pratical-simple examples of Ocaml and so far
the things I have thought of trying Ocaml took me too long to
figure them out. Even with no pratical previous perl experience
using a Perl book in less than a day I had got the basics and
was on my way to been productive. I am not sure this could be
possible with Ocaml.

Is Ocaml best for larger more complex tasks?
