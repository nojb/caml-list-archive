Right, I didn't mean to say they're completely equivalent (I've read the FAQ), just that I expected equivalence in that case.

Ah, now I see, it's because the parameter in function is actually the pattern in an implicit match?

Is there ever a reason to use function (assuming you don't mind parenthesizing constructors and whatnot in fun arguments)?  Does the implied match allow some simplification or optimization or something?  Why do they both exist?

As I said, I've read the FAQ, but I can't see why you'd ever use function when you've got fun...

Thanks,
Chris
