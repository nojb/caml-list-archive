Nope, but I do think that for the average  "business/database"
programmer math doesn't do all that much. Specially if working
with an SQL database AND you are not doing DBA work.

Haven't got to that chapter yet.

I noticed. :-(

That would be great, although I don't know what kind of market
there is for it. After all how many people have even heard of
Ocaml or even ML? compared to other languages probably a few
small percentage. The main reason this is important is because
that is exactly what publishers look at.

Haven't got to that point yet either.

Don't know if it would sell lots of copies, but it would surely
make learning the language much easier.
