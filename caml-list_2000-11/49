Depends on the application. Consider for example a browser in which
when you hit the 'back' button, you want to go back to the same
state as previously: with purely functional data structures attached
to a state object, going back is a simple matter of popping the state
object from a stack (and re-rendering :-)

This is not so easy to do with a more extensively mutable state object.
