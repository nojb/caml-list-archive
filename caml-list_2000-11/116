Answers for 1 & 2 is true,
for 3 - false: if you try to run the following program:

let _ = Printf.printf "%b\n" 
  (value_of_int 0 == value_of_allocated_value True)

you got "true" as the result.

The cause is the following: variant without arguments 
represented in the same way with int's.

Correct solution will be:

type allocated_value =
  Bool of bool 
| String of string 
| Array of value
