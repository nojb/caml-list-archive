Hello,

has anybody already considered implementing an interface to the
libplot-library?

  http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils

It is very portable, knows many target "plotters" (from X-windows to
various image formats), has lots of functionality and is thread-safe
(i.e. you can have several independent "plotters" at once).

ADA, Python and Perl already have interfaces so it may already be
considered as a kind of standard in this field.

I don't have time to do it right now, but if anybody wants to give it a
try, I could imagine helping a bit. It doesn't look terribly difficult
and may be a good exercise to try out camlidl...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
