Just a plug: ocamlbrowser is really good at all that.
You can visit modules through navigation, read comments in the .mli's...
You can even search by types, with a few built-in isomorphisms.
Maybe for experienced users full text search is just enough, but
beginners should at least give a try to it.
And it works even if there is no documentation :-) as for labltk :-(
