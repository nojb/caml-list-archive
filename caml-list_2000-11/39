Don't get me wrong.  The "always redefine" approach is just as wrong
as the "never redefine" used by Caml.  It's just that sometimes you want
one and sometimes you want the other.

I remember a proposition for Scheme (maybe from Matthias Blume) to use
`set!' for redefinition and `define' to create a whole new binding.

I'm not sure if Scheme ended up providing such a facility, but it
does sound right to me.
