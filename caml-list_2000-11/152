I guess I should have been a little clearer in my explanation.  The code
isn't documented, or even particularly well written.  I threw it together
during the process of learning ocaml.

Think of it as a proof of concept.  This is a tool I would really like to
see available for ocaml.  The idea comes from the GNU Ada Compiler's
gnatmake utility.

If I ever come up with some time, I may write a real program to do this.  I
posted this in the hopes that someone else would take the concept and
implement the utility.  It needs a lot of work to become a generally useful
utility.
