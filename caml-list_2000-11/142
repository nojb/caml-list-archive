... in response to Xavier...

But as someone who learned to appreciate what CLOS had to offer over the
conventional Smalltalk style of OO, and as an avid user of OCaml, I have to
say that I really miss CLOS sometimes...

I have implemented several large OCaml programs, and I ended up using OO
only sparingly to support a simple hierarchy of COM/OLE encapsulator
objects. So I don't really have any particular example of need for CLOS.  I
just miss its elegant beauty sometimes. Every now and again I sit and write
some Lisp/CLOS just so that I can enjoy the experience. Call me crazy, but I
love functional closures, pattern matching, efficient tail recursion, etc.,
etc. Of course some of these are missing in Common Lisp and so I also write
a great deal of OCaml just so I can experience its special pleasures...
