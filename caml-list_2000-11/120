I am learning OCaml and am confused on the difference between fun and
function. I saw a message to this list earlier, but I didn't understand
it. Could anyone please either explain the difference or point me in the
right direction? I've read the manual and various other docs, but maybe I
missed a clear explaination.

Thank you!
