Sounds like a very useful tool! If I am not mistaken, there have been other
efforts, too. Does anybody know what happened to them? Has anybody already
tried SWIG or similar?

It is probably less effort and gives the OCaml-community more visibility if
we put projects on SourceForge - I'll also do this in the near future.
Furthermore, if the initial author does not have time to maintain them
anymore, others can take over more easily: the hurdle of joining or taking
over a SourceForge project is much lower than for e.g. public cvs only.

Best regards,
