	I can't quite agree with that: reference counting is
a _different_ technique with different properties. In the right
circumstances it is faster than garbage collection, and permits
synchronous, well ordered finalisation. But it is only appropriate
where the 'skeleton' of the data structure is heirarchical, whereas
garbage collection works in general.
