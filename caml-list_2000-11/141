I've tried for about 15 minutes (take the Microsoft Embedded Visual C++ 
environment -- you can order for S&H cost only from MSFT !--, move the byterun 
source files into a project, compile).
Although WinCE 3.0 is supposed to be a Win32 environment, it didn't compile 
immediately. I fooled around a bit, but rapidly abandonned (too hard for me, 
as a first attempt at Windows programming ;-)
Note: for the iPaq 36xx, the Linux ports really seem to go forward, with at 
least two companies promoting their own version. I'm waiting for my serial 
sync cable, and I'll let people know when/if I can run OCaml on it...
