The goal of the Foc project is to have a certified computer algebra library,
and, as part of it we wrote a fairly complete library for abstract and
concrete mathematics which covers the basis for a computer agebra system.
Tthe Foc code is not really public, but is not secret either ; it is simply
not ready for public distribution.


<URL:http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/~foc> 

will give you an idea of what the project is about. 

As of excellency of the code, I don't really know, but you will find
comparisons with the Axiom computer algebra system on our page.

You will also find there an announcement for a meeting we will have on
december 21 and 22. You are welcome if you want to discuss the different
object oriented features we use in the library with us.

Regards,

                        R. Rioboo,
                        for the Foc Project
