Hi,
 
This may not be exactly what you're after, but I'd thought I'd mention
it in case you want to look at it.
 
The compilation manager (CM) for SML/NJ has a parallel and distributed
make option. It seems to use coarse parallelism (multiprocessors, rsh
+ NFS)
 
The manual describes it in section 12
