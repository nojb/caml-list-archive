Exactly.

Pierre> (i.e. top level definitions are treated dynamically):

This is a different issue.  I probably misunderstood you.
Traditionally, dynamic binding means something like this:

(define x 1)
(define (f)
  x)
(let ((x 2))
  (f))

Under dynamic binding (and, in fact, in languages like Common Lisp),
the last expression returns 2.

Binding is not the same thing as assignment.

Pierre> Good! So for built-in procedures we also get static binding at toplevel!

I don't understand what this means: R5RS merely says, that, by
redefining, say, CAR, you won't break MAP.

Right.  I believe this was introduced in R4RS or R5RS.
