Does the Ocaml interpreter provide a mechanism for interactively evaluating
strings or abstract syntax tree representations of Ocaml code? I'm looking
for something along the lines of Common Lisp's "eval" mechanism. If so, does
it work in the presence of the source-level debugger? That is, can I step
into a call to "eval"?

Thanks,

-john
