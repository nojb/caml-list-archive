I find that Emacs is an excellent tool for searching for functions in the
OCaml library.  The developers have helpfully provided a pure-ascii
version of the documentation, and a couple of incremental searches
usually gets me to what I want in a few second.

Occasionally I even do searches based on types.  For example, I can never
remember the convention for naming conversion functions.  Is it
int_to_string or string_to_int or string_of_int or...?  A simple search
for "int -> string" settles the question in moments.  :-)
