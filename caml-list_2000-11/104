	Even sadder (IMHO): while working in a university,
I was told most of the (computer science) academics believed that
most of the theoretical problems of computing were solved, and the
main issues were human ones. Of course, human issues of computing
cannot be belittled ... but we're surely far from having even
a cursory understanding of the mathematics of computing.
