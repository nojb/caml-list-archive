Also notice, ...

I have been working on c2caml, which should become an automatic or
semi-automatic bindings generator from a C header file.

I have not really had time to work on it anymore, so the current status is
that it correctly parses C headers (even some of the GNU extension, it
correctly parses all of the gtk+ headers), but doesn't generate anything yet.

I had a TER student working on it last year, but it didn't go as far as i
hoped, and i proposed it again this year.

If anybody is interrested in working on it, i could try to setup a public cvs
repository of it, or even have it hosted at sourceforge ?

Friendly,

Sven Luther
