It's not very explicit, I agree, but the table of operator precedences
for expressions says that function application has higher precedence
than unary minus.  So, "x-1" cannot be parsed as "x applied to -1"
since this would violate the precedences.  And of course "x-1" cannot
be parsed as "(x applied to -) applied to 1" because "-" in itself is
not a valid expression.  This leaves "x binary minus 1" as the only
legal parsing.
