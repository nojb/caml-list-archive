I am about to embark on a project that seeks to reduce the computation time
of a large problem from 100+ hours to less than 20 minutes. This is
initially though to require a cluster of multiprocessors using either a
Beowulf architecture, or a large, shared memory, message passing,
architecture. I am interested in the suitability (or otherwise) of OCaml to
such computations and the experiences of anyone else in this group on such
architectures. Garbage collection across nodes in a shared memory
architecture seems like a particularly daunting problem.

Any responses would be appreciated.

Thanks,
