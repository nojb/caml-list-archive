I just received the latest copy of IEEE Computer Magazine - I had to double
check that it was this month's issue and not April! The very back article
about the "profession" was written by Neville Holmes, U. of Tasmania. It is
embarrasing to the point that I hesitate to offer that I am a member of the
IEEE Computer Society.

He starts off alright by talking about the difficulty of producing correct
code in the absense of type checking and syntax error reporting (my
interpretation, not his), and then by the third paragraph when he states
"Much could be done to help programmers avoid such coding errors.", he
totally looses me to the point of anger!

He is concerned about coding conventions such as how to abbreviate
identifiers, and how to match up enclosing braces, and placement of
semicolons....

What an opportunity lost to the ML community. Is this all the further we
have managed to come?

Totally Pissed!!!!
