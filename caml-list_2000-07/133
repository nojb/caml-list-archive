Hi Julian,

I've started work on a library to implement internet protocols. One of the
modules has a lexer for mail headers as well as parsers for addresses and
dates. 

The address parser supports all of rfc822 and also includes updates that
have been in later documents.

Also included are modules which implement client-side POP3 and SMTP. You
can get this from:
