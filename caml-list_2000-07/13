Let me add my voice to the crowd: if the default behavior of a failing
caml program were to produce a trace of uncaught exceptions, my life
would be easier.  It will be especially helpful when we start shipping
buggy caml programs to unsuspecting users, who can't reasonably be
asked to run the caml debugger...
