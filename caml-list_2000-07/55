This "feature" comes handy when you want to replace the implementation of
the Array-module while still enjoying syntactic sugar (e.g. you can use my
resizable array module without having to change lots of code).

Unfortunately, if you create arrays with "[| ... |]", you always end up with
ones of the builtin type. So you have to apply a conversion function to
them to get the values you want.
