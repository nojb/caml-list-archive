Subject: overhead of GC in caml runtime?
Sender: weis@pauillac.inria.fr

Can anyone tell me approximately what fraction of time is
spent in garbage collection, or even better, combined allocation and
collection, in typical caml programs?  Or how to get caml to report
this information for a particular program of mine?

thanks,


Norman
