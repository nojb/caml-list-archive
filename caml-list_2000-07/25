It should  be easy to do  with camlp4, since locations  in sources are
bound in the right hand sides of grammar rules. Thus, you just have to
overwrite the syntax of raise so that it actually raises the exception
together with its location, in an exception looking like

  exception LocatedException of exn * (int * int);;

Then, when you want to debug  your program, you compile it with camlp4
and that little extension, instead of ocamlc.

I'm not expert enough  in the use of camlp4 to give  the code for this
extension (by the way, there is no quotation for raising exception, as
far as I looked in the manual) but I'm sure that's no more than two or
three lines of  code. And I don't know if the  current file name being
parsed can be accessed. Surely Daniel will be of some help here if you
ask him.
