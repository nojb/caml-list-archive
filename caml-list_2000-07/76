My mistake.
So your problem is how to bind the Destroy event, avoiding its actual
execution. And I don't know how it can be done; break does not work in
that specific case. Strangely enough, the window is only destroyed
after the script was executed, which gives you time to say to the user
that he has done something wrong, but there is no way to stop it.
Actually I would like to know, since I have uses for it.

Then you will have to stick to Tk, which is available on most platforms.
Having moving APIs in the standard distribution does not sound nice, and
LablGTK's API is not stable yet.
