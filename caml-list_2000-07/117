Of course a trivial approach would be to accept the fact
that O'Caml _has_ true assignable variables, via references.

However, since you sound like you want the _functional_
answer, the insight you're looking for is:

let rec  f v1 v2 i  =  if i=0 then v2   else f v2 (v1+v2) (i-1);;

then:  f 0 1 0  == 1
       f 0 1 1  == 1
       f 0 1 2  == 2
       ...
       f 0 1 10 == 89
