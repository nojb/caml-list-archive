It is unfortunately not possible to use records with the same names at the
same time without putting them into separate modules.

Exactly: names of record fields get overridden by subsequent definitions.
There is no way to get the "old" meaning back without the use of modules.

Using records makes sources more readable and also easier to maintain. For
example, the "with" statement as in

  { some_record with some_field =3D some_value; ... }
 =20
allows adding fields to records without breaking code.
