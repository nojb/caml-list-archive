I registered OCaml on SourceForge for the sole purpose of getting
an account on their "compile farm", and more specifically on their
prototype IA64/Itanium machines.  I'm working on an IA64 port of the
OCaml native-code compiler, and while the initial port was done using
HP's emulator, I needed real hardware to complete it.

IA64 a weird architecture; exploiting all its capabilities is a real
challenge for compiler writers.  OCaml is not going to exploit all of
them (far from it!), but even a relatively naive code generator isn't
easy, especially with all the bugs in the GNU IA64 assembler... 

As for OCaml on SourceForge, I'll put a couple of Web pages pointing
back to the INRIA Web and CVS servers.  I hope the SourceForge people
won't mind this slight bending of their rules!

> PS: now there is 3 OCaml projet under sourceforge !!

I was impressed with the quality of the services offered by
SourceForge, and would encourage that doesn't control their own
servers to host their projects on SourceForge.
