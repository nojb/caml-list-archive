On the other hand, writing the interface _first_ is not always 
appropriate when you want to rapidly prototype experimental code
where you don't actually know what the interface is going to turn
out to be until you experiment.

I often do this, _then_ write an interface, then reimplement
the code cleanly according to this interface. Using this methodology,
I often write the implementation first -- an 'abstraction' of the
interface being in my head:  an easier medium to 'edit' rapidly 
than a text file :-)
