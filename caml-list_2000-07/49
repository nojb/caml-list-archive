For a compiler project I am looking for an IEEE floating point
emulation.  I have already checked http://caml.inria.fr/hump.html and
the OCaml link database for such a libray.  Does anybody has written
something like this for OCaml?

To answer the obvious question, why not use the built in float data
type:  I need access to the representation at the bit level.  Some
code that decodes a float value into a bit vector (int32/int64) and
back would be also helpful.
