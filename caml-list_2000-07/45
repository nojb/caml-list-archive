I have two problems with LablTk :

- I want to prevent a window from being destroyed by the WM : it's a
pretty long to build window, and I'd like to hide it instead of actually
destroy it when the user clicks on the delete button of the window
manager. It's easy to do in some langages such as Java, but I can't find
the way to do it with Labltk.

- I want to use a button to destroy a window. But I can't do

Button.create win ~text:"Close" ~command:(fun _ -> destroy win)

since when the destroy function starts, the button, which belongs to
win, is in use and prevents to destroy its parent win. There is a
specific function (i.e. Tk_EventuallyFree) in Tcl/Tk to handle such
cases, but I don't know how to do with LablTk. What I'm currently doing
is to put the destroying function in a Timer callback, to destroy the
window .1s after the button has been released, but it's not very safe...
