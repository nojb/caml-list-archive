Hello, people.

I have downloaded and succesfully built the ocaml-2.01 distribution on
my Mac (PowerMac G3, MacOS 8.5.1, MPW 3.5d3, Universal Interfaces 3.2).
I wanted to add libnum support to the graphical toplevel, and I
succeeded in linking the libnums.[xo] and nums.cma (as more or less per
:otherlibs:num:README instructions), but got a crash when trying it.
More specifically, what I did was this:

- generate the primitives list, extracting them from nat.ml
- link the C library :otherlibs:num:libums.o together with :byterun:libcamlrun.o
- link the Caml library :otherlibs:num:nums.cma together with the
libraries comprising the toplevel

but it didn't work. Although I undid the mods to the makefile (and I
didn't keep them), I think I can come up again quickly with the setup I used.

What should I have done, or rather, how it is done?

Thank you in advance, and best regards,
Matías

P.S.: I'd be more than happy to share experiences and/or work with the
implementors/maintainers regarding the installation. In particular,
WASTE 1.2 needed a couple of patches to compile successfully with
Universal Interfaces 3.2 (UI 3.1 have errors re. old routine names that
I didn't bother fixing).
