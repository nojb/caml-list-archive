I have a minimal interface for COM already in place for OCAML 2.01. I =
use it to connect with a COM-based universal scientific data server. I =
can handle the OLE types of interest to a scientist... (but not yet for =
things like UUID's and other more bizarred data types). I have to admit, =
that in order to do this I had to stoop to C++ because of the many types =
of ints and floats that are likely to arise, and also because of the =
need to access the SAFEARRAY data structure. I don't know how to do this =
yet in OCAML... It would be really great if OCAML could also be used for =
systems level programming chores like this, and for writing hardware =
control software...
