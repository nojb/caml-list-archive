Hi,
	Why is there no creation function which does not take a default
value for filling the array? When building abstractions like dynamic
arrays or (SRC Modula-3 style) Sequences on top of Arrays I'm forced to 
provide a fill value even though the abstraction really doesn't call for 
one. Is this a simple omission, or is there some compelling reason for 
leaving this out?
