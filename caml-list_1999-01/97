Subject: Catching Break?
Sender: weis


Why doesn't this work:

let main() =
  Sys.catch_break true;
  try Unix.kill (Unix.getpid()) Sys.sigint
  with Sys.Break -> prerr_endline "CAUGHT!"; exit 0

let _ = main()

This program just prints "Fatal error: Uncaught exception Sys.Break"
as if the try block weren't there.  Am I overlooking something really
obvious?

was that the condemned man had no chance at all, absolutely none.
