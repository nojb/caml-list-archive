I haven't read his paper, I just know his book - there is nothing about
the second possibility in it (maybe I have overlooked it).

Anyway, I have compared performance between the two (just for some
common operations). Your version was about 3% faster - not really much,
but I added it again to the repository and renamed the former version to
"sb_ralist2". This should satisfy both the speed-hungry and the advocats
of elegance...

By the way, chapter seven is now available, too. And I have made the
necessary changes so that "PhysicistsQueue" (chapter six) works.

As always:
