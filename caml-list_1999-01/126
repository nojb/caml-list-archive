I wonder if anyone knows how to optimize the following (simplified for the
sake of dicussion) situation:

let global = ref None
let init i =
  global := Some i
let f () =
  match (!global) with
    Some x -> x
  | None -> failwith "not initialized";;
let g() =
  match (!global) with
    ...

Essentially, there is some global state that is initialized once, and is
used by all functions in the module.  In a more realistic situation, this
state might be initialized by reading in a file.  Given that following
initialization the global state never changes, it should be conceivable to
eliminate the match and dereference; on my machine (pentium 166), the match
and dereference result in about a 30% slowdown.  I've fooled around with
some things, but haven't found anything that performs better than this
straightforward approach or is any more elegant.

Thanks,
Mike
