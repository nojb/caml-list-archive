I am currently working on a db interface that connects to Adabas D,
and plan to write another driver for Informix. If somebody else is
interested in that we could share code; most commercial DBMS follow
the ANSI standard for embedded SQL and because of that it should be very 
simple to derive drivers for other DBMS. As far as I know, the free
DBMS have their own specific interfaces; drivers would have to be totally
rewritten.

What would be really nice if Miles is interested in that are tools for
server-side "scripting", as alternative for Perl and Python. This could
mean a good CGI parser, a configurable XML-to-HTML converter, HTTP and
FTP tools, and a killer app showing everybody what's going on.

Another interesting project would be a Corba interface, as Gnome and KDE
want to use Corba. Then Ocaml would be one of the most elegant ways to
write desktop applications.
