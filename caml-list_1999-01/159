Subject: unsigned word type in OCaml?

Hello,

I'm working on a low level systems project, and I'm thinking about using   
OCaml as the langauge.  However, try as I might, I simply cannot find a   
reference to a machine word type.

More specially, I need:
a. byte access to machine words
b. unsigned 32 bit quantities (e.g. physical address)
c. bitwise boolean operations (shifts, not, and & or)

Have I missed something either in the mailing list or the documentation?   
 What about (yuk) storing my OCaml words as strings and then  passing   
these strings to C and operating on them there? Wouldn't be great, but   
maybe a it's a temporary solution.

Thanks,
dave
