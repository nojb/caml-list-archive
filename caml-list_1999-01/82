Perhaps the solution is to have an improved implementation of the 'a
option type, where a NULL pointer would mean "None" and anything else
would be the element of type 'a.

Is there anything wrong with this approach? [except that it could break
some interfaced C code that relies on NULL pointers in "private" types..]
