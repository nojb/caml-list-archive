Thanks again for all your ideas.  I'm afraid enhancements to
OCaml's container libraries or parsing tools are beyond my abilities at the
moment, even though I think those are both worthwhile projects.  I think I'll
start with some database interfaces and perhaps also investigate OCaml web
scripting.  

Gerd Stolpmann's suggestion that some kind of Corba integretation should be
provided is a good one, I think.  I'd have more luck using OCaml at
work if I could hide it behind IDL.  Has anyone investigated Corba or
COM bindings for OCaml?

( Please excuse the absence of a French translation.  My grade-school French
could only confuse things. )
