Hi,

I am looking for a document containing the whole ocaml syntax
such that it is suitable for quick reference. The best would be a
html page where each non-terminal is a hot reference to its
definition. Or a ASCII file, for which one can built a TAGS
table. Is there anything such?

Does such a grammar summary exists for olabl?

Bye,

Hendrik
