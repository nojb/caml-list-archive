On the other hand - if one hard-codes in a value for sigint..

let interrupt_handle _ = prerr_endline "Caught C-c"; exit 0;;
Sys.set_signal 2 ( Sys.Signal_handle interrupt_handle );
print_string "You have 10 seconds to stop me with C-c";
print_newline ();
Unix.sleep 10;
print_endline "You failed."

then everything works perfectly. I don't understand why there is
a discrepancy between the interrupt numbers in
sys.ml and those in /usr/include/sys/signal.h ?


On the other hand, I know next to nothing about these sorts of things.
