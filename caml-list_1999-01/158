I thought I alrady sent it... Here is it (attached).  

This is not doing much, but I find this quite convenient when using the
toplevel as a powerful pocket calculator desk.  It is a quick unpolished
patch over Jacques' mode that reuses the error highlighting code from the
compile mode to make it work in the toplevel mode as well.

Another trivial thing is the redefinition of eval-phrase, so that the cursor
moves to the end of the phrase unless an error occurs. This enables the
evaluation of N phrases (prefix arg) or stop at the first error.

    -Didier.
