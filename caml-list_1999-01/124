The current condition already exists in ocamllex--this is what the
rule name is equivalent to.  The one thing it doesn't do is support
the idea that some regexp -> action specs should be in more than one
rule--which is no real great loss.

I think making the languages of ocamllex and ocamlyacc slightly nicer
wouldn't be entirely out of order, as would writing them in Caml
rather than C.
