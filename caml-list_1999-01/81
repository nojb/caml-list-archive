In 1997 I began a project that was intended to simplify ad-hoc usage
of given C libraries in Ocaml. I have never completed it because of
fights with the garbage collector, and because I had doubts if it was
really useful.

The idea was to read a given C header file and automatically generate
stub functions and other needed auxiliary functions dealing with the
type mapping between C and Ocaml. As far as I can remember the program
contains a lexer and a parser limited to header files, i.e. it cannot parse
function bodies, but I think this is simple to add.

You can find the program on
