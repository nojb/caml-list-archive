I am currently working on a COM binding for OCaml.  The development is
going relatively smoothly so far.  In particular, OCaml classes and
objects provide a good match for COM's interfaces -- nicer than what
they have to do in Haskell due to lack of OO support.

However, some problems remain, not the least of which being writing a
parser for this #$^#!! Microsoft IDL language, which seems to double in
size approximately every year.

Stay tuned,
