If anyone decides to pick up on this one, I would suggest having a look at:
"Scripting COM components in Haskell," by Simon Peyton-Jones and Erik Meijer
at 
	http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/Papers/com.ps.gz

I know similar efforts are ongoing for SML/NJ, and would love to see OCaml
have this too.
