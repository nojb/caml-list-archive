Yes, I'd be interested to see a really convincing use of the utility of the
OO features, e.g. a program or library which is manifestly shorter, cleaner
and/or simpler when expressed with OO rather than the core features.  I
guess people can take this as a challenge if they like :-)  I'm open to be
convinced - but I'm not convinced yet.

That said, Xavier mentions the match between COM & Ocaml, which is a good
sign!

Cheers,
Don
