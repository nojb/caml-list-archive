CALL FOR PAPERS

6th Workshop on Reactive and Event-based Languages and Systems (REBLS 2019)
co-located with the SPLASH Conference
Athens, Greece, Sun 20 - Fri 25 October 2019
Website: https://2019.splashcon.org/home/rebls-2019

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission Deadline: 16 Aug 2019 (extended)
Author Notification:  7 Sep 2019

INTRODUCTION

Reactive programming and event-based programming are two closely related
programming styles that are becoming ever more important with the advent of
advanced HPC technology and the ever increasing requirement for our
applications to run on the web or on collaborating mobile devices. A number
of publications on middleware and language design -- so-called reactive and
event-based languages and systems (REBLS) -- have already seen the light,
but the field still raises several questions. For example, the interaction
with mainstream language concepts is poorly understood, implementation
technology is in its infancy and modularity mechanisms are almost totally
lacking. Moreover, large applications are still to be developed and
patterns and tools for developing reactive applications is an area that is
vastly unexplored. This workshop will gather researchers in reactive and
event-based languages and systems. The goal of the workshop is to exchange
new technical research results and to define better the field by coming up
with taxonomies and overviews of the existing work.

We welcome all submissions on reactive programming, aspect- and event-
oriented systems, including but not limited to:

* Language design, implementation, runtime systems, program analysis,
  software metrics, patterns and benchmarks.

* Study of the paradigm: interaction of reactive and event-based
  programming with existing language features such as object-oriented
  programming, mutable state, concurrency.

* Advanced event systems, event quantification, event composition,
  aspect-oriented programming for reactive applications.

* Functional-reactive programming, self-adjusting computation and
  incremental computing.

* Synchronous languages, modeling real-time systems, safety-critical
  reactive and embedded systems.

* Applications, case studies that show the efficacy of reactive
  programming.

* Empirical studies that motivate further research in the field.

* Patterns and best-practices.

* Related fields, such as complex event processing, reactive data
  structures, view maintenance, constraint-based languages, and their
  integration with reactive programming. IDEs, Tools.

* Implementation technology, language runtimes, virtual machine support,
  compilers.

* Modularity and abstraction mechanisms in large systems.

* Formal models for reactive and event-based programming.

The format of the workshop is that of a mini-conference. Participants can
present their work in slots of 30 mins with Q&A included. Because of the
declarative nature of reactive programs, it is often hard to understand
their semantics just by looking at the code. We therefore also encourage
authors to use their slots for presenting their work based on live demos.

SUBMISSIONS

REBLS encourages submissions of two types of papers:

* Research results: complete works that will be published in the ACM
  digital library.

* In progress papers: papers that have the potential of triggering an
  interesting discussion at the workshop or present new ideas that require
  further systematic investigation. These papers will not be published in
  the ACM digital library.

Format:

* Submissions should be formatted according to the instructions for the
  authors below.

* Full papers can be up to 10 pages in length including references.

* In progress papers can be up to 6 pages.

* Authors are required to explicitly specify the type of paper in the
  submission.

Instructions for the Authors:

Submission link: https://rebls19.hotcrp.com/=20

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting
instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected
without review.

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for
publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN=E2=80=99s Republication Polic=
y.
Submitters should also be aware of ACM=E2=80=99s Policy and Procedures on
Plagiarism.

Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format with
sigplan Subformat, 10 point font, using Biolinum as sans-serif font and
Libertine as serif font. All submissions should be in PDF format. If you
use
LaTeX or Word, please use the ACM SIGPLAN acmart Templates.
