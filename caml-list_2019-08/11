Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.08.1

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Alexander Fleming
by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.08.1.

This is a bug-fix release, which fixes compilation failures in presence of
"-pack" (breaking nocrypto), and dynlinking failures (breaking Frama-C)
(see also the list of changes below).

It is (or soon will be) available as a set of OPAM switches,
and as a source download here:
   https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-$BRANCH/

Happy hacking,

— Florian Angeletti, for the OCaml team.
