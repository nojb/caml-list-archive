Yes. 32-bit x86 platform is not going away anytime soon. Given that 512M
RAM is now standard and 1G RAM is very common for an average PC - having
a programming language with 4M limit for the array size is like to have
an 8+3 characters filename limitation on a filesystem using a mainstream
300G disk in 2006. However I understand the techical difficulty to solve
this issue - it's pretty annoying anyhow :)
