Thanks for the tip ... I suppose I should have thought of it myself.

Anyway, I seem to have solved the problem ... I had:

   msg_fd <-
     Unix.openfile msg_pipe [Unix.O_RDONLY; Unix.O_NONBLOCK] 0o600;

Apparently the file descriptor should *not* be opened in non-blocking 
mode (is that really so obvious that it doesn't need to be documented 
anywhere??). But I'm still puzzled, because the behavior was very 
inconsistent: it worked on one box but not another--though perhaps the 
difference in GTK versions would account for that. What was really 
strange, though, was that if I attempted to display the GUI in the 
normal way, i.e. with the command

   $ bantam -s

'bantam' being a shell script which, given the '-s' option, does the 
following:

   echo '%show' > ${TMPDIR}/bantam-${USER}/message.pipe

(which in my case resolves to

   echo '%show' > /tmp/bantam-matt/message.pipe

) --this caused the I/O error. Yet, if invoked the same 'echo' command 
directly in an interactive shell (in this case, bash running in an 
rxvt), it never caused the error. Why on earth would that be, I wonder?
