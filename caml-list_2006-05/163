I'm aware of __try/__finally, but a bit of experimentation suggested
that it doesn't play nice with OCaml's exception handling.  There is a
lower-level API whose name I cannot remember that might be usable
within Caml, but I didn't pursue this.  Windows users are welcome to
contribute suggestions or code.
