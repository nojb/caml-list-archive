I've noticed that the following causes a crash on both the bytecode 
interpreter and native code:

open Int32
open Printf
let _ = printf "%ld\n" (Int32.div Int32.min_int (-1l))

This doesn't appear to be documented, so I presume it's incorrect 
behavior.  Nativeint also seems to have the same problem.  The built-in 
int type doesn't seem to have the same problem.  Int64 doesn't seem to 
have a problem either.

This is on a 32-bit Windows platform.
