OOps, I just saw Yann's post.... guess I should have read this thread
more carefuly before posting.

I might be stating the obvious but a solution that *should* work in
most cases would be to use a event way of reading (think sax) where
you would pass a "reading" function that would be called back one or
more time with data from the file. If this "reading" function where to
return false "read_from_file" would stop calling it back:

read_from_file: (filename:String) (f:String->Boolean) : Unit

The writing counterpart could be:

flush_to_file:(filename:String) (f:Unit->String Option) : Unit

where f would be called until it returned None.

Note that this is a rather unflexible and inelegant solution. I don't
recommand it.

Cheers,
Till
