Except when someone made a decision like this, in say a revision control
system, and suddenly you discover that you've provoked a worst case
scenario, and it suddenly takes hundreds of cpu hours to check in a file
rather than a few seconds.

For something like a compiler, worse case behavior is very important.  It
is not generally acceptable for a build to just hang in the compiler.
