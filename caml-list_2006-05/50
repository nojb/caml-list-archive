Hi,

That's because your callback raised an exception (!). LablGTK traps
uncaught exceptions from callbacks instead of re-raising them and exiting
the main  loop. For signals, there is a user-overridable handler that
simply prints the exception name to stderr ; for other types of callbacks
(IO watches, timeouts, etc.) you simply get this error message.

In your code you should wrap your "watcher" function in a try...with block
and print the exception using Printexc.to_string to see what's going
wrong.
