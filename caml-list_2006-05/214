MKM 2006: The 5th International Conference on
Mathematical Knowledge Management

10-12 August 2006, St Annes Manor Hotel, Wokingham, UK.

Call for Participation

Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) is an emerging interdisciplinary 
field of research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, 
library science, and scientific publishing. Its objective is to develop new 
and better ways of managing mathematical knowledge using sophisticated 
software tools. Its grand challenge is to create a universal digital 
mathematics library accessible via the World-Wide Web. Sponsored by the MKM 
Interest Group, MKM 2006 will be the fifth conference in a series of 
international MKM conferences that started in 2001.

The event consists of a one day workshop (MathUI - Mathematical User 
Interfaces) on the 10th August and the main conference on 11th and 12th 
August. The main conference programme will consist of 20 fully refereed 
papers, two invited speakers and a panel discussion. The MKM Interest Group 
Business Meeting will be held on the Friday.

Invited Speakers:

    * Gregory J. Chaitin, IBM Research
      Irreducible complexity in pure math
    * Abdou Youssef, George Washington University
      Roles of Math Search in Mathematics

The conference programme will be available on the web site shortly.

Registration for the conference, and the associated workshop is now available 
via the conference web site at:

http://www.rdg.ac.uk/MKM06/


Organisers:

Conference Co-Chairs:

    * Andrew A. Adams, The University of Reading, UK
    * Paul Cairns, UCL, UK

Programme Committee Co-Chairs:

    * Jon Borwein, Dalhousie University, Canada
    * William Farmer, McMaster University, Canada

MKM 2006 is run under the auspices of the MKM Interest Group 
(www.mkm-ig.org). MKM 2006 is an official Satellite Conference of the 
International Congress of Mathematicians.
