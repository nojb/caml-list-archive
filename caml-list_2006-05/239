PHD POSITION: FORMAL VERIFICATION OF EPIDEMIC PROTOCOLS AND DISTRIBUTED VERIFICATION METHODS
============================================================================================


The Theoretical Computer Science Group at the Vrije Universiteit (VU) in Amsterdam
seeks a PhD student for four years on a research project devoted to

  Formal Verification of Epidemic Protocols and Distributed Verification Methods

Starting date of this PhD position: as soon as possible.


The project
-----------

The aim of the project is to develop techniques and tools for distributed verification,
and to apply formal verification techniques in the design and analysis of epidemic
protocols.

The distributed verification track will focus on parallel algorithms for minimizing
state spaces modulo some behavioral equivalence, and model checking. The DAS-3
supercomputer, which will become operational this Summer, will serve as an
experimentation platform.

Epidemic protocols multicast data in a peer-to-peer network similar to the way
a disease spreads. The analysis of epidemic protocols should (1) provide further
experience with applying formal verification methods to communication protocols,
and with applying such methods in the design process, (2) result in improved
versions of epidemic protocols, (3) lead to a systematic approach to analyze epidemic
protocols, and (4) provide case studies for the distributed verification track.

For more detailed information on the project, see

  http://www.cs.vu.nl/~wanf/epidis.txt

This project is a collaboration between three research groups at the VU:
Theoretical Computer Science (Wan Fokkink), Distributed Systems (Maarten van Steen,
Andy Tanenbaum), and Parallel Computing (Henri Bal).

For more information on the involved research groups, see

Qualifications
--------------

Candidates should have completed their studies in computer science or a closely
related area. Experience with distributed systems, a good theoretical background
(algorithmics, formal methods), and an open attitude to applications are
considered advantages. You should enjoy working in an internationally oriented
research environment. Communicative skills and the ability to work in a team
are important.


Information and application
---------------------------

For further information about this position please contact:

  Prof.dr. Wan Fokkink, wanf@cs.vu.nl, tel. +31 (0)20 5987735

You are invited to send an application by email to the above email address no
later than June 29, 2006. Your application should consist of a cover letter,
a curriculum vitae (including detailed information regarding your academic degree,
and possibly a list of publications), and the names and addresses of two references.
