Subject: [Caml-list] something like an ActiveCaml?

Hello,


it would be nice to have OCaml available as stand-alone
binary for windows. As I normally use Unix-like systems
and it is easy to install OCaml there, but sometimes
I have to use Windwos computers of other people, so then
I can't easy install such big things like mingw and/or cygwin
on that machines.
But an aequivalent to ActivePerl but with OCaml instead of Perl
would be fine.

I used ActivePerl for those situations, where I want to do some
programming of specialized tools on windows. I used ActivePerl then.
This is OK and easy to install.
But I would prefer to have OCaml instead of Perl, because ...
...well, you know why to prefer OCaml to Perl. ;-)

Someone here who could provide such a thing?
(I have no development tools for windows and no windows at all.
 I prefer to use Unix-like machines, but some people, who have no
 Unix or Linux installed, then must be annoyed with cygwin?!)

Is there maybe a reason, why cygwin/mingw must be used and
no stand-alone OCaml is available?
Or could such a thing also be created?

Would be fine.


Any suggestions?


Ciao,
   Oliver
