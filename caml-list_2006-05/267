                     CALL FOR PAPERS

              The Fourth ASIAN Symposium on
         Programming Languages and Systems
                   (APLAS 2006)
         Sydney, Australia, November 8-10, 2006
         http://www.kb.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/aplas2006/

APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of recent results and the exchange of ideas
and experience in topics concerned with programming languages and
systems.  APLAS is based in Asia, but is an international forum that
serves the worldwide programming languages community.

The APLAS series is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation
of Software (AAFS), which has recently been founded by Asian
researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the
USA.  The past formal APLAS symposiums were successfully held in
Tsukuba (2005, Japan), Taipei (2004, Taiwan) and Beijing (2003, China)
after three informal workshops held in Shanghai (2002, China), Daejeon
(2001, Korea) and Singapore (2000). Proceedings of the past symposiums
were published in Springer-Verlag's LNCS 2895, 3302, and 3780.

TOPICS

The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical issues in
programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on, but not limited,
to the following topics:

   * semantics, logics, foundational theory
   * type systems, language design
   * program analysis, optimization, transformation
   * software security, safety, verification
   * compiler systems, interpreters, abstract machines
   * domain-specific languages and systems
   * programming tools and environments

Original results that bear on these and related topics are solicited. Papers
investigating novel uses and applications of language systems are especially
encouraged. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are welcome
to consult with the program chair (koba@ecei.tohoku.ac.jp) prior to submission.
