It does pretty well. I had done some tests some time ago, using a lambda
calculus interpreter calculating the fibonacci numbers reducing lambda
expressions, and i was very agreeably surprised comparing a G4 cpu to and AMD
box. I don't remember the details though. Mmm, it is well possible that it was
still with 240Mhz 603e cpu even, compared to a 600-700 AMD box.

The same goes for building the debian ocaml powerpc package, compared to
building it on a x86 box.

Probably yes, provided you compare ones with similar cpus.
