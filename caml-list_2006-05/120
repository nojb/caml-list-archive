Of course it will. :) But what I meant was that the limit is nowhere 
near 32 bits (4 MB is only 22 bits), which leads me to believe that the 
limit is due to the implementation of arrays.  I was asking if there 
would be an improved implemetation of arrays which would increase this 
limit (up to 32 bits).

I was thinking otherwise, as it seemed to be crashing only when 
building the list.  The list is built by a parser rule which is reading 
from a line of floats.  The rule itself is recursive, which does imply 
a stack overflow, (or does it? ocamlyacc generates a LALR or some 
variant, right?) but changing that rule to use a Queue worked fine. 
(Until I tried to convert it into an array, which led me to discover 
the 4 MB limit)

Incidentally, what data structure does the Queue use internally? I 
didn't run into any of the problems I did with lists or arrays.
