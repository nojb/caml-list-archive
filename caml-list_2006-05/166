Well, my first computer (VC 20/VIC 20) had about 3,5 kB RAM, was an 8-Bit
processor based computer (6502 CPU :)) and had 1 MHz clock frequency :)


Some years later HP came up with their HP 9000 workstation,
32 Bit processors they had! :)

I thought that some years later I also would have such a beast!

But: It took  a too long time.... I was a computer-"hater" for many
years, had jumped into analog technics (electrical engineering)
and only came back to programming at the end of the study, when
I merged eletrotechnics and programming (noise simulation and
analog-digital converting in C under DOS or windows, don't know,
but I think it was a x386 processor machine with maybe 100 MHz clock frequency?
 looking for quantization errors, yielded by noise - all simulated in C)


What I wanted to say: yes, the technological "revolution" we so often
hear in the media, is much slower than it could be...

...the fastest machines are created for game playing.

So, when the next playstation comes out, I maybe buy one and install
Linux on it. I hope, that there will be a native OCaml-port for it then :)

       Oliver
