Scope

The ML family of programming languages, whose most popular variants
are SML and OCaml, has inspired a tremendous amount of computer
science research, both practical and theoretical, and ML continues to
underpin a variety of applications, ranging from compilers and theorem
provers to low-level system software. This workshop aims to provide a
forum for discussion and research on existing and future ML and
ML-like languages.

We seek papers on any ML-related topic, including (but not limited to):

  * applications.
  * extensions:     objects, classes, concurrency, distribution
		    and mobility, semi-structured data handling, etc.
  * type systems:   inference, modules, specification, error reporting, etc.
  * implementation: compilers, interpreters, partial evaluators,
                    garbage collectors, etc.
  * environments:   libraries, tools, editors, debuggers,
                    cross-language interoperability, etc.
  * semantics.

Both experimental and theoretical papers are welcome. Each paper
should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms,
clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work. In order to
encourage lively discussion, submitted papers may describe work in
progress.

Papers must be submitted in either PDF format or as PostScript
documents that are interpretable by Ghostscript. They must be
printable on US Letter sized paper. Papers should be formatted using
the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines available at

  http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

The length should be no more than 12 pages.

Proceedings will be published by ACM Press and will appear in the ACM
Digital Library. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign
the ACM copyright form.

Papers can be submitted electronically at
