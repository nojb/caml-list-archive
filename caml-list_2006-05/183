When I've ported C++ programs to OCaml they often use ~2x as much memory, so 
you could argue that a memory limit is more limiting for OCaml users. 
However, my personal impression is that memory has gone from the scarce 
resource that it was 20 years ago to a resource that is now commonly wasted 
and moving from C++ to OCaml certainly fits in with that trend.
