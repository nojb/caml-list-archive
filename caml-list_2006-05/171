I think that's an awfully simplistic point of view.  My problem is  
that I want to store more than 4 million items in an array.  You're  
suggesting moving to 64 bits?  And even if everyone magically moves  
to 64 bits, I can imagine that in the future someone will want to  
read more than 2^(64 - 10) items from a file into memory, as 64 bits  
isn't quite "number of atoms in the universe" big yet.
