Well, I also could use C-functions (externals).

But I don't know HOW OCaml handle's the IP-stuff.

I don't know if - when using protocoll 1 (ICMP) for example,
if the IP-header will be generated automatically by OCaml.
It seems that it will be handled this way, but I have not seen
anything about this in the reference manual.

Do I have to write the IP-header by myself or not?

No documentation about if IP_HDRINCL is used internally or not.

Some more verbosity of the refman could help here.

Ciao,
