And in 20 years or so, assuming Moore's law holds, we'll need to 
transition to 128-bit architectures.  Servers should probably transistion 
a little sooner, maybe 15 years out.

Of course, a large hunk of my annoyance here is comming from C-99 and long 
long- breaking conformant code in a desperate (and- might I add- futile) 
attempt to patch broken and non-conformant code around what will be a 
temporary problem (the only question left is the definition of temporary). 
Eventually, just going to 64 bits will be the solution- just like just 
going to 32 bits was the solution to the 640K limit.
