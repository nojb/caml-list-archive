I wrote a book on OCaml (see my .sig). It was "based on OCaml" in the sense 
that the OCaml code in the book was colour syntax highlighted from the LyX 
source using a custom OCaml program... ;-)

Brian Hurt was also writing a book on OCaml. I'm not sure if it has been 
published. There is also the freely available 700-page book.
