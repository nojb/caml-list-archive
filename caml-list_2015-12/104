There is no ocamldoc.cm{,x}a in  ocamldoc libraries today. We could
probably change ocamldoc's build system to build one, but for now an
ocamldoc package would have no archive(...) field, just the directory. It
is not clear we need an ocamldoc.cm{,x}a archive if all plugins are to be
passed to ocamldoc{,.opt} which is already linked with ocamldoc modules.

&gt;
&gt; It looks like the tag use_ocamldoc expects a file ocamldoc.cmxa to exi=
st, providing library support for ocamldoc plugins, and it does not seem to=
 exist -- it seems that the preferred way to use ocamldoc plugins is to use=
 &quot;ocamldoc.opt -g foo.cmxs&quot;, with ocamldoc libraries already link=

&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0 ocamlbuild -cflags -I,+ocamldoc test.cmxs
&gt;
&gt; works and seems to do what you expect.
&gt;

&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I&#39;m wondering how one should compile ocaml=
doc custom generators using
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 ocamlbuild.
&gt;
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 First, the ocamlbuild manual
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (<a href=3D"https://github.com/gasche/manual-o=

b.com/gasche/manual-ocamlbuild/blob/master/manual.md#basic-tags</a>-)
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 says that the [use_ocamldoc] tag is deprecated=
; and that a corresponding
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 ocamlfind package should be used instead. Is t=
here such a package for ocamldoc?
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I did not found one.
&gt;
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Then, I did not manage to build the plugin int=
o .cma/.cmxs files directly using
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 ocamlbuild. My command line was something alon=
g these lines:
&gt;
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind -t=
ag use_ocamldoc -package compiler-libs plugin.cmxs
&gt;
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 When trying to build plugin.cma/plugin.cmxs, o=
camlbuild complained that &quot;Cannot
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 find file ocamldoc.cma/ocamldoc.cmxa&quot; (re=
spectively). However, I can build
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 plugin.cmo/plugin.cmx using the same command l=
ine, then create the .cma/.cmxs
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 manually using ocamlc/ocamlopt - which I ended=
 up doing.
&gt;
&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Is there a better way to do so? If the whole p=
