Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Papers - 9th Conference on Intelligent
 Computer Mathematics - CICM 2016 - Deadline 28. February 2016

			   Call for Papers
                                                                                 
         9th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
      	                    - CICM 2016 - 
                           July 25-29, 2016
                   University of Bialystok, Poland
                 http://www.cicm-conference.org/2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital and  computational solutions are becoming  the prevalent means
for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of
mathematical  information.  Separate  communities  have  developed  to
investigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,
automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user
interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their
integration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added
value.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)
offers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great
challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.

CICM has been held annually as a joint meeting since 2008, co-locating
related   conferences  and   workshops  to   advance  work   in  these
subjects. Previous  meetings have been  held in Birmingham  (UK 2008),
Grand Bend (Canada 2009), Paris (France 2010), Bertinoro (Italy 2011),
Bremen (Germany  2012), Bath (UK  2013), Coimbra (Portugal  2014), and
Washington DC (USA 2015).

This  is a  call for  papers  for CICM  2016,  which will  be held  in
Bialystok, Poland, July 25-29, 2016.

The principal tracks of the conference will be:

* Track: Calculemus (chair: Leonardo de Moura)
* Track: Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML) (chair: Frank Tompa)
* Track: Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM) (chair: Bruce Miller)
* Track: Systems & Data (chair: Moa Johansson)
* Track: Doctoral Programme (chair: TBD)

Like in previous years, project descriptions are welcomed as well.

The  overall  programme is  organized  by  the General  Program  Chair
Michael Kohlhase.  The workshop and publicity chair is Serge Autexier.
The local arrangements will be coordinated by Adam Naumowicz.

We plan  to have proceedings  of the  conference as in  previous years
with  Springer Verlag  as  a  volume in  Lecture  Notes in  Artificial
Intelligence (LNAI).
