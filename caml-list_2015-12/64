Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Workshops - 9th Conference on Intelligent
 Computer Mathematics - CICM 2016 - Proposals Deadline 22. January 2016

                     Call for Workshop Proposals
                                                                                 
         9th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
      	                    - CICM 2016 - 
                           July 25-29, 2016
                   University of Bialystok, Poland
                 http://www.cicm-conference.org/2016

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital and  computational solutions are becoming  the prevalent means
for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of
mathematical  information.  Separate  communities  have  developed  to
investigate  and build  computer based  systems for  computer algebra,
automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user
interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their
integration  can   lead  to   synergies  offering   significant  added
value.  The  Conference  on Intelligent  Computer  Mathematics  (CICM)
offers a  venue for discussing  and developing solutions to  the great
challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.

CICM has been held annually as  a joint meeting since 2008, colocating
related conferences and  workshops to advance work  in these subjects.
Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend
(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen
(Germany   2012),  Bath (U.K.  2013),    Coimbra (Portugal, 2014)  and
Washington D.C. (USA, 2015). 

This is the call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2016,
which will be held at the University of Bialystok (Poland), July 25-29
next year.

Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:
  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice
  Compact Computer Algebra
  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics
  Formal Mathematics for Mathematicians 
  Intelligent Proof Search
  Mathematical user Interfaces
  Mathematics Information Retrieval
  OpenMath
  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation
  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems
  SCIEnce
  The Notion of Proof
  User Interfaces for Theorem Provers

Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2016 are solicited.  Both
well-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.

Please provide the following information:
 
 + Workshop title.
 + Names and affiliations of organizers.
 + Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.
 + Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).
 + If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference 
   affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, 
   please indicate so.

CICM  will take  care  of copying  and  distributing informal  printed
proceedings for  workshops that  would like this  service, as  well as
permanently archived open access online proceedings with CEUR-WS.org.

All proposals should be sent via email to

             cicm-organizers@jacobs-university.de

for consideration by the CICM 2016 organizers:

 Conference Chair:       Adam Naumowicz    (U Bialystok, Poland)
 General Program Chair:  Michael Kohlhase  (Jacobs University
                                                      Bremen, Germany)
