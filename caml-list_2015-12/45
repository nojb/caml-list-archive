===========================================================
                      CALL FOR PAPERS
                          iFM 2016

  12th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods
              June 1-3, 2016, Reykjavik, Iceland

                    http://en.ru.is/ifm/
===========================================================

=== Important dates ===

Abstract submission:  December 21, 2015
Paper submission:     January 6, 2016
Paper notification:   February 29, 2016
Final version:        March 14, 2016
Conference:           June 1-3, 2016

=== Objectives and scope ===

Applying formal methods may involve the usage of different formalisms
and different analysis techniques to validate a system, either because
individual components are most amenable to one formalism or technique,
because one is interested in different properties of the system, or
simply to cope with the sheer complexity of the system. The iFM
conference series seeks to further research into hybrid approaches to
formal modeling and analysis; i.e., the combination of (formal and
semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding both modeling
and analysis.  The conference covers all aspects from language design
through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their
integration into software engineering practice.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
   - Formal and semi-formal modelling notations
   - Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice
   - Hybrid systems
   - Program verification
   - Program synthesis
   - Model checking
   - Static analysis
   - Runtime analysis, monitoring, performance evaluation
   - Decision procedures, SAT and SMT solving
   - Software engineering
   - Component-based systems (compositional, embedded, distributed, etc.)
   - Testing
   - Abstraction and refinement

=== Submission guidelines ===

iFM 2016 solicits high quality papers reporting research results
and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of method
integration.

We solicit papers in the following categories:

   - research papers (max. 15 pages including bibliography)
   - regular tool papers (max. 15 pages including bibliography)
   - short tool papers (max. 8 pages including bibliography)
   - case study papers (max. 15 pages including bibliography)

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a thorough review
process. If necessary, a paper may be supplemented with a clearly
marked appendix, which will be consulted at the discretion of the
reviewers.

Submissions should be made using the iFM 2016 Easychair site:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2016
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style
files; we suggest to use the LaTeX2e package (the llncs.cls class
file, available in llncs2e.zip and the typeinst.dem available in
typeinst.zip as a template for your contribution). The conference
proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer
Science series.

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors
must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one
author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the
early date, to be indicated by the organizers, and present the paper.

=== Invited speakers ===

  Marsha Chechik (University of Toronto, Canada)
  Laura Kovacs (Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden)
  Reiner Haehnle (Technical University Darmstadt, Germany)
  Edmund Clarke (Carnegie Mellon University, USA)

=== Workshops ===

iFM 2016 will be accompanied by a series of workshops. Further
