It would seem that https://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/ would be the 
definitive link to the C API, which together with the lablgtk source 
code would provide strong clues.

There shoud also be a tutorial by SooHyoung Oh somewhere.  Links on the 
web point to  
http://plus.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/lablgtk2/lablgtk2-tutorial/ and to 
http://plus.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/lablgtk2/treeview-tutorial/
neither of which seem to exist.

It would be useful to locate a copy.
