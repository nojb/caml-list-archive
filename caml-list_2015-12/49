****************************************************************

ABSTRACT:

This advanced school brings together experts from different
areas of formal methods to present state of the art in formal
methods and logical reasoning techniques in design and analysis
of computer systems. The school will cover topics from Model
Checking, Process Algebra, Logic, Concurrency Theory and Quantum
Computing. Our goal is to demonstrate the importance of
foundations and its connection to the design and rigorous
analysis of computer systems. The level of lectures will be
suitable for graduate students, young researchers and also
experts from other fields of computer science who intend to
establish interdisciplinary links with formal methods. This
event proceeds by the IPM Formal Methods Day
(http://cs.ipm.ac.ir/fmd2016).
