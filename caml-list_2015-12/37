Subject: [Caml-list] Here comes the time ...

... of planning a paper for ICFP 2016!

Ok, ok, on revient au francais.

En bref, ceci est un message preliminaire pour savoir qui serait interesse a
contribuer activement et de facon significative a un papier pour ICFP 2016
sur le MOOC OCaml qui est en train de se terminer: je veux bien prendre
le lead sur le papier, mais il me faut au moins deux ou trois autres
personnes prete a y passer vraiement du temps pour etre surs que cela
va passer

Roberto

P.S.: bien sur, tout le monde sera explicitement mentionne dans la
section Acknowledgement, la je cherche les personnes qui acceptent
de bosser suffisamment sur le papier pour etre dans le champs "auteur" :-)

> 
> Functional Pearls
> =================
> 
> A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to

> 
> - a new and thought-provoking way of looking at an old idea
> - an instructive example of program calculation or proof
> - a nifty presentation of an old or new data structure
> - an interesting application of functional programming techniques
> - a novel use or exposition of functional programming in the classroom
> 
> While pearls often demonstrate an idea through the development of a
> short program, there is no requirement or expectation that they do
> so. Thus, they encompass the notions of theoretical and educational
> pearls.
> 
> Functional Pearls are valued as highly and judged as rigorously as
> ordinary papers, but using somewhat different criteria. In particular,
> a pearl is not required to report original research, but, it should be
> concise, instructive, and entertaining. Your pearl is likely to be
> rejected if your readers get bored, if the material gets too
> complicated, if too much specialized knowledge is needed, or if the
> writing is inelegant. The key to writing a good pearl is polishing.
> 
> A submission you wish to have treated as a pearl must be marked as
> such on the submission web page, and should contain the words
> ``Functional Pearl'' somewhere in its title or subtitle. These steps
> will alert reviewers to use the appropriate evaluation
> criteria. Pearls will be combined with ordinary papers, however, for
> the purpose of computing the conference's acceptance rate.
> 
> Experience Reports
> ==================
> 
> The purpose of an Experience Report is to help create a body of
> published, refereed, citable evidence that functional programming
> really works -- or to describe what obstacles prevent it from working.
> 
> Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited
> to:
> 
> - insights gained from real-world projects using functional
>   programming
> 
> - comparison of functional programming with conventional programming
>   in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum
> 
> - project-management, business, or legal issues encountered when using
>   functional programming in a real-world project
> 
> - curricular issues encountered when using functional programming in
>   education
> 
> - real-world constraints that created special challenges for an
>   implementation of a functional language or for functional
>   programming in general
> 
> An Experience Report is distinguished from a normal ICFP paper by its
> title, by its length, and by the criteria used to evaluate it.
> 
> - Both in the proceedings and in any citations, the title of each
>   accepted Experience Report must begin with the words ``Experience
>   Report'' followed by a colon. The acceptance rate for Experience
>   Reports will be computed and reported separately from the rate for
>   ordinary papers.
> 
> - An Experience Report is at most six pages long. Each accepted
>   Experience Report will be presented at the conference, but depending
>   on the number of Experience Reports and regular papers accepted,
>   authors of Experience reports may be asked to give shorter talks.
> 
> - Because the purpose of Experience Reports is to enable our community
>   to accumulate a body of evidence about the efficacy of functional
>   programming, an acceptable Experience Report need not add to the
>   body of knowledge of the functional-programming community by
>   presenting novel results or conclusions. It is sufficient if the
>   Report states a clear thesis and provides supporting evidence. The
>   thesis must be relevant to ICFP, but it need not be novel.
