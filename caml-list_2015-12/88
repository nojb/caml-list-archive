> Are beginners even welcome?

Yes, beginners are warmly welcome. Feel free to keep pointing out
changes that would help answer this question, this is helpful. Of
course small-scope changes (fixing library X to support format Y) are
always much easier to actuate than general recommendations
(more libraries).

> Is anyone in charge of the OCaml ecosystem?

No, there is no one in charge of the OCaml ecosystem, or of a general
"OCaml experience". This may explain some of the very real usability
issues, but it is also rather unclear to me how this should be
fixed. Would anyone volunteer for such a role (funded how?), and to do
what?

I agree with your conclusion that the OCaml ecosystem today is
unforgiving, and that it is particularly harsh on non-accompanied
beginners. How could this state of affairs be improved?

I think that while a unified vision for the ecosystem may be necessary
to fix some of the usability issues (one problem with unification is
that you need people to agree on it), a large part of the problem is
rather of the "death by thousand cuts" kind: small things that add up
to create an overall unpleasant experience. This portion of the
general problem is both too large for a single person to fix (no one
person can guess all use-cases), it is easily amenable to
crowd-fixing: reporting and/or fixing issues one at a time as you
discover them. So please keep doing that!
