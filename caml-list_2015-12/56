Subject: [Caml-list] WRLA 2016: 2nd Call for Papers (including invited
 speakers)

======================== Call for Papers =================================

                            WRLA 2016

                        11th International
           Workshop on Rewriting Logic and its Applications

                    An ETAPS 2016 satellite event
              Eindhoven, The Netherlands, April 2-3, 2016
==========================================================================

IMPORTANT DATES

  * Abstract deadline: January 6th 2016
  * Submission deadline: January 10th 2016
  * Author notification: February 14th 2016
  * Workshop: Saturday April 2nd and Sunday April 3rd, 2016

AIMS AND SCOPE

Rewriting is a natural model of computation and an expressive semantic
framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication, and interaction. It
can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and languages in various
application domains. It also has good properties as a metalogical framework
for representing logics. Several successful languages based on rewriting
(ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed and implemented. The aim
of WRLA is to bring together researchers with a common interest in rewriting
and its applications, and to give them the opportunity to present their
recent work, discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.
The 2016 edition of WRLA will mark its 20th anniversary since its first
edition in Asilomar, California, in 1996.

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:

A. Foundations 

  * foundations and models of rewriting and rewriting logic, including
    termination, confluence, coherence and complexity
  * unification, generalisation, narrowing, and partial evaluation
  * constrained rewriting and symbolic algebra
  * graph rewriting
  * tree automata
  * rewriting strategies
  * rewriting-based calculi and explicit substitutions

B. Rewriting as a Logical and Semantic Framework 

  * uses of rewriting and rewriting logic as a logical framework,
    including deduction modulo 
  * uses of rewriting as a semantic framework for programming language
    semantics 
  * rewriting semantics of concurrency models, distributed systems, and
    network protocols 
  * rewriting semantics of real-time, hybrid, and probabilistic systems
  * uses of rewriting for compilation and language transformation

C.  Rewriting Languages

  * rewriting-based declarative languages
  * type systems for rewriting
  * implementation techniques
  * tools supporting rewriting languages

D. Verification Techniques

  * verification of confluence, termination, coherence, sufficient
    completeness, and related properties 
  * temporal, modal and reachability logics for verifying dynamic
    properties of rewrite theories 
  * explicit-state and symbolic model-checking techniques for
    verification of rewrite theories 
  * rewriting-based theorem proving, including (co)inductive theorem proving
  * rewriting-based constraint solving and satisfiability
  * rewriting-semantics-based verification and analysis of programs

E. Applications

  * applications to logic, mathematics and physics
  * rewriting models of biology, chemistry, and membrane systems
  * security specification and verification 
  * applications to distributed, network, mobile, and cloud computing
  * specification and verification of real-time, probabilistic, and
    cyber-physical systems 
  * specifications and verification of critical systems
  * applications to model-based software engineering 
  * applications to engineering and planning

SUBMISSION

We solicit submissions of regular papers, tool papers, and 
work-in-progress papers. 

Regular papers must contain original contributions, be clearly written,
include appropriate references, and comparison with related work. They must
be unpublished and not submitted simultaneously for publication
elsewhere.

Tool papers have to present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel
extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of
the theoretical foundations with relevant citations, emphasise the design and
implementation, and give a clear account of the tool's functionality. The
described tools must be publicly available via the web.

Work-in-progress papers present early-stage work or other types of innovative
or thought-provoking work related to the topics of the workshop. The
difference between work-in-progress and regular papers is that work-in-progress
submissions represent work that has not reached yet a level of
completion that would warrant the full-refereed selection process. We
encourage researchers and practitioners to submit work-in-progress papers as
this provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting
useful feedback on ongoing work, and fostering discussions and collaborations
among colleagues.


All submissions should be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer
LNCS papers, and should be submitted electronically using EasyChair at 

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrla2016

Regular and work-in-progress papers should not exceed 15 pages including
references. Tool papers can have a maximum of 6 pages including references
and may have an appendix of up to 4 additional pages with usage details and
tool demonstration. 

PUBLICATION

All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee. Regular papers,
tool papers, and work-in-progress papers that are accepted will be presented
at the workshop and included in the pre-proceedings, which will be available
during the workshop. Following the tradition of the last editions, the
regular papers, tool papers, and invited presentations will be
published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) series to be distributed after the workshop.

A special issue of the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in
Programming (JLAMP) will be devoted to extended versions of selected papers
from WRLA 2016.
