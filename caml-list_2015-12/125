INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL ON WEB SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 

  

WEBST
2016 

BILBAO, SPAIN 

JULY 18-22, 2016 

Organized by: 

University of
Deusto 

Rovira i VirgiliUniversity


http://grammars.grlmc.com/webst2016/


*****************************************************************************


AIM: 

WebST 2016 is a research training event addressed to graduates
and postgraduates in the first steps of their academic career. With a
global scope, it aims at updating them about the most recent advances in
the critical, multidisciplinary and fast developing area of web studies,
which covers a large spectrum of current exciting research and
industrial innovation from computing and technologies to social sciences
and the humanities and has turned out to be the largest socio-technical
infrastructure in human history. Renowned academics and industry
pioneers will lecture and share their views with the audience. 

Most
subareas of web science and technology will be displayed, namely:
content analysis and information extraction, information networks,
search, data and semantics, ontologies, user behavior and
personalization, online communities, social networks, economic
transactions, mobility, security and privacy, graph analysis, web mining
and applications. Main challenges and opportunities will be identified
through 4 keynote lectures, 20 six-hour courses, and 1 round table,
which will tackle the most active and promising topics from various
perspectives: philosophy, sociology, politics, digital humanities,
economics, computer science, engineering and mathematics. The organizers
believe outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most
motivated students. Interaction will be a main component of the event.
Moreover, an open session will give participants the opportunity to
present their own work in progress in 5 minutes. 

ADDRESSED TO:


Graduates and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal
pre-requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will
be differences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may
be assumed for some of them. WebST 2016 is also appropriate for more
senior people who want to keep themselves updated on recent developments
and future trends. All will surely find it fruitful to listen and
discuss with major researchers, scholars, industry leaders and
innovators. 

REGIME: 

In addition to keynotes, at least 2 courses will
run in parallel during the whole event. Participants will be able to
freely choose the courses they will be willing to attend as well as to
move from one to another. 

VENUE: 

WebST 2016 will take place in
Bilbao, the capital of the Basque Country region, famous for its
gastronomy and the seat of the GuggenheimMuseum. The venue will be:


DeustoTech, School of Engineering
