Subject: Re: [Caml-list] LablGtk-documentation...

Hi,

For the C API, you should probably just load
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk2/stable/ and keep it around: the
documentation tends to not "regress" and it's often useful to have the
most recent one so that you can see that an API that you might need is
available in a newer version.

As you've probably seen, the C API links are file:/// URIs. This means
they're neither wrong nor right: it depends on the machine used to
display the documentation. I cannot tell what is the major on-disk path
for that documentation. For some people it would be solved by installing
the corresponding distribution package.

You can definitely argue that the links should point to gnome.org or
gtk.org but the issue remains: they point to an external resource which
is free to change. In any case, I agree that this should be fixed but I
don't have a definitive answer about how.

I'm partly to blame because I had started with lablgtk but subsequently
mostly gave up on GTK+ (not lablgtk) and therefore don't practice it.
Technically-speaking, I could fix it but I wouldn't be dog-feeding it,
making changes risky. Anyway, if you're interested in contributing, your
involvement will be welcome and I'll make my best to help you with that
(off-list preferably for simplicity matters).
