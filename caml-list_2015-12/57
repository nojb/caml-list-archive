Subject: [Caml-list] FLOPS 2016: Call for Participation and Posters/Demos


FLOPS 2016: 13th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming
March 4-6, 2016, Kochi, Japan    http://www.info.kochi-tech.ac.jp/FLOPS2016/   

Call for Participation and Posters/Demos

   Registration will be open on Monday, Dec 21, 2015.
   Early registration deadline is Monday, Feb 8, 2016.
   Poster/Demo abstract submission deadline is Monday, Jan 11, 2016.

FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and
implementers of the declarative programming, to discuss mutually
interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their
implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of
these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the
design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching
of declarative programming.  FLOPS specifically aims to
promote cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among
different styles of declarative programming.

In addition to the presentations of regular research papers, the FLOPS
program includes tutorials, as well as the poster/demo session for
demonstrating the tools and systems described during the talks and for
presenting works-in-progress and getting the feedback.

FLOPS has established a Best Paper award. The winner will be 
announced at the symposium.


CALLS FOR POSTERS AND DEMONSTRATIONS

If you wish to present a poster at FLOPS, please send the plain text
abstract by e-mail to <flops2016@easychair.org> -- by January 11, 2016.
The abstract should include the title, the names of the authors and
their affiliation, along with enough details to judge its scope and
relevance. We will announce the accepted submissions on January 25,
2016.  The format of the poster will be announced at that time.
Important Dates
  * Submission due:  January 11, 2016 (Monday), any time zone
  * Notification:    January 25, 2016 (Monday)
