I'm currently contributing to a 45KLOC C library which I'm sure would
be about 10 times smaller if written in a reasonable language.

Putting aside the obvious cultural resistance to using a sensible
language for this project, there is one technical hurdle: It needs to
compile into a DLL which can be linked to other programs (in C and
other languages).  I can't generate such code using ocamlopt, at least
not without using unsupported out-of-tree extensions.
