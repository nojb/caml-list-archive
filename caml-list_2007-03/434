The price for ocaml compatility and for (relative) simplicity.
Code mobility may be added later...

No, JoCaml is a modified OCaml system, besides parsing, typing
is different and we added a pattern matching feature that
must take place inside the compiler.

We hope so, and this should be quite simple.
At the moment JoCaml is a branch in OCaml cvs trunk. Synchronization
at release time is quite easy. This enable compatibility at the source
level almost for free.

Compatibility at the binary level apparently works.
