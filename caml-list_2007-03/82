That isn't the question. If Harrop developed it and sold it
for $US 5000.00 would your grant cover it?

Harrop can estimate the market by surveying researchers
and finding what their financial situations could support.

One grant isn't expected to cover the whole development!

BTW: I did some computational atmospheric photochemistry
in the 1970s, looking at ozone and effects of SSTs,
but mainly studying the socio-political role of 
funding of those studies .. (most of the money came
from people with vested interests :)
