                     TYPES Summer School 2007

         Proofs of Programs and Formalisation of Mathematics

               August 19-31 2007, Bertinoro, Italy

             http://TypesSummerSchool07.cs.unibo.it


During the last ten years major achievements have been made in using
computers for interactive proof developments to produce secure
software and to show interesting mathematical results. Recent major
results are, for instance, the complete formalisation of a proof of
the four colour theorem, and a formalisation of the prime number
theorem.

The summer school is a two weeks' course for postgraduate students,
researchers and industrials who want to learn about interactive proof
development. The present school follows the format of previous TYPES
summer school (in Baastad 1993, Giens 1999, Giens 2002 and Goteborg 2005).
There will be introductory and advanced lectures on lambda calculus, type
theory, logical frameworks, program extraction, proof carrying code,
formal topology and models, with relevant theoretical background.
Several talks will be devoted to applications.

During the two weeks, participants will get extensive opportunities to use 
and compare most ot the current tools for the automation of formal 
reasoning, comprising Agda, Coq, Epigram, Matita, Mizar and Isabelle/ 
Isar.

The school is organised by the TYPES working group "Types for Proofs
and Programs", which is a project in the IST (Information Society
Technologies) program of the European Union. A limited number of grants
covering part of travel, fees and ackommodation are available. Neither
participation nor grants are restricted to TYPES participants.

Grants
------
A large amount of money is available to offer travel grants. To apply
for a grant you must provide a recommendation letter and a CV or a similar
short description of yourself. All information/documentation concerning a
grant applications must reach us by June 4.

Both the recommendation letter and the CV must be sent to
typessummerschool@cs.unibo.it. Please use the subject: "grant 
application".
The recommendation letter must be sent to us directly by the person that
writes it. We will confirm by email each CV and recommendation letter we
receive.
