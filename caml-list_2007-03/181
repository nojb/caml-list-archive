                       Call For Papers

               Fourth International Workshop on
       HIGH-LEVEL PARALLEL PROGRAMMING AND APPLICATIONS
                         (HLPP 2007)

              The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan
                       July 23-24, 2007

AIMS AND SCOPE

Bill McColl's post Sequential Computing Considered Harmful is an
excellent summary of today's situation
(http://www.computingatscale.com). Sequential computing cannot go
further. Major companies in the computing industry now recognizes the
urgency of reorienting an entire industry towards massively parallel
computing.

The trend is towards the increase of cores in processors and the need
for scalable computing everywhere. But parallel and distributed
programming is still dominated by low-level techniques such as
send/receive message passing. Thus high-level approaches should play a
key role in the shift to scalable computing in every computer.

This workshop follows the first three HLPP workshops held in 2001,
2003 and 2005. It is aimed at:

- computer science researchers, practitioners, graduate students
- scientific computing researchers, practitioners, graduate students
- high-performance application developers (e.g. in DBMS, data-mining,
   parallel model checking, virtual reality)

TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including (but not limited to) the following aspects of
multi-core, concurrent, parallel, distributed, meta and grid
computing:

- high-level algorithms for parallel, communication-efficient and
   external-memory computation
- high-level programming models (BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.) and tools
- high-level programming models, tools and algorithms for
   multi-threaded, reconfigurable and multi-core computing
- parallel programming methodologies
- algorithmic skeletons and constructive methods
- performance models and performance evaluation
- high level resource-aware approaches object, functional,
   logic, constraint programming (semantics and implementation)
- verification of parallel and distributed programs
- security in high-level approaches
- applications using high-level languages and tools (scientific
   computing, DBMS, model-checking, virtual reality, ...)
- teaching experience with high-level tools and methods

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop. Revised versions
will be published in a special issue of an international journal
(previous HLPP workshops were published in Parallel Processing
Letters, World Scientific Publishing) provided revisions suggested by
the referees are made.

PAST HLPP WORKSHOPS

HLPP 2005 was held in Coventry (July 4-5, 2005).

HLPP 2003 was held in Paris (June 16-18, 2003). Parallel Processing
Letters (Volume 13, issue 3) contains 14 revised papers presented at
the workshop.

HLPP 2001 was held in Orleans (March 26-27, 2001). Parallel Processing
Letters (Volume 11,issue 4) contains 8 revised papers presented at the
workshop.
