Richard,

This sounds really great. I've been building Fedora RPMs for the last
few releases (the ones listed at http://rpm.nogin.org/ocaml.html and
linked from http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html ). However I
myself no longer use Fedora (only Red Hat EL at work and CentOS at
home). Because of that, I did not have energy to push for a better
integration of OCaml into Fedora, for working with Fedora Extras, etc.

This page currently states "This project is not affiliated with Red Hat
and does not provide support for RHEL."

As I said, RHEL and CentOS is what I and a number of my colleagues
currently use and I would like to keep providing "unofficial"
RHEL/CentOS binaries for them. If the project would have its primary
focus on Fedora, but would still provide RHEL-compatible .src.rpm and
distribute RHEL-compatible binaries (and there is no need to be
affiliated with Red Hat for that), I would be much more inclined to join.
