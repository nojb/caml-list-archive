I do this a little differently - and don't have your problem.  I use 
add_ui_from_string on a "UI manager" instance (from GAction.ui_manager 
()), since building up a menu bar and dropdowns seemed easier this way.

Then I build up an hbox with the resulting menu widget and a couple of 
other controls and pack *that* into the vbox, followed by the rest of 
my window contents and status bar widget.

In any case, the undesirable menu bar resizing does not occur for me.

Finally, you might check out the LablGTK mailing list (there is one) 
in the cc list, as they are a little more focused on things LablGTK.
