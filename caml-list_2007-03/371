OK, I am trying to convert my syntax extensions and everyday I hit a new
problem, which by default I report as a bug because if it's not documented
as an intentional incompatiblity, it must be a bug.

I started with pa_json_static.ml
(from http://martin.jambon.free.fr/json-static.html)
because it's fairly complete and doesn't use any dirty trick.
It manipulates all kinds of types, each of them as exprs, patts and ctyps.
So I guess once this works, it would be a big progress toward upgrading
all my stuff.

I'll publish the commented diffs as soon as I get a version that works,
but it would be much faster if you could do it for me. The thing is I
don't really know how I can help.

For now I am stuck with record type definitions:
With quotations in the revised syntax (command camlp4orf), how to create a
record field with an optional mutable flag?

  <:ctyp< $name$ : $opt:is_mutable$ $t1$ >>

gives a syntax error (well, that was yesterday night and it was late and
I don't have the details here, but you can check).
It's only needed because the $list:...$ is not supported for building my
whole record declaration, in version 3.10.0+beta that is.


Thanks

Martin
