When I read some of Luca Cardelli's papers on type inference I found that they 
were not explicit enough and required me to infer a lot. When that inference 
went wrong the backtracking was costly and seemed unneccesary because I could 
have read a paper 4x as long that required no inference.

But aren't we all here because we like inference and brevity?
