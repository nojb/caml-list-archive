While I didn't have the impression that ocaml related discussion, even
if not centering on the language definition, were OT here, I haven't
read the list charta for a long time. So it is for others to decide on
this, personally I never felt the need for separate forums (there are
also com.lamg,functional, comp.lang.haskell and comp.lang.ml where I
can discuss a wide range of topics, so that might explain why I never
felt it). 

It would be upt to others to formulate that need.

Probably I'd suscribe to another list/forum, but certainly not to a
Google Group or a web based forum. Archiving (at _my_ workstation) is
absolutely atrocious with those and I don't want to produce content
that is locked into Google and with which Google will do *their*
business for the rest of time.

May I suggest either a miling list, or a usenet news group from the alt hierarchie?
