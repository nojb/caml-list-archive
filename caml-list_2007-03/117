I don't think this is a real hurdle to general adoption of a language.
After all, Java and C# aren't intended to be used like that, yet they
certainly have wide-spread adoption.

I suppose there is gcj for Java, but that's not in 99+% of Java
development, and I'm not sure that will give you a lib at the end of the
day.  I don't know of an equivalent for that in C# -- in all the C#
development I've done, we've never even considered it.

I'm currently contributing to a 45KLOC C library which I'm sure would
be about 10 times smaller if written in a reasonable language.

Putting aside the obvious cultural resistance to using a sensible
language for this project, there is one technical hurdle: It needs to
compile into a DLL which can be linked to other programs (in C and
other languages).  I can't generate such code using ocamlopt, at least
not without using unsupported out-of-tree extensions.
