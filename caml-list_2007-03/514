Not sure this adds anything, but the kind of bioinformatics I do is
mostly statistics and similar with genomic/proteomic data sets. And
many (most ?) people seem to do that via R (and maybe C, and to a
lesser extent Fortran, called from R). We also tend to use
parallelization quite a bit via MPI (from this list, I understand some
of the latter might fit some of F#'s strengths).

Python usage, for us, is limited to some initial data cleaning, error
checking, etc, (we also use some sed and awk) and the CGI interfaces.

I am not sure how OCaml would fit here but it'd be great to see
examples of usage.

Best,

R.
