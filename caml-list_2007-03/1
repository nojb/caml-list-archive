X-Spam: no; 0.00; hodgson:01 gcc:01 flags:01 hodgson:01 averse:98 compile:01 compile:01 complains:01 variables:02 i'd:05 missing:07 missing:07 plant:91 i'm:09 i'm:09 

has anyone had any luck building lablscintilla?
i'm on centos 4.4, and am having trouble with the makefile's
use of "cl" for c and c++ compile and link (CC and CCXX variables). 

this program is not found on my machine.  am i missing a package?  
i tried changing this to gcc/g++, but then it complains about a bunch
of the compile time flags.  i'm not averse to hacking through this and
feeding back what i come up with, but i thought i'd just check first,
and make sure i'm not missing something obvious.

thanks
