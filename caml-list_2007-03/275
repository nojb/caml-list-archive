              The Fifth ASIAN Symposium on
      Programming Languages and Systems (APLAS 2007)
                   CALL FOR PAPERS

                     Singapore
              November 29 - December 1, 2007

          http://flint.cs.yale.edu/aplas2007/

APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by providing a
forum for the presentation of recent results and the exchange of ideas
and experience in topics concerned with programming languages and
systems.  APLAS is based in Asia, but is an international forum that
serves the worldwide programming languages community.

The APLAS series is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation
of Software (AAFS), which has recently been founded by Asian
researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the
USA.  The past formal APLAS symposiums were successfully held in
Sydney (2006, Australia), Tsukuba (2005, Japan), Taipei (2004, Taiwan)
and Beijing (2003, China) after three informal workshops held in
Shanghai (2002, China), Daejeon (2001, Korea) and Singapore (2000).
Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in Springer-Verlag's
LNCS 2895, 3302, 3780, and 4279.

TOPICS:

The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical issues in
programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on, but not
limited, to the following topics:

    * semantics, logics, foundational theory
    * type systems, language design
    * program analysis, optimization, transformation
    * software security, safety, verification
    * compiler systems, interpreters, abstract machines
    * domain-specific languages and systems
    * programming tools and environments

Original results that bear on these and related topics are
solicited. Papers investigating novel uses and applications of
language systems are especially encouraged. Authors concerned about
the appropriateness of a topic are welcome to consult with the program
chair (shao@cs.yale.edu) prior to submission.

IMPORTANT DATES:

  Paper Submission Deadline:   11:00 AM (in Samoan Time), June 15, 2007 
  Author Notification:         August 17, 2007
  Camera Ready:                September 7, 2007
  Conference:                  November 29-December 1, 2007

SUBMISSIONS INFORMATION:

Papers should be submitted electronically online via the conference
submission webpage. Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable
by Ghostview or Acrobat Reader. Submissions should not exceed 16 pages
in LNCS format, including bibliography and figures.  Submitted papers
will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness,
originality, and clarity. They should clearly identify what has been
accomplished and why it is significant. Submitted papers must be
unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. The
proceedings of the symposium is planned to be published as a volume in
Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
