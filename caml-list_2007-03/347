You know... I have found myself on several occasions wishing for =20
something like that.  A nitpick: I think I'd be happier with "type =20
rec" as opposed to "rec type" since that seems symmetrical with the =20
"let rec" phrasing.  Yes, I would expect "type rec a =3D ... and b =20
=3D ... and c =3D ..." to allow all three types to be recursive.
