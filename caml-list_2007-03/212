Hi, list

This is a quick bug-fix and features update to Enhtop since the first
release. Main enhancements include:

  * fixed a serious bug of visiting values from opened modules (Thanks Roberto)
  * new directive #env to set toplevel environment configuration. For now,
    which kinds of declarations get pretty printed is configurable, and we
    make a default configuration different from, and hopefully more rational
    than, the original toplevel setting. 
  * new directive #modu to list all the modules at hand and indicate whether
    they are already loaded or not. 
  * #directory now support the removal of path by prefixing "-"
  * #tell can now distinguish which module the current binding is from, in the
    case that more than one modules have the same identifier and all being
    opened
  * #tell now allow independent access to a single entry of an external
    module. It prints both the value and the type of the visited entry if 
    the module is already loaded, otherwise only the type is printed.
  * *most* of the directives (both original and newly added ones) now get
    "defaults", i.e., when executed without any arguments, they fall back to
    some predefined default functions, which usually provide relevant
    helping information. e.g. #directory will print out current path setting,
    #load will print out the name of all .cmo and .cma currently available etc.
  * the feedback of some directives is improved.

Check changelog and README from its website for more details and examples. 

One thing you should note that, we do not touch source files other than those
inside the "toplevel" directory. I.e. there is no modification to your
compilers (ocamlc/ocamlopt etc.) and libraries, the compilers themselves and
the executables produced by them should remain identical to the originals. So
you're safe and free to switch to it or switch back. We'd like to get more
feedback from more people to improve it.

> This is an experimental patch (we also provide pre-built testing executable and
> Debian package) for an enhanced OCaml toplevel with following features:
>
> For any kind of bindings (i.e. value, type, module, class etc.):
>
>   * Identifiers been rebound are shown differently by default, to distinguish
>     with currently effective ones
>   * A new directive to query (by kinds or names or their composition) and show
>     both current and history bindings
>   * A new directive to show the current binding of any identifier without
>     evaluating or rebinding it
>   * A type-check-only testing mode to experiment your definitions without
>     polluting the world, and the directive to enter/leave it
