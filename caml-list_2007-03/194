That's what happens in practice. But no, the ocaml-beginners list is 
described as a beginners' forum. Why would anyone else subscribe?

I've been receiving the messages from ocaml-beginners since its creation. 
At that time I was not a beginner for a long time already, but it has been 
interesting until now because some questions are just practical 
questions which do not have anything to do with learning the OCaml 
language.
But here again, not everyone is interested in reading and answering 
beginners' questions, which still constitutes the majority of messages 
there.
