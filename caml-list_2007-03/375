Oops I don't remember that was in French (sorry for those that can't read it)

Yes I understand your point, but that's why I pointed out these slides
that talk about many of these features, even if it's from a
presentation point of view.

If I start traducing all camlp4 extensions (or the first of everyone),
I'm not done!

<just kidding>
Perhaps there is a need for some consulting services on camlp4 :)

Generally all flags: private, mutable, virtual, rec, .., to/downto now
have their own antiquotation.

<:expr< let $rec:is_rec$ f f = f in f >>
<:class_str_item< value $mutable:is_mutable$ x = 42 >>
<:ctyp< < meth1 : int ; meth2 : float $..:raw_variable$ > >>
...

However there is some exceptions to that rule.

A private type is a type surrounded by a node "private".
That's now the same thing for mutable types.

You can define this function if you want:

let mkmutable is_mutable = if is_mutable then <:ctyp< mutable $t$ >> else t

Or rewrite a little the code to take a better profit of this change.

BTW: camlp4/Camlp4Parsers/Camlp4OCamlRevisedParser.ml contains many of
your answers.

Best regards,
