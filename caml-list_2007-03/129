It is in fact an utter and complete show stopper.
I've spent 6 years developing Felix precisely to solve this
problem: a high level language that can generate shared libraries
which can use and be used by other shared libraries.

Ocaml is great for stand-alone programs but a significant
fraction of software development is library building,
and Linux distros such as those based on Debian provide
a library component model which demands dynamic linkage
so the components can be upgraded without end user recompilation.

I expect this will eventually be solved too.

They don't make binary shared libraries
because the architecture is a virtual machine driven by
bytecode .. they DO make dynamically linkable bytecode
libraries.
