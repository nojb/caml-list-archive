Is there some documentation or at least a tutorial for how to setup ocamlbuild in order to build a lib<name>.a file from a bunch of *.c, *.C, and *.h files?

And after having done that, how to tell ocamlbuild that some ocmal-program which is build depends on lib<name>.a.

Currently I build lib<name>.a using a Makefile and the g++ compiler. After that I create a <name>.cma like

 ocamlc -cc g++ -ccopt -L<name> -a -o <name>.cma -custom \
 <some *.cmo files> -cclib -l<name>

Then I compile the program using the ocaml-interfaced C++ library like

 ocamlc -cc g++ -o <progname> -ccopt -L<path to lib<name>.a> \
 -cclib -l<name> <name>.cma <some *.cmo files>

For each of the 3 steps I need a different Makefile and almost always when something changes I have to do the cumbersome
make clean; make depend; make cycle to avoid any compile errors
like inconsistent assumptions over interfaces. There should be an easier way, shouldn't it?

cheers

christian
