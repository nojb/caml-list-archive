Actually, it was once included in lablgtk2, but then development was
(I believe) interrupted.

lablgtk2 supports libglade, so you can use glade2, and write your
application logic in ocaml. Look at the lablgladecc tool.

Cameleon included an interface editor, but I don't see it in the
features of Cameleon2, so it may just that people see little point in
trying to reimplement glade.
