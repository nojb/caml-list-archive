Dear all,

For a long time I've been thinking that it would be nice to have a forum
for "OCaml software developers", i.e. focused on the practical use of
OCaml and its interaction with other existing technologies. It means that
discussions that are not centered on the OCaml language may not be off-topic.

Let me know (privately or not) if you would be interested. I think that
this plus a wiki are important to help programmers find the right tool
for a job or the right piece of documentation without having to subscribe
to the mailing-lists of each existing library or reading all the manuals.

I reserved a Google group named ocaml-developer:

  http://groups.google.com/group/ocaml-developer/

I may just kill it if people are not thrilled by the idea, or prefer
another name or another host than Google Groups.


Martin
