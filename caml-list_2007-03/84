What's I think is the interesting point about this discussion is "What are
the hurdles toward acceptance of any new language, scripting or not, into a
given community?"  Obviously OCAML and the ML languages have deeply
penetrated some markets but haven't even dented others.  There have been
lots of papers, studies, and discussion written on this (
lambda-the-ultimate.org has many of them archived) so that's probably
something for a different thread to be read wearing flame-retardant
underthings.

Professionally I'm in a community that could deeply benefit from the type of
language that would allow for scripting, data analysis, etc, that could then
be directly compiled into tight executable code.  While the barriers to
entry to that market could be high, I'm in a position where I could see
selling it.  I could actually get really excited about this.

Probably something to take off list if this is something to pursue
