I have a program compiled to native code on a linux machine, which uses 
some more-or-less "standard" library like libpangocairo-1.0.so.0.
Since this library is not universally present on all linux boxes, I 
suspect it might be not so easy for an average user to install it. 
Moreover, it's very small. Therefore I decide to ship it with my software.

The question is: is there a way to decide, at run-time, whether the user 
already has this library or not ? If so, I can ignore (and even delete) 
the version I shipped, and use the user's library. If not, I fall back 
on "my" version.

reader (icedove) - in the wrong thread.
