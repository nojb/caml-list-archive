In fact, there is no font attribute in source tag styles of gtksourceviews.
I could not find any gedit screenshot showing two distinct fonts in the same
gtksourceview.

Here is a little explanation about how the gtksourceview works (as I
understand it).

Gtk offers buffers and views on buffers. There can be more than one view on
one buffer. In each buffer, one can define "tags", and associate parts of
the text in a buffer to these tags. These tags can have different style
which allows to render the (parts of) text in different colors, font
weight, ... depending on the associated tags. This is for Gtk.

What gtksourceview brings is a convenient way to define syntax elements and
new buffers and views, inheriting from the original ones of gtk. The new
buffers (source_buffers) can be given a language, which is a description of
syntax elements. The buffers then automatically define tags
corresponding to the syntax elements of the language and associates these
tags to the parts of the text in the buffer, according to the definition
of the syntax elements (keywords, beginning and ending of blocks, ...). The
application only has to define the styles of each of these tags to provide
syntax highlighting.

The styles associated to "syntax tags" can be used to define background and
foreground colors, bold, italic, strikethrough, and underline attributes.

So each application has to define (and eventually store) the attributes
associated to each "syntax tags" for each language.

I hope this explanation was useful (and quite clear).

By the way, the lablgtksourceview library offers bindings to the
gtksourceview library (and so the features above):
http://helm.cs.unibo.it/software/lablgtksourceview/

This library is used in Chamo to provide syntax highlighting.
