I have seen several references to mlglade, which was apparently an adaptation of 
glade, a GUI designer for the Gimp toolkit, for Ocaml that uses the excellent 
lablGtk bindings to that toolkit. I cannot seem to find a homepage for the 
project and am wondering what became of it.

If anyone has alternative suggestions on designing GTK-based GUIs (or other 
toolkits for that matter), I'd like to explore the available options.

Cheers,
Chris
