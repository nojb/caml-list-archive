It is a hurdle because not all programming is writing end-user
application code.

In fact what is somewhat sad is that OCaml (unlike Java and C#) can
compile to native code which really has very minimal "environmental
needs" - just a smallish library of functions and a GC which is
written on top of C's malloc.  So really it could be an ideal
replacement for libraries written in C, where the heavy lifting is
done in OCaml and there are some thin bindings to provide a C API.
