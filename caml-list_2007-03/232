Below is the CFP for the 2007 Workshop on ML.  Note that this year, we
are introducing a new paper category of "work-in-progress reports".
These are intended as a way of informing others in the ML community
about the status of ML-related research or implementation projects, as
well as communicating insights gained from such projects that do not
quite constitute a full research paper.  See the CFP below for details.

If you are interested in submitting a paper, but you are not sure
about what category it belongs in or if it would be appropriate for
the workshop, please feel free to ask me.

                  The 2007 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

                        Friday, October 5, 2007
                           Freiburg, Germany

                To be held in conjunction with ICFP '07

             http://research.microsoft.com/~crusso/ml2007/

                            CALL FOR PAPERS

GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP:

The ML family of programming languages, whose most popular dialects are
Standard ML and Objective Caml, has inspired a tremendous amount of computer
science research, both practical and theoretical. ML continues to be
employed successfully in applications ranging from compilers and theorem
provers to low-level systems software, web applications and video games. The
Workshop on ML aims to bring together researchers, developers and users of
ML to hear about and discuss the latest work on the design, semantics,
implementation and application of ML and ML-like languages. Previous ML
workshops have been held in Orlando, Florida (1994), Baltimore, Maryland
(1998), Tallinn, Estonia (2005), and Portland, Oregon (2006).

The 2007 Workshop on ML will be held in conjunction with the 12th ACM
SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2007) in
Freiburg, Germany on Friday, October 5, 2007.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

This year, we are seeking paper submissions of two varieties: *research
papers* and *work-in-progress reports*.

*Research papers* must present original research that has not been published
elsewhere. We welcome research papers on any ML-related topic, including
(but not limited to):

 * applications
 * concurrent programming
 * formal semantics
 * language design
 * language formalization and mechanization
 * language implementation
 * programming environments
 * type systems

*Work-in-progress reports* need not present original research. Rather, they
are intended as a way of informing others in the ML community about the
status of ML-related research or implementation projects, as well as
communicating insights gained from such projects that do not quite
constitute a full research paper. As such, we expect that work-in-progress
reports will be shorter than research papers, and we will not judge them to
the same standard. If you have any questions regarding the appropriate paper
category for a potential submission or its overall suitability for the
workshop, please contact the program chair.

All paper submissions must be at most 12 pages total length in the standard
ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference format. Authors of work-in-progress report
submissions should designate their papers as such by including the words
"work in progress" or "status report" in the title. Submissions authored by
program committee members are permitted, with the usual stipulation that
they will be judged to a higher standard.

Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM
Digital Library.

Details of the submission process will be provided at a time closer to the
submission deadline.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission deadline:        Friday, June 15, 2007
Notification of acceptance: Friday, July 13, 2007
Final revision due:         Friday, August 3, 2007
