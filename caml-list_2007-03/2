Check the INSTALL.txt and the Makefile again - the PLATFORM variable 
needs to be set, either in your environment or on the make command 
line.  In your case, the value should presumably be "linux".

I have only built and tested this on Fedora Core 6 and Windows XP, so 
your experiences could be of use to others... and possibly help in 
updating the package itself.
