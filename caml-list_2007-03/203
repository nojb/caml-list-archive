Really? But how will the relevant mail be distributed to the
relevant lists? Aren't we deciding by hand to which list the mail goes
and isn't this prone to errors (i.e. "language geekiness" turning up
at your list and pedestrian mail turning up at caml-list)? And if the
splitting of mail by topics ("by hand") doesn't work well enough,
we'll all have to subscribe to two lists. How annoying.

I didn't complain about subscribing, but that there is another
list. Which will have (in my setup at least) to be sorted by the
incoming mail sorter, will have to have its own local folder/archive
and its own quirks concerning the mail headers (which are NEVER right
in lists). All that is work too.

But seriously: If you list is a success, we will have two mailing list
archives (that have to be searched for solutions) and I don't expect
we'll be able to avoid subscribing to both lists, because the scopes
of each lists can hardly be distinguished. ONE always wins over TWO,
that's all. :-)

And fragmentation hurts especially the newcomers who will often only
find and search one archive/list and then go away disapppointed (or
enraged).

And: Will the CAML weekly news editor also read you list?
