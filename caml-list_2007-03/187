Hello,

There's a new OCaml mailing-list/forum for OCaml software developers:

  http://groups.google.com/group/ocaml-developer

This forum is centered on practical issues that arise during OCaml
software development.

Appropriate topics for this forum include:

* Which library should I use for doing job X?
* Should I write my own?
* Has anyone had the same problem before?
* How to communicate with other software components written in language Y?
* Project architecture and build tools
* Cross-platform issues
* Web development
* Intensive and distributed computing
* Packaging and distribution
* File formats and implementation of domain-specific languages
  ...

Of course all the topics above must be addressed in the context of OCaml
applications.


Topics which are excluded from this forum are:

* Learning the OCaml language
* Discussing language extensions without trying to implement and use them
  effectively

ocaml_beginners@yahoogroups.com and caml-list@inria.fr and wonderful
places for such things...
