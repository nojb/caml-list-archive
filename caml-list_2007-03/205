This is all nice and very moral, but: According to which criteria has
the writer to select the list? No language geekiness at your list,
that much is clear :-], but he/she can as well post almost anything to
caml-list according to the charter of caml-list. This doesn't bode
well for a distinctive sorting ...

More Googleization at work. I dislike it. The internet is not only the
web. Which brings me to another point against Google groups: There is
no downloadable archive of messages (say in mbox format) which one can
download and index/search locally by the program of ones
choice. Basically all messages (as a whole) are locked into Google for
the rest of time and every time one wants to find anything, one also
furthers Googles business. At the long run a dear price to pay for a
"free service".

Good. IMHO that rather upgrades the status of the new list.
