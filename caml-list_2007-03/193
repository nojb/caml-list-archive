I agree 100%.  This is the biggest limitation to using ocaml for large projects. 
  If it were fixed, ocaml would become an unstoppable juggernaut ;-)

Here's a paper describing an approach to this problem for an extended version of 
Standard ML:

http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/Papers/abstracts/missing-link.html

This actually goes further than dynamic linking to provide a full component 
model.  What I wouldn't give to see this in ocaml.
