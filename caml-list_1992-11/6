producing directly runnable code for this architecture.

You have three choices :
 - port the Le_Lisp runtime (*not* easy, very expensive and nobody wants
to do that...) on Snake architecture or develop a byte-code version
(no so stupid !)
 - use only non-interactive (i.e. batch...) version of CAML, throwing
away the toplevel loop
 - use Caml-Light who has a byte-code interpreter (note: there is no
really usable byte-coded version of the Le_Lisp runtime)

PS : you have or will have the same problem for all the new RISC architectures
(DEC Alpha, MIPS R4000, Intel Pentium, ...)
