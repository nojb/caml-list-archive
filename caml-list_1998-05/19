There is OK. Indeed, when defining the  quotient and the remainder you
must specify the range of the remainder. Usually, you specify that the
remainder of the division of a by b is between  0 and b-1, whatever is
the sign of a. That is the case in the big_in library.

But in the case of Caml division, the  specification is different: the
remainder has the same sign that a, which is negative in your example.

But in both cases you always have

	a = b * (a/b) + (a mod b)

which is the expected invariant.
