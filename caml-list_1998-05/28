The problem we face is that Ocaml is not palatable for most people. The
Ensemble (our Group Communication System) code base is free and anyone
(including companies) can pick it up and use it. The problem we find is
that people are unwilling to use ML and will rather build their own
systems in Java/C/C++/SmallTalk. We believe that having a Java version of
our software will make it more accessible. This version may be
automatically generated and may not be very readable, but it will still be
100% Java which is a desirable property nowadays. At least it will compile
and link with other Java code.
