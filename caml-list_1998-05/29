(sorry, no French)

Tuareg 1.30 is now available.

It's goal is to provide a good support for Caml editing and debugging.
See the README file and on-line help for details.

Major changes include:
- Correct intentation with multi-line strings;
- Significant speed-up with long sequences of "and", large blocks...
- Deeply improved Sym-Lock features (replacing multicharcter operators;
  by pretty symbols);
- Increased interactivity with Caml toplevel;
- Compatibile with Caml 1.07, OLabl 1.07 and Camllight.
- Many bugs corrected and configuration options added.

The archive can be found at
http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/~acohen/tuareg.html

It includes the standard camldebug.el file, which has not been changed
since April 1996, except minor adaptation to the new name of the mode.

Warning: This version is no more compatible with old Emacses (before
19.30).

Tuareg is a constantly evolving product: I'll be glad to receive bug
reports and comments!
