Hi,
  It has been brought to my attention that a compiler from 
SML to java bytecode has been written, see:
    http://research.persimmon.co.uk/
We, at the Ensemble project could use such a compiler. Even better
would be a compiler from Ocaml to Java (not bytecode). Is anything
in the works? 

	Ohad.
