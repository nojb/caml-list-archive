Subject: polymorphic printer functions ?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello everybody ...

I'd like to know how to implement polymorphic printer functions. 
(I use ocaml 1.07)

I'm writing a library implementing a large subset of the Z library operators
(operations on sets, relations, functions, and so on) and i would like
to be able to install printer functions for printing 'a set, ('a,'b) relations,
etc.,  (using #install_printer). set, relations being abstract types
constructors.

Writing a polymorphic printer for such structures means to be able to call a
function printing each element.
Is there any function like
  print_value : 'a -> unit 
available when using the top level ?
