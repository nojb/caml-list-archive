Thank you for your interest in my library.

Because I thought Haskell's scanl is more similar to EventSig.scan than foldl.

scanl : (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> [a]
foldl : (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a

BTW, I have just noticed Event.scan has a bug. The result of scan function should
  contain initial value specified second argument, but Event.scan doesn't.
That has been fixed.
