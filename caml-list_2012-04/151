Alternative malloc implementation may well be worth a try. I've seen the cases
when glibc was constantly growing RSS while tcmalloc was on stable level (and 10x less), 
guessing due to fragmentation.
Maybe related, see PR#5389 for ocaml compaction related issues.
Also have a look at http://ygrek.org.ua/p/code/mlvalues.py for the way to peep
into ocaml heap at runtime.
