Subject: [Caml-list] Recursive polymorphic variants

Hi list,

why is this definition allowed:
    type t = [`A of t]
but the following one fails:
    type t = [`A of [t|`B]]
    Error: The type constructor t is not yet completely defined

Is there any work-around?

(My actual example is much larger and complex but I think it boils down to this
simple case.)

Many thanks,
