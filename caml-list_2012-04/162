                            LoCoCo 2012
    Third International Workshop on Logics for Component Configuration
      28th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2012)
                  Budapest, Hungary, September 8, 2012
                    http://lococo.irill.org/2012
                          Call for Papers

=======================================================================
======================================================================= 


Scope:
======

Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic of
great importance for many application domains. For example, modern
software distributions are based on the notion of components, which
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components
provide the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software
distribution, but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting
components from a large repository of possible choices, and
configuring these components according to user needs, resource
constraints, and interdependencies with other components.  Some
well-known examples of complex systems of components in the world of
Free and Open Source software are software packages of distributions
for GNU/Linux, BSD, or Eclipse plugins. A different application domain
is manufacturing where a company seeks to meet the varying needs of
customers by assembling configurable products from components.

Understanding and solving these questions is an attractive research
topic since, on the one hand, the problems to be solved are complex
and interesting for researchers working on solving techniques. On the
other hand, research in this area has the potential of high impact on
the way how the systems that we all use every day are developed,
deployed, and maintained.

Not only adequate logical formalisms to represent a configuration
problem are required, but also sophisticated reasoning technologies to
deal with large amounts of data. Further relevant aspects include
diagnosis of failed configuration settings and an intelligent behavior
dealing with user preferences.

This workshop will focus on logic-based methods for specifying and
solving complex configuration problems.  The goal of the workshop is
to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the
area of component configuration of systems, using different modeling
and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programming,
description logics, satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop
will be an opportunity to discuss common and complementary solutions
for solving component configuration.

Previous LoCoCo workshops took place in Edinburgh at FLoC 2010,
and Perugia at CP 2011.

Topics:
=======
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
* Configuration problems and models: knowledge representation and
   acquisition, incomplete knowledge, inconsistent knowledge, etc.
* Reasoning methods for solving configuration problems: constraint
   satisfaction and optimization, logic and answer-set programming,
   SAT solving and extensions, integer programing, local search,
   symmetry breaking, etc.
* Interactivity: user preferences, machine learning, distributed
   environments, etc.
* Applications and tools: case studies, current challenges,
   application reports, etc.

Invited Talk

(To be announced)

MISC 2012
=========
The third Mancoosi International Solver Competition will be held in
conjunction with the LoCoCo workshop, see http://www.mancoosi.org/misc.

Important Dates
===============
Wednesday, June 20     Submission deadline
Friday, July 13        Notification about acceptance/rejection
Wednesday, July 25     Final paper due
Saturday, September 8  Workshop

Submission and Publication
==========================

We solicit submissions of research papers describing original
work. Submitted research papers must not have been previously
published, nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere. This
includes system descriptions and tutorial overview papers. System
descriptions should come with an URL allowing to access or download the
system, with preference to systems that can be downloaded under an open
source licence. Presentations of system descriptions at the workshop
should include a system demonstration.

Besides regular research papers we also welcome short presentations
reporting on recent or ongoing work. These are not subject to
restriction as for previous, simultaneous, or future publication
elsewhere. Short presentations will be included in the workshop working
notes distributed to workshop participants and will be made available
through the workshop web pages.

The complete proceedings, containing the accepted papers of both
categories, will be made freely available on the web for the workshop,
and will be distributed to the workshop participants.  In addition to
that, we intend to publish the accepted regular research papers in a
special issue of Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science
(EPTCS) as in the previous years.

Submitted papers (both regular research papers and short
presentations) must not exceed a limit of 10 pages, and have to be
prepared in LaTeX following the EPTCS formatting instructions.
Authors may provide pointers to additional online resources if
necessary, and which the reviewers may use to their sole discretion.
Authors of accepted papers will keep their copyright, however all
papers must carry one of the different brands of the Creative Commons
Licence mandated by EPTCS, and must be submitted to CoRR. Authors of
accepted regular research papers have to grant EPTCS a non-exclusive
licence to distribute.

Submission is via Easychair at
