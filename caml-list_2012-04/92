Subject: [Caml-list] Printexc.register_printer without catch

Hello,

Is there a way to change printing of uncaught exceptions in the toplevel 
and in (native/bytecode, 3.12) compiled code without wrapping the whole 
code in a try ... with or in Printexc.catch?

Printexc.catch's documentation says it is deprecated and that the 
runtime system should be able to print exceptions the way they were 
registered with Printexc.register_printer, yet

# Printexc.register_printer begin function Not_found -> Some "hello" | _ 
-> None end;;
# raise Not_found;;
Exception: Not_found.

(* I would expect it to respond [Exception: hello] *)

Do I miss something here?
Thanks in advance,
     -m
