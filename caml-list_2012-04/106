Thanks, I realise I hadn't properly understood what -I +... was doing.
I can't use the cryptokit from godi because opa depends on
cryptokit-1.5 and godi ships 1.3.

Wish I could! It's a pretty big open source project that I'm merely
trying to get compiled so I can use it. I don't have the time to sit
and hack at their build system :( But thanks for the detailed
explanation of why ocamlfind is the way to go; I'll definitely be
using it for all my personal projects.
