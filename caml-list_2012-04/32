                    CALL FOR TALK PROPOSALS

                           HOPE 2012

                The 1st ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
              Higher-Order Programming with Effects

                       September 9, 2012
                      Copenhagen, Denmark
                   (the day before ICFP 2012)

                  http://hope2012.mpi-sws.org


HOPE is a *new workshop* that is intended to bring together
researchers interested in the design, semantics, implementation, and
verification of higher-order effectful programs. It will be
*informal*, consisting of invited talks, contributed talks on work in
progress, and open-ended discussion sessions. This 1st edition of HOPE
is dedicated to John Reynolds, whose work is an inspiration to us all.


---------------------
Goals of the Workshop
---------------------

A recurring theme in many papers at ICFP, and in the research of many
ICFP attendees, is the interaction of higher-order programming with
various kinds of effects: storage effects, I/O, control effects,
concurrency, etc. While effects are of critical importance in many
applications, they also make it hard to build, maintain, and reason
about one's code. Higher-order languages (both functional and
object-oriented) provide a variety of abstraction mechanisms to help
"tame" or "encapsulate" effects (e.g. monads, ADTs, ownership types,
typestate, first-class events, transactions, Hoare Type Theory,
session types, substructural and region-based type systems), and a
number of different semantic models and verification technologies have
been developed in order to codify and exploit the benefits of this
encapsulation (e.g. bisimulations, step-indexed Kripke logical
relations, higher-order separation logic, game semantics, various
modal logics). But there remain many open problems, and the field is
highly active.

The goal of the HOPE workshop is to bring researchers from a variety
of different backgrounds and perspectives together to exchange new and
exciting ideas concerning the design, semantics, implementation, and
verification of higher-order effectful programs.

We want HOPE to be as informal and interactive as possible. The
program will thus involve a combination of invited talks, contributed
talks about work in progress, and open-ended discussion
sessions. There will be no published proceedings, but participants
will be invited to submit working documents, talk slides, etc. to be
posted on this website.


-----------------------
Call for Talk Proposals
-----------------------

We solicit proposals for contributed talks. Proposals should be at
most 2 pages, in either plain text or PDF format, and should specify
how long a talk the speaker wishes to give. By default, contributed
talks will be 30 minutes long, but proposals for shorter or longer
talks will also be considered. Speakers may also submit supplementary
material (e.g. a full paper, talk slides) if they desire, which PC
members are free (but not expected) to read.

We are interested in talks on all topics related to the interaction of
higher-order programming and computational effects. Talks about work
in progress are particularly encouraged. If you have any questions
about the relevance of a particular topic, please contact the PC
chairs at the address hope2012@mpi-sws.org.

Deadline for talk proposals: 	June 8, 2012 (Friday)

Notification of acceptance:   	July 1, 2012 (Sunday)

Workshop:    			September 9, 2012 (Sunday)

The submission website is now open:
