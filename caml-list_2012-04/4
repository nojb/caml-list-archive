It depends on what you call "under the Cygwin environment". What matters 
is which toolchain OCaml uses.  It has always been the case that the 
"officially supported" toolchain for the MinGW port of OCaml is provided 
by Cygwin packages (previously: the regular gcc package, with the 
-mno-cygwin flag; now: the mingw64 32-bit or 64-bit packages). Which 
does not imply any runtime dependency on Cygwin for the binaries 
compiled with ocamlopt.
