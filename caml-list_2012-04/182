Well, the conclusion would be that there is something wrong with the
installation ;-)

It could be that there is more than one installation of these
libraries on your system and that they are in conflict.  E.g. if you
ever installed type_conv outside of Godi.

There is surely a reason for this exception.  It might indeed be due
to incompatible preprocessing modules.

To make sure that things compile, please delete any potential other
installations of the above libraries from your system.  One problem
that seems to have happened for some people is that they previously
installed type-conv and bin-prot.  These packages have been renamed to
type_conv and bin_prot (complex reason).  If they have been previously
installed, you may now have both packages on your system.  It seems
Godi cannot determine renamed packages and will leave old ones in
place.  Please make sure to manually delete all files and directories
in your Godi installation that match "*type-conv*" or "*bin-prot*".
If in doubt, just completely reinstall Godi.  I've just tested the
current release, and it works for me.

Regards,
Markus
