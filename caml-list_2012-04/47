THE TOPIC
---------

Intelligent computing covers a hybrid palette of methods and techniques derived
from classical artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, multi-agent
systems a.o. Distributed computing studies systems that contain loosely-coupled
components running on different networked computers and that communicate and
coordinate their actions by message transfer. The emergent field of intelligent
distributed computing is expected to pose special challenges of adaptation and
fruitful combination of results of both areas with a great impact on
the development
of new generation intelligent distributed information systems. The aim of this
symposium is to bring together researchers involved in intelligent distributed
computing to allow cross-fertilization and synergy of ideas and to enable
advancement of researches in the field.

The symposium welcomes submissions of original papers concerning all aspects of
intelligent distributed computing ranging from concepts and
theoretical developments
to advanced technologies and innovative applications. Papers acceptance and
publication will be judged based on their relevance to the symposium
theme, clarity
of presentation, originality and accuracy of results and proposed solutions.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Intelligent Distributed Architecture
------------------------------------
Hybrid systems involving software agents and human actors
Intelligent integration of data and processes
