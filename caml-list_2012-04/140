Now also posting to the web via Twitter at:

Hi...
As of January 16, 2004 - I am no longer working for the Nunavut Department of Education.. I am no longer moderating the Haa Ai e-mail list at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/haa-ai
so I have stared a new list as my interest in Nunavut and circumpolar issues and education did not stop when I left Education Nunavut.
It lives at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/nunavutcircumpolar

As far as I know, no one has been assigned to continue the running of Haa Ai... and, I suspect, no one will be.

To subscribe to my new list, please send a blank e-mail to 
nunavutcircumpolar-subscribe@yahoogroups.com
if you wish to continue (or start) to get information about Nunavut, the circumpolar regions and related topics.

If you have any problems subscribing or wish to receive the list's postings in a single full text daily digest mode.. let me know at the e-mail address below and I will take care of it for you.

Thanks
George Lessard
