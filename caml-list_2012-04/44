Dear colleagues,

we would like to invite you to submit a paper to

WCB12 - Workshop on Constraint Based Methods for Bioinformatics 2012
--------------------------------------------------------------------
September, 8th, 2012
Budapest, Hungary
Collocated with ICLP 2012

Submission: May, 18th, 2012


OVERVIEW AND SCOPE

Bioinformatics is a challenging and fast growing area of research,
which is of utmost importance for our understanding of life. Major
contributions to this discipline can have thousands of positive
effects in medicine, agriculture, or industry. To pick out only a few
examples, Bioinformatics tackles problems related to

 * Recognition, analysis, and organization of DNA sequences. For
   instance, Haplotype/Pedigree inference, Phylogenetic
   reconstruction, Motif localization, and Alignments
 * Biological systems simulations (for metabolic or regulatory
   networks)
 * Prediction of the spatial conformation of a bio-polymer, given its
   sequence of monomers (in particular for proteins and RNA).

The main aim of this workshop is twofold. On the one hand, to share
recent results in this area (new ideas, systems and solvers that rely
on constraints, but also on Logic Programming, Answer Set Programming,
Linear Programming, Mixed Integer Linear Programming, Local Search,
and any other AI techniques, possibly combining some of them). On the
other hand, to present new challenging problems recently formalized
but still beyond current computing capabilities.


MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION

We welcome submissions of

    * Extended Abstracts of new results
    * Abstract of ongoing works
    * Systems presentations (with demos at the workshop)
    * Summaries of already accepted or recently published results

in the topics above. Manuscripts should be formatted in the standard
llncs style and submitted as PDF. The page limit is 6 pages.
Submission is handled by Easychair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wcb12


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission Deadline:      May 18th, 2012
Notification to Authors:  June 18th, 2012
Camera-ready:             July 13th, 2012
Workshop:                 September 8th, 2012

The final submission must include latex sources. We are going to use
Computing Research Repository (CoRR) for the workshop proceedings. At
least one author is required to participate in the workshop and
present the work.
