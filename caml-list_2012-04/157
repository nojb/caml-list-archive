THE TOPIC
---------

Intelligent computing covers a hybrid palette of methods and
techniques derived from classical artificial intelligence,
computational intelligence, multi-agent systems a.o. Distributed
computing studies systems that contain loosely-coupled components
running on different networked computers and that communicate and
coordinate their actions by message transfer. The emergent field of
intelligent distributed computing is expected to pose special
challenges of adaptation and fruitful combination of results of both
areas with a great impact on the development of new generation
intelligent distributed information systems. The aim of this symposium
is to bring together researchers involved in intelligent distributed
computing to allow cross-fertilization and synergy of ideas and to
enable advancement of researches in the field.

The symposium welcomes submissions of original papers concerning all
aspects of intelligent distributed computing ranging from concepts and
theoretical developments to advanced technologies and innovative
applications. Papers acceptance and publication will be judged based
on their relevance to the symposium theme, clarity of presentation,
originality and accuracy of results and proposed solutions.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

Intelligent Distributed Architecture
------------------------------------
Hybrid systems involving software agents and human actors
Intelligent integration of data and processes

Paper Publication
-----------------
All accepted papers will be included in the Symposium Proceedings,
which will be published by Springer as part of their series Studies in
Computational Intelligence. Papers should have at most 10 pages length
and must be formatted according to Springer format for multi-authored
works. Latex2e macro packages (preferred) can be also donwloaded from
here: http://www.springer.com/authors/book+authors?SGWID=0-154102-12-417900-0

Special Issue
-------------
As in previous editions of IDC, we plan to organize special issues in
well-known international Journals and invite selected and revised
papers presented at the conference in the organized special issues. A
special issue will be organized in the ISI-impacted CERA Journal
(http://cer.sagepub.com/).
