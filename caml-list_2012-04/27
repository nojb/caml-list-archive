                        CALL FOR PAPERS

                            GCM 2012
                  Fourth International Workshop on
                     Graph Computation Models
                Bremen, Germany, September 29th, 2012
                     http://gcm2012.imag.fr/


                         Part of ICGT2012
             http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/icgt2012/

      Full versions of best papers will be included in an issue of the
the international journal of the "Electronic Communications of the  EASST"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  Aims

The aim of the  International Workshop  GCM2012  is to bring  together
researchers interested  in all aspects  of computation models based on
graphs    and graph transformation    techniques.    It promotes   the
cross-fertilizing exchange of  ideas and experiences among researchers
and   students from   the different   communities   interested in  the
foundations, applications,   and implementations of  graph computation
models and related areas.

GCM2012 is a  one-day satellite event of   ICGT 2012, which  will take
place  in Bremen, Germany, from  24 to 29  of September 2012. Previous
editions of  GCM series  were  held in  Natal,  Brazil (GCM  2006), in
Leicester, UK (GCM 2008) and in Enschede, The Netherlands (GCM 2010).

                         Submissions and Publication

Authors are invited to submit either regular papers  (up to 15 pages),
or  position papers, system  descriptions, work  in progress, extended
abstracts (5-7 pages), via the EasyChair system, at URL

        https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=gcm2012

Submissions should be in  PDF format, using  Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) style.

Preliminary proceedings will be distributed at the workshop.  Selected
authors will be invited to submit a full version of their papers after
the workshop. These  submissions will pass through  a second  round of
reviewing and accepted contributions are to  be published as a special
issue of  the international journal  of the "Electronic Communications
of the EASST".
