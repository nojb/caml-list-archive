Subject: [Caml-list] Articles on using types for enhancing sw-quality?

Hello,

do you know of articles (or books?) that describe
the usage of types for enhancing software quality
by coding the software invariants as types?

(And if possible, for example enforce certain operations
 on such values, maybe also encoded as types?)

I remember an interesting talk from Yaron Minsky
on that topic.
But this rather was an explanation on
why OCaml and other strongly typed languages are
very useful to ensure software integrity by the 
type system. There were examples, but not completely
going too much into depth there.

I would like to explore this more thoroughly and look
for articles / books (or other videos), that explain
the design technique in more depth.

So, if you know of something regarding this topic,
please let me know.

Ciao,
   Oliver
