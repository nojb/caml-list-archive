Subject: [Caml-list] Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics, call for work-in-progress papers

       CICM 2012 - Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
         July 9-13, 2012 at Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany

          http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/cicm2012/
  
             Call for work-in-progress papers 
----------------------------------------------------------------

As computers and communications technology advance, greater
opportunities arise for intelligent mathematical computation. While
computer algebra, automated deduction, mathematical publishing and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we are now seeing increasing opportunities for synergy among these
areas. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics offers a
venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.

The conference will be organized by Serge Autexier and Michael
Kohlhase at Jacobs University in Bremen and consist of five tracks:

Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation (AISC)
  Co-Chairs: John A. Campbell, Jacques Carette
Calculemus
  Chair: Gabriel Dos Reis
Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)
  Chair: Petr Sojka
Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
  Chair: Makarius Wenzel
Systems and Projects
  Chair: Volker Sorge
  
The overall programme will be organized by the General Program Chair
Johan Jeuring.

Invited talks will be given by:

Yannis Haralambous, Département Informatique, Télécom Bretagne
Conor McBride, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, 
  University of Strathclyde
Cezar Ionescu, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research

----------------------------------------------------------------
                       Work in progress
----------------------------------------------------------------

Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for
submission as a full or system description paper. This includes work 
in progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we 
recommend 5 - 10 pages.

----------------------------------------------------------------
                       Important dates
----------------------------------------------------------------

Submission deadline:          6 May 2012
Notification of acceptance:  27 May 2012
Camera ready copies due:      3 June 2012
Conference:                9-13 July 2012
