----------------------------------------------------
 WING 2012 - 4th International Workshop on INvariant Generation
          http://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/wing2012/
                 June 30, 2012
    Manchester, UK (a satellite Workshop of IJCAR 2012)
----------------------------------------------------
         --- Call for Presentations ---

General
-------

The ability to automatically extract and synthesize auxiliary
properties of programs has had a profound effect on program analysis,
testing, and verification over the last several decades. A key
impediment for program verification is the overhead associated with
providing, debugging, and verifying auxiliary invariant
annotations. This workshop aims to bring together researchers from 
the diverse field of invariant generation to discuss recent developments. 

Scope
-----

We encourage ONE-PAGE ABSTRACT submissions on work in
progress, new ideas, tools under development, as well as 
work by PhD students, to be presented at WING 2012.

Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Program analysis and verification
* Inductive Assertion Generation
* Inductive Proofs for Reasoning about Loops
* Applications to Assertion Generation using the following tools:
 - Abstract Interpretation,
 - Static Analysis,
 - Model Checking,
 - Theorem Proving,
 - Theory Formation,
 - Algebraic Techniques
* Tools for inductive assertion generation and verification
* Alternative techniques for reasoning about loops

Submission
----------

Submissions need not be original. Extended versions of submissions
may have been published previously, or submitted concurrently with 
or after WING 2012 to another workshop, conference or a journal.

Submission is by email to:

Please submit a ONE-PAGE abstract in PDF.
