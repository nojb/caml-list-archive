Others have already pointed out that it wasn't necessarily the case.

If you call "gcc" from cygwin, you'll end up with cygwin binaries but
you can very simply cross-compile.

Cygwin provides a POSIX environment that can also run windows stuff
and does some translation between the two but if you cross-compile,
you can target whatever you want and that includes "pure" windows.

Also, note that msys, which is often used when cygwin isn't, is
similar to cygwin (and it's a "light" fork of cygwin), also requires
you to provide a specific library and changes the behaviour of the
application. However, you should absolutely never ever build anything
msys (msys is also a target for gcc, which has never been merged and
is from gcc 2.95 or 2.96).

With x-compilation, you can do what you want:
- need full POSIX? cygwin
- need some POSIX? msys (maybe)
- need some POSIX but not a lot? a library on top of win32, or move
away from posix directly

By the way, there was a netbsd-derived environment named Interix which
microsoft used to advise. Windows 8's documentation now advises users
of Interix to use cygwin or mingw(-w64).
