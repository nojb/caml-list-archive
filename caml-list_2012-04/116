Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] PEC ver. 1.1

Hello lists,

I'm please to announce release PEC version 1.1, a push-based event combinator library
which is helpful to write event driven systems with purely functional style.

 https://github.com/osiire/Pec

PEC is similar to React library but there are some different points.

- PEC's update cycle is separated from sending events.
  You can send a value to event during update cycle.

- PEC doesn't hold any pointer(including weak one) to event until the
  event will be subscribed.

- All PEC's signal are switchable. 'switch' means you can replace dependency
  of a signal keeping signals depends on the signal unchanged.

You can see sample codes to use PEC.

Regards,
 ogasawara
