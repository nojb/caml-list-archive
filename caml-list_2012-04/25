-- CALL FOR PAPERS - Deadline for submissions (2nd call): 30 April 2012--

IADIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE THEORY AND PRACTICE IN MODERN COMPUTING 2012
Lisbon, Portugal, 17 - 19 July 2012
(http://www.tpmc-conf.org/)
part of the IADIS Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems
(MCCSIS 2012)
Lisbon, Portugal, 17 - 23 July 2012
(http://www.mccsis.org)

* Keynote Speaker (confirmed):
Dr. Stephan Lukosch, Associate Professor, Delft University of
Technology, The Netherlands

* Conference background and goals
The IADIS international conference on "Theory and Practice in Modern
Computing" provides a forum for research and developments in the field
of computing foundations and technology. Modern computing comes not
only with efficient concepts and their application, but also it often
addresses networking and mobility topics. Hence, the view in TPMC
ranges from fundamentals like new or improved algorithms to very
recent and modern applications like ubiquitous scenarios or even
everyday computing. Complementary to these technically-oriented
contents, TPMC also shall serve as discussion platform about ethics
and social impact of those technologies. In its main focus, this
scientific conference aims to attract research reports on efficient
application and realization of simple algorithmic methods, new
architectures in design and data structures, new and improved
communication protocols, and synthesis of known computing concepts and
approaches.

* Format of the Conference
The conference will comprise of invited talks and oral presentations.
The proceedings of the conference will be published in the form of a
book and CD-ROM with ISBN, and will be available also in the IADIS
Digital Library (accessible on-line).
The conference proceedings will be submitted for indexing to INSPEC,
EI Compendex, Thomson ISI, ISTP and other indexing services.

* Best Papers
Selected authors of best papers will be invited to submit extended
versions of their papers to
selected journals (i.e. IADIS International Journal on Computer
Science and Information Systems (IJCSIS - ISSN: 1646-3692) including
journals from INDERSCIENCE Publishers.

* Types of submissions
Full papers, Short Papers, Reflection Papers, Posters/Demonstrations,
Tutorials, Panels and Doctoral Consortium.
All submissions are subject to a blind refereeing process.
