Subject: [Caml-list] Stdlib's hashtbl never sized down?

I just discovered that stdlib's hash table size is doubled when the
average list length reach some threshold, but are never sized down. So
if one uses a long lived hashtable which number of elements vary with
time the underlying array will only grow.  I suppose it's on purpose but
need help to find a reason for this.
