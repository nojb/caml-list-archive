                                   CP 2012
                   Eighteenth International Conference on
               Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming

                              October 8-12, 2012
                              Quebec City, Canada

                Deadline for abstract submission: April 19, 2012
                Deadline for Paper Submissions: April 23, 2012

--------
SCOPE
--------

The CP conference is the annual international conference on constraint
programming.  It is concerned with all aspects of computing with
constraints, including theory, algorithms, environments, languages,
models, systems, and applications such as decision making, resource
allocation, and agreement technologies.

CP 2012 includes a technical program, where presentations of research
papers as well as invited talks aim at describing the best
results and techniques in the state-of-the-art of constraint
programming.
One day of Workshops precedes the conference. Tutorials and the
Doctoral Program will form part of the main conference.
Papers are solicited from all disciplines concerned with constraints.

------------------
APPLICATION TRACK
------------------

Reports on successful applications of constraint technology are
particularly encouraged and are subject to special Applications track
acceptance criteria.

------------------------
MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRACK
------------------------

Beside the application track, this year, for the first time a track on
"Multidisciplinary papers: cross-cutting methodology and challenging
applications" welcomes papers that link CP technology with other techniques
like (this is not an exhaustive list) machine learning, data mining, game
theory,
simulation, knowledge compilation, visualization, control theory and
robotics.
In addition challenging application fields with a high social impact
are especially welcome: some examples (not an exhaustive list) are
CP for life sciences, CP for sustainability, CP for energy efficiency,
CP for the web, CP for social sciences, CP for finance, CP for verification.

------------------------
CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS
------------------------

The conference proceedings will be published by
Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.  Full
paper submissions are limited to 15 LNCS pages (+ references), while Short
paper
submissions are limited to 8 pages (+ references).  Short papers will be
reviewed to
the same standards of quality as full papers, but will naturally contain
less quantity of new material.  Short papers will have the same status as
long papers and be eligible for the best paper prize.

------------------------------------
POST-CONFERENCE JOURNAL PUBLICATION
------------------------------------

Selected papers submitted to the main conference and application track
which receive excellent reviews from the referees will be invited to submit
a revised paper for fast track review in the Constraints journal.
Selected papers submitted to the Multidisciplinary track, which receive
excellent
reviews from the referees, and which fit the scope of the Artificial
Intelligence journal, will be invited to submit a revised paper for fast
track
review in the AI journal.

Further information is provided on the conference webpage.
