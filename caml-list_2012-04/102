DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP

It has been understood since the late 1960s that tools and structures
arising in mathematical logic and proof theory can usefully be applied
to the design of high level programming languages, and to the
development of reasoning principles for such languages. Yet low level
languages, such as machine code, and the compilation of high level
languages into a low level ones have traditionally been seen as having
little or no essential connection to logic.

However, a fundamental discovery of this past decade has been that low
level languages are also governed by logical principles. From this key
observation has emerged an active and fascinating new research area at
the frontier of logic and computer science. The practically-motivated
design of logics reflecting the structure of low level languages (such
as heaps, registers and code pointers) and low level properties of
programs (such as resource usage) goes hand in hand with the some of
the most advanced contemporary researches in semantics and proof
theory, including classical realizability and forcing, double
orthogonality, parametricity, linear logic, game semantics,
uniformity, categorical semantics, explicit substitutions, abstract
machines, implicit complexity and sublinear programming.

The LOLA workshop, affiliated with LICS, will bring together
researchers interested in many aspects of the relationship between
logic and low level languages and programs. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

Typed assembly languages,
Certified assembly programming,
Certified and certifying compilation,
Proof-carrying code,
Program optimization,
Modal logic and realizability in machine code,
Realizability and double orthogonality in assembly code,
Parametricity, modules and existential types,
General references, Kripke models and recursive types,
Continuations and concurrency, 
Implicit complexity, sublinear programming and Turing machines,
Closures and explicit substitutions,
Linear logic and separation logic,
Game semantics, abstract machines and hardware synthesis,
Monoidal and premonoidal categories, traces and effects.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION: 

LOLA is an informal workshop aiming at a high degree of useful
interaction amongst the participants, welcoming proposals for talks on
work in progress, overviews of larger programmes, position
presentations and short tutorials as well as more traditional research
talks describing new results.

The programme committee will select the workshop presentations from
submitted proposals, which may take the form either of a short
abstract or of a longer (published or unpublished) paper describing
completed work.
