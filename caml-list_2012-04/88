Do we really need a new special tag?  Why not use Object_tag and 
represent slots as blocks of size 2 (constructor name + unique integer 
as the second field)?  This would have the following consequences (which 
are the expected ones):

  - The generic equality function compares the unique ids.

  - The generic hash function returns the unique id.

  - The generic unmarshaling function allocates a fresh id when 
umarshaling such a block.
