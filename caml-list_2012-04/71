Here's the issue: using the -I +... syntax while ocamlfind should be
used. Of course, that requires cryptokit to have been installed through
ocamlfind (which I believe yours has).

Nothing is wrong with it. As far as I remember, the "-I +..." syntax is
relative to the location of the compiler. On my godi install, I get:
  % ocamlc -where
  /opt/ocaml/lib/ocaml/std-lib

As you can see, "std-lib" <> "site-lib" (and same for "pkg-lib"). By the
way, if I'm not mistaken, on godi, std-lib is for the base ocaml,
pkg-lib is for what has been installed through godi and site-lib is for
user-installed packages (and godi has a cryptokit package ;-) ).

The right way to do it is to compile with ocamlfind which will always
know the right location.
  % ocamlfind query cryptokit
  /opt/ocaml/lib/ocaml/pkg-lib/cryptokit

  % ocamlfind ocamlopt -package cryptokit -c ...

Some more reasons to use ocamlfind are:
- -I +... is brittle and too annoying to change
- maybe cross-compilation (it's easy to set which compiler to use with
  environment variables)
- ocamlfind ocamlc -package lablgtk2,lablgtk2.glade,lablwebkit,cryptokit
  is definitely much more readable than the equivalent with -I +
- almost everything is using ocamlfind
- (linux) distributions add ocamlfind support anyway
- oasis uses
- it works, even on windows
- it nicely solves a nightmare

I wish all ocaml libraries installed with ocamlfind and I wish all ocaml
code compiled with ocamlfind.
