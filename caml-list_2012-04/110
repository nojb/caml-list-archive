I tried to debug this, but the result is strange. First, I tried to create
a reproduction case which is independent of findlib (i.e. using the same
topfind script, but loading a different module). I was not successful.
There must be something very special triggering the problem. I also read
the relevant parts of the Ocaml sources to get an idea - again, no result,
the search path is simply a global variable.

The only thing I found out: If you change the topfind script so that the
#directory directive is executed before loading the modules (i.e. move
this directive right to the beginning of the script), everything works
again. Somehow the load must be incomplete when the directory of the .cma
files is not in the search path (although we load by absolute path). Maybe
the behaviour has to do with bug
http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5551 .
