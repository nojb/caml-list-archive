mmm, ...

lablgl + lablgtk uses the gtkglarea library, if i am not wrong. Did you try
the gtkglarea examples for the same thing ? 

Also what openGL lib are you using, what X server, what OS, what graphic card
? All of this may have an impact on the openGL display. Also are you using
software rendreing or hardware ? try glxinfo to be sure.

Do you have an idea of what the C example you speak about do that is not done
by lablgl ? 

Or maybe it is just the garbage collector quicking in, and thus slowing the
display ?
