Hi,

I have the VC++ port of Ocaml3.1 and cygwin installed. When I try to 
make a custom toplevel with ocamlmktop including labltk the linker alwasy 
looks for Tk83.lib and Tcl83.lib in the directory c:\tcl\lib. But I have installed Tcl 
at another location. I tried to set TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY accordingly
but this didn't change anything. The only workaround is to place the libs where
the linker is looking for. The second problem I have with cygwin make is that
the ocaml tools are not able to find files when absolute paths are given.
For example ../dir works but /cygdrive/d/projects/dir does not. I also tried
"d:\projects\dir" but this didn't work either. I can place the *.cma or *.cmx files
in a directory that I can reach without specifying absolute paths but this is 
not the most elegant method.  

I would very much appreciate any help on this problems.

Kind regards

Rolf Wester
