I've been off the list for a bit, so I may have missed it, but I'm curious to
hear the status of the plan to translate the O'Reilly ocaml book into English.
Is anyone still working on this?

ps: I seem to be having some trouble searching the mailing list archives.  All
my searches come up empty, even if I just search for 'ocaml'.
