I notice that the CDK license is GPL, rather than LGPL. I've read the 
discussions of GPL vs LGPL, and I'm not unsympathetic to the Free 
Software cause, but (speaking for myself here) as a commercial OCaml user 
I won't be able to use the CDK for this reason. So, for instance, I'll end
up grabbing lablgtk and PCRE directly from the source where their authors
chose to release it under LGPL, rather than using the CDK.

Was this a conscientious choice on the part of the CDK developers? If so, 
then perhaps Caml Consortium members should think about creating a less 
encumbered "standard" library. It would be a pity to have to duplicate 
this effort.
