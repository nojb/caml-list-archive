I couldn't agree more !!  I would absolutely hate to be forced to
write my comments in some non-human-readable language such as HTML (or
any other instance of SGML/XML).  In my opinion, unobtrusiveness is a
lot more important than any fancy feature like <blink> or
<img src="http://cristal.inria.fr/~harley/ecdl7/pics/planar.gif">.
</blink>

You want titles and subtitles, font change for code, enumerations,
maybe some escape mechanism to write formulas in LaTeX, a way of
producing cross-references, and that's it.  Everything else is
overhead.
