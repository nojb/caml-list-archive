Subject: [Caml-list] cygwin port
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk

Trying the Cygwin port to Windows, when I build from sources and try a simple example:

$ cat - > hello.ml
let _ = print_endline "Hello"
$ ocamlc -o hello hello.ml
$ ./hello

I get the popup dialog box, "A required DLL file, C:\TMP\HELLO.EXE, was not found."

Another experiment:

$ cat - > hello.ml
let _ = Unix.write Unix.stdout "Hello\n" 0 6
$ ocamlc -o hello unix.cma hello.ml
gcc: wsock32.lib: No such file or directory

This even though I have copied wsock32.lib into /usr/local/lib (on my LIBRARY_PATH).  If I copy wsock32.lib into the current directory, it makes it past this message, only to give many undefined references, for example:

/tmp/ccNjkLkh.o(.data+0x370):camlprim0.c: undefined reference to `win_waitpid'

I see that win_waitpid is defined in otherlibs/win32unix, but since I built this from sources under cygwin, this library shouldn't be needed?

Any guidance appreciated.

Here's the output I got from my ./configure, just for grins:
