Yes, -use-prims is exactly what you need.  The format is one C
function name per line, in the exact order in which they appear in the
table cprim[] in byterun/prims.c.  

Even easier: building the runtime system in byterun produces the file
byterun/primitives, which happens to have exactly the right format.  Whopee!

Have fun with Epoc,
