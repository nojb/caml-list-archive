Ah, the problem for me is that I really do care about the actual value for 
the constants. It turns out that I may process binary file formats (GDSII
is the canonical example) where I want the name to correspond to a number. 
Of course, I can and do do it by hand (or use P4) by writing the equivalent of 
Ada's 'Pos and 'Val attributes for enumerated types. I would use plain old 
sum types too since I don't need them to be open for extension. It's a bit 
more cumbersome than I'd like it since I have to specify the mapping twice 
(constructor -> integer and integer -> constructor) which is cumbersome.
