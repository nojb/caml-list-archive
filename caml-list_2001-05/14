Looks good!

I realize that this is regression testing, which is important, but I
have used junit quite a lot with Java (increasingly wishing I was
using ocaml), and I think, in general, that junit-style testing is
more useful than regression testing.  So patrick, or someone else,
might want to look at www.junit.org.

Unless I missed someone announcing an ocunit...
