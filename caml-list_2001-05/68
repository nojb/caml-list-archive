I agree.  I posted recently about any experiences users have with SGML
documentation linked with Ocaml programs so this seems to be coming up at
a good time.  I would like to have a good framework in place for writing
the documentation for FORT and would prefer an SGML approach.

Good points again.  One advantage worth mentioning about sgml/xml
representation of the documentation is that transformations will be much
easier to implement than if the native output format is latex.
