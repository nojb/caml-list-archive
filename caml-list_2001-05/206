If you allow arbitrary (dynamically determined) values to be matched
against, then pattern matching has unbound cost. It might not even
terminate in the presence of circular values. OTOH, with the current
form, the cost of pattern matching is always linear in the syntactic
size of the match. I think it is good design to have potentially costly
operations explicit.

Moreover, such matching would most likely rely on structural equality.
Although this is not a technical problem since OCaml already has
structural equality, I would at least consider it questionable to
promote its (implicit!) use through such a feature.
