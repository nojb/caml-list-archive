I think that's the main point of disagreement. I'd like a source documentation
tool which will scale up to writing books (unlikely) or at least magazine
or journal article like things. I'd also prefer not to have a separate
tool and source of embedded comment information just for documenting
interfaces, like JavaDoc. Latex seems to be able to fill that role, there
is a wealth of experience using it, and now there is hevea, ocamlweb, and mldoc. 

I don't know enough about the state of SGML or XML tools to know how they
fare against my desires. I'm leaning to the Latex approach now.
