Err, Phrase and such are not types, but values, you could do somethign like :

type a = 
| Word of string
| Wordlist of a list
| Phrase of (unit ->a)
| Phraselist of a list

or more probably :

type word = string
type wordlist = string list
type phrase = unit -> wordlist
type phraselist = phrase list

and then :

type grammar_element =
| Word of word
| Wordlist of wordlist
| Phrase of phrase
| Phraselist of phraselist

or something such.

beware, non of this is tested, but you should be able to find somethign
working along those lines.

Hope this helps, ...
