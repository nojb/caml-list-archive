What about sgml, most project use that, and they can then transform it in many
different format afterward.

Also if windows people don't use latex (there is a tex suite for windows
available anyway), you just need to transform the latex files into something
they can use, like html, with one of the latex2html tools available (hevea for
example).

Releasing html documentation only is not a nice thing.
