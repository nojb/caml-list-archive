I read a paper on an SML extension to handle this named constant problem,
here at ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/papers/92-tr-aitken.ps
Anyone know why this or some similar approach hasn't caught on? The CamlP4 
approach isn't too bad, but this seems important enough to be in the core 
language. 

This is certainly on my "wish list" for future enhancements, since there
are so many cases where named constants are useful and the current
workarounds are a bit ugly.
