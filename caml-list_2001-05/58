Many thanks for your work!

I have just taken a look at the way documentation is handled. It would
be fine if there were some kind of standard way to prepare documentation
for OCaml-sources in general. It's otherwise a tremendous effort to
maintain various formats (and who likes writing documentation anyway? ;)

Is there any specific reason for inventing a new documentation tool? Why
not use e.g. Jean-Christophe Filliatre's ocamlweb?

How about the tool that INRIA uses? - Unfortunately, nobody has answered
may recent question on this here yet... :(

Best regards,
