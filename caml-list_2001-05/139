I fully agree with Benjamin and Damien. Some light annotations as opposed
to heavy markup would be ok, but at least for me it's really important
that I can also easily cross-reference to "real" documentation, which
currently only leaves Latex as viable alternative.

Difficult algorithmic stuff is better explained in separate documents,
and heavy-weight literate programming is too cumbersome for me if I want
to maintain code. For simple library interface documentation, something
as "light" as the current documentation style used in the OCaml standard
libraries would suffice for me.

There is also the psychological issue that if we allow advanced
annotations, people will really use them. This is not unlikely to produce
good looking but completely incomprehensible documentation, not even to
mention the difficulty of reading the source comments. It's the contents
that matters...

Regards,
Markus Mottl
