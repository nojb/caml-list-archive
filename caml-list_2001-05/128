Xavier, ...

Why do you feel the sgml or some XML based thing is not adequate. As i see it,
but i have never really used it myself, just seen how it is used, it seems
that it is much easier, when using sgml, or the XML variant of it, to generate
either html stuff, latex files, info pahes, and do on. Why limit yourself if
with a bit more effort you can generate files in all of the above formats ?
While, altough HTML is easy to write (well most people are already familiar
with it) there isn't much you can do with it once you have it. I know of only
one tool who generate latex from html, and it's not a free tool, ...

Juts my opinion, ...

Friendly,

Sven Luther
