Hi Dave,

I think we may have a different expectation for the terminology.  The
JUnit web page describes it is as a "regression testing framework".  Also,
my initial uses of FORT have been just for unit testing, so I think it
should grow to handle that area of testing well.

Not having used JUnit, there are probably several low-level primitives
that could be useful to add to FORT.

So, give it a try, and let me know what aspects of JUnit we need to try to
pull in!
