In the FAQ, I can read an estimation on how expensive different operations
in ocamlopt are.

I have some further questions:
1. If I define Array.iter + a function that uses it,
   will ocamlopt combine these two functions two one?
   (I looked in the assembler code, but it seemed as
    ocamlopt didn't combine them)
2. Do we need special Pentium-4 adaptions to utilize
   its very good float performance?
3. Would ocamlopt benefit from a peephole optimizer of
   the assembler code? Or is the assembler code already
   optimal?
4. What is unboxed and what isn't?
   I have noticed that there is a
   continuos work to unbox more.
5. How do you make sense of gprof-output? Any suggestions?
