Hello Luc,

Yes I installed the freetype2-dev and the freetype.h
was found, this was alright.

The problem was that the freetype.h needed to have a
defined variable that stated from which directory to
include the file that had the TTF_.. structure
defined.

In short, there where no such define so this include
file was not included at all.
I added it to the make file and then it worked.
I can send you a more detailed report of the error if
you like.

So know I have run the samples/examlple.ml program. I
am now trying to modifiy this example to do some
animation to finally get to see a ocaml program
synchronise its graphics output with the vertical
retrace.

Thank you for your feedback, 
 
/Peter
