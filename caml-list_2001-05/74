The same is true for me: the documentation of interfaces is the same
for users of some module and for developers. Only the latter usually
also want to see the documentation of the implementation. Being able
to generate both kinds of documentations without having to write extra
annotations would be a big help! That's why I am a bit reluctant about
cdk_doc, because it only addresses the library user's point of view.

Ocamlweb could probably (please correct me if I am wrong) be turned into
a general tool much more easily than the other approaches I have seen.

Any chance that it (or something similar) could ever get the status of
a standard tool (which cdk_doc seems to be targeting)?

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
