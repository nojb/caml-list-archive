After all these years, HTML still has no good support for navigating
with the keyboard, for full-document searches or for indices.
The best you can get is "look for the `next' button" or "reach for
the search engine" or "look around for the `index' page".

These are the three reasons why I find `info' much more usable.
Maybe `info' will be replaced in the long run, but I have the distinct
impression that this run is going to be mighty long.

Given the added functionality offered by Info (even though many people
dislike Info browsers and even though HTML also offers its own added
functionality) I think that Info (or better yet TeXinfo) output shouldn't
be left in the "would be nice" category.
