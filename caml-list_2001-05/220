On the same line of thought, the ocaml compiler is released under the
QPL, which is not compatible with the GPL.
This means that you cannot build a toplevel including any library
under the GPL, since it would be in contradiction with either of the
two licenses.
At the very least, it seems necessary to add a clause to the GPL,
saying that linking to QPLed libraries is allowed, just as RMS himself
suggested for KDE software.

Another remark is that lablgtk-1.2.0 contains a COPYING file, saying
that the library itself is LGPL, examples are more or less public
domain, and applications are _not_ open source. Claiming that all this
is GPL is clearly wrong. This COPYING is not there, and no README file
either, which is the only documentation for lablgtk :-)

(This is not a rant: I am the one who didn't check)
