Hello All and particularily the core Ocaml team,

C-- (see "http://www.cminusminus.org/") is an effort to define a low
level langage (sort of portable assembler) -better than C- to be used
as a common target for (functional languages) compilers. C-- offers
things that are missing in C (notably tail recursion) and useful to
compiler implementors. QickC-- (qc--) is an opensource compiler from
C-- to machine code. Currently it is not yet completed but aims to
target several usual architectures (eg x86, Alpha, etc...). Qc-- will
probably be useable (according to their web page) at end of year 2001.

Qc-- is written -as a literate program- in Ocaml and I believe it is
(or will become) a good example of real useful Ocaml code.

I believe that there have beeen a proof of concept port of Ocaml to
target C--. Is it really so? 

Supposing that QC-- will deliver it promises (but Norman Ramsey, Simon
Peyton Jones and Christian Lindig are impressively serious and clever
guys), will Ocaml switch to target C-- or will Ocaml continue to
natively target the usual architectures (x86, Alpha, Sparc, ia64,
x86-64...)?

What is the relation between C-- and Ocaml (apart a mutual respect of
the leading developers in each team)?

Regards
