As the (co)author of ocamlweb, I  think I should say something at that
point.

First, I agree that ocamlweb could be improved, and in particular that
its  HTML output  is  rather ugly.  But  the purposes  of cdk_doc  and
ocamlweb are clearly different:

 - cdk_doc is nice to produce  HTML documentations of libraries, to be
   browsed when developping. Personally, I find these pages quite nice
   and useful.

 - ocamlweb is a  literate programming tool; it means  that it is used
   to produce  a document describing  the all code i.e.  interface but
   also implementation,  explaining the algorithms,  giving complexity
   analysis, scientific references, etc.  This document is intended to
   be read  as an article (not to  be quickly browsed to  find out the
   name and/or spec of a function) and, for that purpose, it has to be
   *beautiful*, especially if it involves mathematical material. Knuth
   invented   TeX  to  support   literate  programming   (among  other
   applications   like   scientific   publishing),  because   literate
   programming *needs*  a complex typographic  tool. HTML is  not (and
   will probably never be) such a tool.

I hope  this will help  clarifying the difference between  cdk_doc and
ocamlweb.
