I tried the examples under the directory GL in the
lablgtk debian package, I think they use gtkglarea.

I am using
mesa/dri/Xfree4/linux/g400/hardwarerendering.

Open gl synchs with the vertical retrace in those C
tutorial examples 

http://nehe.gamedev.net/opengl.asp
(I tried the Texture mapping example)

The difference is that the C examples uses glx for the
window handling, 
I hope that the garbage collection does not affect the
synchronization.
I plan to try the ocamlsdl and see if it works with
that.
Otherwise I think Chris is right regarding this
extension for X, I don't remeber the exact name of it
but it exists a syncronization extension. I am looking
forward for new versions of lablgl that support this.

Another way to go would be to try ocamlsdl with
lablgl.
