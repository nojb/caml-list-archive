At this point, I'd suggest that we _really_ need to consult a lawyer who
is familiar with intellectual property law and the GPL. 

As far as libraries go, I think the LGPL is a fair compromise between the 
really dedicated RMS followers (once affectionately referred to as
"license ayatollahs" on this very list :) and those who are willing to
tolerate a variety of kinds of software, including proprietary. I
understand the reasons for going GPL instead of LGPL ("resistance is
futile, prepare to be assimilated, or don't use this code") but if it's 
going to be that way then I don't want my Consortium dues to fund work
on the CDK.

It's a tricky business, this license stuff, and a lot less fun than coding ;-).
