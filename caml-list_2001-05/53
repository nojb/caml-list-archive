Quoted from the web page:
>Written for students attending to the computer science optional cursus of 
>the MPSI/MP classes (classes pr=E9paratoires aux grandes =E9coles 
>d'ing=E9nieurs), this book mainly covers problems on automata, words (fini=
te 
>or infinite), formal languages theory, and some classical algorithms such 
>as bin packing. 

This sounds interesting! Could somebody please tell us, exactly which 
sixteen problems are covered in this book?

Thanks,
