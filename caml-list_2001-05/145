Hello Jacques,

  I've just downloaded the snapshot and I'll take a look. Some reflections
about the Glade stuff.

Yes!!! this is so true. The _main_ difference coding in LablGtk is that you
does not depend on the callbacks structure proposed by Glade (or callbacks in Glade are top functions and the event-driven nature cannot be abstracted) so you
has the choice to design the functional layout of your app. This not only is 
'more natural' style to Caml, but it adds a lot of extra power when dynamic
widget layout is needed and intra-function context callbacks tailoring. I agree Benjamin that Glade is a usefull tool for learning GTK to novices, but for a
skilled programmer 'Glade scheme' imposes programming style restrictions that doesn't pay the rapid visual widget placement. In my personal taste I prefer a
little pain packing the widgets by hand (1 or 2 lines per widget) and then
expand all the power of functional style in favour of expresiveness and elegant
app code, abstracted from the 'visual nature' of the interface.

Best regards
Arturo
