Thanks to S=E9bastien Carlier for his help during the installation
of CamlLight on MacOS X. You will find below a short how-to summing up
the steps involved.

1. Edit and modify the Makefile according to:

### Configuration section

# Which C compiler to use.
# Performance is often improved if you use gcc 2.x instead of cc.
CC=3Dcc

# Additional options to $(CC).
# If you are using gcc, add -fno-defer-pop.
# This option circumvents a gcc bug on some platforms (680x0, 80386).
OPTS=3D-fno-defer-pop -traditional-cpp

# Extra libraries that have to be linked with the runtime system.
# The math library "-lm" is linked by default.
# On most machines, nothing else is needed.
# Under Solaris: -lsocket -lnsl
LIBS=3D

# How to call the C preprocessor on a file that does not have the .c
extension.
# That's /lib/cpp on most machines, sometimes /usr/bin/cpp,
# and /usr/ccs/lib/cpp under Solaris.
# The -P option suppresses the generation of "# linenum" directives,
# which are not understood by Caml Light.
# The -Dunix option ensures that the symbol "unix" is defined --
# not all Unix C preprocessors define it.
# If your cpp is too fussy, make tools/clprepro and use this:
# CPP=3D../../src/tools/clprepro -Dunix
# CPP=3D/lib/cpp -P -Dunix
CPP=3D/usr/bin/cpp -P -Dunix

# The directory where public executables will be installed
BINDIR=3D/usr/local/bin

# The directory where the Caml Light standard library will be installed
LIBDIR=3D/usr/local/lib/caml-light

# The manual section where the manual pages will be installed
MANEXT=3D1

# The directory where the manual pages will be installed
MANDIR=3D/usr/local/man/man$(MANEXT)

# Some "make"s need this to ensure that they call the Bourne shell,
# not the C shell. Seems harmless on most other "make"s.
# Try removing this line if you run into trouble.
SHELL=3D/bin/sh

### End of configuration section





2. For the two files src/runtime/main.c and src/runtime/io.c, insert
as first line

#include <unistd.h>



It ought to work

Some explanations from S=E9bastien, far beyond my ken

1. The origin of the problem is the preprocessor C, not compatible
with the extensions of GCC used by the interpreter in CamlLight.

2. lseek needs a 64-bits offset in MacOS X when the paramater by
default is a 32-bits int.
hope this helps
