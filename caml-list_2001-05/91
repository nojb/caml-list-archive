The main problem with CDK documentation is that the CDK is not
intented to develop the libraries it contains. This development is
done by libraries'authors, while the CDK job is to gather these
libraries (by adding common Makefiles and configuration scripts, with
minimal modifications to the files, in particular the interfaces to
allow easy/fast updates). Thus, we cannot force the authors to use
ocamlweb, LaTeX or anything else, nor modify the documentation they
gave. We can of course advise them to use one particular tool, but we
have to be able to support other documentation formats. Since most mli
files have only simple text documentation, cdk_doc is enough for that.

The best approach would probably be to have several documentation tools, and
for each library, to specify in the Makefile the corresponding tool
(ocamlweb + hevea, cdk_doc, ...). However, we need then to be sure
that all these tools have some common output formats (man, html, info,
ps, ...)  and formatting conventions (title colors, etc)

I'm not sure that HeVea should be distributed in the
CDK. It is not really a development tool. However, OcamlWeb could
be in the CDK since it is used for literate programming.
