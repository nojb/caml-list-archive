ocamlweb intents to be a tool to document source code as Knuth's WEB
tool. In other words, it's more for internal code documentation than for
user manual and reference guide.

As far as I know (despite my @inria.fr email, I'm not part of the Caml
team), the tool used by the Caml team is specific and not ready for a
public release, i.e. some shortcomings are solved in ad-hoc manner. 

But I agree that a recommended documentation tool would be a plus. It
does not mean that such a tool should be very elaborated. The simpler,
the better. And I also think that such a tool should be close to
standard tool in other languages, mostly javadoc. It would help the
transition from other languages (and multi-language developments).

My 2 cents,
Best regards,
david
