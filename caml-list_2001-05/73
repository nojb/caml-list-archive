To compile ocaml sdl I needed to add 
-lSDL_ttf  to the CLIBS in OCamlSDL/src/Makefile.

Also  added -DHAVE_FREETYPE_FREETYPE_H to the CFLAGS
in OCamlSDL/makefile.toplevel

But I still don't sync with the vertical retrace.
I have a small test loop that do the following:

---------------------

...

let placement x y src dst =
  let h = surface_height src
  and w = surface_width src
  in
  let y_max = (surface_height dst) - h
  and x_max = (surface_width dst) - w
  in
let r_smiley = (Rect(x, 
		     y,
		     w,h))
and r_src = (surface_rect src)
    
in
surface_blit src r_src dst r_smiley;
update_rect dst r_smiley;;


(* The "main" loop *)
for i = 1 to 200 do       
(*      surface_blit icon r_src screen r_smiley;
   update_rect screen r_smiley;*)
  placement v.(0) 25 icon screen;
  v.(0) <- v.(0) +2;
  Sdltimer.delay 10; 
  Sdlvideo.flip screen;
done;

...
--------------------------

The Sdlvideo.flip should sync with vertical retrace if
sdl is initialized with SDL_DOUBLEBUF, SDL_HWSURFACE
and I also tried to add SDL_FULLSCREEN with the same
result.

According to the online documentation SDL_Flip will
wait for vertical retrace on hardware that supports
it. G400 supports it, at least glx manages to do it.

Thanks for any help,

Best Regards
Peter Rönnquist
