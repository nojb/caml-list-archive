Hi,

 I would like to use a C library which has a number of Pthread operations
used in it. What would be the limitations of the Caml system if I write a
wrapper around it's API ? These wrappers would be using the API provided
by  the C library. The C library threads interact among one another. Are
there any special concerns I should be aware of ?

 Specifically, I would be interested in knowing if I could run and
schedule two or more threads within the C system. 

Thanks,
Any help would be highly appreciated,
Ravi
