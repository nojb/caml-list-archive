I have looked into the examples that are provided with
lablgl and lablgtk and comparared it with the C
version of gears.c. You can notice a small disruption
in the animation gears.ml and planet.ml (when the
planet is closer and is displayed big on the screen).
This is due to that the swap buffer is done when the
monitors ray gun is in the middle of the graphics.

There are also some small and good tutorial examples
that uses C and glx that does not have this problem.
Here there is no disruption of the animation at all.
I can provide you with the link to this webpage when I
get access to the link.

It seems that it is up to the library that you use for
handling the window for opengl. Appearantly gtk and tk
does not do this syncronization.
glut, glx do this and I am almost sure that sdl do
that as well.
