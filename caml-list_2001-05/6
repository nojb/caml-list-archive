While working on a recent project with Brian Rogoff, it became clear to
both of us that a reusable framework for testing Ocaml code would be very
useful for the community.

An early development version of FORT (Framework for Ocaml Regression
Testing) has been made available for download at: 

  http://www.watson.org/~patrick/fort/

Check it out, and let me know what you think.  I would like to get
comments on the design of the system early and the features that are the
most important to include.  There is still a good bit of support structure
needed (documentation, better installation rules, etc) but it should be
usable at this stage.
