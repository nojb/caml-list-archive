	Actually, it would be nice to have man pages for each
Ocaml module. It is faster to say:

	man  ocaml-list

to check the order of arguments to List.fold_left (newbie, aren't I :-)
or the names (if using label mode) than fiddle around with a browser:
and doesn't need a mouse. 

	I have the C standard on paper and online.
but I often use 'man memcpy' when I forget the order
of arguments :-)
