Hello Jacques,
 It is not so clear to me that a Glade GUI builder is so easy to deal with
for beginners. My experience with Glade is that was very easy to pack
widgets and in a few minutes got a form. But dealing with callbacks is a very
different story. The first problem for a novice is to choose the apropriate
signal events (= dive into GTK & GDK docs for a long time) and fill them with
usefull code in order to get the app work right. I could use LablGtk rapidly
only because my prior background gained from working with GTK, but surely it 
was very painfull at the beginning (Gtk). Also Glade as it was designed to be
used with C (in spite its portable XML output) is much more low level than
LablGtk, and I don't know if this XML output is suited to build a high level
callback interface (it seems me not) 'a la par' of LablGtk. Also when you get
some skill with LablGtk is not a big issue designing pretty interfaces and it
don't take so much time and gain a lot of flexibility that is not available
cleanly with Glade callback 'static model'.
Best Regards
Arturo.
