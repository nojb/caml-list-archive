The CDK documentation tool has still many problems, but it is
currently the only tool which produces man pages for Ocaml modules and
functions. Moreover, LaTeX is not used by all Ocaml users (some are
using Windows and its wonderful editors). For now, I think the best
language is a specific language, for example, a subset of HTML.
This would have the benefit of being easily translatable to LaTex(ie PS),
HTML and MAN (I think HTML --> LaTeX is easier than LaTeX --> HTML,
even with HeVea). Note that the current language used by cdk_doc is
documented in the HTML documentation of the CDK (cdk_doc.html).

cdk_doc was not designed for being used by everybody, but to generate
immediatly some documentation for the CDK with a minimal effort. Now,
we have to think about how to change Sebastien's tool in a more
general documentation tool. But, we have the same problem with
cdk_config (and findlib). 

Another approach I used a few years ago was to generate HTML
documentation using the compiler, which can add cross-links between
modules (and even between types in the same module). This could be
another good idea ...
