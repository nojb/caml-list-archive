You mean that, because you don't like man pages, nobody like them ?

HTML is already supported, I have nothing against texinfo. But, do you
know a tool to generate it from all the mli files from the CDK (that
use different formatting conventions) ? Can you send me a patch to the
CDK to use it ? Are you sure it is installed on all computers that
will compile the CDK documentation ?

For LaTeX, we will not force people to use LaTeX to document their
interfaces: most comments are simple text lines including some pieces
of code (in cdk_doc, they simply have to be between brackets). Only
section titles have to be handled differently. cdk_doc is enough for
that. New output formats have to be added, and all interfaces have to
be completely translated to the input format ... We are not writting a
book, but only a reference manual, thus, we don't need SGML or
complicated formatting tool for that !
