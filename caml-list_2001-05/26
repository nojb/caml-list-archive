You usually have to do this through an extension.  It's a windowing system issue (or at least, that's how OpenGL thinks of it).  So, on windows there's a SwapInterval extension, and I'm not sure about X, but it's probably the same.

You'll need to write a thunk to the extension in C to use it, because lablgl does not support extensions yet.  I hope to fix this at some point soon.
