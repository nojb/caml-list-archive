LaTeX runs fine on MS-Windows.

(I don't know if this was meant as sarcastic.  Probably not, although
it doesn't match my experience with MS-Windows.  For me, there is only
one decent editor for MS-Windows; it's called emacs.)

Unless you are providing (or pointing to) a translator from HTML-->
LaTeX, this is an iffy argument.  Simple LaTeX, understandable by
HeVea, isn't very difficult to write even if you never feed it to
LaTeX and only produce HTML.  And as a bonus, you can get rather nice
output from LaTeX!

I haven't had a chance to look at this yet, but wanted to make the
point that there is an open-source formatting system that produces
good output (LaTeX), already available, and it would be good to use it.

It shouldn't be very difficult to have it spit out LaTeX for HeVea.

Sounds interesting, but why not generate LaTeX?
