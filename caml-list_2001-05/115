	I agree. But I think an important point is to start somewhere.
If I could see a specification -- even an inadequate one -- there
would be a starting point for discussion. I could try it out,
even write a tool, and report my findings, and so could you.

	Fabrice already has a tool and has used it. 
It seems like a good place to start as a proposal for a standard
 -- without assuming it is final. It would at least allow authors 
to clean up their interfaces so the existing CDK tools 
could produce a better synopsis of the interfaces 
(the existing description, for say, pcre, is quite unusable).

	The other good place to start is the internal INRIA
standard use to generate the library documentation.
[Or, are these the same?]
