The set of target formats is sufficiently large with this option, and
output looks reasonably nice. The power of texinfo is probably high enough
to cover around 99% of all uses. It's not clear that the remaining 1%
should actually be written as interface documentation anyway: seperately
written Latex-documentation might be the better choice then.

I think I could live with this option, but before I adopt it, I'd really
want to make sure that it has a chance of becoming "the" standard. I
already suffer enough when I have to write documentation once. Having to
do this even more often due to shifting standards would ruin my life... ;)

Any chance that we could jointly agree on this?

Best regards,
