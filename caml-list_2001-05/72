I guess the point is that I don't use record pattern matching much, and
where I do I don't want partial matches.  Or at least I have a cases
where enforcing full matching would catch more bugs.  For example, if
I'm writing marshalling code for the record by hand I want the type
system to tell me if I have forgotten to marshal a field.

You could argue that, but I wouldn't....
