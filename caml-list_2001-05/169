I've noticed that there is no notion of a named constant in ML.  I
sort of assumed that the compiler could determine that uses of a
variable after a declaration like

  let mpg_joint_stereo = 1

could be compiled as a constant provided the value was never altered
and no references to the variable were created.  Does the compiler
actually do this?  I can't see how it could do it for a variable that
wasn't module local.  I ask because it seems odd that camlp4 includes
a feature for creating real defined constants that are textually
substituted before compilation begins.  Would it be a better bet to
use a function like

  let is_joint_stereo head = (mpg_mode head) = 1

and hope the compiler inlines the function?
