Yes, this is a problem with the new "autolink" feature in OCaml 3.01:
you don't have to specify external C libraries, but their paths are
hard-wired in the binary distribution (in the .cma file, actually).

Another workaround is:

ocamlc -noautolink -I +labltk labltk.cma <your files> \
  -cclib -llabltk41 \my\path\to\tk83.lib \my\path\to\tcl83.lib

I believe this is a Cygwin problem.  The Win32 port of OCaml doesn't
do anything special with the file names given on the command line:
they are passed straight to the Win32 system calls.  Try invoking
OCaml from a Windows "command" shell and see if it works.

Cygwin does do all sorts of transformations over file names when a
Cygwin program (e.g. bash) launches a non-Cygwin program (e.g. ocamlc).
This is because Cygwin has its own view of the file system, with
Unix-like mount points and so on.  On some versions of Cygwin that
I've used, these file name conversions are quite strange, if not
downright buggy, e.g. the Win32 command does not receive the correct
Win32 equivalent of the file specified on the command line.
The only way I got it to work is to mount "C:\" on "/" and have all my
files on C:.  As usual with Cygwin, your mileage may vary...
