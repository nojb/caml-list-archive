=C2=A0That's what I'm doing for my local needs, approximately. =C2=A0First =
of
all, I have an infrastructure to build so called "packages". =C2=A0global
configure script (allows to choose installation prefix, library
paths), a lot of patches, platform-specific build scripts, some
dependency-stuff. =C2=A0Patches allow me to hardcode paths in some places
(ugly, but it works). =C2=A0I'm building it under platforms that are
interesting for me, for now it's only mingw/win32 and ubuntu, maybe
I'll build under freebsd later. =C2=A0I'm enjoying the pleasure of patching
everything: for example, I made ocamlnet (fastcgi part) working on
mingw. =C2=A0"Packages" are building and working both under mingw and
linux. (working as far as I have tested -- using "test" targets when
available, or using the library in my code). =C2=A0The selection of
packages is incomplete, but that's the packages I'm using and its
dependencies: camltemplate camlzip camomile cryptokit deriving extlib
findlib json-static lablgtk2 lwt menhir objsize ocaml-bitstring
ocaml-sqlite3 ocaml-ssl ocamlgraph ocamlnet omake ounit pa_do
pa_safeuse pcre-ocaml sexplib type-conv ulex xmlm. =C2=A0(there are no
batteries for now)

=C2=A0Then, some revisions of my project become binary. =C2=A0I'm making 4
zip-archives under windows: 1. base installation of mingw, msys,
tcl/tk, gtk+ in standard places (c:\mingw, etc), 2. archive that adds
unpacked .tar.gz with mingw C libraries, 3. archive that contains
compiled ocaml + findlib, 4. archive with other ocaml libraries. =C2=A0So,
installing fresh ocaml and libraries under fresh win32 is just
unpacking 4 zip-archives in c:\ , and adding something like "call
c:\ocaml\set-vars.bat" or ". c:/ocaml/set-vars.sh" in build script.

=C2=A0I don't distribute it mainly because of the following reasons. =C2=A0=
1.
License questions for binary builds. =C2=A0For my local needs I can do
whatever I want, until it doesn't leave my host and nobody sees it.
(so, guys, you haven't seen all what I've described before) =C2=A02. The
complexity of building the system from sources under windows: approx
17 files to download, some of them you install, others you unpack
(.tar.gz, .tar.bz2, not very comfortable for windows). =C2=A03. I don't
want to support cygwin (I'm even not installing it at all), and I
don't support msvc and win64 architectures (I don't need it for now).
=C2=A0Maybe the reason#1 can be solved by building ocaml compiler without
my local patches and reading licenses carefully.
