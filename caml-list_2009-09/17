Thanks for the explanation. 

I can think of two situations where such a clone detector may be useful;
for finding similar chunks of code so that they may be refactored for
software QA management and for detecting plaguarism in student programming
assignments.

I suspect that these two kinds of clone detectors would actually be
quite different.

Cheers,
Erik
