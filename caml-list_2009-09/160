		SUBMISSION DEADLINE: SEPTEMBER 21, 2009

The  advent  of multicore architectures  has profoundly  increased the 
importance of research  in parallel  computing. Modern  platforms  are 
becoming more complex and heterogenous and novel solutions  are needed
to account for their peculiarities.
Multicore  architectures will  differ in  significant ways  from their
multisocket  predecessors. For example,  the communication  to compute
bandwidth ratio is  likely to be higher, which  will positively impact
performance. More generally, multicore architectures introduce several
new  dimensions  of variability  in  both  performance guarantees  and
architectural  contracts,  such as  the  memory  model,  that may  not
stabilize for several generations of product.

Programs  written  in  functional  or  (constraint-)logic  programming
languages, or in other highly declarative languages  with a controlled  
use of side effects, can  greatly simplify parallel  programming. Such 
declarative programming  allows  for  a  deterministic semantics  even  
when  the underlying implementation might be highly non-deterministic.  
In addition to simplifying programming this can simplify debugging and
analyzing correctness.

DAMP 2010 is the  fifth in  a series of  one-day  workshops seeking to 
explore  ideas in  declarative  programming  language design that will 
greatly  simplify programming for  multicore  architectures, and  more 
generally  for tightly  coupled parallel  architectures.  The emphasis 
will  be  on (constraint-)logic and  functional  programming, but  any 
declarative programming language ideas that aim to raise the level of 
abstraction are welcome. DAMP seeks to gather together researchers in 
declarative approaches to parallel programming and to foster cross 
fertilization across different approaches.

Specific topics include, but are not limited to: 

 * investigation  of applications  of logic,  constraint logic, and 
   functional programing to multicore programing
 * run-time issues of exploitation of parallelism using declarative 
   programming approaches (e.g., garbage collection, scheduling)
 * architectural   impact  on  exploitation  of  parallelism   from 
   declarative languages
 * type systems and analysis for accurately detecting dependencies, 
   aliasing, side effects, and impure features
 * language level declarative constructs for expressing parallelism
 * declarative language  specification for  the description of data 
   placement and distribution
 * compilation   and   static analysis   techniques   to    support 
   exploitation  of  parallelism from declarative  languages (e.g., 
   granularity control)
 * practical  experiences  and  challenges  arising  from  parallel 
   declarative programming
 * technology for debugging parallel programs
 * design  and   implementation   of  domain-specific   declarative 
   languages for multicore programming


Submission:

  Submitted  papers  papers  should  not  exceed  10  pages  in ACM
  SIGPLAN conference format. Submission is electronic via:

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damp10

  Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital  Library and 
  in a physical  proceedings.  Papers must  adhere to  the  SIGPLAN 
  Republication Policy:

       http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm

  Concurrent submissions to other conferences,  workshops, journals, 
  or similar forums of  publication are  not allowed.  However, DAMP 
  is   intended to  be  a  venue for  discussion and  exploration of 
  works-in-progress, and so publication of a paper  at DAMP  2010 is 
  not intended to preclude later publication as appropriate.

  Additional information  about the submission process can be  found
  at the conference web site.
