F# is superficially similar to OCaml, most notably its OCaml-like syntax, but 
there are some quite major differences:

Good question. I saw these important advantages realized in F# by Microsoft 
and wanted to bring those benefits to the OCaml/Linux world. There is 
no "need" to do so unless you refuse to use Windows and I am happily using 
Windows now. Moreover, the libraries available under Linux are dire in 
comparison to .NET. Hence I am no longer really motivated to work on HLVM. F# 
is a lot more fun and a lot more profitable. :-)

No. F# is Microsoft's new programming language for .NET.

> or is it executing natively compiled code?

Yes. The F# compiler generates .NET assemblies containing CIL (Common 
Intermediate Language) that the CLR (Common Language Run-time) then JIT 
compiles the CIL to native code:

This is true of the interactive F# REPL as well as compiled binaries.

The timings I posted show JIT-compiled F# solving your problem orders of 
magnitude faster than native-code compiled with ocamlopt. OCaml's interpreted 
bytecode is even slower than its compiled native code, of course. I don't 
know how fast other native-code compiled languages like C, C++ and Fortran 
are in comparison except that some of my numerical F# code outperform's 
Intel's vendor-tuned Fortran running on Intel hardware.
