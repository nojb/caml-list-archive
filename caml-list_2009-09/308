Hi,

While I want to extend a hearty congratulations to the OC4MC team for  
an effort well done! I also want to point out some other approaches...

Here is a link to a paper about a "new" approach to SMP multicores as  
well as distributed heterogenous systems, being developed by MS  
Research and ETH Zurich... (seems an evolutionary approach from Mach  
microkernel)

http://www.barrelfish.org/barrelfish_sosp09.pdf

It is an orthogonal approach to that using shared concurrent memory  
that may well map better, not only for OS's, but also for applications  
written in OCaml.

Cheers,
