SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS                      SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

                         JFLA'2010 (http://jfla.inria.fr/2010/)

                Journées Francophones des Langages Applicatifs
                         Organised by INRIA

                         from 30 January  to 02 February 2010

JFLA'2010 is the twenty-first french speaking conference
on functional programming and proofs technics.

Theses new days will be

             from 30 January  to 02 February 2010.

It takes place on the coast, at

             Vieux-Port La Ciotat, near Marseille.

Centered on functional programming approach, the conference also deals
with complementary technics and tools which upgrade software quality
(proof assistant system, rewriting, tests, automatic proof, verification).

JFLA bring together developers and users in a pleasant
setting that ease communications; this conference has the
ambition to cover applicative languages domain that allows
construction of software systems that are safer. The teaching of
functional approach of software development (specification,
semantics, programming, compilation, certification) is a subject
of major concern for the JFLA.

That is why contributions to the following topics are especially
awaited (non exhaustive list) :

- Fonctionnal and applicative languages : semantic, compilation,
   optimisation, measures, tests, extensions by other programming paradigms

- Specification, prototyping, formal development of algorithms.

- Industrial use of functional and applicative languages.

- Proof assistants : implementation, new tactics, developments
   presenting technical or methodologic interest.

- Teaching aspects when used in functional approach of development

For JFLA we are looking for original research articles
that brings real novelties.

Articles submited to  JFLA will be reviewed by at least 2
persons if it is accepted and by one more reader if it is to be rejected.
Reviewers' remarks are always benevolent and most of the time
encouraging and constructive, even in case of refusal.
