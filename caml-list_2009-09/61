I would use batteries and would recommend it to my students if there
were any chance they would succeed installing it. In other words,
batteries is too hard to install. This may not be so on Linux, but
what about Windows (99% of my students use Windows only)?

By the way, my experience with students trying to install software (on
WindowS) was that:

a) Java is easy to install but is useless by itself
b) Java + Textpad editor is hard to install because Java must be
installed before Textpad
c) Java + Eclipse is hard to install because Eclipse is scary
d) Ocaml is very hard to install for a number of reasons
e) Python is easy to install (assuming the use IDLE for editing)

We switched to Pythong from Java a while ago. You can never
overestimate how important "trivialities" such as ease of installation
and natural-looking syntax (python's indentation) are to beginners.
