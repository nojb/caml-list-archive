Xavier,

Thanks for the comments.  I thought that float ref's were unboxed by  
default!  In fact, I find that breaking out the code into a stand- 
alone example which loops through matrix multiplies only indeed does  
not have any calls to "caml_modify"; everything is unboxed and stored  
on the stack (I'm on x86) as you say.  It must be the remainder of my  
application that is producing the calls to caml_modify (the profile I  
was using was embedded in a larger application with lots of inlining  
going on, so maybe something that calls caml_modify is getting inlined  
around the matrix multiply and confusing the profiler).

Thanks,
Will
