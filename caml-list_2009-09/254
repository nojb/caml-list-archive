Of course, the internals of json-static are much more likely to change than
its user interface.  This may however not be such a big problem here in practice.

The problem is more that it's not compatible with other possible extensions of
json-static provided by 3rd parties.

Oh yes, there's type-conv too.  I don't know the pros and cons of using either
type-conv or deriving.  If anyone knows, a brief comparison would be helpful.
