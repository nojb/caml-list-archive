Just to quantify this with a data point: the fastest (serial) version of my 
ray tracer benchmark is 10x slower with the new GC. However, this is 
anomalous with respect to complexity and the relative performance is much 
better for simpler renderings. For example, the new GC is only 1.7x slower 
with n=6 instead of n=9.
