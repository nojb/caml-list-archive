Thanks for the tip Jake. I arrived to a similar conclusion by doing
experiments on source files with comments but I did not pinpoint the
exact location in camlp4's sources. As you say, a solution that
injects comments would probably look very hacky. I decided to go for
Tiphaine's suggestion. After 45 minutes of hacking on the generator, I
had decent looking ocamldoc. Thanks Tiphaine!

Cheers,

Alexey
