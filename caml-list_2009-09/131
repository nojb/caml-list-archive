The OCaml packaging sprint is now complete.  It was quite a success!

In total, seven packages were worked on today as part of this effort:

- cairo-ocaml
- bitstring
- mlpost
- ocamlgsl
- Deriving
- coThreads
- Uuidm

Out of these seven packages, the packaging efforts are in several states.

New package available in GODI:
- ocamlgsl

Ready for GODI, pending upload:
- bitstring
- Uuidm

Almost ready, requiring a bit more testing/tweaking:
- Cairo-OCaml
- mlpost

In progress:
- Deriving
- coThreads

So ocamlgsl is out there now and installable in GODI, with the other
packages hopefully following in the next few days.

You can read more, and find some ideas for libraries to package if you
are interested, at the wiki page:

Thanks to everyone who was involved in the packaging effort today!
