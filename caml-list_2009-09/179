You were already paying the price of "one pointer more"
many times over and were not even thinking about it. One
more will not make any difference.

You have to realize that each node already carries a height,
two pointers to subtrees, and take into account the one-word
overhead for the block header. We're not doubling the size of
each tree node here, we're increasing it from 5 to 6 words.

Pascal
PS: You make up for the overhead by having dynamic structures
that are just the right size, and by taking advantage of sharing,
of course.
