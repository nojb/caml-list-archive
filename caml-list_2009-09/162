SCOPE:

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the areas of program manipulation, partial
evaluation, and program generation. PEPM focuses on techniques,
theories, tools, and applications of analysis and manipulation of =20
programs.

The 2010 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation in a continued effort to expand the
scope of PEPM significantly beyond the traditionally covered areas of
partial evaluation and specialization and include practical applications
of program transformations such as refactoring tools, and practical
implementation techniques such as rule-based transformation systems. In
addition, it covers manipulation and transformations of program and
system representations such as structural and semantic models that occur
in the context of model-driven development. In order to reach out to
practitioners, there is a separate category of tool demonstration =20
papers.

Topics of interest for PEPM'10 include, but are not limited to:

* Program and model manipulation techniques such as transformations
driven by rules, patterns, or analyses, partial evaluation,
specialization, program inversion, program composition, slicing,
symbolic execution, refactoring, aspect weaving, decompilation, and
obfuscation.

* Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
manipulation such as abstract interpretation, static analysis,
binding-time analysis, dynamic analysis, constraint solving, type
systems, automated testing and test case generation.

* Analysis and transformation for programs/models with advanced features
such as objects, generics, ownership types, aspects, reflection, XML
type systems, component frameworks, and middleware.

* Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
meta-programming, generative programming, deep embedded
domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and
inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program
generation and transformation.

* Application of the above techniques including experimental studies,
engineering needed for scalability, and benchmarking. Examples of
application domains include legacy program understanding and
transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user
programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and
infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications,
resource-limited computation, and security.

We especially encourage papers that break new ground including
descriptions of how program/model manipulation tools can be integrated
into realistic software development processes, descriptions of robust
tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, and new
areas of application such as rapidly evolving systems, distributed and
web-based programming including middleware manipulation, model-driven
development, and on-the-fly program adaptation driven by run-time or
statistical analysis.


PROCEEDINGS:

There will be formal proceedings published by ACM Press. In addition to
printed proceedings, accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital
Library. Selected papers may later on be invited for a journal special
issue dedicated to PEPM'10.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

Papers should be submitted electronically via the workshop web site.

Regular research papers must not exceed 10 pages in ACM Proceedings
style. Tool demonstration papers must not exceed 4 pages in ACM
Proceedings style, and authors will be expected to present a live
demonstration of the described tool at the workshop (tool papers should
include an additional appendix of up to 6 extra pages giving the
outline, screenshots, examples, etc. to indicate the content of the
proposed live demo at the workshop).

Authors using Latex to prepare their submissions should use the new
improved SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls, 9pt template).
