There is an example in
  http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild_example_with_C_stubs 

The key is to create a file with the extension ".clib" that contains
the list of .o files that should be compiled from your C
stubs. Ocamlbuild will then build these into a libary (foo.clib will
result in foo.a).  You then add rules in myocamlbuild.ml that define
tags for depending on and linking with that library, and add these to
your _tags file.
