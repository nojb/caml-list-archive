It is indeed not easy - fortunately, it's a once-only thing (for each DLL)

Not as far as I'm aware - no site I've ever seen gives a reasonable
explanation for why the "@nn" decorations are necessary (gcc or any other
compiler should be able to infer it from the header at link time, but
neither gcc nor the MS compilers provide a way to do this)

The irony is that the -k (--kill-at) removes the @nn from the symbols :o)

This shouldn't be trial and error - you can work out the numbers from the C
definitions (which presumably you know as you're writing stubs). For the
most part for 32-bit code, it'll be 4 x the number of parameters to the
function but in more exact terms it's the number of bytes occupied by the
parameters (so sizeof the *type* of each arg) which you can deduce from the
.h file. Alternatively, you can just put them all as @0 initially and use
the error messages - it'll always give you the correct one (provided that
your headers are correct)

Hope this reassures, even if it doesn't offer an easier way!

ever find a moron who wanted/needed to do this kind of thing!!
