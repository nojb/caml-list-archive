Yes, dynamic loading doesn't mix with whole-program analysis.  Although
I wonder if it's possible to have our cake and eat it too, with a fast
bytecode compiler and a slower native code compiler that does great
specialization.

I'm not as committed to abandoning OCaml as you seem, and have hope for
incremental improvement of OCaml's weaknesses, although I realize we'll
have to break a number of things to get to where we both (and likely
many others) want to be.
