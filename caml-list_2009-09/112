It turned out these errors were spurious - I nuked the machine and  
installed 10.6 clean, and it was fine. However, 3.11.1 seems to have a  
bug 3.11.0 doesn't, which I've reported here:

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4860

Also, the 3.11.1 intel .dmg from the OCaml website doesn't work, which  
I've reported here:

http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4861

Thanks to Andres and Markus for their help. It's taken 3 days in total  
to deal with all the ocaml and non-ocaml issues with Snow Leopard -  
time I got back to some work now :-) And next time a new OS X comes  
out, I'll buy a copy and put it on the shelf for a few months!

Cheers,

John
