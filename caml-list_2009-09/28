Hi,=0A=0A> It seems like batteries' adoption isn't quite as thorough as exp=
ected.=0A> We in the batteries devel team would love to know why you don't =
use=0A> batteries.=A0 Here's some of our guesses:=0A=0ABatteries is a great=
 project, and you guys shouldn't feel discouraged=0Aif it doesn't take over=
 the world overnight.  There's unfamiliarity and=0Ainertia to overcome, and=
 that takes time.  Personally, I've installed=0ABatteries and played with i=
t, but I'm not using it (yet) on my projects.=0AGoing back to your list, he=
re's why:=0A =0A> 2) It's not 1.0 yet, I'll try it then=0A=0AThat's indeed =
a factor.=0A=0A=0A> 3) It makes my executables too big=0A=0AThis used to be=
 a bigger problem.  Previous versions of Batteries would=0Apack everything =
into a module, disabling the linker's ability to link=0Aonly effectively us=
ed code.  Thankfully newer versions are going towards=0Aa flatter hierarchy=
.=0A=0A=0A> 4) It's too hard to install (dependencies, godi failures)=0A=0A=
Never ran into this problem.=0A=0A=0A> 5) It's difficult to compile against=
=0A=0ANot an issue.=0A=0A=0A> 6) It doesn't work on my platform=0A=0ANot an=
 issue.=0A=0A=0A> 7) It uses camlp4=0A=0ANot an issue for me.  There's this=
 thing called a "build system" that=0Ashould handle all that transparently,=
 so I couldn't care less if it=0Arequired carrier pigeons to compile my pro=
grams.  But yes, I admit=0Ait may be an issue for more constrained platform=
s.=0A=0A=0A> 8) Other (please explain)=0A=0Aa) Lack of exposure to the adva=
ntages of Batteries.  It borrows lots of=0A   cool ideas from Haskell, but =
that may not be immediately apparent.=0A   You guys should take advantage o=
f the Ocaml Planet to run a publicity=0A   campaign: you can make a number =
of tutorial posts showing the "old"=0A   way versus the Batteries way.  The=
re's more to Batteries than just=0A   a collection of APIs, and that messag=
e may not be getting through.=0A=0Ab) I'm already using Extlib extensively,=
 and that reduces the advantage=0A   for Batteries.  (Same way the Minitel =
slowed down Internet adoption=0A   in France in the mid-nineties?)=0A=0A=0A=
