I agree on most of your points. However, we are trying very hard to be
homogeneous. So if you feel that we're not homogeneous enough, it means
that we're failing somewhere. Do you have details?

Ok, that's a good point. The main focus is having a set of high-level
libraries. This can benefit both students and most developers (probably
not developers who intend to squeeze the last bit of performance from
the compiler, though).

Now, let's be clear: the primary audience is *developers*, but this does
not mean only OCaml hackers. This also means people from the Java/C#
world, for instance.

I hope this lifts part of the confusion.

Cheers,
 David
