Don't bank on it. We shipped a product called Presenta a few years ago that 
was written in OCaml and distributed as a native code executable for Linux. 
It was a complete disaster with 80% of users experiencing random segfaults 
and we canned the product and will never try to distribute compiled OCaml 
programs again.

Linux is basically a complete disaster in this regard because it offers so 
little binary compatibility between distros. Building upon a decent VM solves 
this problem and many others, of course, but Linux has none.
