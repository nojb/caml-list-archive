Good question. I have no idea, of course. :-)

Philippe, is it feasible to bring your patches up to date wrt OCaml?

Fair enough. I think this is the single most important development OCaml has 
seen since its inception so I would personally drop OCaml in favor of oc4mc 
even if it meant reverting to 3.10.2.

There is also the issue that this is x64 only...

Yes, that would be ideal. Pretty please, Xavier? ;-)
