 From the manual:

If the x-expression e evaluates to an x-sequence, the construction e/ 
will result in a new x-sequence obtained by taking in order all the 
children of the XML elements from the sequence e. For instance, the 
x-expression [<a>[ 1 2 3 ] 4 5 <b>[ 6 7 8 ] ]/ evaluates to the x-value 
[ 1 2 3 6 7 8 ].

If the x-expression e evaluates to an x-sequence, the construction e.(t) 
(where t is an x-type) will result in a new x-sequence obtained by 
filtering e to keep only the elements of type t. For instance, the 
x-expression [<a>[ 1 2 3 ] 4 5 <b>[ 6 7 8 ] ].(Int) evaluates to the 
x-value [ 4 5 ].

The error tells you that Latin1 is not a subtype of [ Latin1* ].
It probably means that you are trying to use a value of type Latin1 
where a value of type [ Latin1* ] is expected.

There was a GODI package that includes them. It would be ok to put these 
files in the distribution without compiling them (otherwise it would 
create a dependency on more OCaml packages). It's up to Stéphane Glondu, 
the new maintainer of OCamlDuce.
