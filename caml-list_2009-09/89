I don't think anyone's claiming it's not possible, just that no one
has actually done the work or offered to keep making up to date
releases.

It's a big project, but not big compared to other OCaml projects out
there, eg. Debian's OCaml project is far larger than is proposed for
an "Active OCaml" Windows installer.  For comparison, I reckon on
spending about one day a month maintaining the Fedora OCaml packages.

You just need to find some people who are technically competent on
OCaml on Windows, yet haven't ditched Windows for Linux for some
reason.
