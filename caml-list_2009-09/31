It's not part of the standard distribution.

Using it in an open source project adds a lot of dependencies. I  
understand that the Batteries team doesn't decide what gets included  
in OCaml. Still, many projects are very hesitant to add extra  
dependencies (even if batteries was entirely self-contained).

I imagine there are a fair number of people who take parts bits and  
pieces out of the batteries sources and use those in their projects.
