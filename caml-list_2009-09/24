 From the end user point of view, things that might help in usage are:
- package availability
- "For Dummy" Documentation + examples.

I hate to say that, but something like this:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strip-tags.php
Is "clear" for many discovering users.

With such a documentation, you are going to see many beginners
using it, have questions traffic about it, and slowly
go to the adoption of Batteries by "everyone".
