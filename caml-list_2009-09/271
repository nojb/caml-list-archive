Hi,=0A=0A> Very few programs that are not written with multicore in mind wo=

  I am working in a domain (doing backend web application=0Aprogramming usi=

, since you can get much better performance and design=0Asimplicity by runn=
ing multiple independent servers (one for each core).=0AEach server runs mu=
