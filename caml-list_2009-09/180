     Programming Languages meets Program Verification (PLPV) 2010

		  http://slang.soe.ucsc.edu/plpv10/

		      Tuesday, January 19, 2010
			    Madrid, Spain
		      Affiliated with POPL 2010


Overview: The goal of PLPV is to foster and stimulate research at the
intersection of programming languages and program verification. Work
in this area typically attempts to reduce the burden of program
verification by taking advantage of particular semantic and/or
structural properties of the programming language. One example is
dependently typed programming languages, which leverage a language's
type system to specify and check richer than usual specifications,
possibly with programmer-provided proof terms. Another example is
extended static checking systems like Spec#, which extends C# with
pre- and postconditions along with a static verifier for these
contracts.

We invite submissions on all aspects, both theoretical and practical,
of the integration of programming language and program verification
technology. To encourage cross-pollination between different
communities, we seek a broad the scope for PLPV.  In particular,
submissions may have diverse foundations for verification (type-based,
Hoare-logic-based, etc), target diverse kinds of programming languages
(functional, imperative, object-oriented, etc), and apply to diverse
kinds of program properties (data structure invariants, security
properties, temporal protocols, etc).

Submissions: Submissions should fall into one of the following three
categories:

   1. Regular research papers that describe new work on the above or
      related topics. Submissions in this category have an upper limit
      of 12 pages, but shorter submissions are also encouraged.

   2. Work-in-progress reports should describe new work that is
      ongoing and may not be fully completed or evaluated. Submissions
      in this category should be at most 6 pages in total length.

   3. Proposals for challenge problems which the author believes is
      are useful benchmarks or important domains for language-based
      program verification techniques.  Submissions in this category
      should be at most 6 pages in total length.

Submissions should be prepared with SIGPLAN two-column conference
format. Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN republication
policy. Concurrent submissions to other workshops, conferences,
journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.
Papers should be submitted through Easychair,
at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=plpv2010

Publication: Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and appear
in the ACM digital library.

Student Attendees: Students with accepted papers or posters are
encouraged to apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant that will help to cover
travel expenses to PLPV. Details on the PAC program and the
application can be found on the workshop web page. PAC also offers
support for companion travel.
