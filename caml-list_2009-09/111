For any who are interested:

There will be an informal GODI packaging sprint for OCaml libraries
this Wednesday, 9/9, with coordination taking place via IRC (#ocaml on
Freenode).  Some information (documentation, ideas for libraries to
package) is available here:

http://ocamlsprint.couch.it/ocamlfind_and_GODI_packaging

The site is a wiki, so please feel free to add links to packaging
documentation, ideas for libraries to package or other relevant
information.

Everyone is welcome!  The plan is to continue the packaging efforts
throughout the day.  If you are interested, please drop by for as long
or short a time as you like.

Many thanks to bluestorm for suggesting and initiating this effort!
