                *** Second Call for Papers ***

             The Fifth ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
          Types in Language Design and Implementation

              Madrid, Spain, January 23, 2010
                (Co-located with POPL 2010)

        http://research.microsoft.com/~akenn/tldi2010/

                Submission Deadline: 5 October 2009

The role of types and proofs in all aspects of language design, compiler co=
nstruction, and software development has expanded greatly in recent years. =
Type systems, type-based analyses and type-theoretic deductive systems have=
 been central to advances in compilation techniques for modern programming =
languages, verification of safety and security properties of programs, prog=
ram transformation and optimization, and many other areas. The ACM SIGPLAN =
Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation brings researchers =
together to share new ideas and results concerning all aspects of types and=
 programming, and is now an annual event. TLDI 2010 is the fifth workshop i=
n the series and will be co-located with POPL in Madrid, Spain in January 2=
010.

Submissions for TLDI 2010 are invited on all interactions of types with lan=
guage design, implementation, and programming methodology. This includes bo=
th practical applications and theoretical aspects. TLDI 2010 specifically e=
ncourages papers from a broad field of programming language and compiler re=
searchers, including those working on object-oriented, dynamically-typed or=
 late-bound languages, systems programming, mobile-code or security, as wel=
l as traditional fully-static type systems. Topics of interest include:

   * Typed intermediate languages and type-directed compilation
   * Type-based language support for safety and security
   * Types for interoperability
   * Type systems for system programming languages
   * Type-based program analysis, transformation, and optimization
   * Dependent types and type-based proof assistants
   * Types for security protocols, concurrency, and distributed computing
   * Type inference and type reconstruction
   * Type-based specifications of data structures and program invariants
   * Type-based memory management
   * Proof-carrying code and certifying compilation
   * Types and objects

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list; papers on novel utilizations of=
 type information are welcome. Authors concerned about the suitability of a=
 topic are encouraged to inquire via electronic mail to the program chair p=
rior to submission.

Submission Guidelines:

Authors should submit a full paper of no more than 12 pages (including bibl=
iography and appendices) by Monday 5th October, 2009. The submission deadli=
ne and length limitations are firm. Submissions that do not meet these guid=
elines will not be considered.=20

All submissions should be in standard ACM SIGPLAN conference format:
two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline. Detailed formatting g=
uidelines are available on the SIGPLAN Author Information page, along with =
a LaTeX class file and template.

Papers must be submitted electronically via the conference website in Adobe=
 Portable Document Format (PDF) and must be formatted for US Letter size (8=
.5"x11") paper. Authors for whom this is a hardship should contact the prog=
ram chair before the deadline.=20

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. Submissio=
ns should contain original research not published or submitted for publicat=
ion elsewhere.

Important Dates:

- Submission of papers: 5 October 2009 (Monday)
- Notification:         6 November 2009 (Friday)
- Final versions due:  15 November 2009 (Sunday)
- Workshop:            23 January 2010 (Saturday)
