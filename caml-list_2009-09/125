Not aware of any other bindings. I think I got daml to a stage similar to your 
Brook bindings where you could allocate a floating point array in the gpu and 
then maybe do something with that array. I can't really remember. It's been a 
while since I looked at it.

I would have expected CUDA to have a similar ability but haven't checked.
