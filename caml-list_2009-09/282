Visual Basic has been a *lot* faster than OCaml for several years now, not 
least because it makes efficient multicore programming easy. Even Python is 
beating OCaml on benchmarks now:

Even if that were not the case, the idea of cherry picking interpreted 
scripting languages to compete with because OCaml has fallen so far behind 
mainstream languages (let alone modern languages) is embarrassing. What's 
next, OCaml vs Bash for your high performance needs?

If you want to draw aspirations based upon popularity, look at the most 
popular languages: Java and C#. They are far more popular than OCaml for many 
reasons but parallel threads to make efficient multicore programming easy is 
a big one.
