Hi,



Zitat von "Philippe Wang" <philippe.wang.lists@gmail.com>:

I looked at bigloo before I came to OCaml.

I decided against it.
Not only because of schem's ((((())))()(()()))))))-terror ;-)
but also (main reason) because of this:


"Bigloo produces C files. C code uses the C stack,
  so some programs can?t be properly tail recursive.
  Nevertheless all simple tail recursions are compiled
  without stack consumption."


This was not really inspiring confidence.
Even if I did not really know much about that topic tailrec-topic,
it seemed to be a basic feature, and other scheme implementations did =20
not have such a limitation...
...then I had contact to Haskell and Ocaml and decided OCaml to be my =20
favourite.

I never looked at bigloo again, but that quote above is from the =20
bigloo-documentation that I just now downloaded to assure the point =20
has not changed during the last years.

oh,  I saw this too late;-)
