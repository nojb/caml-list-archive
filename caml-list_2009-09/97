You seem to have a pretty nice list of packages on windows^Wmingw. :)

Reason #1 could also be solved by publishing your patches and having
them merged upstream. ;-)

>From what you said, your patches won't be very clean and won't be
mergeable in their current state (hardcoding paths, I've been there
too) but they would at least show where the problems are and that's
maybe the biggest part of the work. Please share them if you can.
