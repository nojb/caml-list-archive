I take it to be a complaint against Batteries in particular
(helloworld.native is several Mb, when linked statically) and agains the
compiler in particular (in any given program, most of this is dead code
which the compiler fails to remove).

Xavier Leroy is aware of the issue. Maybe either he or Xavier Clerc will
be able to look at it someday.

Cheers,
 David
