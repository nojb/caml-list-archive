Is this a complaint against Batteries in particular or OCaml in
general?  OCaml binaries in general are rather large, and it appears
to be because the runtime / GC is statically linked.  Do you know how
much this would improve with dynamic linking of libasmrun.a (which
IIRC was a feature added in 3.11)?
