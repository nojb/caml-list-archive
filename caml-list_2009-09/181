Hello,


the program Scilab, a Matlab-clone,
written by INRIA, is written in C,
and since version 5.0 is using Java-Stuff for Plotting,
and this stuff is used in a way that it does not really
support Linux...


...why is that program not written with INRIA's
Ocaml?


Maybe rewriting it would make sense,
because Scilab seems not to be very stable.

...and from INRIA's view I would think: they have developed
OCaml, but do not use it for their own developments....
... strange, isn't it?

Ciao,
    Oliver
