I try it and even try it to work a new version on my own. The problem is
that automake is deeply tight with C compilation. Supporting other
languages that do not compile the same way as C (.c -> .o -> .exe / no
header compilation) is a nightmare and really difficult to maintain
overtime inside automake...

Take a look at ocaml-autoconf for configure time and ocamlbuild for link
time.
http://ocaml-autoconf.forge.ocamlcore.org

If it is a pure OCaml project, you can try to use ocaml-autobuild (but
it dev. status, you will need to fecth the darcs repo):
