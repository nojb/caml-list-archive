With OCaml you can distribute native code programs, so the installation
problem is relevant only to programmers.

As only a very small portion of these "computers in the world" are used as
programming work-stations, we can't conclude much from this measure.
We'd rather have to know what share of computers used by programmers to write
software does not come with a decent package system. I guess this would be much
less impressive.

Also, OCaml is not the only system that's harder to install on windows
than on Unix : Haskell's Cabal have difficulties on windows also, for instance.
I bet something like ActivePython came _after_ python was already popular and
had many libraries that were easy to install on Linux only, and not the other
way around.

In other words, you would like to be read but not answered ?
