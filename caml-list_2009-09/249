JoCaml is all about concurrency: minimizing latency. Oc4mc is all about 
parallelism: maximizing throughput.

Until now, OCaml sucked at parallelism. You can sometimes obtain some 
parallelism by forking threads but it is asymptotically slower than using 
shared memory. Consequently, oc4mc is a hugely-important development in the 
OCaml world because it means that OCaml programmers can write OCaml programs 
that use multicore machines efficiently for the first time.

The next steps are to get oc4mc into the apt repositories and build some 
libraries that make parallelism easier (like Microsoft's Task Parallel 
Library).
