Unfortunately, many people do that.

The problem with this approach (from a FOSS point of view) is with
external contributors (who can fix bugs or develop features). A (big)
project using non-standard libraries for things that do have a standard
(imagine zlib and pcre in C) will attract less external contributors (it
would deter me from contributing and therefore using, at least).

Of course, things are easier with OCaml than with C, as you can "learn"
or discover the usage of a library being guided just by the compiler
error messages, but it become painful at some point.

I appreciate the Batteries initiative which IIUC aims at providing
standards (but I don't use it myself... yet). But I'd like to comment on:=

I wouldn't say this is a problem of Batteries, but a problem of OCaml's
lack of proper shared libraries.
