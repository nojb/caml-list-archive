You're quoting statistics that cover secretaries, housewives and teenage 
gamers and trying to apply them to OCaml programmers. Windows' market share 
among technical users and programmers is significantly smaller and among 
OCaml programmers is smaller still.

For example, if you look at sales of technical software like ours or 
Mathematica, Windows has only ~60% market share.
