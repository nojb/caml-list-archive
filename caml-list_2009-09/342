We don't have fully separate compilation anyway (in native mode). The
compiler can already dump an intermediate representation of functions
into .cmx files, and can use that for cross-module inlining. This
feature is optional for the user. Of course, it increases the number of
modules that need to be recompiled when something is changed.

If we keep that spirit of giving the user a choice: Of course the "Ocaml
world" would appreciate when the actual code generation can be delayed
in order to gain performance improvements by whole-program analysis.
However, for projects with several 100KLOC the compile time could be
drastically increased, and I don't think users with such large programs
would actually use that feature.
