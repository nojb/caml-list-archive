   The problem with Cristian's solution is that you don't automatically
   get told what positions in what file had the mismatch, like you do if
   you simply leave out the wildcard match.  If there were a convenient
   way to get that automatic error tracking, I'd rather do as Cristian
   suggests because it makes it more explicit

In these cases I just use:

 	  function
 	  A -> ...
 	| B -> ...
 	| _ -> failwith "Useful message 498249"
                                        ^^^^^^-- a random string.

Or am I misunderstanding what you want?

Pierpaolo.
