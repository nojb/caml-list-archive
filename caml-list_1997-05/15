hi,

I was reading an article about language implementation in Standard ML
(slightly annoying name isn't it?) which described a
continuation-passing interpreter.  It seems that in sml, continuations
are simply unit -> unit functions.  So it seems that any language with
higher-order functions is capable of passing continuations.  This is
not the impression I get from the Scheme camp, who seem to think that
continuations are a special form that only a few almighty languages
support.  Anyone know the full story?
