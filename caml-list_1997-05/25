The ocamlopt native-code compiler is already available for Win32. You
need MASM and MSVC++ to use it, though. But you're correct that there
is no interface for the Win32 API.

We don't have the manpower to invest in a full Win32 port. The
majority of our serious users works under Unix, anyway. If you feel
like doing the Win32 port, we'll support your efforts, of course.
