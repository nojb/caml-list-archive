Hi,

I agree with this, but more generally we need a syntactic sugar to copy a
record and change some fields like

{ r with a = e; b = f; ... }

Or anything like that ! 
(this would give record copy by removing the with part)

When you use a record with many fields it makes the program much longer (and
less readable) when you often need to change one or two field in a record.
