hi,

I think it would be nice if more programmers used ocaml, and if more
companies could view the language as a serious vehicle for application
development.  Given those goals, it seems that one step in the right
direction would involve porting ocamlopt to Intel Win32 and binding
the frightful but popular Windows API to it, thus allowing people to
produce Windows binaries without leaving the comforts of ocaml.  Have
any steps been taken in this direction?  Does anyone else think this
is a goal worth pursuing?


Lyn
