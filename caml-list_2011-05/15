You could also try

	-cclib -l:libsqlite3.a

According to ld docs, the colon prevents the automatic name translation
that results in preferring libsqlite3.so.

However, I don't think this will be successful. The
ocamlfind/ocamlopt/gcc/ld chain will generate a normal -lsqlite3
nevertheless, and so far I've tried it, this takes precedence. What you
can try is to copy libsqlite3.a to a private directory p, and use -ccopt
-Lp to add it to the library search path.

Also note that static linking is more sensitive to the order of the
linked libraries. As more or less everybody is using dynamic linking,
these problem often remain unnoticed.
