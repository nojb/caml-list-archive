How clean do you want this to be? Lets go with easy and dirty.

First thing is that if you have different 'a poll_items then you need to
include a callback that accepts a matching 'a Socket.t. E.g.:

type 'a poll_item = ('a Socket.t * event_mask * ('a Socket.t -> event_mask -> unit))

Then you can make an unit poll_item array and use

let set i (item : 'a poll_item) =
    array.[i] <- Obj.magic item

let call i =
    let (sock, mask, fn) = array.[i]
    in
    fn sock mask

The important part here is that you ensure the 'a Socket.t is only
accessed through the callback. Only that will have the right type.


If you want to make it clean then you need a 2 layer approach with 2
records and 'a. 'a -> 'b style types. I can't remember how to do this
from memory but search the list archive for something like universal
container. I've asked the same a few years back.
