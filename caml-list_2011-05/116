Hello all,

Sorry for the very late reply on this thread. 

In gmane.comp.lang.caml.inria, you wrote:

Unfortunately teaching (as in "being able to make other people
understand") and coding are two different things. I won't say that
I am a good teacher. I tend to go too fast in details, which is not a
good thing. The documentation already written reflect my style. As
you can see, I am far from being a perfect teacher ;-)

I will be glad to accept help from people that know how to teach,
hopefully this will even contribute to improve my own style.

Well, there is a preliminary work document here:
https://forge.ocamlcore.org/docman/view.php/54/123/Technical+specification.pdf

It gives detail on the infrastructure. But it is evolving as I code
oasis-db. Once the system will reach a stable status, I will publish a
more in-depth description of it.

The point 2) will be solved by providing an oasis-bundle-XXX.tar.gz that
will contain oasis and its dependencies to be compiled in an easy way.

But to create the bundle, I use oasis-db... (see the bundle section in
the technical specification). I am working on this "bundle" subcommand
since yesterday.

At least, there is a good point ;-)

Creating binary installers is not a big deal once you know how to do
them. I am still a strong believer in binary distribution (i.e. Debian,
Fedora or binary installers). It tends to ease the adoption of a
program, especially by beginners who won't spend 30 minutes compiling
something.

For small programs and libraries, it should be easy to use source code
distribution. But people should be allowed to have binary counterpart
for some packages, especially for executables only (i.e. oasis, unison,
mldonkey). This kind of executables target people that are most of the
time 100% beginners in OCaml.

Cheers,
Sylvain Le Gall
