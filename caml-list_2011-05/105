Subject: [Caml-list] CFP: SSV 2011 - Workshop on Systems Software Verification [deadline extended]

[The deadline for abstract submissions has just been extended to
 May 29th. My apologies if you receive multiple copies of this
 CfP -- Hendrik Tews]

=============================================================================
                  6th International Workshop on
             Systems Software Verification (SSV 2011)
           Real Software, Real Problems, Real Solutions

           August 26-27 2011, Nijmegen, The Netherlands

              https://es.fbk.eu/events/ssv2011

Industrial-strength software analysis and verification has advanced in
recent years through the introduction of model checking, automated and
interactive theorem proving, and static analysis techniques as well as
correctness by design, correctness by contract, and model-driven
development. However, many techniques are working under restrictive
assumptions which are invalidated by complex (embedded) system
software such as operating system kernels, low-level device drivers or
microcontroller code.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and
developers from both academia and industry, who are facing real
software and real problems to find real, applicable solutions. By
"real" we mean problems such as time-to-market or reliability that the
industry is facing and is trying to fix in software that is deployed
in the market place. A real solution is one that is applicable to the
problem in industry and not one that only applies to an abstract,
academic toy version of it. This forum will discuss software
analysis/development techniques and tools; it will also serve as a
platform to discuss open problems and future challenges in dealing
with existing and upcoming systems level code.

Topics include (but are not limited to):

    * model checking
    * automated and interactive theorem proving
    * static analysis
    * model-driven development
    * embedded systems development
    * automated testing
    * programming languages
    * verifying compilers
    * software certification
    * software tools
    * experience reports

Submissions must be made electronically through the EasyChair
system [1] until May 29 2011, 23:59h Samoan time. Papers should
be up to 15 pages in pdf format and formatted in LNCS style [2].
Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix,
which will be read at the discretion of the program committee.
All will be subject to peer review under normal conference
standards. Experience reports and papers on work in progress are
welcome as long as there is a clear contribution. Submissions
which are based or discuss a non-trivial piece of software are
required to make all those non-standard software parts available,
which a referee may need, in order to check the claims of the
submission.

Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal
or conference with published proceedings and must not be
concurrently submitted to any other peer-reviewed workshop,
symposium, conference or archival journal. Any partial overlap
with any such published or concurrently submitted paper must be
clearly indicated.

The workshop proceedings are planned to be published in the form
of post-proceedings in the Springer series Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS).

Important dates
May  29 2011			Abstract Registration Deadline
June 03 2011			Paper submission deadline
June 30 2011			Notification of accepted papers
