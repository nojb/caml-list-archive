                                - SSS 2011 -

                       13th International Symposium on
         Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems

                           October 10-12, 2011
                            Grenoble, France
                (Previously in Shinagawa (Tokyo), Japan)

                      http://www.jaist.ac.jp/sss2011/


******************************************************************************
We are very saddened by the terrible tragedy that affects Japan and its people.
On behalf of our community, we express our support for the Japanese people,
especially to our colleagues and friends.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Symposium is a prestigious international forum for researchers and
practitioners in the design and development of fault-tolerant distributed
systems with self-* properties, such as self-stabilizing, self-configuring,
self-organizing, self-managing, self-repairing, self-healing, self-optimizing,
self-adaptive, and self-protecting.  Research in distributed systems is now
at a crucial point in its evolution, marked by the importance of dynamic
systems such as peer-to-peer networks, large-scale wireless sensor networks,
mobile ad hoc networks, robotic networks, etc. Moreover, new applications such
as grid and web services, banking and e-commerce, e-health and robotics,
aerospace and avionics, automotive, industrial process control, etc. have
joined the traditional applications of distributed systems.

The conference provides a wide spectrum of topics, covered in the following
tracks:
* Ad-Hoc, Sensor, and Dynamic Networks
* Fault-Tolerance and Dependable Systems
* Overlay and Peer-to-Peer Networks
* Safety and Verification
* Security
* Self-Organizing and Autonomic Networks
* Self-Stabilization

IMPORTANT DATES
* Abstract Submission: May 20, 2011 ***EXTENDED***
* Paper Submission: May 25, 2011 ***EXTENDED***
* Notification: July 8, 2011
* Camera Ready Submission: July 15, 2011


PAPER SUBMISSION
Papers must be submitted in PDF format and be prepared using the LNCS style.
Detailed instructions for submitting papers will be available later.
Two types of papers can be submitted: Regular Papers and Brief Announcements.
Submissions for regular papers should be no longer than 15 pages
(including the title, authors, abstract, figures, and references) in LNCS
style; a submission may have an appendix of at most two pages beyond the
15 page limit. Brief announcements are restricted to two pages using the
LNCS style, with no appendix. Submissions deviating from these guidelines
will be rejected without consideration of their merits.
If requested by the authors on the submission system, a regular submission
that is not selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for
a brief announcement.  Such a request will not affect consideration of the
paper for a regular paper.
A paper submitted at this forum is expected to be original research not
previously published. A contribution can be submitted to one track only and
may not be concurrently submitted to another conference, workshop, or journal.

PUBLICATION
The proceedings of the conference will be published in the
Springer Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

BEST PAPER AND BEST STUDENT AWARDS
The program committee will select two papers for best paper and best
student paper awards. A paper is eligible for the best student paper
award if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at the time of
submission. This must be indicated by marking an appropriate box in
the submission system.
