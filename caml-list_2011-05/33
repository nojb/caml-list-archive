The statement is that a source-based distribution can adapt quickly to a
changing environment. What's the problem with this? We are aware of this
problem since yesterday, and we do something the day later.

I do not make any statement (if you read carefully) whether GODI or
Debian is better. Such comparisons are stupid.

Well, Ubuntu is another case, as we all know that Ubuntu does not care
about the quality of their ocaml packages.

Debian is in the lucky situation that they provide both the environment
for ocaml and ocaml. So yes, they can fix the problems they created in
their own environment :-) - Ubuntu is already a different story, they
provide binary packages without any QA process.

The worst case is when you have a binary distribution of ocaml for an OS
you do not control. Sometimes the only possible fix is then to check at
runtime (!) whether you are in a problematic environment or not. Ask
Windows users how this feels.

I hope you get my point. "Binary" does not necessarily mean "as good as
Debian".

Well, nobody told us. I don't see this as a real problem, though,
because we get problem reports when the first user runs into the
problem, and then we can fix it asap. We fortunately don't have to
synchronize with a given release timeline.

Manpower is certainly an issue (for all ocaml distros). I'm currently
working on a plan how to improve this for GODI. Don't know whether it
works, though.

Regarding Ubuntu, maybe we should ask them to remove their ocaml
packages from their distribution as long as they do not do QA.
