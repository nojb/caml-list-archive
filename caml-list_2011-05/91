All I want to do (and must do) is call "poll" on the poll item set. 

There are no callbacks since I'm checking to see what socket has data and then issuing a "receive data" call on that socket. 

> Joel must have an use case in mind which is actually type-safe; maybe it's only the callback as you demonstrated (I fail to see its usefulness, but I don't know anything about ZeroMQ), maybe it's something a bit more complicated. But we won't be able to give him a satisfying solution unless he describes more precisely what this type-safe use is.

My type safe use is exactly what Unix select does, i.e. determine what socket has data available. 

> Joel, may you be more explicit as to what you want to do with those "poll_item" array. More precisely, how do you plan to *use* the data in the array?

I need to check the mask for each item in the returned array to see what socket has data. Then I need to read data from the socket. 

I suspect I'll need to change how the socket is typed to convert to a variant of socket types which can be stored easily into a poll set. I really don't know why Socket is typed as it is, maybe Pedro (the creator of ocaml-zmq) can explain.

	Thanks, Joel
