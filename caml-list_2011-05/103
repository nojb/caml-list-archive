Subject: [Caml-list] 1st CFP: LoCoCo 2010 (Logics for Component Configuration)

                           LoCoCo 2011
   Second International Workshop on Logics for Component Configuration
       Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2011) 
                 Perugia, Italy, September 12, 2011
                   http://lococo.irill.org/2011
                      First Call for Papers
                   
                                 
Scope:
======

Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic of
great importance for many application domains. For example, modern
software distributions are based on the notion of components, which
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components
provide the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software
distribution, but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting
components from a large repository of possible choices, and
configuring these components according to user needs, resource
constraints, and interdependencies with other components.  Some
well-known examples of complex systems of components in the world of
Free and Open Source software are the different distributions for
GNU/Linux, BSD, or Eclipse plugins.

Understanding and solving these questions is an attractive research
topic since, on the one hand, the problems to be solved are complex
and interesting for researchers working on solving techniques. On the
other hand, research in this area has the potential of high impact on
the way how the systems that we all use every day are developed,
deployed, and maintained.

Not only adequate logical formalisms to represent a configuration
problem are required, but also sophisticated reasoning technologies to
deal with large amounts of data. Further relevant aspects include
diagnosis of failed configuration settings and an intelligent behavior
dealing with user preferences.

This workshop will focus on logic-based methods for specifying and
solving complex configuration problems.  The goal of the workshop is
to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the
area of component configuration of systems, using different modeling
and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programming,
description logics, satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop
will be an opportunity to discuss common and complementary solutions
for solving component configuration.

Topics:
=======
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
o Configuration problems and models: knowledge representation and
  acquisition, incomplete knowledge, inconsistent knowledge, etc.
o Reasoning methods for solving configuration problems: constraint
  satisfaction and optimization, constraint programming, answer set
  programming, SAT solving and extensions, integer programming, local
  search, symmetry breaking, etc.
o Interactivity: user preferences, machine learning, distributed
  environments, etc.
o Applications and tools: case studies, current challenges,
  application reports, etc.

Invited Talk
============
An invited talk will be given by Daniel Le Berre (University Artois)

MISC 2011
=========
The second Mancoosi International Solver Competition will be held in
conjunction with the LoCoCo workshop, see http://www.mancoosi.org/misc.

Important Dates
===============
Monday, June 20       Submission deadline
Monday, July 25       Notification about acceptance/rejection
Wednesday, August 10  Final paper due
Monday, September 12  Workshop

Submission and Publication
==========================

We solicit submissions of research papers describing original
work. Submitted research papers must not have been previously published,
nor be under consideration for publication elsewhere. This includes system
descriptions and tutorial overview papers. System descriptions should come
with an URL allowing to access or download the system, with preference to
systems that can be downloaded under an open source licence. Presentations
of system descriptions at the workshop should include a system demonstration.

Besides regular research papers we also welcome short presentations
reporting on recent or ongoing work. These are not subject to restriction
as for previous, simultaneous, or future publication elsewhere. However,
depending on the final choice of editor for the workshop proceeding, it may
not be possible to include short presentations in the proceedings (though
they will be made available to the workshop participants).

We intend to publish the workshop proceedings with an open access
archive. Authors of accepted papers will keep their copyright, but should
be prepared to publish their paper under an open access licence and upload
it to an archive server such as CoRR (details will be posted later).

Submitted papers of both categories must not exceed a limit of 10 pages,
and have to be prepared in LaTeX. Authors may provide pointers to
additional online resources if necessary, and which the reviewers may use
to their sole discretion.

Submission is via Easychair at
