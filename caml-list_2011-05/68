Subject: [Caml-list] [JOB] NYU's Center for Genomics and Systems Biology seeks OCaml programmer


--bcaec54866decd0f6a04a2ed1049
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear OCaml Programmers,

I am excited to tell you about a new opportunity to develop OCaml software
at The Center for Genomics and Systems Biology (CGSB) at New York University
(NYU), located in the heart of Manhattan. The position's main function will
be to develop software in the OCaml language to manage, analyze, and display
the vast amounts of data generated by next-generation sequencing
technologies. NYU's strong commitment to this field is represented by its
$100M investment in the brand new CGSB building, which houses the latest
sequencing platforms and excellent high performance computing facilities.

You will support the computational needs of several experimental labs by
contributing to the following infrastructure:

o A database for tracking samples, very large quantities of raw data and
analysis results
o A website for users to submit new samples, monitor progress of their
workflow, and visualize data
o A system for distributing batch jobs to a cluster, accounting for
dependencies between jobs and cached results

The ideal candidate will be an experienced functional programmer with
knowledge of many OCaml libraries and tools, such as database bindings,
ocsigen, ocamlnet, batteries, janestreet-core, etc. Experience in the
following areas is a plus but not required: bioinformatics, statistics, type
theory, distributed computing, and UNIX systems administration.

NYU researchers are using sequencing technologies to investigate basic
questions about the nature of life and to address fundamental problems in
human health. The very large datasets generated by these technologies pose
significant computational challenges for which the robust principles of
functional programming are ideally suited.

Please contact me to discuss this position further. Thank you.
