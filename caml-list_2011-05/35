We have an autobuilder, but it is simply not possible to find this type
of problem automatically without also controlling the OS. The
autobuilder runs on a single OS and a single version of that only, and
this is always behind the latest release.

Also, for GODI pre-release QA is not as important as for a binary
distro.

Thanks for the clarification. In deed I understood this differently - as
if Ubuntu shipped the broken ocaml.
