Is there a way to disable these monthly notifications? I personally find
them quite annoying and, while I know how to disable them for
mailman-based mailing lists, I haven't found out how to do that with
sympa-based mailing lists. There seems to be nothing relevant under
"subscribers options".

However, I'm on other sympa-based mailing lists which do not have
monthly reminders --- in fact the caml list is the only one I'm a member
of that does send the reminders --- so maybe the kind administrators can
simple disable this "feature"?  (Or alternatively tell me how to disable
it solely for my account, before I procmail them out :-))

Many thanks in advance,
and many thanks as well for administering the list.

Cheers.
