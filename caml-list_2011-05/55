Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Fdinfo 0.1 released

Hello,

I'm pleased to announce the very first release of Fdinfo 0.1.

The library's objective is to return the offset and flag of files opened 
by another processus. I asked a few weeks ago if such a library existed 
but got no answer, therefore I've started writing my own.
It's very easy to use.

The infos are extracted from /proc/<pid>/fdinfo/<fd>.

Feel free to comment or participate. The code is accessible here: 
https://github.com/gbe/FDinfo
