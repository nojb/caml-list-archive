Call for papers: Towards a Digital Mathematics Library (DML 2011)
July 20-21st, 2011, Bertinoro, Italy c/o CICM 2011

Web: http://www.fi.muni.cz/~sojka/dml-2011.html

Deadlines: May 6th: abstract submissions 
           May 7th: paper submissions 
           May 30th: paper acceptance/rejection decision
           June 7th: versions for the proceedings due

http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dml2011
Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, 
potential impact for building DML, and clarity. Final paper versions should
conform to the Springer LNCS (llncs class) style, preferably using LaTeX2e.
Full papers might be also offered for DML session at MKM:

Submission categories:
Full paper: 5-15 LNCS pages
Short paper/poster/work in progress report: 2-5 LNCS pages 

Overview:
Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed 
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked and 
validated/verified. It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical 
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000 
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information technologies.

The workshop's objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of 
a global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current 
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects 
(EuDML, NUMDAM, Euclid, DML-CZ,...), asking such questions as:
# What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should be used
  and what metadata should be shared?
# What business models are suitable for publishers of mathematical
  literature, authors and funders of their projects and institutions?
# Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and extensible 
  mathematical library that mathematicians can use in their everyday work?
# What is the best practice for
    * retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to MathML and/or TeX);
    * retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing electronic copy in
      DVI, PS or PDF to MathML and/or TeX);
    * born-digital mathematics (how to make needed metadata and file formats
      available as a side effect of publishing workflow)?

Proceedings:
will be published by Masaryk University Press and will be available on site 
in printed form and in digital form from DML-CZ repository. All previous 
DML proceedings have been indexed by Thomson Reuters in Conference Proceedings 
Citation Index CPCI and by Google Scholar and are available in digital form 
at http://dml.cz/handle/10338.dmlcz/702563 . Best papers might be chosen for 
a postconference book published by renowned publisher or for a journal special
issue.

Keynote (TBD): 

Topics: 
(include, but are not limited to)
  o search, indexing and retrieval of mathematical documents
  o ranking of mathematical papers, similarity of mathematical documents
  o math OCR with MathML/TeX output
  o document conversions from/to MathML, OpenMath, LaTeX,
    PostScript and [tagged] PDF
  o conversions between various mathematical formalisms
  o mathematical document compression
  o processing of scanned images
  o algorithms for crosslinking of bibliographical items, 
    intext citations search
  o mathematical document classification, MSC 2010
  o mathematical text mining
  o mathematical documents metadata exchange via OAI-PMH and/or OAI-ORE
  o long term archiving, data migration
  o reports and experience from math digitization projects
  o math publishing with long term archival goal
  o software engineering aspects of creating, handling MathML, 
    OMDoc, OpenMath documents, and displaying them in web browsers
