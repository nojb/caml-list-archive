Subject: [Caml-list] Mixed static/dynamic linking of libraries

I want to statically link a library (libsqlite3.a) with my OCaml
application, but allow other
libraries to link dynamically. I'm building using ocamlfind on Linux.
I've tried various combinations
of -cclib -static and -cclib -Bdynamic, to no avail.  If I use the arguments

  -cclib -static -cclib -lsqlite3

the linker appears to find libsqlite3.a, but the linker then tries to
statically link every other library
used by my application.  That's so even if I follow the above by
-cclib -Bdynamic.

Is there a way to mix static and dynamic libraries using ocamlfind?
