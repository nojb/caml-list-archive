You sound like ocaml-related packages are totally broken in Ubuntu,
which is not true. They probably do more QA than GODI, even on
ocaml-related packages (e.g. frequent recompilations with new versions
of toolchain, early bug reporting when something breaks). But as you
pointed out, they have complete control over their OS... it would be
more difficult to do that for GODI. Sure, Ubuntu doesn't have a
dedicated ocaml maintainer, and copy their packages directly from Debian
and they should work most of the time (actually, I've never heard of
breakages that were specific to Ubuntu).

BTW, the ocaml package shipped by Ubuntu 11.04 has been fixed (it's
still version 3.11.2, though). The original mail of this thread was
about an ocaml compiled from sources.
