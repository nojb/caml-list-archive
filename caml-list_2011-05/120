Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Ocamlbuild question

The problem is that xml-light has a weird module dependency graph.
xml.ml depends on Dtd, while dtd.ml and dtd.mli depend on Xml. I'm not
sure the way this is done, but I think it is very hackish. The way I
understand it (and I am probably wrong), xml.mli is first compiled as
an signature-alone module (without implementation; you may have .mli
without attached .ml), against which Dtd is compiled, then the xml.ml
file is compiled as a *different* Xml module (yes, this sounds crazy),
and it reuses the types from the xml.mli interface by casting them
using Obj.magic.

I don't know why this is done that way. I suppose this is some kind of
hack to have recursive modules without saying it. Anyway, it's much
too hackish for any reasonable dependency solver to understand. I
think keeping your old build script is probably the best solution
here. I don't know much about ocamlbuild plugin language, maybe it's
possible to override the default dependency solver completely to
provide your own build order (I know it's possible to change it by
adding constraints), but I don't think you would gain much by this
approach.
