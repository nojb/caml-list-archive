Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] ocaml-xdg-basedir v0.0.1: XDG basedir location for data/cache/configuration files

This library implements the xdg-basedir specification. It helps to define
standard locations for configuration, cache and data files in the user
directory and on the system.

It is a straightforward implementation on UNIX platform and try to apply
consistent policies with regard to Windows directories.

It is inspired by the Haskell implementation of this specification, and it
follows the same choices for Windows directories.

The xdg-basedir specification:
http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

The Haskell implementation:
http://github.com/willdonnelly/xdg-basedir


The API of this implementation:
http://xdg-basedir.forge.ocamlcore.org/api
