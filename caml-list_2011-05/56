FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS 
International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design 
http://www.fmcad.org

University of Texas at Austin, Texas, USA 
October 30 - November 2, 2011 


IMPORTANT DATES 

Abstract Submission: May 11 

Paper Submission: May 18 

Author Notification: July 15 

Final Version: August 5 

Conference: October 30 - November 2 


CONFERENCE SCOPE 

FMCAD 2011 is the eleventh in a series of conferences on the theory
and application of formal methods in hardware and system design and
verification. FMCAD provides a leading international forum to
researchers and practitioners in academia and industry for presenting
and discussing novel methods, technologies, theoretical results, and
tools for formal reasoning about computing systems, as well as open
challenges therein.

FMCAD is privileged to host invited presentations and tutorials from a
number of outstanding academic and industrial speakers:

 - Aaron Bradley, Assistant Professor at CU Boulder
 - Aarti Gupta, senior researcher at NEC
 - John Hughes, Professor at Chalmers University of Technology and CEO
   of QuviQ
 - J Moore, winner of the ACM System Award (2005), member of National
   Academy of Engineering, and ACM Fellow
 - Vigyan Singhal, President and CEO of Oski Technology Inc
 - Ivan Sutherland, Turing Award winner (1988)


ASSOCIATED WORKSHOPS AND COMPETITION

The following workshops are co-located with this year's conference:

 - The 10th International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and Its
   Applications (http://www.cs.ru.nl/~julien/acl2-11/)

 - The Design and Implementation of Formal Tools and Systems workshop
   (http://www.nec-labs.com/research/system/systems_SAV-website/DIFTS11)

We are also proud to host this year's Hardware Model Checking
Competition (http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc11).


TOPICS OF INTEREST 

Advances in model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking,
abstraction and reduction techniques, compositional methods, automatic
decision procedures at the bit and word-level, probabilistic methods,
and combinations of deductive methods and decision procedures.

Topics related to the application of formal and semi-formal methods to
functional and non-functional specification and validation of hardware
and software. This includes timing and power modeling, and
verification of computing systems on all levels of abstraction.

System-level design and verification, especially for embedded systems,
HW/SW co-design and verification, and transaction-level verification.

Modeling and specification languages, formal semantics of known
languages or their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and
transformation, and correct-by-construction methods.

Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to
industrial-scale designs. Tools that represent FV enablement, new
features, or a substantial improvement in the automation of FV
methods.

Application of formal methods in new areas. 


SUBMISSIONS 

Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair.
More details will be provided on the FMCAD web site. The proceedings
will be available online in the ACM Digital Library, at IEEE Xplore,
and as a free download from the FMCAD web site. Two categories of
papers can be submitted: regular papers (8 pages), containing original
research that has not been previously published, nor concurrently
submitted for publication; and short papers (4 pages), containing
emerging results or original ideas that can be described succinctly.

Regular and short papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on
letter-size paper with a 10-point font size, see
http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html.
Submissions must contain original research that has not been
previously published, nor concurrently submitted for publication. Any
partial overlap with any published or concurrently submitted paper
must be clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported,
authors are strongly encouraged to provide adequate access to their
data so that results can be independently verified.

A small number of accepted papers will be considered for a
distinguished paper award.
