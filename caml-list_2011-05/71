In this particular case the two types are almost equivalent.
The only counterexample I could find is unifying with the following
private row type:

  type leA = private [< `A]

leA is unifiable with [< `A] but not with [`A].

The difference becomes more significant when there is an argument.
For instance, [<  `A of int] and [< `A of bool] are unifiable, giving [< `A of int & bool],
but [`A of int] cannot be unified with [`A of bool].

Note that some old versions of OCaml did some "singleton promotion", i.e.
[< `A of int] was automatically converted to [`A of int].
This was removed as an unnecessary complication, and also because you
might actually want to distinguish the two for private row types.
