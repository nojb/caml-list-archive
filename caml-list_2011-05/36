That's hilarious (as a statement). This patch has been applied and
released (since last March 9th) in a binary distribution (namely
Debian). So, I quite don't understand your statement. IMO, It depends
on the manpower behind (and maybe dev tools and release process).
But I don't see where you gain to have a source-based distribution
to address this kind of issues (except for the build time… but that's
ridiculous).

The real problem of Ubuntu (wrt. OCaml) is that OCaml has no maintainer.
And, we also see that with GODI. manpower is lacking and you weren't able
to release a fix until today, although the patch was there since quite
some time now. (Not blaming anyone here, just stating a fact).

But oh well, maybe all this is off-topic.
