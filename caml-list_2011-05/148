Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Fdinfo 0.2.1 released

Hello,

I'm pleased to announce this new release of Fdinfo version 0.2.1.
Fdinfo is a small library to get the current offset and flags of files 
opened by another process.

Feel free to review, comment or participate if you like, I would 
appreciate it: https://github.com/gbe/FDinfo
