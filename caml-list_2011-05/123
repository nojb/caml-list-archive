Subject: [Caml-list] Cfp: HLPP 2011 (ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on High-level Parallel Programming
 and Applications)

5th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on High-level Parallel Programming and Applications
Tokyo, September 18, 2011
Affiliated to ICFP 2011 http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2011
Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN

AIMS AND SCOPE

As processor and system manufacturers adjust their roadmaps towards increasing 
levels of both inter and intra-chip parallelism, so the urgency of reorienting 
the mainstream software industry towards these architectures grows.

At present, popular parallel and distributed programming methodologies are 
dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or 
equivalently unstructured shared memory mechanisms.

Higher-level, structured approaches offer many possible advantages and have a 
key role to play in the scalable exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.

This workshop provides a forum for discussion and research about such high-level 
approaches to parallel programming.

TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on topics 
including (but not limited to) the following aspects of multi-core, parallel, 
distributed, grid and cloud computing:

    * High-level programming and performance models (BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.)
      and tools
    * Declarative parallel programming methodologies
    * Algorithmic skeletons and constructive methods
    * Declarative parallel programming languages and libraries: semantics and
      implementation
    * Verification of declarative parallel and distributed programs
    * Applications using high-level languages and tools
    * Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods
