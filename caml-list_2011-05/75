Book series "Studies on the Semantic Web"

IOS Press/AKA Verlag

http://www.semantic-web-studies.net/


Semantic Web has grown into a mature field of research. Its methods find 
innovative applications on and off the World Wide Web. Its underlying 
technologies have significant impact on adjacent fields of research and 
on industrial applications.

This book series reports on the state of the art in foundations, 
methods, and applications of Semantic Web and its underlying 
technologies. It is a central forum for the communication of recent 
developments and comprises research monographs, textbooks and edited 
volumes on all topics related to the Semantic Web.

Volumes in this series are co-published by IOS Press Amsterdam and AKA 
Verlag Heidelberg ensuring a short publication time and world-wide 
distribution.

Proposals for publishing excellent PhD theses in this series are 
welcome. Publications in German language are possible.
