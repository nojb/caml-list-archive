Subject: new Caml mode for Emacs available
Sender: weis
Status: O



I submitted a beefed up Elisp package for interacting with Caml to the
Ohio State Elisp archive. The main additions are: an indentation
mechanism for Caml mode, and a new debugger mode closely modeled on
gud/gdb.

It is also available as

ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/itz/caml-mode-0.72.tgz
