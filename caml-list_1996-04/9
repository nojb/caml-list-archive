I am happy to announce the first version of caml2csl, a translator from Caml
Light 0.7 to Caml Special Light.

You can get it by anonymous ftp at:

ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/Usercontribs/caml2cslV1.0.tar.gz

It doesn't work like the convert tool: it was designed on the base of the
camlc compiler. So, it is able to analyze the structure of each sentence.
  This allows the renaming of every identifier to fit the CSL conventions,
and prevents name clashes, variable captures.

It translates the constructions that changed, like 'where', infixes,
character constants, ...

caml2csl also summarizes what remains to do by hand after the automatic
translation.

PS: This program has been used to translate the system Coq (about 50000
lines). It took less than a week to get a runable system. I hope this
will encourage you to use it!
