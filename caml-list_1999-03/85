And, on a vaguely related topic, is it possible to use threads with programs
that also use OCamlTK?  I know Tk is not threadsafe, but if only one thread
is calling Tk functions, then perhaps it's still OK?  

Also, the manual says:
  > All object files on the command line must also have been compiled with
the -thread option, 
  > which selects a special, thread-safe version of the standard library
(see chapter 8). 

But does this apply to the object files contained in libraries such as
OCamlTK, Unix, Num and Str?  

Finally, if a particular library has used non-threadsafe constructs, and you
try to link it into a threaded program, some compiler support for detecting
and warning about this might be handy.

Thanks,
Don

Subject: Break under Windows NT




Hi,

Is it true that under the Windows NT version of OCaml there's no easy way of
sending the equivalent of a SIGINT to a OCaml process and have OCaml raise
an exception?  Or have I missed something?  I need to be able to
asynchronously break long running computations under NT.  BTW I'm also using
OCamlTK.

Thanks,
Don
