I'm running ocamlopt on an Alpha (Linux) but need to generate i386
binary executables.

Has anyone done this?  Any hints on how to do it?

(I'm going to be creating a bootable kernel image as part of the FunOS
project - see http://sarg.ryerson.ca/FunOS/ if interested.  Yes,
obviously I could build natively on an i386 box, but we'll initially
be using the bochs emulator, and the Alpha is a lot faster.)

Thanks	../Dave
