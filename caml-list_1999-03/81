Hi,

after lots of bugs have been fixed in the ocaml link db, it's time
to go "online". The final address is:

	http://www.npc.de/ocaml/linkdb/

You find there an index of available free software for Objective Caml.
Currently, only four authors put links into it, which may be the effect
of the title "test software". This is no longer true.

Some recent changes make the database more useable:

	- Entries can now be changed after they have been inserted
	- Entries are sorted by the date of the last modification
	  by default
	- There are some checks on incorrect values
	- There is a version of the database without frames
	- The lists are more compact

While the database has become more stable, the functionality is still
incomplete: You can't search, for example. As the source code is
in the camlcvs repository (camlcvs.inria.fr) you are invited to
help me improving it.

I hope this index helps you a bit to get a better overview of
ocaml-related software.

Gerd
