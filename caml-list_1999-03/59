When i have inheritance hierarchy shaped like a diamond:

           a
          / \
         b   c
          \ /
           d

class d inherits two copies of a's instance variables. If I want to have
only
one copy it seems I need to linearize inheritance hieararchy what I'm 
reluctant to do.

So is there any way I could have d with one copy of a's instance variables?
