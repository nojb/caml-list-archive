Hi!

Uhm. I would really be interested. Since Ocamlopt doesn't currently work
under MachTen 4, I have the problem that I can't use it on my notebook.
To have it running under MPW would really be fun. Since most of the
other libraries like Mesa, GTK or TK are already available for the
MacOS, it might even work out to be a usefull alternative to other MPW
compilers.

bye, Georg
