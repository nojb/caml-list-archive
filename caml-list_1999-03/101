Principially a good idea. I think that the caml list should not be used for
this as frequent automatic mails would only confuse. Of course there are
currently many announcements in the list but most of them give some more
explanations what the piece of software is good for.

Perhaps a broadcast will be more valuable if it summarizes several additions,
for example of the last week. As I have pointed out before, there must be
acceptance for such mails. If many people agree, I will implement it, either
as separate mailing list or by using the caml list. Please let me know what
you prefer.
