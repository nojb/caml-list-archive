Hi, 
The installation of ocaml based applications might be simplified if
the standard "make install" copied the config lib and the config/Makefile
to the library location.  Or if this is messy, how about a "make 
install-devel" that does the copying? Thanks for considering this
detail.  -David Gurr

PS Any suggestions for algorithms for tree (rather than line) oriented
diff/patch/merge?
