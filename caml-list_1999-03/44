The mix-up is in the naming of the library.  The so-called "CamlTk41"
library actually supports Tk 4.0, 4.1 and 8.0 under Unix, but only
Tk 8.0 under Windows.  One day I hope to get rid entirely of the "41"
suffix in the names of library files.

At any rate, under Windows, the CamlTk stuff was built against Tcl/Tk
8.0.4, and that's what you need to use CamlTk.

The following incantation works for me:

ocamlc -custom -I \ocaml\lib\camltk \
        tk41.cma helloworld.ml \
        \ocaml\lib\camltk\libcamltk41.lib \
        \tcl\lib\tk80.lib \tcl\lib\tcl80.lib

(assuming OCaml installed in \ocaml and TclTk in \tcl).

Let me know if it doesn't work for you.
