Subject: Upgrade from OCaml 2.01 to OCaml 2.02 made things _slower_!

Hi,

After I upgraded OCaml & Camlp4 from 2.01 to 2.02, our the native code
of our program became much smaller (5124462 instead of 7219378), but it
also became a little slower (1.5% - 3.5% for various inputs). Do you
have an idea what could have caused it?

Also, I was doing some performance mesurements (using P6 performance
counter support patches for Linux by Erik Hendriks -
http://beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/ ) when I upgraded, so I have some
information (and can get more of it) on the performance counters for my
program under both 2.01 and 2.02. In particular, the number of requests
from the processor to the L1 data cache became 2%-3% bigger.

I am using RedHat Linux 5.2 with kernel 2.2.2 on a dual-PII/400(Xeon).

Alexey
