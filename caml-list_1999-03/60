Subject: Unicode-Support in Ocaml?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Are there any plans of supporting Unicode in objective caml?
A support for Unicode characters is very important for writing
Web-Applications and would be a great improvement for other applications
too (IMHO)!

Id could also be interesting having a standard signature for the DOM (
http://www.w3.org/ ) in ocaml.
Is there any organization defining signatures of existing API's? Of
course one could use an IDL->stub converter, but there is much more
possible using signatures than IDL-Files.

PS.: Fabrice le Fessant: what's the license of your Xlib implementation?
Efuns is very cool ;~)
PPS.: Xavier Leroy, Ocaml is the best programming system I have ever
used, thank you very much!
