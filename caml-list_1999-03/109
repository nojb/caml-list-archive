The config lib is not text and could be extended to include all the
config/Makefile info.

I *need* inflexiblity.  The point of .cmi files is the inflexiblity
of consistency.  I need to use the same compiler etc that was used
to build ocaml.

Since the config lib is used to build ocaml, and the config/Makefile is
used to gen the config lib, if the config file is wrong, your ocaml
build will be wrong and installation of applications is a moot point.

Perhaps I would understand your point if you explained this example.

Re: philosophy: Why would knowing what C compiler was used to compile 
& link the bytecode interp result in a loss of control?
