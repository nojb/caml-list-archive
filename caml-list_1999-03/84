Hi,

Is it true that under the Windows NT version of OCaml there's no easy way of
sending the equivalent of a SIGINT to a OCaml process and have OCaml raise
an exception?  Or have I missed something?  I need to be able to
asynchronously break long running computations under NT.  BTW I'm also using
OCamlTK.

Thanks,
Don
