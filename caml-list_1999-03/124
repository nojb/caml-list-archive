Does anyone else find that the Sort module to be in logical conflict with
the Array and List modules?  Both the Array and List modules contain
"map", "fold_left", and "fold_right", but there isn't a separate Map
module (for example, you use List.map instead of Map.list).

Following this pattern, Sort.list should be List.sort and Sort.array
should be Array.sort. 

I expect that this has come up before, and there is a good justification
for the Sort module, but I thought I would mention it from a new OCaml
user's perspective just in case.
