There's no way to implement Sedgewick's quicksort with the interface
given in sort.mli.  You'd need two comparison functions, one for ">="
and one for "<=".  That explains the degenerate case when all the
elements are equal.

And it degenerates on already-sorted data because you swap the pivot
with the right-most element.  As a consequence, one of the subarrays
has its two highest elements in first and last positions, which makes
the median-of-three degenerate.  I think this bug is also in
Sedgewick's pseudo-code.

Also, you should recurse on the smallest subarray first, not the
largest.


I vote for Shellsort.
