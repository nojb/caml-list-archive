Hi,

The filter function implementation does not seem to be too efficient. I did some
testing once and it turned out that the most efficient (for my applications) way
to write the filter function was:

let rec filter f = function
   [] -> []
 | (h::t) as l ->
      if f h then
         let rem = filter f t in
         if rem == t then l else h::rem
      else
         filter f t

The main gain here is that we do not allocate any new memory for sublist (or the
whole list) that does not change as a result of the filtering.

Alexey
