> Is Multicasting supported in Caml ??

Not by the Unix library we distribute.  However, it should be easy to
write a couple of C functions that set whatever multicast options you
need, and call them from your Caml program.

I think the Ensemble library uses multicast in some cases; you might
look at their source code to see how they did it (www.cs.cornell.edu).
