Tcl/Tk does this, and I absolutely hate it.  First of all, the config
file is text, and in GNU-like environments it should go under the
share tree, not under lib.  Second, and more important, it limits
flexibility in the derived installations.  This is partly a
"philosophical" issue (see the last sentence of this message), but
also a practical one: any bug in the original build is automatically
propagated to the dependent ones.  (With Tcl, this surfaced in the
naming of shared libraries).

Some prefer life simplified; others prefer to keep control of it.

was that the condemned man had no chance at all, absolutely none.
