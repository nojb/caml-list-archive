The OCAML core contains a function

	open_out_gen : open_flag list -> int -> string -> out_channel

where the integer corresponds to the file permissions set when a new file is
created. How is this integer interpreted? Does it vary from platform to
platform? (Unix vs Windows).

Similarly, under the Unix module, there is the type file_perm = int, serving
the same purpose. Are these integers interpreted with the standard Unix
octal file permission bits? How about under Windows?

If this information is described in the doc, I apologize, but I couldn't
find it.
