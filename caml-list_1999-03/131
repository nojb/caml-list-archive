There is, but only for machines running under some version of Unix.
For a Macintosh, that means MkLinux, Linux/PPC, or Rhapsody.  There
will be a port to MacOS X Server as soon as I get my hands on a
machine running it.  In the meantime, the Rhapsody configuration might
work for MacOS X.

As for MacOS, there is not much demand for highly optimized MPW tools,
so we didn't spend the week of work needed to interface ocamlopt with
the MPW assembler.
