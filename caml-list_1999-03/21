The mind boggles!  8-)

Just a comment.  Neither on the WWW nor on the FTP site, there's the
.txt and .prn version of the documentation.

Please, oh please, don't stop providing the docs in text format!

I normally use the .prn version as an inline reference. 
It is way faster to have the .prn file in an emacs
buffer than navigate the html.

On monday I'll post the emacs functions that I use to lock at the
documentation.
