Besides some large projects , I work on many small projects. I can live
perfectly with -I.

I'm using setup-makefiles that are included in many others. For example
sets the setup-makefile  a variable for being used in -I. 

Thus changes are reduced to 1 makefile, furthermore any dependant
makefile may change the setup locally (isn't that called implementation
inheritance :-). This way also solves my problem with generating code
for different OS on the same file-system.

Don't add too many bells and whistles, if that isn't really needed.
Often small is beautiful --- and easier to understand.
