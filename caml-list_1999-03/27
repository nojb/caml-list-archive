It appears that a mixup has occurred...

Your README file indicates that we need Tcl 8.04 in order to run the camltk
interface. However, your distrubution includes the Tk 4.1 version of
libraries. Furthermore, when attempting to create the helloworld example the
compiler complains that Module TK is undefined...

Has the library format changed between 2.01 and 2.02? Or is there really a
mixup in the distribution?
