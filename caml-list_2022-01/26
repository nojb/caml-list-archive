I was able to create an account and found the account creation stage
smooth. I can't say whether or not it conforms to the WCAG for instance,
but in terms of user experience it went surprisingly well.

Once my account was created, I was already logged in so I didn't have to
login explicitly. However I expect this would have worked because login
is rarely inaccessible.

However, I have been unable to enable the mailing-list mode. To be more
precise, I was able to open my account menu and then to switch between
the different tabs. I was however not available to see each tab's
specific content.

Another thing I can share is that I found the web interface scaring. It
may be because I am not used to it, but really, I don't like the web. I
feel unproductive when I am in my web browser and in an hostile world.

SÃ©bastien.
