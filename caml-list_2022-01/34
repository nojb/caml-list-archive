If you are asking me: I didn't even try that. I use Firefox with Orca
under Linux. I uselynx (text-mode browser) only for simple google
searches and for Wikipedia, almost all the time I end-up using Firefox.
I don't feel at ease with it because I feel too far away frmo the
information (it's hard to explain, sorry), but that's what gives the
best user experience, I think.

I am not sure such people exist nowadays. The visually impaired persons
follow, for most of them, the general tendency and use Windows or Mac
with screen-rendering solutions (NVDA and Jaws under Windows, VoiceOver
under MacOSX). Even among the minority of blind persons using Linux,
most of them work in the GUI. And for the minority of the minority who
uses the console, most of the time they do run X just to run Firefox. I
belong to this last category.

But working with screen-readers and being Java-script-free have become
two quite different things nowadays. Think about stuff like ARIA.

Yes but now the reference is WCAG 2.1, see

I, to, would prefer to be able to continue using lynx. I'm way more
comfortable than with Firefox. But there are so many aother batles that
I don't feel brave enough to invest energy in this one, nowadays. But I
am glad others do.

Sébastien.
