Well thei=re is no real equivalence between the ability to view a page
in a text-mode browser and its accessibility. NOt even an implication in
one direction or another.

Similarly, I don't think it's expected, nowadays, that a website is
browsable without JS support for it to conform to WCAG.

Well as was mentionned, the mailing-list mode needs to be enabled and
that seems to have accessibility issues.
