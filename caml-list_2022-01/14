Being myself blind I feel very concerned about accessibility. I admin I
didn't try the forum, but (1) all the forums I tried so far I ofudn way
mess accessible than good old mailing lists and (2) yes, mailing lists
are totally accessible and, in my opinion, very simple to use.
Many thanks for promoting the accessibility concern!
