All of this information should live on ocaml.org.

ocaml.org is easiliy modifiable. Just click the link in the corner,
click the edit button and start typing.

ocaml.org uses Github's issue tracking and pull request system which is well suited for
discussions of changes to content, including supporting inline comments
on pull requests.

If you wish to add a new page or move some things around then just
submit a pull request.

ocaml.org is full of incomplete content :). I'm also not sure that an
argument based on the idea that people won't submit content until it is
ready is a particularly strong one. Besides, some people, myself
included, are more likely to submit things to places if they think their
changes will be looked over by someone, rather than blindly accepted
glaring inaccuracies and all.

Bottom line: just use ocaml.org. People have put a lot of effort into
making it easy to submit content, and are even willing to provide some
maintainence of that content. Obviously the system could be improved,
but I think suggestions/pull requests to improve ocaml.org would be more
useful than creating yet another place for OCaml information.
