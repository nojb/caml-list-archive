The 12th International Symposium on Automated Technology for
Verification and Analysis (ATVA) invites proposals for pre-
and postconference workshops to be held on November 3 (pre)
or November 7 (post). The ATVA conference series covers the
spectrum from theoretical results to practical applications
of automated analysis, verification and synthesis.

Proposals that promise to bring new topics to ATVA, of either
practical or theoretical importance, or to provide a forum for more
detailed discussion on central topics of continuing importance
are highly welcome. Proposals that explore the application of
automated tools to real-world problems are especially encouraged.

Workshop proposals are limited to 2 pages, and should provide at
least the following information:
 - Title
 - Description of the workshop topic and goals
   (Why do you believe this is an interesting and significant topic?)
 - Intended audience
   (From which areas do you expect potential participants to
    come? How many participants do you expect?)
 - Relevance and relation of the workshop to the main conference
 - Organisation of the workshop
   (Describe the intended format (e.g. paper selection process),
    its expected duration (full day or half day) and its preferred
    date (November 3rd or November 7th)
 - Organisers' details
   (Provide affiliations, backgrounds and contact details of
   organisers and potential committee members)

Proposals should be sent as PDF to the workshop chair Peter H=F6fner
(peter.hoefner@nicta.com.au).

Important dates:
  Deadline for proposal submissions:   April 29, 2014  (extended)
  Acceptance/rejection notification:   May 19, 2014
