Subject: [Caml-list] Segmentation fault when using OcamlMPI

Dear all,

I'm trying with a colleague to distribute a verification tool using
OcamlMPI.
Unfortunately, we encounter segmentation faults "sometimes".
Sometimes means still often enough to have the tool crash almost always
at some point.

We don't understand at all what is happening.
We thought that the MPI read function ("Mpi.receive source_rank") would
wait until there is something to read, but maybe we misunderstood that.
The precise command we use to receive info is as follows:

let res = Mpi.receive source_rank (int_of_slave_tag Slave_result_tag)
Mpi.comm_world

where int_of_slave_tag Slave_result_tag is our own function returning
some predefined integer.

Are there any risks of conflicts when several nodes (with different
source_rank, though) send something to one node?
For information, we use a master-workers scheme, with one master
centralizing results computed by workers.
For information too, we first send (and receive) the size of the data,
and then the actual data (although, for some strange reason, we do not
use the size when receiving the data; maybe we should?!).

I put a zip on my Web page with a simplified source (a single .ml file,
with _oasis and the command to launch) that is enough to show the bug.

Thank you for your feedback!
