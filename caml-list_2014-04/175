(extended deadlines)

4th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL & DATA ENGINEERING
(MEDI 2014)

Lordos Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

24-26 September, 2014

http://medi2014.cs.ucy.ac.cy/

The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the dissemin=
ation of
research accomplishments and to promote the interaction
and collaboration of research communities issued from modelling and system
modelling on the one hand and data and data modelling on the other hand.
MEDI 2014 provides an international infrastructure for the presentation of
research results and experimentations on models and data theory, developmen=
t of
advanced technologies related to models and data and their
advanced applications and case studies. This international scientific event,
initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at
promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and
faculty/student exchanges and of other parts of the world as well.


Keynote Speakers

Mukesh Mohania, IBM India: Talk on the data side
Dominique Mery, Loria, Nancy, France: Talk on the model side

Submission Guidelines and Instructions

Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing
original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or
Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should
not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices=
).
Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages with
the indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the paper is
accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which
do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra page purchase
commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness=
, and
clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Not=
es in
Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Duplicate submissions are not
allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if it is
submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already
accepted to be published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate
submissions thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions
require explicit consent from all listed authors.


Important Dates

Abstract submission: April 28, 2014 (extended deadline)
Full-paper submission: May 9, 2014 (extended deadline)
Acceptance notification: June 16, 2014
Camera Ready: July 7, 2014


Paper Publication

All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Best papers will be invited for submission in a
special issue of the Future Generation Computer Systems (Elsevier), the
International Journal of Cooperative Information Systems (World Scientific)
and Fundamenta Informaticae (IOS Press).
