Subject: [Caml-list] [JOB] OCaml Engineers and Scientists at CEA, Software
 Security Labs (Paris Saclay, France)

Hi List,

The CEA' Software Security Laboratory is opening positions for OCaml
engineers and scientists at Paris Saclay, France.

## Engineer & Scientist.
### Research and develop the next-generation of software verification tools.

The Software Security Laboratory - LSL - has an ambitious goal: enable
developers and validation experts to design high-confidence software. We
believe that programs should be as reliable as mathematical truths.

Within CEA, LSL is dedicated to inventing the best possible means to conduct
software verification. We craft methods and tools that leverage exciting,
cutting-edge formal methods to ensure that industrial code can comply with
the
highest standards. And in doing so, we get to interact with the most
creative
people in academia and the industry.

Our organizational structure is very simple: those who pioneer scientific
innovations are the same ones who implement them. We are a dynamic
twenty-person
laboratory, and your work will have a direct and visible impact on the
state of
formal verification.

Our brand-new offices are located in the heart of Campus Paris Saclay, in
the largest European cluster of public and private research.

                                     *


#### You

You dream of devising the next breakthrough in code analysis and to see it
through low-level implementation details. You read research papers with
passion, but you are fully aware that a toy prototype is quite different
from a
hardened tool. You understand that what stands between both is a series of
complex
implementation problems. And that's great, because it means getting your
hands
dirty and confronting your tools to challenging real-life use cases.

You enjoy being a constructive member of a team of talented and dedicated
people; you
are extremely reliable and the nightly builds will prove it every time. Last
week's bleeding-edge release of obscure packages is not really your thing.
You
want the source code, you want scalability, and you want results.

If this sounds like you, we have a job for you.

#### Role

We need you to help us develop the Frama-C platform, by improving the
current
analyses and designing complementary approaches. You will contribute to
growing the
community of users, handling feedback and helping real people solve real
problems.

You will take an active part in research activities and industrial
partnerships, alongside other members of the laboratory. This can include
writing proposals, managing projects, publishing papers, and attending
scientific and technical events worldwide.

#### Requirements

- Background in formal methods, and programming languages.
- Experience with significant OCaml development.
- Experience with software engineering practices: source code management and
  reviews, continuous integration, and bug-tracking.
- Self-organized, with an ability to prioritize effectively.
- Team-minded - you know when to let someone else take the lead.

#### Pluses

- Strong proficiency in foreign languages.
- Experience with writing scientific papers and technical reports.
- Understanding of C or C++ semantics.
- Knowledge in the fields of cybersecurity, concurrency, or floating-point
  arithmetics.
- Administration of Linux environments and software development tools.
- Design of Graphical User Interfaces.
- Hands-on experience with formal verification tools: Coq, PVS, Why3, etc.

#### Applying

If you're interested in joining LSL, send us an email to share what inspires
you, and why you think you are perfect for the team. Send it along with a
resume
at florent.kirchner@cea.fr.
