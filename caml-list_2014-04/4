Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Ocaml compiler documentation

I would suggest that it's probably better to keep the documentation as
comments where possible.  However, I think it is important to avoid
excessive commentary, especially if it is likely to get out of sync as
a result of future modifications to the code.  It may be that in some
cases making alterations to the code (for example, improving the name
of a variable) is a more satisfactory approach than adding a comment.

Thanks for working on this.

Mark
