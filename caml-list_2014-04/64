Proceedings will be published by IEEE


Recent years have witnessed increasing interest and development in computer=
ised systems and procedures,
which exploit the electronic media in order to offer effective and sophisti=
cated solutions to a wide range of
real-world applications. Innovation and research development in this rapidl=
y evolving area of eSystems has
typically been reported on as part of cognate fields such as, for example: =
Information and Communications
Technology, Computer Science, Systems Science, Social Science and engineeri=
ng. This conference, on the

nference. The location offers an
especially attractive opportunity for professional discussion, socialising =
and sightseeing.
