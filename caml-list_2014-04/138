             PAS 2014 - Third International Seminar on
Program Verification, Automated Debugging and Symbolic Computation
                 Vienna, Austria, July 17-18, 2014
                     http://pas2014.cc4cm.org/

Important Dates

  - Submission of papers/extended abstracts:    April 30, 2014
  - Notification of acceptance or rejection:      May 10, 2014
  - Final version due:                            May 20, 2014
  - Seminar taking place:                     July 17-18, 2014

Overview

PAS 2014 will provide a forum for researchers and software developers
actively involved or interested in developing, using, and applying
methods and software tools of symbolic computation for program verification
and automated debugging to exchange ideas and views, to review the state of
the art and discuss prospects, to present research results and experiments,
and to build up contacts for future cooperation. The scientific program of
the seminar will feature invited talks and contributed presentations.

Specific topics for PAS 2014 include (but are not limited to):

  - Theories and methodologies for program verification and testing
  - Model checking, fault locating and program repairing
  - Symbolic computation and automated reasoning for program verification
  - Termination, correctness and complexity analysis of programs
  - Automated program synthesis and transformation
  - Logic and semantics for automated and algorithmic debugging
  - Program debugging paradigms and techniques
  - Symbolic constraint solving for verification and debugging
  - Tools, prototypes, empirical and case studies

The previous two seminars PAS 2012 and PAS 2013 were held in Beijing, China.
PAS 2014 is part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC) and the  
Vienna Summer
of Logic.

Invited Speakers

  - Bruno Buchberger (Johannes Kepler University, Austria)
  - Hoon Hong (North Carolina State University, USA)
  - Michael Rusinowitch (LORIA-INRIA-Lorraine, France)
  - Viorica Sofronie-Stokkermans (University Koblenz-Landau, Germany)

Submission

Potential participants of PAS 2014 are invited to submit extended abstracts
(2-4 pages) or full papers describing their work to be presented at  
the seminar.
The submitted extended abstracts and full papers will be reviewed by the
organizers for soundness and relevance to the seminar. Submission of original
research papers is encouraged, while published material and work in progress
will also be considered for presentation at the seminar. Electronic  
submissions
are strongly preferred using EasyChair:

    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pas2014

Accepted extended abstracts and full papers will be distributed at the  
seminar.
Authors of the extended abstracts and full papers accepted for presentation
at the seminar may be invited to submit their full and/or revised papers for
publication in a post-proceedings volume or a journal special issue after the
meeting. The submitted papers will be formally reviewed by external referees
according to the standard refereeing procedure.
