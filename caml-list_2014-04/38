You mention several features of wikis:

- Easily modifiable - Your original proposal was to enable a wiki on
GitHub, so almost exactly what ocaml.org already is. If you were proposing
a different wiki technology, then this point could be argued, but not if
you're asking for a GitHub based wiki. (And if you were proposing a
different technology, I'd probably still disagree. I think Markdown is the
best syntax we have, and I really like that I can do a pull, modify in the
text editor of my choice, then push. I dislike typing content within a
browser, unless it is a small change.)

- Supports discussions - Again, this also wouldn't be available in the
GitHub based wiki you proposed, so ocaml.org is no different on this point.
Furthermore, I feel GitHub's issue system addresses this sufficiently.

- One can easily build up a hierarchy - Although I consider this a minor
point, I accept it is true in the current system. Links in a markdown file
within the main part of a GitHub repo do not automatically become
clickable. However, they do for markdown pages within the GitHub wiki
feature of a repo (see my proposal below).

- Incomplete content - I accept your argument on this. It is true that
ocaml.org has tried to promote good, complete content. What you're asking
for is a place to have incomplete, possibly poorly written content. I see
the value in that. Sometimes you just want to write something down, and
maybe it'll improve over time or not.

Here's an option: add whatever you want to the wiki [1] of the ocaml/
ocaml.org repo (not of ocaml/ocaml, that wouldn't make sense). It is
already enabled, and as far as I can tell anyone can edit without a PR. I
believe this gives you every feature you're asking for.

Once you've added something, we can decide what to do with the content. If
you want, we can easily publish it, e.g. to http://ocaml.org/wiki. The
exact URL depends on how we want to market this content. Calling it "wiki"
will imply to most people that the content is permanent, and I would get
confused about how this sections differs from the Tutorials page. Thus, a
better choice might be http://ocaml.org/sandbox. Then, it is clear this is
scratch work, potentially incomplete, potentially wrong, etc. When content
within sandbox is deemed good enough, we move it to Tutorials or other
appropriate section. (In fact, some of the current tutorials should go into
scratch, as they are quite out of date.)

<div>Is it possible to turn on the wiki in the OCaml github account?</div>

</div></blockquote><div><br></div></div><div>For which repo? If you&#39;re =
asking for the &quot;ocaml&quot; repo, the wiki for it should, if it all, b=
e used only for matters regarding the compiler.</div><div><br></div><div>



I&#39;m unsure that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for since you make refere=
nce to previous requests on this mailing list, which were for for broader d=
ocumentation in general. None of the repos in the OCaml account would make =
sense for that. We could create a separate ocaml-wiki repo, which could hav=
e this broader purpose.</div>





<div><br></div><div>But I see virtually no difference in that and the curre=
nt <a href=3D"http://ocaml.org" target=3D"_blank">ocaml.org</a> implementat=
ion, which allows to provide documentation in the same markdown syntax, wit=
h the same requirement of a GitHub account. Every <a href=3D"http://ocaml.o=
rg" target=3D"_blank">ocaml.org</a> page can be edited in your browser just=
 like a wiki, and new pages can be added directly from GitHub&#39;s code br=
owser.</div>





<div><br></div><div>The only difference I see is that your change turns int=
o a pull request, rather than going live automatically. I think this is a g=
ood thing. It&#39;s exactly what is needed to make sure a wiki doesn&#39;t =
wither away into a disorganized mess.</div>





<div><br></div><div>Have you tried <a href=3D"http://ocaml.org" target=3D"_=
blank">ocaml.org</a> for whatever purpose you&#39;re thinking? Has it not m=
et your needs in some way? Let us know. It would be better to accommodate w=
hat you need in <a href=3D"http://ocaml.org" target=3D"_blank">ocaml.org</a=
>, rather than fragmenting content to another site.</div>
