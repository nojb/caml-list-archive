Subject: [Caml-list] LINEARITY 2014: Second Call for Papers

[We apologize if you have received multiple copies of this message]

==============================================================================

            Second Call for Papers

   Third International Workshop on Linearity

          http://vsl2014.at/linearity/

                July 13, 2014
               Vienna, Austria

Submission deadline: April 13, 2014

An associated event of  the Joint meeting of the 23rd EACSL Annual
Conference on Computer Science Logic (CSL) and the 29th ACM/IEEE 
Symposium on Logic  in Computer Science (LICS), as part   of  the 
Vienna   Summer   of  Logic.
==============================================================================
Aim and Scope
-------------

Ever since the birth of Girard's linear logic, there has been a stream 
of research where linearity is a key issue, covering both theoretical 
topics and applications to several  areas of Computer Science, such as 
work on  proof technology, complexity classes and more recently quantum 
computation, program analysis, expressive operational semantics, linear 
programming languages, and techniques for program   transformation, 
update analysis and efficient implementation.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are 
currently developing theory and applications of linear calculi, to 
foster their interaction and provide a forum for presenting new ideas 
and work in progress, and enable newcomers to learn about current 
activities in this area.
Linearity is a key feature in both theoretical and practical approaches 
to computer science, and the goal of this workshop is to present work 
exploring linearity both in theory and practice.

Topics of interest include new results that make central use of 
linearity, ranging from foundational work to applications in any field, 
are welcome. Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may 
examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing 
theories and practices.  Specifically, topics of interest include, but 
are not limited to:

  * sub-linear logics
  * linear term calculi
  * linear type systems
  * linear proof-theory
  * linear programming languages
  * applications to concurrency
  * interaction-based systems
  * verification of linear systems
  * quantum models of computation
  * biological and chemical models of computation


Important Dates
---------------
  * April 13, 2014: Submission deadline
  * May   10, 2014: Author notification
  * May   28, 2014: Deadline for final versions of accepted papers
  * July  13, 2014: Workshop


Submission and Publication
--------------------------
Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract (8  pages max) 
describing original ideas and recent results not published nor submitted 
elsewhere, or a 5-page  abstract presenting relevant work that  has been 
or will be published elsewhere, or work in progress. Preliminary 
proceedings will be available at the  workshop. Papers should  be 
written in English, and submitted in PostScript or PDF format, using the 
EPTCS style files. Submission is through the Easychair website:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=linearity2014

After the workshop, authors of the extended abstracts will be invited to 
submit a long version of  their work (typically a 15-pages paper) for 
publication in EPTCS. These submission will undergo a second round of 
referring. Furthermore, we envision publication of a special issue of a 
journal
after the event.
