Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml script on windows (was Re: [ANN] React 1.0.0)



Le samedi, 12 avril 2014 =C3=A0 00:33, David Allsopp a =C3=A9crit :

> Windows can't do anything with that. However, most people compiling OCaml=
 packages on Windows expect to use bash (either from Cygwin or MSYS), where=
 the scripts would run as on Unix. Are you sure that Windows compatibility =
is already a problem?

No, I just thought that you wouldn't get a shell on windows. So maybe you a=
re right, nothing needs to be done, reports welcome.

That being said with an ocaml rewrite I'd abstract the thing a little bit m=
ore to make it more DRY (I deliberately prevented myself of doing that in s=
h: possible but guaranteed to become un-rereadable once you figured out the=
 magic invocations)
=20=20
> s long as you don't do anything exotic with command line parameters (quot=
ing can be very weird for the Windows command processor, cmd, which is what=
 Sys.command uses) then yes, Sys.command will be fine, and the same as on U=
nix.

Ok and ocamlbuild is ocamlbuild not ocamlbuild.exe ?

> In passing, it does have to be said that getting Windows support automati=
cally from your build system is something that OASIS does...
At an unacceptable time cost, level of complexity and insulation from your =
build system=E2=80=A6 oasis maybe fine if you distribute a single package a=
nd have time to loose fighting with the system. It's not when you formally =
release a dozen of packages (and plan to release more).=20=20

At the risk of repeating myself I need simple, reliable, efficient release =
and packaging workflows: right now if I need to perform a 5 min administrat=
ive task on each of my released packages that's already an hour of my time =
that is gone and I hate admin tasks. So it turns out that in *my* case, I'm=
 very well served by opam .install files, ocamlbuild and a 100 loc, trivial=
, shell script [1] that I hope I'll be able to kill if we once get a good b=
uild system that has decent packaging support and handles .install file gen=
eration for me.

Best,

Daniel
