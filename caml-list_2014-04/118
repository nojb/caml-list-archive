IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract submission         April 25, 2014
Paper submission            May 2, 2014
Notification of acceptance  May 30, 2014
Camera ready versions       June 20, 2014
Workshop WWV 2014           July 18, 2014


SCOPE

The Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems
(WWV, http://users.dsic.upv.es/grupos/elp/wwv/) is a yearly workshop
that aims at providing an interdisciplinary forum to facilitate the
cross-fertilization and the advancement of hybrid methods that exploit
concepts and tools drawn from rule-based programming, formal methods,
software engineering and Web-oriented research.

Nowadays, many companies and institutions have diverted their Web sites
into interactive, completely automated, Web-based applications for areas
such as e-business, e-learning, e-government and e-health. The increased
complexity and the explosive growth of Web systems has made their design
and implementation a challenging task.
Systematic, formal approaches to their specification and verification
can permit to address the problems of this specific domain by means of
automated and effective techniques and tools.

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not
limited to:
- Rule-based approaches to Web system analysis, certification,
   specification, verification and optimization
- Languages and models for programming and designing Web systems
- Formal methods for describing and reasoning about Web systems
- Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems
- Analysis and verification of linked data
- Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to the
   semantic Web
- Middleware and frameworks for composition and orchestration of Web
   services
- Software Product Line Engineering for Web systems
- Feature-oriented modeling and variability analysis of Web systems


SUBMISSION

We solicit the submission of original and unpublished contributions not
under review for publication elsewhere, which include full papers and
short papers.

- Full (regular) papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS-style
format and they should not exceed 15 pages (typeset 11 points). All
accepted papers will be included in the proceedings.
- Short papers are concerned with work-in-progress or tool papers and
they should not exceed 6 pages. Short papers might not be included in
the proceedings (a selection is invited for the proceedings).

All contributions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers, chosen
by the Program Committee. Contributions should be submitted through the
EasyChair online submission system in PDF format.
Submission of a paper involves a firm commitment that at least one of
the authors will attend and participate in the workshop in case the
paper is accepted.


PUBLICATION

All accepted regular papers will be included in the proceedings, which
will be published as a volume of the EPTCS series (WWV publication is
indexed in DBLP and Microsoft Academic Research, among other important
repositories). Selected short papers will be invited to the proceedings.

An open call for a special issue of a high-quality journal on the topic
of the WWV workshop is envisaged. This has been common practice for WWV
since 2009.

The previous 9 editions of WWV attracted high-quality papers that were
published in ENTCS (WWV'05, WWV'07 and WWV'08), by IEEE (WWV'06) and in
EPTCS (WWV'11, WWV'12 and WWV'13).
After WWV'09, a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation on
the topics of the WWV was organized. Similarly, a special issue of the
Journal of Applied Logic was organized after WWV'10 and special issues
of the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming were organized after
WWV'11, WWV'12 and WWV'13.
