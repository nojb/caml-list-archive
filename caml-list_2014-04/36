I don't want to comment on the other things mentionned in this thread; I
only want to remind that these values cannot be used to extrapolate
anything. 

Probably the main thing (and I'm sure some will disagree with this) is
that haskellers tend to create more "buzz" and be more vocal. As far as
I can tell it's something few ocamlers are interested in doing or
getting the results of (i.e. sudden increases in new people and this can
be quite taxing for people active in the community).

Btw, don't get me wrong: I don't see this as something bad and I wish
ocamlers were a bit better at it but it seems to be mostly fit people.

Btw, the #ocaml IRC channel has gotten much bigger over the years, from
60 to 80 around 5 years ago (I'd have to check logs) to 200 currently.
As a channel operator, I'm happy there isn't too much noise and drama
there (though there have been some for sure) and that I can follow the
channel even at work while this is not the case for some other channels.
