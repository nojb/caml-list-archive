4th Workshop on Cryptography, Robustness, and Provably Secure Schemes
for Female Young Researchers (CrossFyre)

July 3-4, 2014
Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany
http://wiki.crypto.rub.de/CrossFyre/

*****************************************************************
Extended Abstract/Registration Deadline: May 16, 2014
*****************************************************************

Horst Görtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr University Bochum will
organize the fourth International Workshop on Cryptography, Robustness,
and Provably Secure Schemes for Female Young Researchers (CrossFyre).
This 2-day workshop will be held at Blue Square (of Ruhr University),
Bochum, Germany, on 3-4 July 2014, with the support and funding of
UbiCrypt (DFG Research Training Group GRK 1817/1) and Microsoft Research.

This workshop aims to bring female researchers in the field of
Cryptography and Information Security together to promote their research
topics and their careers as women in science and engineering. We hope to
encourage a tighter cooperation between women in Cryptography and
Information Security, and to motivate joint papers. In this spirit, you
are kindly invited to attend and give a short presentation of your
research topic to your fellow participants.

Though the workshop is primarily aimed at female researchers, male
researchers are also invited to take part.

We also welcome undergraduate students to this workshop and strongly
encourage supervisors to support participation, be it passive (mainly
listening) or active (all students are encouraged to submit abstracts
and give talks during the workshop).

Format:
 * 2 key-note talks,
 * Fellow researchers introducing themselves: selected fields in
cryptography, security, robustness, provable security etc. are briefly
outlined,
 * A plenary discussion on positions and perspectives of women in research

IMPORTANT: A few grants will be awarded for those students who are
presenting and least able to attend.

Important dates:
-- May 16, 2014: Deadline for extended abstract of your talk
-- May 30, 2014: Notification for grant applicants + Announcement of the
program
-- July 3-4, 2014: CrossFyre workshop

Disclaimer: This workshop aims at bringing women together to discuss
their career opportunities, make contacts, and exchange experiences. The
workshop does NOT intend to discriminate men. Male researchers are of
course welcome to attend.
