                         ======== TFP 2014 ===========

15th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
May 26-28, 2014
Utrecht University
Soesterberg, The Netherlands
http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/TFP2014/WebHome

Registration is now open for the symposium on Trends in Functional
Programming (TFP). It is an international forum for researchers with 
interests
in all aspects of functional programming, taking a broad view of current 
and
future trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for 
presenting
the latest research results. Submission for TFP is now closed, and the 
complete
programme (29 presentations and two invited talks) for TFP can be 
perused here:

    http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/TFP2014/PresentationSchedule

TFP 2014 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming events.
The other is the International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming
in Education (TFPIE). TFPIE will take place on May 25th. Its website is 
located
at http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/ . The submission deadline for TFPIE
is April 21, 2014.


INVITED SPEAKERS

TFP is pleased to announce talks by the following two invited speakers:

John Hughes of Chalmers, Goteborg, Sweden, is well-known as author of
Why Functional Programming Matters, and as one of the designers of 
QuickCheck
(together with Koen Claessen); the paper on QuickCheck won the
ICFP Most Influential Paper Award in 2010. Currently he divides his time 
between
his professorship and Quviq, a company that performs property-based 
testing of
software with a tool implemented in Erlang.

Geoffrey Mainland received his PhD from Harvard University where he was
advised by Greg Morrisett and Matt Welsh. After a two year postdoc with the
Programming Principles and Tools group at Microsoft Research Cambridge, 
he is
now an assistant professor at Drexel University. His research focuses on
high-level programming language and runtime support for non-general purpose
computation.
