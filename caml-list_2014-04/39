Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Activating wiki on ocaml github

Thanks for taking the time to explain your thoughts.

I've tried to read carefully and I summarise your main points to be:
(1) some form of centralization of information is good/desired and
(2) it should be possible for anyone to contribute to it

I agree that the above two things are important but imho you haven't specif=
ically explained why a *wiki* is the right solution.  The one point that st=
ands out is that it may feel more socially acceptable to submit incomplete =
content to a wiki, whereas it may not feel the same for a 'website'.  I can=
 assure you that there is plenty of content on ocaml.org that could be impr=
oved (cf the tutorials section [1]) and in any case, having a lot of incomp=
lete content on the internet is exactly one of the things you describe as a=
 problem (finding outdated/incorrect information).  Every other point you r=
aise is already catered for by the current set up of ocaml.org.  Some speci=
fic things I'd like to highlight are:

- The PR process already works for (large) code bases so it seems odd to cl=
aim that such a system may not work for written content. People can even go=
 through that process entirely in their browser if they wish.

- Discussions happen on PRs, which are based on specific issues. Everyone p=
articipating gets email notifications and can keep up on (a) just the thing=
s they're discussing or (b) can follow the whole repo.  This isn't really m=
uch different to a 'talk' page on a wiki and latency only comes down to a (=
usually busy) human, not the software.

- The questions you ask yourself as a contributor are true of any submissio=
n to pretty much anything on the internet. As ocaml.org gets approx 7k hits=
 per week and people are responsive in the PRs, I'd say all three of your q=
uestions are answered with a 'yes'.

In general I disagree with the idea that wikis (specifically) are part of a=
 thriving ecosystem of a language.  Ruby-lang.org has no wiki but anyone ca=
n submit a PR to the site itself [2].  Python.org does *not* allow such cha=
nges to it's main site, therefore they do have a wiki for 'user generated' =
content [3].  Both are successful languages with very large user bases.  I =
also had a quick look at Erlang where there's no wiki nor the ability to ch=
ange the website and Haskell just has a wiki, as I'm sure everyone here kno=
ws.  The important thing for a thriving community is that it has places whe=
re it can gather and share knowledge.  For OCaml, a list of those places ca=
n be found at http://ocaml.org/community/ and the site's content itself can=
 be improved by anyone.

I have a question for you (and anyone else interested in this).  Why do you=
 feel that ocaml.org is *not* the right place to put the kind of informatio=
n you're describing?  I'd love to see some content there on some of the typ=
e theory or other such topics.  There are even great blog posts by others t=
hat I'd like to import as articles e.g Polymorphism for beginners [4].

If you (or anyone) is not using the site, please say why and we can collect=
ively work to improve it.

[3] https://wiki.python.org

Best wishes,

t this to r/haskell's 15,000 subscribers and ~60 users on the page at a tim=
e, and you get a sense of the user ratio. If we say only 1/20th of ocaml us=
ers are on r/ocaml, we get around 30,000 users in the world (very rough fig=

many of these users are active participants in the community? Out of those,=
 how many feel confident enough to contribute to documentation? Out of thos=
e, how many find the time? You quickly whittle it down to very few people.
>=20

myself:=20

se on one front, you make the most of what you have as well as grow that ba=
se, since new users looking into ocaml will find their answers easily.
>=20

riously, that's the best place for it to be. However, it doesn't seem to me=
 that the process that currently exists for markdown files can suit a wiki-=
type repository. Here are the features of a wiki:
> - Easily modifiable. This is huge. The barrier to contribution is very lo=
w. And while it's not so bad for ocaml.org, I don't see how the PR process =
can scale up to many users constantly modifying, and then modifying each ot=
hers' modifications.
> - Supports discussions. Serious wikis have a discussion tab for every pag=
e, where you can discuss what should be on the page itself. This fosters a =
back-and-forth exchange of ideas. I don't see how ocaml.org can support thi=
s currently. The PR process simply introduces too much latency.

ranch out from there. If I need to link to another topic, I just type the t=
opic's name the link appears. To what degree does the ocaml.org infrastruct=
ure support this kind of ad-hoc restructuring and linking?
> - Incomplete content. In a wiki, I don't care if the page I just wrote is=
 only partially complete. I can lay out the page in pseudocode style, knowi=
ng that I (or someone else) can come later and fix up whatever needs fixing=
. It's a constantly evolving platform. The PR review process on ocaml.org b=
y definition means that you can't really do that. Even if we remove the req=
uirement for a page to be 'complete' in some sense of the word (which is un=
likely), the very existence of a review process and a PR means that I won't=
 submit my page until I feel it's ready -- it's a human psychology thing.=20
>=20
> Bottom line: I think it would be a very big positive step for us to have =
a central wiki *somewhere*. If it can be done with ocaml.org that's great. =
If not, though I'm not crazy about github's wikis (I don't know for example=
 if they have discussion support, or if they bypass PRs), I think it makes =
sense to either have it off of the ocaml/ocaml repository or in an ocaml/oc=
aml-wiki repository of its own. This needs to be the main wiki ie. other th=
ings like compiler-hacking/compiler-internals etc should be on this wiki, u=
nless you deliberately don't want the ocaml community to find your informat=
ion (e.g. if it's proprietary).
