The purpose of ATVA is to promote research on theoretical and practical
aspects of automated analysis, verification and synthesis by providing
an international forum for interaction among the researchers in academia
and industry.

SCOPE OF INTEREST:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
ATVA 2014 solicits high quality submissions in areas related to the theory =
and
practice of automated analysis and verification of hardware and software sy=
stems.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
Formalisms for modeling hardware, software and embedded systems
. Specification and verification of finite-state, infinite-state
and parameterized system
. Program analysis and software verification
. Analysis and verification of hardware circuits, systems-on-chip
and embedded systems
. Analysis of real-time, hybrid, timed, priced/weighted and probabilistic s=
ystems
. Deductive, algorithmic, compositional, and abstraction/refinement techniq=
ues
for analysis and verification
. Analytical techniques for safety, security, and dependability
. Testing and runtime analysis based on verification technology
. Synthesis and Games
. Analysis and verification of parallel and concurrent hardware/software sy=
stems
. Verification in industrial practice
. Applications and case studies
Theory papers should preferably be motivated by practical problems, and
applications should be based on sound theory and should solve problems of
practical interest.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
ATVA invites research contributions in two categories: Regular research
papers (with 15 pages page limit) and tool papers (with 4 pages page limit).
Contributions must be written in English and in LNCS format, and must
present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere
(conferences or journals). The proceedings of ATVA 2014 will be
be published by Springer as a volume in the series of Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS). A special journal issue is also being planned
for selected papers.
