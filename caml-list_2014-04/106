Daniel isn't constructing a new build system though -- he's using
ocamlbuild to take care of that.  He's simply looking for an efficient
*packaging* system to redistribute his code and take care of the metadata.

And autotools really does represent the worst of the approaches to me,
having spent years digging through hundreds of thousands of lines of
generated shell scripts to figure out why some obscure libtool option
isn't working on OpenBSD.  By generating the code and committing it,
chances are that it'll be very hard to regenerate in the future.  We've
already seen hints of this in OASIS with the minor incompatibility in
its generated code with OCaml 4.0+, which took us about 4 months of
bulk builds and cajoling upstream maintainers to get rid of the last
vestiges of.  Not really OASIS's fault (bugs happen), but the basic
architecture of "follow the autotools philosophy" causes this.

I do like the fact that I can glance at Daniel's repositories and
understand what's going on in minutes rather than days...
