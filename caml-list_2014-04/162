Handcrafting VMs for dynamic languages: reality and dreams,=20
Vyacheslav Egorov, Google
This is a story of what happens when the art of VM construction meets=20
development constraints. This is a first-person narrative about my experien=
ce=20
with the V8 and Dart virtual machines, fundamental engineering decisions, a=
nd=20
their implications. I will try to show how production VMs are treading the =
thin=20
line between "practical reality" and "dreams of academia". Finally I intend=
=20
to share my own dreams on how ideas borrowed from academia could help to=20
solve practical issues in VM-construction.


Overview
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
The ICOOOLPS workshop series brings together researchers and practitioners
working in the field of OO languages implementation and optimization.
ICOOOLPS key goal is to identify current and emerging issues relating to the
efficient implementation, compilation and optimization of such languages, a=
nd
outlining future challenges and research directions.

Topics of interest for ICOOOLPS include, but are not limited to:
implementation of fundamental OO and OO-like features (e.g. inheritance,
parametric types, memory management, objects, prototypes), runtime systems
(e.g. compilers, linkers, virtual machines, garbage collectors),
optimizations (e.g. static or dynamic analyses, adaptive virtual machines),
resource constraints (e.g. time for real-time systems, space or low-power f=
or
embedded systems) and relevant choices and tradeoffs (e.g. constant time vs.
non-constant time mechanisms, separate compilation vs. global compilation,
dynamic loading vs. global linking, dynamic checking vs. proof-carrying
code...).


Submissions
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
ICOOOLPS is not a mini-conference; it is a workshop designed to facilitate
discussion and the exchange of ideas between peers. ICOOOLPS therefore
welcomes both position (1=974 pages) and research (max. 10 pages) papers.
Position papers should outline interesting or unconventional ideas, which
need not be fully fleshed out. Research papers are expected to contain more
complete ideas, but these need not necessarily be fully complete as with a
traditional conference. Authors will be given the option to publish their
papers (short or long) in the ACM Digital Library if they wish.

Submissions must be written in English, formatted according to ACM SIG
Proceedings style. Please submit via EasyChair (link on the ICOOOLPS
website).
