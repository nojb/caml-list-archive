Subject: [Caml-list] Vacancies: Two New HIPERFIT PhD Scholarships Available

--089e01536864efc64404f713bb89
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

The HIPERFIT Research Center seeks two new excellent PhD students for
working within the area of High-Performance Functional Programming.

Below follows some more detailed information about the scholarships;
see also the announcement at the HIPERFIT home page:

  http://hiperfit.dk/news/2014/03/28/two-new-hiperfit-phd-scholarships/

For information about the application procedure, and the scholarships
in general, please consult the general announcement available at


http://www.diku.dk/english/about/vacancies/phd_scholar_cs_call_spring_2014/

The application deadline is April 22, 2014 (23:59, timezone: LINT =
UTC+14).

Best Regards,

On behalf of HIPERFIT,
Martin Elsman
HIPERFIT Manager, Associate Professor

PhD scholarship(s) in High-Performance Functional Programming.

The PhD student will be working in the Research Center for Functional
High-Performance Computing for Financial Information Technology
(http://www.hiperfit.dk). The PhD scholarship is funded by the Danish
Council
for Strategic Research and will be carried out at DIKU in formal
collaboration with the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the
Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen and several finance
it-partners in the Copenhagen area.

The objective of the PhD project is to develop, implement and evaluate
techniques related to executing, efficiently and safely, high-level,
functional specifications of both numeric and symbolic computations on
modern, highly parallel computational platforms such as multi- and
many-core CPUs, GPGPUs and FPGAs.

The candidate must - in addition to the qualifications listed above -
have a solid academic background in the relevant areas of computer
science, as demonstrated by academic courses and project/thesis work
related to several of the following areas: Functional programming,
programming language theory, and compilers. Experience with either
high-performance computing, mathematical finance, domain-specific
language or parallel algorithms is desirable, but not required.

The position is available from 1 July 2014 or as soon as possible
thereafter.
