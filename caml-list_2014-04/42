 Ruby (as a community) seems to have stuck with the current approach of oca=
ml.org, while python has an extensible wiki. As a result, python has a much=
 deeper, richer coverage of articles. Just look at https://wiki.python.org/=
moin/UsefulModules or https://wiki.python.org/moin/Applications for example=
s. Giving users a centralized, free-form avenue to collect knowledge can be=
 very effective. Having the information accessible in one location means th=
at the information is not ephemeral, and that users can find it whenever th=
ey want to.
>=20
> ocaml.org currently doesn't provide that avenue.

You're ascribing the coverage/depth/richness/etc of articles to the fact th=
at Python has a wiki but there's actually no way to know if this is really =
true.  That it's wiki may have had very little to do with it.  My point in =
using these examples was that Python does not allow anyone to edit their ma=
in site whereas Ruby does, hence it would appear that the the Ruby communit=
y didn't feel the need to create one.  That Ruby doesn't have a wiki hasn't=
 diminished it's popularity or the ability of people to learn about it and =
there are lots (and lots) of resources on the web.  Just because they're no=
t under 'ruby-lang' does not make them ephemeral.


> First of all, the hierarchy of articles is flat. All of the articles are =
lumped together under the heading 'tutorials' when that label doesn't neces=
sarily fit many of them. I would much rather see a 'Knowledge Base' area, w=
ith articles organized by hierarchies with many-to-many mappings of levels =
to articles. Second, think of how the 'Useful Modules' python article start=
ed out: it was probably pretty empty to begin with, and slowly built up ove=
r time as more users contributed. We need an avenue for knowledge that accu=
mulates gradually. A 'compiler internals' article will start out mostly emp=
ty, as nobody has the time to cover all of it, but it'll fill up over time.=
=20

As mentioned before, if the current structure doesn't seem to be working, t=
hen it should improve.  There's absolutely no rule which says items must li=
ve under 'tutorials' and as mentioned, this part of the site is in need of =
attention anyway.

Also, we don't need to speculate about the page you link to.  The first com=
mit is at: https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules?action=3Drecall&rev=
=3D1 (login required - spoiler: it started off with 14 entries in 2005 - th=
ere are now around 88 entries inc links to elsewhere).  Please be aware tha=
t the entire ocaml.org site would also have started out page by page in a s=
imilar fashion.  For example the meetings page [1] is pretty basic but over=
 time it could become a great resource by accumulating ical event feeds, re=
ports, etc.  The videos and media page [2] is certainly not 'complete' eith=
er but has the potential to put lots more information in front of the thous=
ands of visitors the site gets.  Whether it's a wiki or a static site, cont=
ent still needs curation and building features means it can happen automati=
cally.

[1] http://ocaml.org/meetings/
[2] http://ocaml.org/community/media.html


> Now, I've started implementing a 'Kowledge Base' article under 'Docs', on=
 the site, but this is currently a mostly empty article with little informa=
tion, and I don't know if you'll want to publish it. So Ashish's suggestion=
 of using the github wiki makes more sense, although really, my ideal would=
 be something like a 'wiki.ocaml.org', where the wiki is a proper wikimedia=
-style wiki, much like wiki.python.org or wiki.xenproject.org.
>=20
> In my opinion, there's room for both the structured articles currently on=
 ocaml.org and a less rigid, evolving centralized wiki. We have the former,=
 but not the latter.

Xen Project is another place where users cannot edit the site itself, so th=
e wiki is where user input goes.=20=20

Overall, I get the feeling that your arguments start with the fact that you=
 want a wiki but the things you state in support of it are just as applicab=
le to the current site.  The one thing that does stand out is the ability t=
o create work-in-progress content to share with others.  I like Ashish's su=
ggestion of using the github wiki and as he pointed out, you (or anyone) ca=
n immediately begin putting content there, structuring it however you feel =
appropriate.=20

 (usually busy) human, not the software.
>=20

 questions are answered with a 'yes'.
>=20
> In general I disagree with the idea that wikis (specifically) are part of=
 a thriving ecosystem of a language.  Ruby-lang.org has no wiki but anyone =
can submit a PR to the site itself [2].  Python.org does *not* allow such c=
hanges to it's main site, therefore they do have a wiki for 'user generated=
' content [3].  Both are successful languages with very large user bases.  =
I also had a quick look at Erlang where there's no wiki nor the ability to =
change the website and Haskell just has a wiki, as I'm sure everyone here k=
nows.  The important thing for a thriving community is that it has places w=
here it can gather and share knowledge.  For OCaml, a list of those places =
can be found at http://ocaml.org/community/ and the site's content itself c=
an be improved by anyone.
>=20
> I have a question for you (and anyone else interested in this).  Why do y=

Seriously, that's the best place for it to be. However, it doesn't seem to =
me that the process that currently exists for markdown files can suit a wik=
i-type repository. Here are the features of a wiki:

a back-and-forth exchange of ideas. I don't see how ocaml.org can support t=

 branch out from there. If I need to link to another topic, I just type the=

 by definition means that you can't really do that. Even if we remove the r=

unlikely), the very existence of a review process and a PR means that I won=
