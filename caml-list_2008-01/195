My problem with ocamlfind is that it takes too much control over me. =20
Also it doesn't help you with the tedious publishing aspect (which I =20
try to mitigate by using news feeds) and it won't help you with the =20
binary update problem.

Yes of course. But the point is that we already have a decentralized =20
system. All these tarballs that are referenced from the hump and not =20
part of godi. My aim is to be able to quickly install or publish such =20=

decentralized bits. Currently these two tasks take too much time: =20
using them, because everyone does it its own way, publishing them, =20
because you have to devise your own way (make a readme, think about =20
how to structure the tarball how to manage releases, announce on the =20
mailing list, etc.). The idea is to simplify all this uninteresting =20
business to entice people to share their modules. Lowering the bar may =20=

mean a decrease in quality but in the end good modules and reliable =20
publishers will be identified by the community.

Also note that the proposal in itself doesn't prevent the development =20=

of a more authoritative, centralized and stable source of packages.

If the aim is to support an operating system I completly agree with =20
you. But the aim of my proposal is to support the ocaml development =20
bazaar which is not the same thing.

That's not what I say. The _if_ of the last sentence is for when you =20
are developing an ocaml library with dependencies in that case your =20
project may become a package. If you are making an end-user =20
application this should not be used as a distribution mechanism, I =20
explicitly say that in the proposal, it is a tool for ocaml =20
_developers_. But still from a developer perspective it is a good =20
thing to have a mechanical way to track the external dependencies of =20
your project whether this is an end-user application or not, hence =20
packages should be (conceptually) managed per project.

Best,
