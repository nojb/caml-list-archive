Would it not be much easier and much more productive to simply fork the OCaml 
distribution and address these issues at source? You could then address many 
other issues like improving the stdlib, adding a "try..finally" construct to 
the language, adding features to help with the brittle binding problem and 
opening the compiler's internal representations to the outside world.
