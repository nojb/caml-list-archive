Yes. Thanks for the link.

Sure. I don't see a clear preference for either myself.

Flamewars may be a waste of time but I don't see that as a flamewar. The idea 
of using software written in Haskell (darcs) because OCaml has none and 
Haskell is a related language seems nice but several darcs users have said 
here that it is really broken and unusable. I've never used it myself but 
I've certainly heard that a lot elsewhere and few people use darcs anyway.

Given that many people want to use the vanilla OCaml distribution from INRIA 
but many other people want to use improved versions, I only ask that future 
work provide for both. If the distribution is to be source-based with 
automatic recompilation then this should be quite easy: we have two roots for 
the distribution, one providing INRIA's raw OCaml and the other providing a 
dressed up alternative that the community can develop.

Would everyone be happy with that?
