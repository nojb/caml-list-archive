I had found similar problems on Solaris 64-Bit machines during a project
where I was involved and had permission to use OCaml by the teamleader.
(Normally Perl and C was used).


The answer I got to the question, was, that INRIA has no 64-Bit machines
and therefore the support is not included so far.

During the Linux day in Berlin in 2007, I asked Sun-people
(developers and others) about OCaml. They denied and tried to convince
me that Java is such a good language.

I did not expect that they deny modern technology ;-(


If you can convince INRIA to get the 64-Bit Sun-machines
or Sun to offer them at university-possible prices,
the situation might change.

But the information I  had also is older, I think it was in
the beginning of 2007, so is one year old.

The platform I was working on was a Sun Fire E4900.
At that time in that project they also had some changes to go
from 32-Bit Solaris with 64-Bit emulation to the true 64-Bit version.
But the admin told me, I already were using the 64-Bit stuff,
so that then was the reason to ask here (or possibly I wrote
a bugreport; do not remember) on that problem.
And I got the answer I explained above: no hardware there
to have the support.


Ciao,
   Oliver
