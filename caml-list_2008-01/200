Why not take a Bittorrent style approach to decentralization?  Given that a
package format is agreed upon, you can download a small file that has basic
info such as an MD5 sum.  Every person has a P2P-style client that caches
any packages they've downloaded, and when you download a new package, pulls
from everybody who has a copy with the same MD5 sum, and after it is
downloaded it is offered for redistribution.  Updates could simply search
for all users who are offering the old version and alert them that there is
a new version.  Any dependencies will be offered at least as much as the
packages that depend on them.

That eliminates the single point of failure at least.
