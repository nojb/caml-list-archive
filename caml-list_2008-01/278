Oh, an unusual way ;-)

Oaaaaahhhr, yes.
Thanks for the hint.

Normally I read the data complete.
This time I did not (because I only want 1KB
for my Digest). That was, what I have overseen.

[...]

Because the type that both functions accept are the same,
there should be no problem to use one for the other...
... what's the exit value of a process, that is no process? ;-)
So, channels have some hidden values that take care of
process issues...?!
