I'm inclined to agree.  I would even go as far as saying that the lack of
Qt bindings is perhaps the biggest open sore as far as Ocaml library support
is concerned.

The guys at Trolltech, however, seem quite keen on having Qt on as many
platforms as possible (Qt-Jambi, which brings Qt to the JVM is one of their
products).  Couldn't this whole auto-generation of bindings be made easier
if they got involved?  I am sure they already have plenty of tools in
place to facilitate it.  Even if they were not to commit actual manpower
to the effort, they might still be able to help.

And incidentally, the afore mentioned Qt-Jambi, together with the Ocamljava
project might provide a last-resort solution in the absence of native bindings.
Another possibility might be the Qyoto/Kimono project (which brings Qt/KDE
into .net) together with the OcamlIL project (if it's still alive).  You would
then use Mono to run Ocaml programmes.

cheers,
Dario
