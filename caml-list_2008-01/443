This is the prerogative of the library author(s), not the
distribution.  The distribution might only accept and redistribute
software with a given license (a very bad idea, IMO), or suggest a
license to those authors who are on the fence, but in the end it's the
authors' choice.

And you can't reasonably expect an outside author to care about
providing preferential licensing to members of the Caml Consortium.

As a strawman, I'd suggest following the Debian Free Software
Guidelines ( http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines )

A final comment: I think (specialized) mailing lists, with archives,
are better for these kinds of discusion than Wikis.
