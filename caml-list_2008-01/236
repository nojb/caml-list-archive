In other words, Jon: if you tried to sell me source-code-less libraries, I 
simply wouldn't buy, and no amount of persuading could change that. I'd still 
keep buying your books, though :)

Just look at what happened to scores of Delphi and OCX controls which became 
abandonware, and how much of this stuff eventually had to be simply 
reimplemented by the same people who originally bought the controls not to 
implement them in the first place. I detest closed-source controls and 
libraries, I simply don't use them. The whole idea of "here's the OCX and a 
typelib, and a help file, take it or leave it" is preposterous. Well, maybe 
it's fine if you're being contracted for a one-off job where the payee has no 
clue, and your morals don't seem to interfere -- sure then you can reuse all 
the source-less crap you want. But as a part of a long term strategy? No way.

If there was one decision Trolls made right, it was to include the source 
code.

Cheers, Kuba
