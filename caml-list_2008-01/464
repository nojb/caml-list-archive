I am not sure that i understand you. "Community distribution" should
just be "INRIA-Ocaml" + some others libraries. I am really not sure that
anyone talk about anything else. In other word, what have been talked
about is that ocaml INRIA distribution will stay as is, but people can
take it to put it into the center of a larger distribution.

If i read you well, you are thinking that we can change things inside
ocaml INRIA distribution. That is not true. And anyway, if such a thing
should happen, you will see a change in INRIA license, that will permit
you to do so. For now, this is not the case.

Sorry if i didn't catch your point.
