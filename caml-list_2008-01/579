Sylvain Le Gall has announced at the meeting that he would provide a
server with basic development tools. I think it would be pertinent to
host such projects there.
(Moreover, sourceforge is not free, baah :p )
But I don't know how his server-building is going.

More generally, I totally agree on the "get things done" idea.
I'm willing to help in the camlp4 area. A common place for up-to-date
camlp4 extensions (akin to what martin jambon provides for ocaml <=
3.09) would be a very good thing.
