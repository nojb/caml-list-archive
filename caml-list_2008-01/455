I agree that this is an excellent point that needs to be seriously
considered.  I'm not saying that we need to limit people to the license that
they have to choose, I do think that for inclusion in the baseline, the
license should meet a set of minimum specific characteristics.  In the
community that I operate in, licenses are a very serious matter and there
are a tremendous number of packages that I cannot use for different projects
to do this.

At a minimum, the requirement MUST be that the license type and version is
specifically stated and that the requirements of the license are met by the
developer (i.e. GPL and LGPL require that each source file have wording and
a link to the license).

I believe this has a very direct tie into the evolving discussion on the
package management system that is going on.
