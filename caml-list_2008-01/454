Inspired by the existing recommendation on the cocan wiki for I/O, I'd like
to recommend the development of a standard interface for XML processing.
Currently there are many different implementations of XML parsers but their
interfaces are very different and don't allow for easy swapping of
implementations.

On a side note, the development of these recommendations seems to be very
much in the vein of an SRFI in the scheme world, which I think is an
excellent model to follow for these recommendations.  (which doesn't include
the actual mechanics of distribution or package management which seems to be
the bulk of OSR discussion).

I'm willing to start the topic on the wiki but I'm simply going to take an
existing XML processor and start from there.
