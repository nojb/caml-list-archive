        AISC 2008 - 9th International Conference on 
      ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION 
         Theory, Implementations and Applications
           http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/aisc08/
         Birmingham, UK, 31 July - 2 August 2008

	           AISC 2008 is part of the
       Conferences in Intelligent Computer Mathematics
	      http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/
             Birmingham, UK, 26 July-2 August 2008


                       CALL FOR PAPERS

Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation are two views and
approaches for automating problem solving, in particular mathematical
problem solving. The two approaches are based on heuristics and on
mathematical algorithmics, respectively. Artificial Intelligence can
be applied to Symbolic Computation and Symbolic Computation can be
applied to Artificial Intelligence. Hence, a wealth of challenges,
ideas, theoretical insights and results, methods and algorithms arise
in the interaction of the two fields and research
communities. Advanced tools of software technology and system design
are needed and a broad spectrum of applications is possible by the
combined problem solving power of the two fields.

Hence, the conference is in the center of interest and interaction for
various research communities:

    * artificial intelligence,
    * symbolic computation,
    * computer algebra,
    * automated reasoning,
    * formal mathematics,
    * mathematical knowledge management,
    * automated discovery,
    * machine learning,
    * logic,
    * software technology,
    * semantic web technology,
    * computer-based math teaching and didactics,
  
Topics
======
Topics of particular interest of the conference include:

    * AI in Symbolic Mathematical Computing
    * Computer Algebra Systems and Automated Theorem Provers
    * Integration of Logical Reasoning and Computer Algebra
    * Symmetries in AI problems,
    * Engineering, Industrial and Operations Research Applications
    * Foundations and Complexity of Symbolic Computation
    * Mathematical Modeling of Multi-Agent Systems
    * Programming Languages for Symbolic Computation
    * Symbolic Computations for Expert Systems and Machine Learning
    * Implementations of Symbolic Computation Systems
    * Logic and Symbolic Computing
    * Implementation and Performance Issues
    * Intelligent Interfaces
    * Symbolic Techniques for Document Analysis

Papers on other topics with links to the above research fields and
topics will also be welcomed for consideration.

Proceedings
===========

The proceedings of the conference will be published as a volume in the
series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by 
Springer-Verlag. Accepted papers will have to be prepared in LaTeX and
formatted according to the requirements of the Springer's LNAI series 
(the corresponding style files can be downloaded from 
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html and are the same for LNCS 
and LNAI).

Submission
==========

Theoretical and applied research papers on all topics within the scope
of the conference are invited. Submitted papers (in English) must not
exceed 15 pages in length (in the LNCS style). The title page should
contain the title, author(s) with affiliation(s), e-mail address(es),
listing of keywords and abstract plus the topics from the above list
to which the paper is related. The program committee (PC) will subject
all submitted papers to a peer review. Theoretical papers will be 
judged on their originality and contribution to their field, and 
applied papers on the importance and originality of the application.
Results must be original and have not been published elsewhere.

The web page for electronic submission is at:

  http://www.easychair.org/AISC08/

===============

Submission deadline: 24 February 2008
Notification: 23 March 2008
Camera Ready Version: 27 April
