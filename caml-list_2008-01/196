You might take a look at the PLaneT (http://planet.plt-scheme.org/)
system for PLT Scheme.  It's a centralized repository, so not directly
applicable if you stick with your current idea, but they handle the
issues if interdependence and ease of publishing with *extreme*
elegance (from my point of view---I've published a few PLaneT
packages), and I think they have a paper discussing some of the design
issues they've come across.  (The paper is, in fact, here:
http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/04-matthews.pdf .)

Good luck, and have fun at the conference!
