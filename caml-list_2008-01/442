Then I don't understand anymore. So the system is still centralized in =20=

the sense that all port files are under the same vcs at some location. =20=

That is exactly the kind of thing I'd like to avoid.

If you don't have a centralized system, then managing your package's =20
port file is at your discretion. The port file itself should describe =20=

the various versions it provides of the package, their dependencies =20
and where you can find them.

Frankly this is not the average case, please try to solve the average =20=

case, not the baroque ones. If you need to follow a project at the =20
patch level deal directly with the developer's repository. Browse the =20=

hump and try to think about which projects you'd follow at that level =20=

to use in your own projects - dealing with moving targets is annoying.

Besides having such a fine grain will bother both package users (up to =20=

which patch should I pull ?) and package developers (transient issues =20=

due to a user that pulled up to a given patch).

Another thing you may want to consider is that a "released" package =20
may need less (build) dependencies than a direct pull from a =20
repository (e.g. files generated using custom tools, etc.).

A system can always be complexified. I'd rather have something simple =20=

that works. I strongly think the vcs should be kept outside the =20
package management system.

Best,

Daniel
