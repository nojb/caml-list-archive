Hallo,

I'm looking forward to hearing more about the results from yesterday's
meeting (are there minutes?).  In any case, the OSR seems like a very
reasonable process.

I'll start with one thorn: the Unicode situation.  Everyone plus their
mother defines some custom Unicode module.  ExtLib has one, Camomile
has obviously a few, Ocamlnet has its own thing, etc, etc.  It would make
sense to have instead a fairly simple "Unicode" package that defined the
basic data type, and then have all these libs use that one.  I bet this
was discussed yesterday -- what was the conclusion?

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
