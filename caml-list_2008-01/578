I did not see that message in the midst of that thread.  On the one hand, I
don't want to duplicate efforts.  On the other, SourceForge has a host of
development resources available, plus builtin user management, etc.  It
would be nice to have our own site, but there doesn't seem to be much at al=
l
up yet.  I'd be in favor of having something that's working _now_ as oppose=
d
to something that's going the be amazing ... in a few months ... whenever w=
e
get it up ...

Sylvan, what are your thoughts?  The last thing I want is two "competing"
sites...
