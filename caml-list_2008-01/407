The library license is LGPL, so the stdlib could be changed in the
distribution without extra licensing trouble.  However, that is
probably not the way to go if we want to maintain bug-for-bug
compatibility.  For the example you mentioned, ExtLib already has a
tail recursive List.map, so if that were included it (or something
similar) in the official distribution then developers will know that
"open ExtList" will provide them with a tail recursive List.map
implementation without the end user having to install libraries out of
the official distribution.

I do not know the details of the compiler license (QPL) but I think
modifications would have to be distributed as patches and then applied
on the user's end.  I also do not know how this would affect binary
distributions of OCaml.
