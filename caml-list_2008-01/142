 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

The 10th IFIP International Conference on Formal Methods for Open 
Object-based Distributed Systems (FMOODS) is part of the federated 
conferences DisCoTec (Distributed Computing Techniques), together with 
the 10th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages 
(COORDINATION) and the 8th IFIP International Conference on Distributed 
Applications and Interoperable Systems (DAIS). It will be organised by 
the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oslo, Norway.


OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:

Established in 1996, the FMOODS series of conferences aims to provide 
an integrated forum for research on formal aspects of Open Object-based
Distributed Systems. The conference will especially welcome novel
contributions reflecting recent developments in the area, in particular
component- and model-based design, service-oriented computing and 
software quality. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
  
  - Semantics and implementation of object-oriented programming and
    (visual) modelling languages
  - Formal techniques for specification, design, analysis, verification,
    validation and testing
  - Model checking, theorem proving and deductive verification
  - Type systems and behavioural typing
  - Formal methods for service-oriented computing
  - Formal techniques for security and trust in global computing
  - Formalization of runtime system evolution (e.g. dynamic updates, 
    reconfiguration)
  - Multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different views
  - Model transformations and refactorings
  - Integration of quality of service requirements into formal models
  - Formal approaches to component-based design
  - Applications of formal methods (e.g. web services, multimedia, 
    telecommunications)
  - Experience reports on best practices and tools
