Good point. AMD64 gives far better performance than all other platforms any=
way=20
(AFAIK) so people should be using that if they want good performance anyway.

Alain wrote "ocamlnat", an OCaml top-level that uses compilation to native=
=20
code (with dynamic linking) to provide performance competitive with other=20
languages like Lisp and F#. I found this extremely useful for the few month=
s=20
that I used it, although it was a little buggy.
