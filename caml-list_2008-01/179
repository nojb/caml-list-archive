A trivial solution to that is to keep both, as obviously each time an 
equivalent of dlopen() is made, everything has to be rehashed. gperf 
is "slightly" memory-hungry, so surely it'd need to be something using a 
different algorithm. I'm talking hypothetically, but I also think it's a 
weird design decision to use those possibly-colliding hashes. String 
sorting/comparison isn't exactly a CPU killer, so couldn't the original names 
have been used instead? I admit not to knowing too many details of the 
current implementation of course ;(

Cheers, Kuba
