While `get' and `search' are probably OK (I presume that `get' raises
an exception, and `search' returns an option type), we must be
careful.  If multiple functions is the standard, I would prefer that a
naming/variant system be recommended (such as get and get_exn).  If we
come up with clever names for our various functions, I fear the Java
Queue API syndrome (where you can get a value with any of 4 different
functions, and add with another 4, that mostly differ in how they
handle error and thread blocking conditions and the names have little
correlation to the differences).
