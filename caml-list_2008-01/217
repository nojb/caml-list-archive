Hi list,

I've just finished "porting" the venerable OCamlExc to work with OCaml 3.10.0:
mostly a few modified paths and vars in the Makefile and the translation of
interface files using CamlTk with LablTk.

I had also to add on a case-by-case basis some missing stdlib functions
(actually just "fake" ones that has the same type and exceptions raising
than the genuine 3.10.0 stdlib ones) because special versions of the old
stdlib/*.ml files are copied in the OCamlExc distribution with the external
primitive types specifically annotated. I could also have annotated the
current stdlib files, but I just felt it was more work.

The result seems to work quite well and would be much useful, however some
"recent" features like module and signature inclusion (and objects as well)
still lacks and prevent from using OCamlExc on larger softwares.

So I was wondering if there is any current or recent projects (or interests)
to resume OCamlExc development and complete the set of handled constructs,
as I'm afraid I'll have neither the time nor the skills to do the job.

I hope such a precious tool will be included in the official OCaml distribution
one day...

-- Nicolas


P.S. : My packaging abilities are very poor as well, so I'll be glad to provide
the modified OCamlExc files to anyone interested in building a (e.g.) .deb package.
