a) doesn't seem to be an option :
the INRIA won't include in stdlib things they don't want to maintain,
and they don't want to maintain anything more.

I don't think point c) is a really good idea : most people are quite
comfortable with Stdlib now. Do you have *really* good reasons to
create an interface-incompatible library ?
I don't think so : lots of people have expressed concern for the lack
of something in the Stdlib, but i haven't seen anybody actually
complaining about one of the provided functions (except for the
tail-rec thing, wich isn't an incompatible change).
If all the change you want to make are compatible (either addition of
plain new functions/modules, or interface-compatible changes of
existing ones), then i think the "overriding" model of Extlib is fine.
What does -nopervasives give us in that case ?
