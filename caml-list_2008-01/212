As I understand it, OCaml's FFI makes writing Qt bindings an enormous 
undertaking which is why we don't have any.

I'm happy with GTK for now and would rather see OpenGL 2 bindings instead.

I found TrollTech's customer support awful as a customer so I very much doubt 
they will go out of their way to help a really obscure virgin corner of the 
Qt market. That was a few years ago though.

I evaluated various such options recently and decided that Mono is truly awful 
(very poorly written, unreliable and slow) and LLVM is absolutely superb 
(extremely well-written C++ with complete native OCaml bindings!). Moreover, 
Mono appears to have no future in its current form whereas LLVM has serious 
backers and is improving at a tremendous rate.

Even if you don't want to implement a whole new language or backend, using 
LLVM's JIT compilation for code generation has great potential for OCaml, 
e.g. regexps. I highly recommend giving it a play!
