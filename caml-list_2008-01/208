GTK itself is horribly undocumented.  However SooHyoung Oh has done an
excellent job translating the C-based GTK 2.0 tutorial into OCaml,
here:

My requirement is similar to this: (1) to be able to take OCaml
libraries and automatically generate C bindings from them (ie.
translate the OCaml .mli file into a .h file, and generate stubs).
(2) to be able to ship the library as a DLL / .so file.  Efficiency is
not so much of a concern for me - eg. if the generated stubs worked by
copying all strings passed, that would be OK for my requirements.

I actually did a little bit of work on a stub/wrapper generator, and I
think it is possible to implement it, especially now that ocamlopt can
generate PIC.
