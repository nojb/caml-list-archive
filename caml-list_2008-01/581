I am not the kind of guy waiting "a few months" for doing things. In
fact, the host is up and running. It already run a gforge and should be
available to the community (in fact, you can already create a project).

Stefano, Romain and Samuel propose to help me to set it up. For now, i
have worked alone, due to a complicated web/email set up. At this
moment, i am ready to let this three people really help me (since 2
days, i was doing grunt work on the server). 

We have decided to delay the announce of the availability of the server,
because we need some extra test, to check everything is working (list,
bug tracking et al). 

BUT, if you are willing to help, there is some basic task you can do,
who should help us a lot:
* create a scm plugin to gforge to be able to use hg/git/darcs (copy and
 paste the svn/cvs plugin)
* create a nice gforge theme with a caml for the website (i think you can have
 a look at caml.inria.fr)
* later you can help us to test things
* help us to create a "terms and conditions" for the website
* ...

If you don't believe me, go to:
http://www.ocamlcore.org

BUT DON'T REGISTER/ASK FOR PROJECT FOR NOW. I am not sure the site is
working perfectly...

There will be an official annoucement when the whole website will be up
and running.

Contact me privately if you want more information.

Regards,
Sylvain Le Gall
