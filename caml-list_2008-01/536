...meaning that the user has to install *all* possible VCSs on *all* 
machines where an application is to be built? Looks like a maintenance 
nightmare to me.

This is about introducing yet another concept into the package 
management system, which doesn't simplify that at all.

I think the system needs to use the least common denominator as a basic 
transport if we want it to be widely adopted. Which is, I believe, 
HTTP/FTP in today's world.
