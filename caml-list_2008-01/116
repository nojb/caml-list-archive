It it?  I mean, all I ever read into compare was that it returned a 
*consistent* ordering- for example, if a < b and b < c, then a < c.  
Note that a *specific* ordering was ever gaurenteed- and if I wanted a 
specific ordering, I should implement it myself.  It certainly wasn't 
ever gaurenteed that the ordering would be consistent with some other 
(or any other) language.

Ordering arrays based on length is an obvious performance advantage- 
it's an O(1) comparison, independent of the length of the arrays (or the 
cost of comparing two elements of the arrays).

This is indeed unexpected behavior:

    - : int = -1
    # compare [1;2;3] [4;5];;    
    - : int = -1
