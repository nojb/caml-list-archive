At some point, in order to "naturally" use Qt and benefit from its 
performance, the machine translation will be easier than any bindings you 
could think of. IMHO, of course. Qt's code itself will become smaller in 
Ocaml - I've hacked at porting QObject, and so far I've got the line count to 
50% of Trolltech's. And I'm a total noob.
