To make a short summary:

* have a makefile with 4 targets in upstream tarball: opt, byte, clean, install
* have a central repository with all the upstream tarball

That is "keep it simple and stupide" (KISS)! That is great, easy and direct. I
like it.

I think we should add some variable to the makefile to define target
installation et al, but that is technical details. 

The main idea fit to a progressive way of doing. Maybe at the beginning
we should provide the Makefile as and external things (just like GODI).
