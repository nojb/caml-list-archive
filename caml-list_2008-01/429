Exact, however I think that was Berke's humor :)

That's fully right, darcs2 solve a lot of his formers issues.

I'm largely in favor of darcs.

I think that dynamic dependency graph of ocamlbuild could really help.

Yes,  we  have  to  think  about a clean interface to specify versions without
fall into a too much complex system.
