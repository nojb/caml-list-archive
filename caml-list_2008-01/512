It would make sense as a business venture when you'd throw in some economy of 
scale. MS can sell visual studio for peanuts, and keep that business unit out 
of the red, of course because they sell so many.

For relatively small projects like OCaml, any "pay for a feature" scheme would 
necessarily be out of reach of many customers. Maybe Jane Street could afford 
to pay $100/hr consulting rate to a seasoned OCaml hacker, but for most of us 
that makes little financial sense.

I guess it's a big stride to break that small-to-mid-scale barrier. Trolltech 
had done that, and they are IMHO good technical innvoators too. If there was 
a way for some OCaml-centric business to do what Trolltech had done, it could 
probably take off and make very feature-rich OCaml environment available for 
a good price I wouldn't mind paying $1500/year for an OCaml environment that 
could run natively (as in no .net and no Cygwin dependencies) on Windows and 
Linux, and just "do the job". Qt is really nice in that regard: you only need 
the C++ compiler, and everything else is included and ready to go. It even 
builds its own build tools (qmake, moc, uic).

Cheers, Kuba
