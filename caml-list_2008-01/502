If I might just drag economics back in momentarily. :-)

People have mentioned "volunteers" but I think it is worth pointing out that 
this could also be run as a business, with users paying for work that they 
want done. Perhaps a system of charging customers and letting them choose 
what work and which developer would increase overall productivity and be 
relatively easy to implement?

INRIA could doubtless make a lot of money by doing this so I proposed the idea 
to Xavier but he wants to focus on research and not ordinary software 
development and maintainence, of course.
