A few things here:
* we can provide two libraries, one with monads and one without, and let
users choose whichever they use
* it's quite easy to build a generic resource-disposal facility on par
with 'use' or 'try...finally...', even without resorting to Camlp4 -- I
leave that as an exercise to the reader or to the time when we decide to
start an OSR thread on that issue
* in any case, there's no need to change OCaml itself to do any of
these, or even to add a IDisposable interface and an object-oriented
hierarchy, only the distribution.

Let me remind you that the initial topic of the thread was to agree upon
a discussion process, not to debate on a specific issue.

So do we agree on the OSR process as I've described it or does anyone
believe we should first change it ?

Cheers,
 David
