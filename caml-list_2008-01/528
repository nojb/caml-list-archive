Windows has ample support for make and friends at
http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/ - I've happily used make under Windows for
years without resorting to Cygwin. As long as you keep your scripts sane you
can write "portable" OCaml Makefiles that work correctly under *NIX and
Windows using all your favourite shell commands.

I recall that RH Linux (a long time ago, Fedora may be different!), by
default, didn't install make or even a C compiler so a developer using RH
Linux had to choose install these things. There's no conceivable reason why
a Windows developer should expect not to have to install the odd development
tool too in addition to the OCaml compiler.

There of course other off-topic arguments for trying to adopt build systems
other than make.

Just to add a bit of Windows seasoning to this debate - if GODI (or
whatever) becomes a "de facto" standard for OCaml packaging, then it's going
to need to support Windows.
