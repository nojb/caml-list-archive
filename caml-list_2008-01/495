I think that Markus's post was reasonably well balanced, and he presented a 
humble view from his experience. It didn't look like bashing nor 
flamethrowing to me. The facts in question can be disputed, but they really 
have nothing to do about who profits from what and who pays for what. Let's 
leave the economics out of the merit discussion -- doesn't that only make 
sense?

Cheers, Kuba
