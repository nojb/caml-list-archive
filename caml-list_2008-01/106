You cannot easily change the camlp4 lexer dynamically, but when you get a quotation you get a string that you can lex with a different lexer.

Their is only two restrictions:

- ">>" is forbidden since it will end the quotation
- if you start a new quotation inside, you must close it: '<' (':' ident)? ('@' locname)? '<' ... ">>"

Here is the intersting part of the lexer

---------------------------
and quotation c = parse
  | '<' (':' ident)? ('@' locname)? '<'    {                          store c ;
                                                    with_curr_loc quotation c ;
                                                            parse quotation c }
  | ">>"                                                            { store c }
  | eof                                  { err Unterminated_quotation (loc c) }
  | newline                                     { update_loc c None 1 false 0 ;
                                                      store_parse quotation c }
  | _                                               { store_parse quotation c }
