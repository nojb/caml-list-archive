Having metadata point to the upstream VCS isn't necessarily difficult,
lots of build systems support that.
It can be as simple as using the right URI: http:// ftp:// for
tarballs, svn://, hg:// git://, etc. for a VCS.
The user doesn't need to know how to operate the VCS, the build system
does this for him.

Speaking as the author of a caml binding library that has no published
tarball, I don't see a lot of merit for preventing access to those VCS
either :)
A revision id or tag on a repository is as good as a tarball for
referencing a precise state of some software component.
