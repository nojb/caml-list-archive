My understanding is that the benefits would come from having a richer,
community developed "official" OCaml distribution.  So the stdlib
would stay in place, but extra items would be included as well.  For
example, package ExtLib and some commonly useful Camlp4 extensions
along with the distribution .tar.gz/.exe/.dmg.  If I understood the
meeting transcription in IRC, the official OCaml folks at INRIA would
bless this as the proper way to get and install OCaml once the
community structure is in place.
