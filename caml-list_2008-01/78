Actually, something that might be nice to see, now that the flat page 
table has been replaced with a heap that can handle disjoint heap 
spaces, is to allow multiple different Ocaml runtimes to be running in 
seperate threads in the same process.
The heaps wouldn't be able to see each other, but they'd be able to 
communicate via light weight (and strongly typed) message passing, and 
you wouldn't have to dink around with sockets, pipes, MPI, or simiar 
"heavy weight" solutions, so it'd be simpler, and possibly faster.  This 
is not unlike the Erlang model, in fact.

I often wonder about that myself.  I'd like to do very simple OpenMP
style multi-threaded processing.  OcamlP3 is promising, although it is
much more heavyweight.

Does Xavier's "standard lecture on parallelism" still apply?:
