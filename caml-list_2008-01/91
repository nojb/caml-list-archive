I frequent a website, plnews.org quite a bit.  It's a syndication of 
programming implementation updates/Language meetings etc.  I notice the 
other day, however, they now have a "Caml Powered" logo on the site.  I 
sent them an email and asked about the site and it's use of Ocaml, but 
I've got no reply yet.  Does anyone here know who runs it, or anything 
else about it?  Would be neat to see what it uses.
