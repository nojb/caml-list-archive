Jane Street has a setup quite similar to the one Alain describes.  The
differences are:

   - We use mercurial instead of SVN
   - We do most of our building on Linux rather than Windows.
   - We're less far along the path of bringing external libraries into
   our tree, and so we still use external package management with GODI and
   findlib for many of our libraries.  We are moving to a model closer to
   LexiFi's, though.

We have a very similar-sounding omake setup, and we have the same feelings
about the fact that ocamlbuild is not a complete make replacement.
