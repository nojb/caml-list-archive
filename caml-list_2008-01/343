What is it that is meant to be standardized by this process?  Is this meant
to be parallel to the Java Community Process or Python's PEPs (Python
Enhancement Proposals)?  Those are not just about "best practices", but are
actually about code, language features, APIs, etc.  I don't at first glance
see any real use in agreeing on best practices for OCaml.  Can you give some
examples of what would make a reasonable OSR?  That might clarify the
purpose of them considerably.
