    Dear list,

 As I have mentioned in my previous message, during the OCaml Developer
Days, the INRIA team has made clear that, among other things, the
community is essentially in charge of recommending best practices,
standards, etc. A candidate name has been suggested: "OSR", for "OCaml
Standard Recommandations."

While we already have a few tools for this kind of discussions, (I'm
thinking about the current mailing-list and the Cocan Wiki), at the
moment, we are lacking organisation and a way of committing to a
decision.

Let me suggest the following process:
* anyone on this mailing-list may ask for or suggest best practises --
to do so, please put [OSR] in the header of your e-mail
* after some debate, if one or more solutions have emerged, we put these
solutions on the appropriate page of the Cocan Wiki, with summaries of
pros and cons and an official space for voting and suggesting future
improvements
* if the vote proves conclusive, we move the chosen solution from the
voting stage to some page on that Wiki, say "recommended practises."

Does this seem an acceptable method ?

Regards,
 David
