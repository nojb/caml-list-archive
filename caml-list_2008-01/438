I  think  this  was  what  Berke  has in mind to. However the repository still
becomes very large even if there only a few files by package.

Perhaps  not so overkill for developers, if you've just patched a project, you
need   to  update  the  package  quickly  and  perhaps  not  want  to  have  a
release/tarball  for  each  of  them.  I think that the upstream source can be
either  a tarball URL or a VCS URL. For upstream sources one can supports some
VCSs (CVS, SVN, darcs, git, hg) since one only need to checkout.

Of course, I agree also on this :)
