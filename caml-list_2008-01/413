Hi,

Another example that is probably so obvious that it almost doesn't need
mentioning is the incompatibility of the lexer interface between ulex
and Ocamlyacc/Menhir.  Either we define a common lexer interface that
everyone can migrate to, or at least Ocamlyacc and Menhir could adopt
Dypgen's solution and allow the user to specify the lexer's signature.
The current situation is just absurd.

Cheers,
Dario
