Hiya,

I'm gradually falling in love with Ocaml, but my main hobby is writing demos, 
mainly in the 64k category.  Ocaml is a great way of writing small code, alas 
it comes with a zonking great lump of baggage :-)

"Hello world" written in ocaml and compiled with ocamlopt is 81K on my 32 bit 
linux box, which instantly rules it out.  (running it through upx packer, it 
comes out at 37k, which is still too high).

Are there any options which can strip this down to the bare minimum?  I'm 
guessing that much of the code in there is part of the garbage collection 
code, in which case, I'll have to give up, but it would be nice to use 
ocaml :-)

Thanks,

Giles
