OCaml in Debian has a lot of problems. I have talked about openly
during the meeting. You can find my slides on the wiki, if you want more
information about it.
http://wiki.cocan.org/events/europe/ocamlmeetingparis2008

In this case, i was talking about dealing with repository/metadata.
Which is something about package management and not OCaml in Debian. I
just suggest using a ftp repository and putting a VCS field in the
metadata.

Please read me twice before answering.

I never participate to flameware. But i have seen many on Debian lists,
and think it is a waste of time. Just like people on this list when they
also go into flameware...
