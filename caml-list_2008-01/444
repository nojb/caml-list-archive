You have an interesting point.  It seems quite reasonable that the
licensing of extensions to the OCaml stdlib have at least as permissive
license as LGPL V2 + linking exception.  For those (7?) companies in the
Caml Consortium, the difference comes down to... having to distribute
source to modifications to the extended stdlib if they distribute code
using those modifications.  (Correct me if I'm wrong on this, IANAL.)

I hear of most companies seriously using OCaml re-implementing their own
standard libraries anyway, and the "cost" of sharing some of their
improvements to community-developed extensions of stdlib seems quite
minor to me.  The easy workaround for these companies looks like not
modifying the extended stdlib, but to use their own stdlib replacements
(which they have license to) and to make the internal stdlib sufficient.

That said, I hope these companies will not adopt such an adversarial
relationship with the community developing an extended stdlib.  I hope
they contribute the gems of code they have in their internal stdlib to
the community one, and gain benefits themselves when others using the
community stdlib contribute their changes back to the community.
