First OCaml users conference, Sat 26th Jan 2008, at ENST Paris site
Barrault, Paris, France.

http://wiki.cocan.org/events/europe/ocamlmeetingparis2008

Already 37 people have signed up.  If anyone else is intending to come,
please sign up as soon as possible by editing the page above.  The
conference is free and open to everyone, and there will be some speakers
and workshops.

After Mon 21st Jan 2008, no more inscription will be possible. Since
ENST must have a list of participant before the meeting, it won't be
possible to add anyone else after this date.

I would also like to highlight some points:
* you must have an ID card to enter ENST
* you will have to pay for lunch and dinner (if you choose to have
 lunch/dinner with the other participants)

The final list of talks will be available on Tue 22nd Jan 2008. The
workshop will be a free discussion time around ideas gathered on the
wiki.

Regards,
Sylvain Le Gall
