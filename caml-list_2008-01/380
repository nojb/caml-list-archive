Wouldn't it be better to define a real structure where your company and oth=
ers=20
may take part ?

=46or instance, kernel.org is run by a non-profit organisation, see:=20
http://www.kernel.org/nonprofit.html

The fact is that, if we don't setup strong and clear definitions of who's i=
n=20
charge of what or don't define a common head for the community, what will=20
happen if any of the involved company/hacker/.... decide to split and=20
continue alone, or simply to shutdown one machine, or claim copyright, etc.=
=2E.

Again, I don't suspect any bad intention, but this is the only way to preve=
nt=20
them, isn't it ?
