Today I found out, that we indeed had a circular dependency:

An interface file B.mli used a type A.t, whereas the implementation
file A.ml uses functions from B. When using ocamldep + a Makefile, no
error occurred. But ocamlbuild refused to compile... I guess that is
the right thing to do =)

As far as I know, a `+' means that the following name should be searched
relative to the standard library.

Still my question remains, how one should configure a project
that consists of several libraries and one binary, together
with ocamlbuild. E.g.,

+- prof.dir/
+-+- A/
| +- a.mllib
| +- a1.ml
| +- ...
| +- aN.ml
|
+-+- B/
| +- b.mllib
| +- b1.ml
| +- ...
| +- bN.ml
|
+-+- Main/
  +- main.ml (depending on a.cma and b.cma)

cheers
