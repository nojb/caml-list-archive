I use the following setting for a project:

Within the root directory of the project there are
two subdirectories A and B containing *.ml, *.mli, and *.mly
files.

additionally there is the file A.mllib in A containing all
modules that are in A and B.mllib containing all
modules that are in B.

ocamlbuild -I A A.cma

works fine.

Now B should also result in a lib where some modules in B
depend on modules in A. When trying

ocamlbuild -lib A -Is A,B B.cma

the compilation terminates unsuccessful indicating
some Circular dependencies. However, the Makefile we
used before works fine and there really are no circular
dependencies.

Am I doing something completely wrong here?
Isn't it possible to compile libraries depending on other
libraries?

cheers

christian
