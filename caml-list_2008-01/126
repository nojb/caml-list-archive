I don't think it's worth worrying about.

I wrote a program a while ago to look into this.  I never saw any
"human-sensible" collisions (between two identifiers that a person
might have chosen). And if you're producing gensyms in a program, you
can just check ahead of time.

To find a collision with a given identifier, consider each bignum N
that differs by a multiple of 2^31 from the identifier's hash value.
Compute the radix-223 representation of N.  If that forms a legal
OCaml identifier, then you've found a collision.

For example, Eric_Cooper collides with azdwbie, c7diagq, hlChrkt,
NSaServ, and SaupDOF, to pick just a few.
