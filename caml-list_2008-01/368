Sorry I couldn't attempt to the meeting, so perhaps my point has already be=
en=20
discussed..

While I agree it's generally a good idea to rely on the community for=20
improvements, I think there's a wide difference between the lack of manpowe=
r=20
and a community driven organisation.

In particular, if the work are to be joined together, there shall be at som=
e=20
point a concrete collaboration between INRIA and the communauty.

It does not mean hiring people, but letting contributors participate in the=
=20
core code too.=20
Because, if we say extensions are to be maintained by a community and then =
we=20
need to wait and be confirmed by INRIA for each change that interacts with=
=20
the core, then it might be a loss of energy for both groups, including=20
frustration...

Another question is who will provide machines and means to acheive it.
In particular, a repository =C3=A0 la CPAN for modules would be a great thi=
ng, but=20
it would have to be supported by some structure...

Not that I suspect any problem for now, but I think this has to be stated=20
clearly somewhere.
