If INRIA had a link on its site to a recommended batteries-included distribution, that would help the community coalesce around that distribution.  Obviously trying to choose winners in this way is tricky and not to be done lightly, but I do think there's a good chance that it will become important.

Just to be clear: we already have the verbal blessing of Xavier Leroy on
this. I can only assume that, once the process has been bootstrapped,
this will be materialized by a link on the site and/or in the manual.

Cheers,
 David
