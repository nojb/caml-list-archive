Ok, your concerns are not really about being able to distribute shared
libraries, but rather being able to distribute binary libraries that
don't depend on precise version of other dependent libraries and of
OCaml. I don't think you'll get them any time soon.

Suggestions:

1. Distribute the source code, even without an open source license. I
cannot imagine this would reduce your sales, but you know better.

2. Distribute a fully packaged OCaml distribution that includes all the
dependent libraries (your users will be free to add third party libs as
well).

3. Obfuscate the parts of the source code you want to keep secret.
Camlp4 might help here.

4. Distribute a static binary that plays the role of a server that
encapsulates all your precious trade secrets + a client library
distributed in source code.

Yes, indeed.
