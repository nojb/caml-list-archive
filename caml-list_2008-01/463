You  have a local branch of the whole port hierarchy, that's why we're talking
about DVCS.

That's  not  a  baroque  case,  I  mean  if  you are responsible of libFoo and
progBar,  you  perhaps  want to quickly package progBar using the last version
of libFoo.

I also would like to keep things simple...
