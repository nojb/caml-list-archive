I presume you're worried about the bindings clashing internally rather than
someone who uses the library happening to use a variant that clashes?

You can do something about it - when you're generating your bindings, you
can use the hash_variant() C function to detect the collisions yourself. If
you detect one, you can either issue *your own* warning while generating the
bindings allowing you to specify specific renaming for the program
generating your bindings or you could append digits to the names until the
collisions disappear (which is likely, though not guaranteed, to happen
quickly).

It's slightly ugly, but then the possibility of collisions in the first
place is IMHO ugly too!
