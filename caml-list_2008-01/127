I'm interested in automatically translating the GL_* enum from OpenGL into 
polymorphic variants. So although it is generated code I have little control 
over it, e.g. I cannot change the translation as OpenGL gets extended because 
code will already be using the existing names.

Still, maybe I'm over-reacting. ;-)
