    Dear list,

 During yesterday's OCaml Developer Day, a few important points have
been discussed. First and foremost, due to extremely limited manpower,
Inria does not intend to expand on the current OCaml distribution, nor
even to be in charge of an end-user distribution. Rather, Inria would
concentrate on the core language, in a distribution possibly smaller
than the current tarball, while the community should be in charge of
things such as
* a standard library distribution (e.g. ExtLib + Camomile + LablGtk
+ ... )
* binaries & installers
* testing
* code repositories (Ã  la CPAN)
* deciding standard practices (e.g. Unicode) 
* expanding the platform (e.g. development environments, DSLs)
* maintaining FAQs and tutorials
* evangelism...

 How and when all this should happen needs to be discussed. One tool for
these discussions is the current mailing-list. Another tool is the Cocan
Wiki ( http://www.cocan.org ).

 One important thing: every task needs manpower. So please consider
volunteering.

Cheers,
 David
