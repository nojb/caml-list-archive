$ ocaml
        Objective Caml version 3.10.0

# Sys.sigpipe ;;
- : int = -8

The caml runtime library just uses negative signal numbers.

It does work. It's just that since you close the channel before the
zcat process has finished writing all of the decompressed data, it
dies because it gets a SIGPIPE signal.

Unix.close_process_in calls Pervasives.close_in, ultimately. Before
that, it uses the channel to lookup in a hashtable the pid of the
child process, so as to wait() and report the status of the child
process.
