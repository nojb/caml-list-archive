Hello!

Last two days were exceptionally very loaded.

Yes, but this generally means data about data.

Considering GNU make, BSD make, pmake, bmake, omake... I would say no.

That's not rumor, that's the truth :)

That's why ocamlbuild has been created, to make Makefiles useless.

That's OCaml itself using the ocamlbuild API.
