Not sure it will work in most case.

I think this should be an option. The only things is that Bernard must
continue to send patches to Alphonse...

Stop dreaming ;-) (i.e. Alphonse and Bernard keep talking about VCS,
Alphonse and Bernard decide to both start a new VCS from scratch, in
OCaml, nobody works anymore on Nicemodule).
