What about using Subversion for the main/central repository?  I
realize that it is not distributed itself, but Git, SVK and bzr all
allow for "distributed" connectivity to Subversion repositories.
There may be similar tools/plugins available for Mercurial but I have
not used them.  Subversion has the cross-platform issue covered, with
many CLI and GUI tools available.  It is fairly standard at this
point, which should help to lower the entry barrier for any new
developers.

I have personally found SVK and git-svn to work very well with
Subversion repositories.  This allows for each individual developer to
use the tool(s) they prefer, while still connecting to a central,
canonical repository.
