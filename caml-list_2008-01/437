If distributed version control is to be considered as a solution to the
"package management" problem, then any unbiased evaluation of DVCS
candidates must surely include Bazaar (bzr): http://bazaar-vcs.org/

Architecturally, the design is very similar to Mercurial (anyone who
likes hg will probably like bzr, and vice versa).  However, bzr also has
best-in-class support for history-preserving file and directory renames,
provides excellent built-in merging capabilities, and is flexible enough
to support more workflow models than any other tool I have used.  In
addition, at the time of my last side-by-side comparison bzr had
significantly better Windows support than Mercurial.

bzr has recently reached its 1.0 milestone, and is now quite fast and
suitable for use on very large trees (not yet quite as fast as Mercurial
for most operations, but close).  It is a very well-supported product,
with a core developer team primarily employed by Canonical (of Ubuntu
fame).
