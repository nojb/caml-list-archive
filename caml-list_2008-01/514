Full ack on this.

Of course now the point is how to agree on a standard API, and how to
make all projects out there start switching to it ...

Just to be clear here: Debian does not have a repository of OCaml
libraries and programs on alioth (the GForge instance used by Debian).
It only has a repository with the Debian specificities used to build
debian packages out of those libraries and programs. Then we also cache,
for the ease of our workflow, the original tarballs there, but they are
not the point of that repository.

And this is something which is hopefully coming, provided by Sylvain and
a couple of helpers (including myself). His technical proposal is not
the same as yours, but has the advantages of being based on pieces of
software which already exists and do not need to be written from
scratch. Just wait a bit for the setup ...
