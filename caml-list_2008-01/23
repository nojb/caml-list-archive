The 19th International Conference on Rewriting Techniques and
Applications (RTA 2008) is organised as part of the RISC Summer
2008, which comprises five conferences, five workshops and the
Training School in Symbolic Computation, and is followed by the
3rd International School on Rewriting in Obergurgl.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract:           February 4, 2008
Paper Submission:   February 11, 2008
Notification:       April 4, 2008
Final version:      April 25, 2008

RTA is the major forum for the presentation of research on all
aspects of rewriting. Typical areas of interest include
(but are not limited to):

 * Applications: case studies; analysis of cryptographic protocols;
   rule-based (functional and logic) programming; symbolic and
   algebraic computation; theorem proving; system synthesis and
   verification; proof checking; reasoning about programming
   languages and logics; program transformation;

 * Foundations: matching and unification; narrowing; completion
   techniques; strategies; rewriting calculi, constraint solving;
   tree automata; termination; combination;

 * Frameworks: string, term, and graph rewriting; lambda-calculus
   and higher-order rewriting; constrained rewriting/deduction;
   categorical and infinitary rewriting; integration of decision
   procedures;

 * Implementation: implementation techniques; parallel execution;
   rewrite tools; termination checking;

 * Semantics: equational logic; rewriting logic; rewriting models
   of programs.

BEST PAPER AWARD:
An award is given to the best paper or papers as decided by the
program committee.

STUDENT SUPPORT:
Limited student support will be available and announced in future
versions of this call.
