Don't current x32 processors "emulate" extra registers anyway? I don't know 
what's the preferred way of telling the on-chip code dissector that you 
intend the data to say in virtual registers, but it must be something simple, 
like common, fixed memory locations or stack locations accessed in a certain 
way. I'm sure if you google on Intel's site you'll find it. In any event, the 
x32 chips have a notion of "many" virtual registers, it's just the old x32 
opcodes that don't have it. Isn't it so?

Cheers, Kuba
