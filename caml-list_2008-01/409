Combinators are certainly better than nothing and easier to implement (because 
they don't touch the language) but they can't compete with syntactic sugar 
for brevity and clarity, of course.

This should be in the stdlib (I don't know if that counts as "changing 
OCaml").

breeding ground for proposals.
