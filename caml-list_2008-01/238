The garbage collector does not close I/O channels.

Have a look at the implementation of Scanf:
http://camlcvs.inria.fr/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ocaml/stdlib/scanf.ml?rev=1.77
Apparently close_in is called when the end of file is encountered.
So if you stop scanning before the end of file, you'd better use
Scanning.from_channel and close the channel yourself.
