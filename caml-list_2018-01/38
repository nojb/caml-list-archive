***********************************************************************

                        last Call for Papers

            22nd International Symposium on Formal Methods

                              FM 2018

                    Oxford UK, July 15-17 2018
                  carrier conference of FLoC 2018 
                       http://www.fm2018.org

***********************************************************************

FM 2018 is the latest in a series of symposia organized by Formal
Methods Europe, an independent association that encourages the use of,
and research on, formal methods for the engineering of computer-based
systems and software. The symposia have been notably successful in
bringing together researchers and industrial users around a programme
of original papers on research and industrial experience, workshops,
tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and ongoing doctoral work. FM
2018 will take place in Oxford, UK, 15-17 July 2018 as part of FLoC
2018, the Federated Logic Conferences.

FM 2018 will highlight the development and application of formal
methods in a wide range of domains including software and integrated
computer-based systems. In the latter field, cyber-physical systems,
systems-of-systems, human-computer interaction, manufacturing,
sustainability, power, transport, cities, healthcare, and biology are
of particular interest. We also welcome papers on experiences of
formal methods in industry, and on the design and validation of formal
methods tools.
 

Submission Guidelines

FM 2018 encourages submissions on formal methods for developing and
evaluating systems that interact with physical processes, and systems
that use artificial intelligence technology. Examples include
autonomous systems, robots, and cyber-physical systems in
general. Applying formal methods to these systems of growing interest
and importance is challenging because they exhibit much greater
non-determinism than traditional systems, making them challenging to
assure.

All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to
another journal or conference.

Broad topics of interest for FM 2018 include, but are not limited to:

* Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools and experiences
demonstrating formal methods in interdisciplinary frameworks.  
* Formal methods in practice: Industrial applications of formal
methods, experience with formal methods in industry, tool usage
reports, experiments with challenge problems. Authors are encouraged
to explain how formal methods overcame problems, led to improved
designs, or provided new insights.
* Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification,
model-checking, and testing with formal methods, tools integration,
environments for formal methods, and experimental validation of
tools. Authors are encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new
tool or environment advances the state of the art.
* Role of formal methods in software and systems engineering:
Development processes with formal methods, usage guidelines for formal
methods, and method integration. Authors are encouraged to evaluate
process innovations with respect to qualitative or quantitative
improvements. Empirical studies and evaluations are also solicited.
* Theoretical foundations: All aspects of theory related to
specification, verification, refinement, and static and dynamic
analysis. Authors are encouraged to explain how their results
contribute to the solution of practical problems with methods or
tools.


Submission Information

Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere,
in Springer LNCS format, written in English, submitted through
Easychair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2018).

Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the
Programme Committee. Authors of papers reporting experimental work are
strongly encouraged to make their experimental results available for
use by reviewers. Similarly, case study papers should describe
significant case studies, and the complete development should be made
available at the time of review. The usual criteria for novelty,
reproducibility, correctness and the ability for others to build upon
the described work apply. Tool papers should explain enhancements made
compared to previously published work. A tool paper need not present
the theory behind the tool but should focus on the tool's features,
how it is used, its evaluation, and examples and screen shots
illustrating the tool's use. Authors of tool papers should make their
tool available for use by reviewers.

We solicit two categories of papers:
* Regular papers should not exceed 15 pages, not counting references
and appendices.
* Short papers, including tool papers, should not exceed 6 pages, not
counting references and appendices. Besides tool papers, short papers
are encouraged for any subject that can be described within the page
limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an extensive
experimental evaluation. Short papers will be accompanied by short
presentations.

For regular and tool papers, an appendix can provide additional
material such as details on proofs or experiments. The appendix is not
part of the page count and not guaranteed to be read or taken into
account by the reviewers. It should not contain information necessary
to the understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers
will be accepted or rejected in the category in which they were
submitted — there will be no "demotions" from a regular to a short
paper.  


Keynote Speakers

The FM 2018 program includes three invited talks

    Annabelle McIver, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia
    Leonardo de Moura, Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA
    Kim Guldstrand Larsen, Aalborg University & UP4ALL, Denmark

Best Paper Award
During the conference, the Programme Committee Chairs will present an
award to the authors of the submission selected as the FM 2018 Best
Paper.  


Publication

Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings to
appear in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Extended
versions of selected papers will be invited for publication in a
special issue of one or more journals.  


Location

FM2018, the 22nd International Symposium on Formal Methods, will take
place in Oxford, UK, 15-17 July 2018 as part of FLoC 2018, the
