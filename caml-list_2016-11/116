Hi,

The Ocsigen team is going to release Eliom 6 next week, which focuses on
mobile apps. We will also release Ocsigen Start, a template with an example
of multi platform application: a single code for both your Web app and
mobile html5 apps (Android, iOS, Windows).

If you want to see an example, download the Be Sport app on Google Play or
Apple app store and have a look at the Web app. They are all using Eliom 6
and Ocsigen Start.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=3Dcom.besport.www.mobile
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/besport/id1104216922

It is not native code but the performance are good (even if we have some
problems on iOS, Apple's webview being very buggy). And this technique
requires to write only one code for all your apps (even with server side
generated pages for the Web version!).

Ocsigen Start will be released probably next week (we are polishing the
documentation) but is mature enough for large applications (as you can see
with Be Sport). We are also using the Cordova bindings by Danny Willems,
for some features.
