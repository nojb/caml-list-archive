Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Android/iOS apps with OCaml

Dear Dario,

Making it possible (easier) to cross-compile OCaml programs is one of
the outcomes the work I am doing with Gallium (the team developping
OCaml at Inria) is supposed to have. I am not sure yet how this can
impact the production of Android apps, but as far as iOS apps are
concerned, one thing I am supposed to work on is the integration of
Gerd's pull request (can someone find the number?) which has been stored
in the ios-support branch of the OCaml repository on GitHub.

This should make it possible to cross-compile OCaml programs which can
then be executed on iOS devices.

One other question will then be whether such programs can somehow use
all the application frameworks provided by Apple.

Regarding Android I don't know how helpful OCamljava could be but it
might be worth investigating.

SÃ©bastien.
