And how would you do more complex case analysis, corresponding to nested
patterns? This is more than cumbersome and error-prone in C++ - with
RTTI, and even more so with method dispatch, where your single algorithm
will have to be scattered over tons of distant functions. A maintenance
nightmare.

BTW, as Issac noted, you cannot even use switch statements to perform
RTTI in C++. You have to program if cascades.
