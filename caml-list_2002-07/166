Hi William,

But it is completely imperative. As I understand, the original Oleg's
concern was that he doesn't see a point in learning something which
doesn't bring any benefit over C++. Personally, I don't see a point
in using OCaml _solely_ as a Pascal with GC. 

The only reason which justifies for me your quoted exercise is that
when you deadly need an efficient imperative part in your program you
can (quite likely) achieve this without leaving the language (to a C
extension or whatever).
