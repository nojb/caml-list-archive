This problem is known as "the killer space in file names" :-)
OCaml 3.04 calls the C linker without quoting properly the file arguments,
including the OCaml standard library directory.  You can view the
resulting mess by running ocamlc -verbose -custom ... for the linking
phase.

This bug should be fixed for good in 3.05.  In the meantime, using the
DOS name for OCAMLLIB, as suggested on this list, should do the job.
