Is it, in the sense that Stepanov and those guys mean it?  John Max Skaller 
and I were talking about this a long time ago, and I thought he posted this 
to the list but it turns out it was in email to me, but here goes anyway:

"Sure. I have a 'problem' example: try to implement STL iterators
in Caml. I don't have the expertise in Caml: I think this requires
'higher order functors'. Several people have attempted this, no one
has succeeded that I know of."

Perhaps he's reading and can explain some of the problems.

Caml polymorphism&functors and C++ templates seem to have different 
properties, and I wonder what you can and can't write in each.
