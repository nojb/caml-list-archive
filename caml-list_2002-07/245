Actually, Mozilla has, as do most modern mailers, a Reply-to-All function:
Message->Reply to All, or Ctrl-Shift-R.  In fact, if you use something like
Mutt, you actually get a Reply-to-List function, if you've configured
things properly.

An interesting document detailing one person's opinion on the subject:

    http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html

Basically, the idea is that without adding (or worse, changing) the
Reply-To field, you can choose how you want to reply -- to sender, or to
all -- but if a Reply-To header is added, you lose that functionality.  I 
don't speak for the caml-list managers, but perhaps this is the reason why 
they don't use such a header.

cheers,
William
