I am a games and realtime 3D professional - and I have to tell you, in the
nicest way (I hope) this really isn't how things are. I'd suggest that your
conversations have naturally reflected your own interests. If you want to
make a balanced assessment of what people do in the real world, try looking
at some representative books and collections of conference papers - the
Graphics Gems and Game Gems series would be good starting points.

The hard part of a games scripting language is not, generally, the symbol
processing (take a junior programmer and les and yacc) but the runtime. Do a
search for Unrealscript's documentation. Symbol processing barely impacts
graphics editors at all.
