Isn't this fairly impossible for an applications programmer programming
the popular modern computers?  Don't these machines implement their
features through low-level virtual machines?  Re-order and rewrite
instructions?  Speculatively branch?  Execute sequential instructions
in parallel? Have hierarchical memory caches that they manage
themselves,
impervious to the desires of the programmer?  Etc, etc, etc?
