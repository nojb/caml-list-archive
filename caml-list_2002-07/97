First of all, let me excuse myself for having been away from 
this discussion for a couple of days, but I could not help 
it. The cause, unfortunately, is a tragedy which hit me 
abruptly.

I was thinking about something more specific to XML 
processing. Something like a application/processing server 
to be connected with Apache and the like. Such a process 
would have to listen on a socket for connections from 
clients requesting the processing of <?ocaml ...?> tags or 
of an otherwise specified ocaml expression. I am now 
thinking that maybe this would be overshooting the mark 
here, if we are simply thinking of integrating O'Caml code 
in XSLT stylesheets, where the processor is an O'Caml 
application. In this case, one could conceivably link the 
toplevel into the XSLT processor. As an XSLT template is 
activated, if there is any O'Caml code associated with it, 
the processor could just pass it to the "virtual" toplevel 
within it for immediate excecution.
