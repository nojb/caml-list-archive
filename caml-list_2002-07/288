I'm not a compiler guru from INRIA but I can point out
the languages SAC (Single Assignment C) and FiSH (ask
Google; I'm feeling lazy) that do array shape
inference.  Basically the type system for arrays in
augmented by their shape and shapes are inferred in a
similar way to types.  In addition to eliminating
bounds checks the compiler can do funky reordering
optimisations (because these are functional languages,
so evaluation order is not important) and produce code
faster than Fortran. Exciting stuff if you're into
numerical code.
