Easy: almost all commercial and most academic programmers have never
heard of OCaml. That's a fact.

Nobody has ever said so. They are at least uninformed what concerns
this language. And even if they are informed, there are many commercial
reasons why OCaml might be a sub-optimal choice: lack of programmers,
lack of libraries for commercial purposes, etc. This is not just a matter
of language features.

Another reason why project managers don't want OCaml :-)

Now seriously, I don't quite get your argument. Do you have any
imagination, how difficult it is to find OCaml-programmers? I can tell
you of maybe three somewhat competent OCaml-programmers in my country.
Other programmers here are not incompetent in the sense that they don't
know how to program in general but in the sense that they have never used
(most often not even heard) of this language. If I founded a company
here using this technology, I'd get into very serious troubles when my
main programmer gets a brick on his head. Just too risky!
