Looking at Halo [1] credits, one can see that it was developed by about 10 
programmers (there were also testers and artists involved). A single O'Caml 
programmer capable of developing such a game alone should certainly stand to 
make tons of money. Then why don't we see much software written in O'Caml?

I'm not buying the argument that "O'Caml isn't used in the industry because 
investors and project managers are stupid". You don't need a project manager 
if you can replace a team of 100 C/C++ programmers alone (or just 10 of 
them if you work in your spare time < 1 hour a day) [2]

[1] By far the best first-person-shooter game I've ever played in terms of 
AI, graphics, playability and relative freedom from bugs.

[2] The number is supposed to be even higher if you take into account that an 
n-fold increase in individual productivity is equivalent to more than an 
n-fold increase in team size.
