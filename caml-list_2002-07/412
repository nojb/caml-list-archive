I think that the "class" and "class type" constructs are useful when 
expressing the relationship between types/classes. For example, "let 
point a b..." defines a function that creates an object. But, what does 
(x :> point) mean when point is a function instead of a class type? If 
anything, I would thing that (f :> g) would mean that the return type 
and parameter types of f follow the covariant/contravariant rules for 
methods. Similarly, what would the #point construct mean?

Also, class types are types, and classes define implicit types, so I 
think that the class syntax should be close to the syntax for defining 
other kinds of types, instead of the syntax for defining functions.
