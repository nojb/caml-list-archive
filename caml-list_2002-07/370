I am in the process of finishing up a simple XML stylesheet 
processor which formats ascii data for a line printer. Very 
simple. About 1000 odd lines of code in O'Caml. Would a 
project of this kind and size suit your interest? You might 
try to code a processor for the same dtd, so that we can 
measure di difference in "semantic density" of O'Caml and 
C++, within the limits of our respective abilities with the 
two languages (I'm not an O'Caml guru--yet...)

I have a feeling that O'Caml was born out INRIA's need for a 
language to use in symbolic AI projects. The two worlds seem 
to be very difficult to reconcile.

Ah! Wait a minute. I have another toy project I could 
propose to you: an interpreter for rule based language, à la 
CLIPS. 197 lines of code in ocaml, including comments. This 
is probably the kind of compelling example you are looking 
for. I coded it in 24 h, including time for sleep, nutrition 
and general self care.

Let me know if you are interested.
