I'm new to caml, but see the ocaml environment as something I've wanted
for some time---an interpreted environment for manipulating and viewing
data interactively, and a compiled speed that is close to C.  What I'm
really after is a matlab-like environment that I can program using
ocaml.  

What is the closest set of modules out there to this?  What code is
available that I could start with?  Perhaps PsiLab?  I would like to
build GUI's and plotting functions using gtk and stick with fundamental
ocaml arrays.  Will this limit me?  Must I eventually use bigarrays?

Thanks for any suggestions.
