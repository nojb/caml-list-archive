Subject: [Caml-list] Do streams still need to be patched?
Message-Id: <20020730155645.88DD47F66@lobus.fungible.com>

I see this comment at the beginning of streams.ml:

(* The fields of type t are not mutable to preserve polymorphism of
   the empty stream. This is type safe because the empty stream is never
   patched. *)

Is this still true?  I can easily imagine that it used to be true if
and when OCAML had weak type variables, but it doesn't anymore.

If it isn't true any more, then I think it would be possible to make a version
of streams that's as fast and functional as what's there now, and it
would allow consing streams to interoperate properly with streams
derived from functions or channels.
