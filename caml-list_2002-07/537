I'm curious, how are you going to be able to establish the productivity 
gain/loss once your game is finished? (I don't suppose you have an identical 
twin next door coding the same game in C++ ;-)  Is it safe to assume you have 
been working on it for many months full-time?

Are you using O'Caml for all of your code in the game? Are you using external 
libraries extensively? 

I happened to look at d6.com web site. It talks about an _original_ game that 
involves climbing a hill online against human competitors. Is this why it is 
original [1]?

Oleg
