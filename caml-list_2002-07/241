I agree, I like Usenet a lot more than mailing lists.

However, there are already comp.lang.functional and comp.lang.ml where
OCaml is on topic. Given that especially comp.lang.ml has quite low
traffic, I doubt an OCaml-specific newsgroup would be either necessary
or sucessfull.

Additionally, this mailing list seems to be gatewayed to a newsgroup
called fa.caml. I don't have it on my NNTP server, but
groups.google.com knows it.

Henrik
