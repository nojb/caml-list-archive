Then COM is obviously your choice. How else will you interface VB with
your Ocaml library?

I cannot understand this. DLL and COM are not concepts of the same
level. That's like to say "I prefer fruits to oranges" :-)

I have already explaned you that in fact you can use COM DLL without
registering, at least from C/C++ (don't know about VB since I never used
it).

Not a problem. Camlidl lets you to equip Ocaml COM component with IDispatch
interface.
