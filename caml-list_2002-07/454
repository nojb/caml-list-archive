   That's enough, at least for now.  Is CVS version relatively stable
   under Cygwin?
It should compile (I only check from time to time -- please mail me if
it doesn't).  Stable... I presume multiplying the probabilities of not
finding a bug in Cash and Cygwin, should give you some kind of
measure :-)

   Thank you, now it's clear.  And the Ocaml question: why "-custom"
   flag, passed to ocamlmktop, does not link all Ocaml libraries into
   the resulting executable?  Am I missing something?
I thought the very purpose of a top-level was to let me wrote my
libraries after having made this top-level.  Well, OK, the other point
is that, IIRC, .cma don't include .cmi.  I don't remember exactly why.

Bruno.
