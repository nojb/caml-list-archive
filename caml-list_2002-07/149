Hi everyone,

Since I'm new to the list, I introduce myself:
Corentin Herbert, young French high-school student (16 years old)
Passions: Astronomy, Tennis and of course computer (Mac particularly: I'm a
Mac OS X programmer and webmaster at http://www.mac4ever.com)

I suscribed to the list because I've planned to go to a "Classe
Pr=E9paratoire" after high-school (sorry, I don't know the english word for
that), and I know Caml is the language used there.
I'm not a complete newbie because last year, my maths teacher lent me a boo=
k
aimed at "Classes Preparatoires"'s students and since I was rather good in
maths and I already knew other programming languages (ObjectiveC, C++, Java=
,
Perl, and even a bit of assembly, Lisp=8A), I understood almost everything
quite easily. That was how I discovered Caml and now, I'd like to learn mor=
e
about it=8A

First I've a non-really-Caml question:
I can't manage to install CamlLight !
I downloaded the sources and when I try a "make world", I get this error:

>cd lib; make CPP=3D"/usr/bin/cpp -P -Dunix" all
>../camlrun ../camlcomp -stdlib . -O none -g -W arg.mli
>Fatal error: the file ../camlcomp is not a bytecode executable file
>make[1]: *** [arg.zi] Error 2
>make: *** [world] Error 2

Obviously there is a problem with the file camlcomp but I can't see what's
going wrong ! I thought the problem could be in m.h or s.h files but I'd
rather not try to modify these files whithout being completely sure that th=
e
problem comes from there=8A

Thanks in advance for any help=8A

Corentin

PS: Sorry for my english, as I said, I'm just a young french student so I
don't speak very well=8A
I hope I've been understandable
