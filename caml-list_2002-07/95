It's semantically equivalent to input iterators, though the syntax is 
different,
and it misses the ability to iterate over a range with a specified endpoint.
More general iterators need a more sophisticated interface, but the 
technique
can be generalised to returning a tuple of closures [deref, increment, 
compare,
etc, rather than just 'next'] (effectively, a set of
methods on the object which is the state encapsulated in the function:
the usual functional tricky to get object orientation for free :-)

heh! It's academic for me too.
I was just curious if I could build a version of STL for Ocaml.
