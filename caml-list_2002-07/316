    Last month I fineshed a project in the biomedical
engineering field and what I had to do was to build a
software to process and acquire biomedical signals. I
had chosen Visual C++ as my compiler and I found many
problems with this compiler. It was due to this fact
that now I am looking for new compilers and even
paradigms to work with. 
     
    My tasks are:

       To develop dsp tools (FFT, ChirpZ, AR-models,
...)
       To design a friendly interface
       To design an oscope capable of showing signals
in real time
       To communicate with an acquisition board (I
have a driver - a DLL - distributed by the
manufacturer)
       And to finish: my program must run on Windows.
But I would like to design a multiplataform software.

       As I do not have almost none experience with
Ocaml, I would like to know your opinion about the
ocaml and its tools for solving my task. Is it
feasible? 

       Thanks for your opinion.
