I am wondering about this point too. But, perhaps you can use O'Caml 
classes to do the same thing as the C++ template classes?

Anway, I think that the above "problem" can also be an asset. If you are 
building an interpreter, and you add a new construct to the interpreted 
language, then all code that claims to know about every construct will 
become erroneous, and so you will know right away what new code needs to 
be added. There doesn't seem to be anything like that in an 
inheritance-based model.
