I am not familiar with Ensemble, but they say in its overview that

http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble/overview.html
[...]
Ensemble System.

As Horus/C has matured, we have also encountered issues that recently lead
to a complete reimplementation of the system using a subset of the ML
programming language. To avoid confusion, we have begun to call this
version of our system Ensemble. The subset of ML employed for this work
translates directly into C, which can then be compiled in a normal manner,
and makes no use of ML's garbage collection features. Thus, the choice of
ML has no negative performance implications, and the code itself looks like
C++.

Does it mean that Ensemble is *not* in fact an Ocaml application?
