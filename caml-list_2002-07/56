I agree. I experienced similar problems with CDK. I just wanted
the X11 code. Had lot of problems, I thought that it didn't
like OpenBSD, I tried on Linux. Also, having to recompile Ocaml
isn't very convenient, and it's tricky to compile CDK with an
already compiled Ocaml (I didn't manage... I haven't spent a full
week on it, though).

So I'd really like to have a CDK that compiles easily and cleanly on
a UNIX box, and that doesn't need a specific Ocaml version. I mean,
patching the compiler to install a X lib doesn't sound good to me.
