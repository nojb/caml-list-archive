Available at www.issactrotts.net :

The lablglut library is a simple GLUT binding for OCaml.  GLUT 
(OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is a portable, minimal user interface library for OpenGL, 
written by Mark Kilgard.  GLUT tends to be easier to install and use than
most other OpenGL windowing alternatives.  Its portability is hard to beat.

lablglut includes bindings for a small subset, called ezgl, of OpenGL's 
commands, mainly for testing.  For real programs, lablGL's bindings 
will probably come in handy.  

Cheers,
Issac
