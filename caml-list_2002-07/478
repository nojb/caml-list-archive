Hi,

Nicolas Cannasse seems to believe that "productivity"
and "performance" are orthogonal concepts. They are
not always. For some tasks the performance of the
algorithm determins if the program can be put into the
application. Hence, if the program executes too
slowly, the program is useless and the time spent on
it was a waste. In other words, there was no
productivity at all.

I commend Nicolas for trying to use O'Caml in a games
setting. We, however, can not afford this - instead
the company designed and implemented a specific
language in order to be able to optimize _and_ be
productive. This language has high-level constructs as
well as low-level constructs --- and they can be
freely mixed.

Take care,

PKE.
