Hi list !

I'm pleased to announce the .pre release of OCam'OLE, an OLE binding for
OCaml.

OCam'OLE enable you to control remote COM objects with OCaml and is provided
with
OLEGen, a program that generate ML/MLI static type interface from the OLE
Type Libraries.

The current distribution include a sample that demonstrate the combined
usage of
OCam'OLE and OLEGen to enable the creation and the control of an MS Excel
sheet in a few
lines of OCaml code.

This release is ".pre" because it hasn't been heavily tested, so some bugs
could remain
and are waiting for some serious users to discover them :)

You can download it at http://tech.motion-twin.com

I would like to thanks Lexifi (www.lexifi.com) for supporting this project
