I knew C++ could be linked as 'extern "C"', but I'm not sure 
this would allow me to use a DOM XML parser, because, as far 
as I can see, this method only allows O'Caml code to call C 
functions compiled within C++ code. I wonder if this is 
enough to exploit such DOM parsers as Xerces of the Apache 
project.

Then again, I just realized gdome2-xslt by Claudio Sacerdoti 
Coen might be all that I really need. I'll download it and 
take a good look at it.
