Well, why not write that language in ocaml yourself?  Whatever else you can
say about ocaml, it is a superb language for writing other languages in.
Jason Hickey's group here at Caltech use ocaml to write all their compilers
(actually one big compiler with multiple front ends for different
languages).  I know this is a lot of work, but I'm not being totally
tongue-in-cheek here.
