The need for this isn't apparent yet: we haven't yet encountered a
situation where a show-stopper bug appears, but the main CVS branch is
far from a releasable state.  One reason for this is that major
evolutions of the system, e.g. polymorphic methods or dynamic loading
of C libraries, are carried on separate branches, and merged back only
when they are in a usable state.

If that happens, we'll do what works best, and that might very well be
a bugfix branch.  But, frankly, this is our internal "cuisine", and I
don't see why you and other users should care.
