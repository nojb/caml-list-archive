I am terribly sorry. But, as I have already had occasion to 
mention, in the past few days I have been coding too much 
and sleeping too little. A good many of my neurons are 
already on vacation. Do excuse them, please.

Anyway, my class hierarchy is a mess. I'm still unsure as to 
what I'll end up doing. Maybe I'll just go and make myself a 
coffee.
