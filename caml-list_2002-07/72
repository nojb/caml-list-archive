Hi,

When we started writing the cdk, our first goal was to provide a big
bunch of useful libraries and integrated makefiles, so that one could
get them all from one place, and compile them all with one 'make'.
Unfortunately, I'm afraid our approach does not work, for several
reasons. First of all, many of the libraries included are developed by
other persons, and we need to manually take their changes into the
libraries included, which is a pain. Another problem is the one you
describe: we provide a bundle that is not easy to cut in pieces.

So I really think the packaging issues should be tackled differently, in
a distributed way (it needs to be easy for developpers to integrate in
their project). Packaging should take care of a few things:
- make libraries easy to find
- make libraries easy to compile and use (well known library repository,
  detection of installed libraries)
- make recompiling easy (in my dream world, when I recompile ocaml, I'd
  like to be able to recompile all the libraries and apps that depend on
  it with one command).

Best,

Alan
