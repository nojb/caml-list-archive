With all the talk about an upcoming release of OCaml 3.05, I thought I
should ask once more if anybody knows about the status of the callback_exn
bug that was reported on April 12, 2002 in

http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200204/msg00065.html

The CVS shows that a change was made to byterun/interp.c on that date, which
appears to be intended to fix the problem, but for me the problem remains
even with this fix.  Is it possible that version 3.05 will really fix the
problem?  If there's still more tweaking to be done, is it possible that it
could get done in time to be included in the release?

Thanks,
Harry
