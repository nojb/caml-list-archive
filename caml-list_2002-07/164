Not that I need to add more noise to the channel, but just in case
someone cares, that time listed below is for the bytecode compiled
version.  Times for native compiled versions are as follows:

5000 primes:
0.050u 0.000s 0:00.07 71.4%     0+0k 0+6io 0pf+0w
10000 primes:
0.100u 0.030s 0:00.16 81.2%     0+0k 0+6io 0pf+0w
50000 primes:
0.710u 0.020s 0:01.26 57.9%     0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
500000 primes:
21.460u 0.330s 0:29.02 75.0%    0+0k 0+3io 0pf+0w

Now then...I suppose it's time to get back to work.

"The magnum opus of rms and his Foundation is called 'GNU', a project to
completely rewrite the propritorially soiled Unix operating system. 
(Apparently, 'GNU' stands for "Gnu's Not Unix", and is proudly held to be
the world's first 'recursive acronym'. Which, of course, proves that rms
didn't get out enough in his youth.)
