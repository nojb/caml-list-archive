I have code similar to the following

class a =
object (self)
   method m = 1
   method n = "Hello!"
end

class b =
object (self)
   inherit a as super_a
   method m = 2
end

Now I would like to define a third class, inheriting from b. 
  I need this class to be able to access the definition of 
method m from class a, otherwise I would have to use "copy & 
paste", which is contrary to my programmer's ethics.

Ideally, I would like to write

class c =
object (self)
   inherit b as super_b

   method m =
     (* some_stuff *)
     super_b # super_a # m
end

Presently, this is not allowed. Is there any specific reason 
for this? Could such a feature be implemented in the future?

Alex
