This was my impression as well. I think it would be a good idea to add
something to the FAQ about how UML-ish/Java-ish
private/protected/public/package visibility maps to O'Caml. And, if
there isn't a direct mapping in some cases, then perhaps explanations of
"workarounds" like the ones presented in this thread.

Thanks,
Brian
