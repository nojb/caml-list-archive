The reason I was looking for a sample is that it will take me 
probably a couple of days just getting the makefile right etc.
Therefor, much easier to just take someone else code and tweak
it a little.

COM's are implemented as a DLL, I have been unclear. What I need
is to be able using the old win16/32 dll-calling convention, not
using the modern COM-convention.

The reason is that VBA doesn't support the COM supported by camlidl,
it only supports IDISPATCH. (I made some COM-stuff in my life, but
I do not like it, especially if you need to use C++. Now at last
in dotnet seems Microsoft gotten it right without wizards that
creates enormous amounts of code I don't understand.)

I would like to keep it as simple as possible, thus the dll-calling
convention is enough. I will only call a few functions and I only
need to return integers. (Thus no need to mess with BSTR, which
would be needed if I would return strings from ocaml to vb).
