Definitely not. By using multiple inheritance as you 
suggest, class c inherits from class a *twice*, thereby 
having double copies of all instance variables declared in 
a. This is bad. Consider how difficult it is to manage a 
multiple-path inheritance in C++, and how that has rendered 
necessary the use of "virtual" memember objects.
