This can easily be written in terms of Unix.fork and Unix.exec; you
can use the sources for the Unix.process_* functions as a starting point.

This is standard Unix behavior: file descriptors are preserved across
"exec", unless they were set to "close on exec" mode before the exec
(see Unix.set_close_on_exec).
