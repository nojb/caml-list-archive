Something I've been wanting for a while (And vaguely remember being
discussed on the list a while back) is being able to have literal int32 and
int64 and nativeint values in source files. For example, I have code that
has int32 constants that are too large to fit in a normal caml int, so I'm
stuck doing things like let some_value = Int32.of_string "123456789" at the
moment, which seems icky. For some reason, I was under the impression that
this was going to be in .05. Any chance of it for .06?

Nifty. In a vaguely related note, I'm working off and on on adding support
for IPv6 sockets to the Unix library. I think I just need to finish the
interface code for the C getnameinfo() and getaddrinfo() functions, and do a
merge with the 05 code instead of 04. Is there any interest in making this
part of a future release?
