I'm trying to get the semantics of protected methods of C++. 
I have a class with a method that is not meaningful for the 
outside world, but different instances of this class should 
be able to invoke this method on one another.

I need something like the following pseudocode:

class a =
object
   method protected m = ...
   method m2 (obj:a) = a # m
end

I understand this can be obtained by creating a container 
module for class a and restricting the type of a through the 
module signature. I read the manual but was unable to figure 
out the syntax to do this. Would anyone be so kind as to 
lend a hand?

Thank you very much.

Alex
