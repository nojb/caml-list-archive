It's certainly not going to be scientific, that's for sure.  :)  I just 
figure I'll have a better idea of how caml handles a complete project (or 
at least how I handle a complete project with caml) once I'm done.  It'll 
be more of a personal metric of productivity, but since I work by myself, 
that's fine for me.

The only external library is gl/d3d, at least I hope to keep it that way 
(well, I'll have to interface to dsound as well, obviously).

This game isn't up there, it's still a long ways from being finished, sadly.

To have some actual potentially list-worthy content in this mail:  I have 
found caml code easier to refactor than C.  Moving blocks of code around is 
pretty easy because of local functions/closures.
