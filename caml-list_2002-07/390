I think I know what nested patterns are (something like 
Node (x, y, Bla(1, _)) -> ...), but I don't see where any extra difficulty 
will come from while using virtual functions. Could you give specific 
examples please?

Why would maintaining code organized by data type be harder? Isn't it what 
encapsulation is all about?

That is correct. I never actually had to use RTTI, so I thought typeid could 
be converted into int.
