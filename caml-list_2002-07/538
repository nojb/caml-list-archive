Do you have links/references? (Although the fact that ML is more productive 
than C is quite believable to me) I found Horus/Ensemble web site. It looks 
like it has not been updated in 5 years[1]

It's very easy to give simple examples of when C++ is much more productive 
than C in programs defined by their I/O (If anyone needs such examples: a) 
reverse a file, b) reverse lines in a file c) /usr/bin/sort ). The situation 
seems to be different with O'Caml vs C++.
