Markus, you write as a brick to the head is a foregone
conclusion.  Is this how functional programmers are
treated in Austria?  ;-)

Seriously, Markus is right: many business decisions
are based on fear.  This is sad and leads to the kind
of lossage that Paul Graham has been writing about in
his recent essays.  It's up to small companies to gain
the advantages of innovative technology.
