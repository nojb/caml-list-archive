Xavier, don't you think it would be a good time for going with a dual cvs
branch scheme or something like that, where you have a released branch
(3.05, and bugfix releases : 3.05.1, 3.05.2, etc) and a development
branch (which will become 3.06).

I suppose it is easy now to do a 3.06 bufix release, but what will
happen when you encouter such a serious bug which needs fixing, when you
are in the middle of developpment of the next version, and the cvs tree
is not really in a releasable state ?

In this case, will you revert all your changes and reapply after having
released the bugfix version, hurry the developpment so you can ship the
new version fixing the bug, or just let the bug stay until the next
version is released ?

None of these solutions appear satisfactory.

Friendly,

Sven Luther
