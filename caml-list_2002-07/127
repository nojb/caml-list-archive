Hi

As part of learning O'Caml I was rewriting small personal utility programs 
from C++ to O'Caml and I have not seen any productivity improvement so far. 
Possibly, this is because I essentially use the same imperative style or 
because my knowledge of O'Caml is rudimental or because there is no 
productivity enhancement, at least for the programs I was translating or for 
small programs in general.

What are the _simplest_ examples that demonstrate considerable (> 2:1) O'Caml 
vs C++ productivity improvement (in terms of program size) and where can I 
find them?

Thanks
Oleg

P.S. Just trying to stay motivated.
