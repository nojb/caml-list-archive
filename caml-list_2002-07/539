 I'm currently working on a numerical (and some symbolics) computational
environment in OCaml (but not interactive, it must work with a database,
something like a distributed multidimensional spreadsheet).

 Looking at PsiLab, I had choosen the following approach:
1) bigarrays for matrices and large datasets, for multidimensional
  data - arrays or tuples of bigarrays (sic!).
2) conventional arrays for vectors
3) "compilation" of the functions (e.g. minimization function using
 $\chi^2$ for the given dataset and model) by producing a partially 
 applied functions - it seems to be very effective with ocaml.

 But my problems are somewhat specific: relatively simple mathematical
models with a large datasets (particle physics phenomenology).
