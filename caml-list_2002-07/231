Well, this is a simple consequence of us humans having finite brains
(though some hack=08=08=08=08programmers don't believe that ;)

Even if FPLs reduce complexity only slightly, this implies that there
must be previously insoluble problems that become solvable by their
application.

Right, as soon as there are constraints (scarce resources), economical
thinking demands more efficient tools (languages).
