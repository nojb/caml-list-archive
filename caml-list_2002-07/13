Actually, it turns out to be trivial to add this feature to the debugger.
In the file debugger/show_information.ml, apply this patch:

25a26
> open Source
72,73c73,78
<   fprintf ppf "#%i  Pc : %i  %s char %i@."
<          framenum event.ev_pos event.ev_module event.ev_char
---
>   let first_char_of_line, line =

>   fprintf ppf "#%i  Pc : %i  %s line: %i char: %i@."
>     framenum event.ev_pos event.ev_module 
>       line char_on_line

Don't forget the "open Source" line, or you won't be able to access the
"line_of_pos" function.  Nothing like open source software ;-)

Hmm.  It doesn't work for me.  When I do this the last location I can see
before hitting the exception is about two lines before the location of the
bug.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around the way the debugger
works.
