There is no digest for the caml-list, although the mailing list
manager that we use (Majordomo) can be configured to support a digest
list.  However, I was under the impression that digests aren't very
popular these days, in particular because they make it inconvenient to
reply to a particular message.

As for newsgroups, there already exists two newsgroups where Caml
discussions are on topic: comp.lang.ml and comp.lang.functional.
Everyone is free to post messages on these newsgroups instead of on
the caml-list.  That most of the discussions on Caml go to caml-list
seems to indicate that most posters prefer a mailing list.

The solution, I believe, is on your side: it is not hard to filter
caml-list messages to a special mailbox, and/or read it as if it were
a newsgroup.  I know how to do this with procmail and Gnus, but I
believe that even Outlook Express and Netscape Mail can do this.
