Hello,

Has anyone encountered the following problem:
My development environment is Windows 2000, Ocaml 3.04, and Dev Studio
.NET (for the necessary C compiler, linker, etc)
I am trying to build an ocaml application with the -custom switch.
The problem is that if OCAMLLIB is defined as "C:\program files\..."
the link stage fails claiming that it cannot find the relevant Ocaml
files.
However, if I define OCAMLLIB as C:\program files\... then Ocaml
thinks that C:\program and files are two different arguments.

It seems that somewhere there is inconsistency between the way parsing of
environment variables is done between the ocaml compiler and linker.

P.S. when I build an ocaml app without the -custom switch, it works fine!

Any ideas anyone?

Thanks,

Roy
