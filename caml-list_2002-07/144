Hello,

I'm looking at ocaml as the language to make ultrasonic programs.
The difficult part for me is the scientific imaging.
I will have to show waveforms (typically 1024 points long) and colormaps
(1024 * 100 * 256 levels of color for example) at comfortable
speed (I mean more than 20 Hz).

I tried to use lablgtk and camlimage starting from the examples, but
didn't achieve to get a area in wich I can draw all what I want...
Starting from the lablgtk drawing.ml example, I was not able to
chose/create RGB colors. My feeling is that there is something to do
to have the right colormap or extend it ?

I would appreciate any suggestion to progress.

I would need:
* to be able to draw and change the colors,
* a very nice point would be to have transparency, in order to be able
  to implement layers in graphical widgets (composite widgets in ocaml,
  or gtk widget in C + binding ?)
* the ability to manipulate some decorations on the graphic with the
  mouse (event handling)
* and certainly a lot more...

Well, all this is not so far from the canvas widget (Tk, Gnome).

Thanks in advance
