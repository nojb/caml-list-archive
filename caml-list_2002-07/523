I agree that the C interface is pretty nice. However,
how do would you use SIMD math instructions on the
x86? Would you always call C-routines just to make use
of SIMD or multimedia-instructions? What is the
overhead for calling a function that is executing a
few assembly instructions? Is it even possible to
create a solid division line between "low-level" and
"high-level" code? 

There's something to be said for premature
optimizations, but don't you think there's something
to be gained from having inline assembly in O'Caml? In
C++, one can create inline SIMD floating point vector
operations. A.I. and behaviour code constantly use 3D
math that would benefit from inline assembly.

PKE.
