Hi all,
I'm upgrading some very old network code of mine to Ocaml 3.05,
and I'm getting confused about the behavior of connect() in=20
bytecode threads vs. native threads.=20
As you know, to get a yieldable connect, you put a socket
in non-blocking mode, connect, and wait for the socket to
be writable. That is how connect is written in
otherlibs/threads/unix.ml.
Now on the other hand otherlibs/systhreads does not=20
have a specific unix.ml that defines a connect().

Which unix.ml is used when compiling with -threads with
bytecode and native compilers (with Ocaml configured in native
threads)?
