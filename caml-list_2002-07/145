After I thought we had tamed bigarrays, it seems we did not. Certain
operations such as slices and reshaping allocate new bigarray structs. They
use the stock bigarray_alloc instead of the custom one, of course, and so
they bypass the finalizers. We managed to make OCaml segfault for this!

I don't see any way to work around that problem other than having support for
external finalizers in bigarray_alloc, and having proxies and slices
remember them. Even with a perfectly working Gc.finalise, we would encounter
the same problem, as the finalizers will get forgotten after a reshape, not
a very nice feature...

I think, given this input, lack of finalization support in bigarrays should be
promoted from just a feature wish to a bug, since there seems to be no way
to work around it.

Thanks,
       Fernando
