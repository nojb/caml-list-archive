NC

-------------

OCam'OLE enable you to control remote COM objects with OCaml and is provided
with OLEGen, a program that generate ML/MLI static type interface from the
OLE Type Libraries.

The current distribution include a sample that demonstrate the combined
usage of OCam'OLE and OLEGen to enable the creation and the control of an MS
Excel sheet in a few lines of OCaml code.

This release is ".pre" because it hasn't been heavily tested, so some bugs
could remain and are waiting for some serious users to discover them :)

You can download it at http://tech.motion-twin.com

I would like to thanks Lexifi (www.lexifi.com) for supporting this project
