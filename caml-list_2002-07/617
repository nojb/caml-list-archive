Hi,

Excuse me for my naive question, but is it possible to have something
as a "binary" distribution, as least for the "cpp" file ?

I mean, I do not have MSVC at hand, and I suppose I'm not the only
one on the list. Ocaml, yes, MSVC, no :) I assume that a DLL/binary
version for a "windows platform" is as well-defined as "linux
distribution" (that is, there are no two installation alike), so may
be it is not possible for you to provide a compiled "ocamole.cpp" for
poor people like me...

Thanks anyway,

sL
