Actually, speed-wise natively compiled OCaml (on at least x86; I
haven't seen benches for other architectures) is slightly faster than
C++ compiled by gcc 3.0, and slightly slower than C compiled by gcc
3.0.  OCaml does have an excellent C binding facility, which makes it
easy to interface between OCaml and C code (so therefore one can use C
for extremely speed-critical code while writing most other code in
OCaml).  Thus, I see little advantage to writing a whole new natively
compiled language (which would require writing a whole new code
generation and optimization layer, which would be extremely
time-intensive, unless such a language were "compiled to C" as things
such as GCL (GNU Common Lisp) do) rather than simply using OCaml with
speed-critical or otherwise extremely low-level code in C.

Yes, I know my enemies.
They're the teachers who tell me to fight me.
Compromise, conformity, assimilation, submission, ignorance,
hypocrisy, brutality, the elite.
All of which are American dreams.
