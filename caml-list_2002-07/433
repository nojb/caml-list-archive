I thought so, too. I made several atttempts, and the 
compiler seemed to reject all of them. Let me see if I can 
cook up a quick example.

# class a = object method private m : unit = (new a) # m end;;
The expression "new a" has type a = <  > but is used with type
   < m : unit; .. >
Only the second object type has a method m
