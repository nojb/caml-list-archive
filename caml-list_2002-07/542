Sorry. No. You're wrong. People use C, when C++ is unequivocably
superior in almost every way. Why?

[Example: Ocaml. Python. Gtk. Etc Etc. Why are all these
fools using C instead of C++? Perhaps they're not fools after all?]

I think you underestimate 'inertia'.
It is worthwhile to consider that being conservative does have
some advantages.

Note also: *business productivity* is more closely related
to predictable performance. Even predictable low performance
of programmers is very attractive compared to risk taking.
