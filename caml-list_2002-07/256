No, plese not, Reply-To: should be left to the freedom of the poster, If
you set this field to the ML a poster can't set it to another value
when, for example, it's temporarly available under a new address.

Just use a MUA that support a "list reply" like mutt and many else.

WRT newsgroup I suggest the use of a mailing list - newsgroup gateway so
that we can have a mailing list (with archives, search engine, ecc) AND
a newsgroup (where one have not to download all post, group reply :),
...).

I suggest "pyg", a likely tool that keep in sync a mailing list and a
newsgroup forwarding messages that came from a source to the other and
viceversa. It was written in Python (I know, in OCaml it should be
better, but .... :-))))

Cheers.
