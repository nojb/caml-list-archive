What I meant was "when a new version of ocaml comes out, or when I want
to recompile ocaml from cvs, ...".

At the moment, each time I install a new version of ocaml, I need to
recompile all librairies that depend on the standard library if it has
changed a bit. Same thing if I get a new version of, say, lablgtk, with
all my gtk apps.

So I don't mean to have a special version of ocaml with any packaging
system, just to be able to handle dependencies among librairies.

Best,

Alan
