Two major reasons.

    (1) licence uncertainty
    (2) lack of programmers

Issue (2) will go away with time as use snowballs,
it would help if Universities started teaching Ocaml instead
of stupid OO languages like Java, or at least as well as.

Lack of bindings to C libraries is also an obstacle, but I'd roll that
up into issue (2).

It would be really useful if all the run time parts of Ocaml were given
a simple no bull licence such as 'free for any use' so it was quite clear
that generated code was OWNED by the entity that owned
the inputs.
