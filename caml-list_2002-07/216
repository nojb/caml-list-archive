No, but we do need a richer library. Unlike Python, efficiency is important
for Ocaml. A lot of work has gone into making Ocaml fast: right from the 
start,
the decision to generate native code directly rather than going via C 
indicates
that performance is treated very seriously. As it should be!


Now recently, big arrays of various types have been added with
unboxed elements. And I can guess that the problem
of supporting arrays of unboxed elements of a more general class
of types is being looked at.


[Do I guess right?]
