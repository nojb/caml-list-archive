That Erlang is niche-specific is exactly my point -- it's a niche that is
ripe for major productivity improvements, and I can believe a factor of
10:1 for Erlang over traditional languages within that niche.

Other niches are less likely to show such gains, IMO -- even theorem
provers and compilers.  A gain of 10:1 means that you could write in 5
weeks using OCaml what it would take you a year to write in C.  I've used
SML and C/C++ to write compilers, and I didn't see anything like that sort
of improvement.  Even if OCaml is more productive than SML, it still seems
unlikely to me to reach a 10:1 improvement, at least for most people.

I really think you should be careful when trumpeting productivity
improvements. People have seen a lot of hype for various technologies, and
are understandably sceptical.  It's best if you can produce actual figures
(this is hard, of course).

I don't think it's worthwhile to distinguish between "languages",
"libraries" and "tools", when considering productivity.

OK, I'll take that on board.
