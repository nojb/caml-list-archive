Which site have you been looking at?

The Ensemble site is at www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble, there is
a link
to it from the Horus site (www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Horus). As for
updates,
the last time the homepage was touched was 23-July-02, and the last
distribution is
from the same date.

As for complexity, it as actually gone done, and we've been able to throw
away some
code as OCaml has evolved. I don't think C has evolved much (C99 ?) in any
way that
it had helped us.

You can take my word for it, the line count, complexity etc. in a C version
that does the
same as Ensemble was a lot higher.

Do you have links/references? (Although the fact that ML is more productive

than C is quite believable to me) I found Horus/Ensemble web site. It looks

like it has not been updated in 5 years[1]

> [...] why are you using C++?

It's very easy to give simple examples of when C++ is much more productive
than C in programs defined by their I/O (If anyone needs such examples: a)
reverse a file, b) reverse lines in a file c) /usr/bin/sort ). The
situation
seems to be different with O'Caml vs C++.

Oleg

[1] Maybe the complexity has cought up with them eventually :)
