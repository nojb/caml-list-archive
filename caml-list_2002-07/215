I completely agree with you on those, somewhat impossible to obtain and
prove, productivity ratio gains. 1:3 to 1:10 is reasonable.

However, an interesting ratio seems to be forgotten in the discussion:
infinity :)

I mean, I know a lot of problems that could simply not have been
solved in any other language, and in this casess we observe this
extreme limit ratio.

No flame, please: I know that SML or Haskell could do roughly speaking
the same as Caml could do for the programmer, I also know that once
the program has been written and is fairly stable you can rewrite it
in any other language you want, even C++ or Java, provided you have
enough time and money. I also do know that there are a lot of
situations where you do not have enough time and/or money...
