Yes. That's it. I had to specify a -I option in the Makefile 
to allow gcc to find the headers.

Compiling the CVS version is no real problem, but it tends 
to be slightly less stable than the distro, so I tend to 
prefer to stick with the distro for production work. Well, I 
guess I'll have to update my source directory and bootstrap it.

Reading your Makefile I had thought that stow was some 
strange name or acronym for a project you might be working 
on. Now you teach it is a package manager. Ok, I'll try it out.

Of course, I would appreciate greatly. But I do not wish to 
hassle you more than I have already. I am already idebted to 
you for writing the fftw package.

This is definitely worth the effort. But, it is such a pity 
that nothing can be done to rendere the installation 
painless until the new release is out.

Thank you very much.
