I avoid C++ as much as I can, so this is just a wild guess.  Could it
be that you're calling the wrong linker?  ocamlmltop -custom performs
its linking stage by calling the C compiler that was used to build
OCaml, usually cc or gcc.  (You can see exactly how the linker is
called by adding the flag -verbose.)  Maybe you need to use icc as the
linker, or pass some magic flag to it telling that you're using C++
libraries.  You can do that with the -cc flag, e.g.

        ocamlmktop -cc "icc <whatever options>" -custom ...

Good luck,
