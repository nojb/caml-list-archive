hello! 

none of the ocaml xml parsers out there quite served my needs, so i
wrote my own. for anyone who's interested, i put up a page about it. 

http://mikelin.mit.edu/yaxpo/

the most interesting thing about the parser is that it is all hand
written in explicit continuation-passing style (CPS) instead of using
recursion or iteration. this allows one to do some amusing things in
clever ways; for example, it is possible to "pause" parsing, returning
control to the caller, and then pick up where it left off at some later
time. 

i am using the parser in conjunction with another project i'm working
on. it's still quite preliminary, but i'm using it already to do some
'real' stuff, so i hope it can eventually be useful standalone. 

mike
