I did not misunderstand. I use multiplicative AND. All three programs give 
equivalent output when they all finish for all cases I looked at. 

However, your and Alex's programs, for examle, fail to finish processing this 
file containing 9000 rules with preconditions of lengths 1 to 10, 10 goals 
and 10 dataset points. (My patience ran out after 72 and 45 minutes of 
waiting for your and Alex's programs, respectively):

http://www.columbia.edu/~ot14/rules_test_long.input.gz (152 kB), 

while mine takes only 4 seconds. Something to think about [1]

I'd ask them if they were on any special medication.

Cheers,

[1] As I said, I certainly do not blame O'Caml for this. Just poor choice of 
algorithm.
