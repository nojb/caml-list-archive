The support for the current release of Objective-Caml (3.04) has only
been partly included into the CDK: no binary release, only a CVS
update. The reason for that was that I had to move from my old project
to a new project at INRIA, and I had not as much time as before to
work on the CDK.

As I will leave INRIA soon, and unless some volonteer here decides to
continue this work, the CDK will not support any new Objective-Caml
release (including the incoming 3.05 release). I hope this will not
disturbe too many Ocaml users. The current version of the CDK will
stay online, so that old users can extract needed code to their
software.
