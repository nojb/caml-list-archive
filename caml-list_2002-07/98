I more or less agree with you. I would like to be able to 
process XML documents in the most efficient way possible 
(which implies using O'Caml :-) ), while taking advantage of 
the currently available *standard* technology (XSLT, XPath).


Let me restate my primary request: is anyone interested in 
constituting an XML/O'Caml task force, for the sake of 
defining and implementing the official O'Caml XML processing 
API / tools. I volunteer for it, but I will not take up the 
task by myself.
