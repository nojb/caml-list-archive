Subject: [Caml-list] ocaml for Mono/.NET?
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


Are there any plans to port ocaml to .NET?  Given that the Mono
implementation of .NET is coming along nicely, having an ocaml compiler
that can compile to .NET IL would greatly increase ocaml's visibility, not
to mention solving some of the library and packaging issues that keep
coming up with ocaml.  I know about the F# project, but that implementation
appears to be only for a subset of ocaml, and is controlled by Microsoft.
I'd be happier with something from the core ocaml team.  Of course, MY
motivation is that I'd like to be able to write nifty graphical apps in
ocaml under Linux.  After all, once you learn ocaml, C# is not really very
tempting ;-)

Given that the ocaml team are compiler wizards, you'd think that this
wouldn't be that big a deal.  Am I being unrealistic?  Maybe M$ can
underwrite a grant...
