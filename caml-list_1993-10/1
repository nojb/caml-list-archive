The PC and Macintosh versions will soon be distributed on floppy disks
by INRIA. Before releasing Caml Light on floppy disks, we would
greatly appreciate if you could quickly download and test the
Macintosh or PC versions and report any problem encountered.

This release is mostly a bug-fix release and should be compatible with
Caml Light 0.5. Main changes:

* Better handling of type abbreviations.

* Debugging mode (option -g to camlc and camllight) to get access
  to the internals of module implementations.

* New library modules:
    genlex    generic lexical analyser
    set       applicative sets over ordered types
    map       applicative maps over ordered types
    baltree   balanced binary trees over ordered types

* "compile" command at toplevel (especially useful in the Macintosh version).

* New contributed libraries and tools:
    camlmode    Emacs editing mode for Caml Light
    mletags     Indexing of Caml Light source files for use with Emacs "tags"
    search_isos Search libraries by types (modulo isomorphisms)
    libgraph    X implementation of the portable graphics library
    libnum      Arbitrary-precision arithmetic
    libstr      String operations, regular expressions

* The 80386 PC version is now DPMI-compliant, hence it can run under Windows
  (in text mode inside a DOS windows and with no graphics, though).

* More examples, including those from the book "Le langage Caml".

The implementors can be contacted at caml-light@margaux.inria.fr.

General questions and comments of interest to the Caml community
should be sent to caml-list@margaux.inria.fr, the Caml mailing list.

Thank you for your attention.
