Thanks for the bug report. Those two will be corrected soon.

The main problem is that the Macintosh version of Caml Light does not
have the -custom compiler option, nor the camlmktop command. Libraries
containing C code, such as libstr and libnum, are therefore useless.

This said, it wouldn't be too hard to have -custom and camlmktop
working on the Macintosh; it's just that we've assumed that few
Macintosh users have MPW. Let us (caml-light@margaux.inria.fr) know if
you are interested.

Otherwise, the libraries libstr and libnum from the Unix version
should be easy to port to the Macintosh. I did the port for a close
cousin of libnum and encountered few problems.
