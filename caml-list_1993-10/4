Subject: release of Caml Light version 0.6
Status: O


Hello,

I tried Caml-Light 0.6 on macintosh. It works fine for me except few details:

	- You forgot to update the About Dialog which says it's 0.5 !!! 
	- You forgot the line "Set Echo 0" a the beginning of file camlc
	- libstr and libnum seems not availaible on the mac distribution. Are
          they available only on the UNIX version ?

Regards,
Christophe.
