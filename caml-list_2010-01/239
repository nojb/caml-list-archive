Dear colleagues,

[ Apologies for the crossposting or if you get multiple copies of this email ]

           Final call for papers for the 3rd International Workshop 
       on Software Engineering for Context Aware Systems and Applications
                                 SECASA 2010

                        a Special Session in SERA 2010
                     8th ACIS International Conference on
      Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA2010)
                   Monday, May 24 – Wednesday, May 26, 2010
                               Montreal, Canada

                   http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~sera2010/

                                 Sponsored by 
      International Association for Computer and Information Science (ACIS)

IEEE Montreal Section, Concordia University, École de technologie supérieure (ETS)


Overview

We call for original contributions on the theme of context-aware computing, focusing both on the development of practical context-aware systems and application and on the theory to support this development. Context-aware concepts are readily found in multiple applications, including distributed and mobile computing, adaptive Web applications, distributed operating systems, and distributed communities for social networking and user collaboration. More generally, context-aware computing requires that the behavior of a piece of software be aware of, and adapt to a set of underlying runtime contexts and changes thereto, where the contexts are external varying environments that may affect computation. Examples of such external environments or contexts involve time, location, situation, and user profile. Context-aware programming means writing software programs that specify how computations or behaviors of context-aware applications depend on or vary in underlying contexts. Of par!
 ticular interest are theoretical approaches to the problem of context-awareness. For example, applying intensional concepts, with possible world semantics, to context-aware computing and programming should help build a solid theoretical foundation for engineering context-aware software systems and applications. Topics of interest include all aspects of software engineering for developing context aware systems and applications. Research papers as well as papers reporting practical experiences and applications of the above topics are all welcome.

Topics include but are not restricted to:

- Software development process for context-aware systems and applications
- Requirements engineering for context-aware systems and applications
- Context-aware software design and development process
- Modeling and simulation of context-aware systems and applications
- Formalism and abstraction of context-awareness in systems and applications
- Software architecture and design patterns of context-aware systems applications
- Quality of context-aware systems and applications
- Programming languages and systems for context-aware systems and applications
- Testing, verification, and validation of context-aware systems and applications

Submission, Review, and Publication

Papers will be submitted in PDF format following the SERA2010 template.

The papers are due on: February 1st, 2010. The authors will receive acceptance notifications on March 1st, 2010. The camera ready papers & registration deadline is March 15th, 2010.

Submitted papers must not be previously published or be under consideration for publication elsewhere. All papers accepted for the session will be published in the proceedings of the 8th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications (SERA2010). The selection procedure includes a review of each paper by at least three SERA2010 PC members.  Experience papers will be accepted based on the relevance of the problems they tackle.  Research papers will be accepted based on the relevance of the research questions to practice and the soundness of the research method deployed.
