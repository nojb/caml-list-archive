Job description:

We are currently looking for a Post-Doc position at the Department of
Computer Science, University of Bologna, to work on the CerCo FET-Open
EU Project (see description below). The gross salary is 36000 euros per
year. The University of Bologna is the oldest western university and the
Department of Computer Science (http://www.cs.unibo.it/en/), located in
the historic city center, has strong expertise in theoretical computer
science and logic and it participates to several national and
international projects. The Post-Doc will join the HELM team, leaded by
Prof. Asperti, whose members work in the domains of Type Theory and
Mathematical Knowledge Management. The CerCo project is headed by
Dr. Sacerdoti Coen. The candidate will benefit from exchange opportunity
with the other project participants (University Paris-Diderot, Paris,
and University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh). The candidate will not have any
teaching duties.

Requirements:

Candidates should have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and previous
experience in either Type Theory (in particular Interactive Theorem
Proving) or Compiler Development, and being proficient in functional
programming languages.

Starting date:

The starting date will be decided together with the candidate and could
not be before March. The contract is for two years. The candidate should
contact sacerdot@cs.unibo.it for further information.

Project description:

The CerCo FET-Open EU Project is aimed at producing the first _formally_
_verified_ _complexity_preserving_ compiler for a subset of C to the
object code for a microprocessor used in embedded systems. The output of
the compilation process will be the object code and a copy of the source
code annotated with _exact_ computational complexities for each program
slice in O(1). The exact computational complexities (expressed in clock
cycles and parametric in the program input) can then be used to formally
reason on the overall code complexity. The source code of the compiler
will be formally verified using the Matita Interactive Theorem Prover
(http://matita.cs.unibo.it), based on a variant of the Calculus of
(Co)Inductive Constructions.
