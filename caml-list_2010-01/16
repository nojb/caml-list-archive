OCaml is not dying out at all (v3.11.2 is being prepared, v3.12.0 is
coming soon). 

Of course, the core OCaml distribution (the one shipped by INRIA), is
missing some features. You can use libraries/alternative compiler to
have these features back (cothreads, jocaml, camlp3l). 

The only point of the whole discussion -- which is a recurring point by
some of those who participate -- is the lack of shared-memory
parallelism in the core language. Other languages like C or C++ are also
lacking this support in their core definition... I.e. there is way to
do it but you need to use pthread or Win32 thread.

All in all, you can go a long way writing your tools with OCaml without
encounting these problems. For the topic you describe, OCaml is a good
choice.
