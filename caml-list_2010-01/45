1. It is written in OCaml and I can extend it with OCaml code to fit my
needs :-)

2. It already provides:
 - syntax highlighting (based on the underlying gtksourceview widget,
   which is quite limited but is simple to use)
 - standard edition features (search, query-replace, transpose
   words, ...)
 - powerful layout: horizontal or vertical split, tabs, "recursively"
 - a system of views to edit each file with specific view
   (for example, there is a view to browse ocamldoc dumps)
 - an ocaml mode with:
   + some automatic indentation, even if it stops on syntax errors
     and sometimes get confused (it is based on a lexer and a stack,
     not a parser)
   + launching compilation process and jumping to error and/or warning
     locations,
   + analyze of stack traces output to allow me to jump at each point
     of the trace (see http://home.gna.org/cameleon/snippets.en.html)
   + using .annot files to display types of expressions,
   + a predefined command to switch between .ml and .mli file,
 - some other modes (latex, R, ChangeLog, Makefile)

3. Additional plugins can be easily defined, like the oug plugin:
  http://home.gna.org/oug/gettingstarted.en.html#gs:cameleon

4. One can improve the display of a source file to get advantage of
  UTF8 characters, like in the Greek-ocaml extension:

It seems to fit points 1-7 of Daniel's list :)
