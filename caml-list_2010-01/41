My colleague edits OCaml code with vim (in fact we share it -- I edit
the same code with emacs) and he seems to like it.

One advantage of vim is that it comes with a good OCaml mode built in.
The OCaml mode that ships with emacs is pretty horrible compared to
tuareg-mode, which you have to install separately (albeit just a
apt-get/yum install away).
