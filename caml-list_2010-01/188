I'm glad you were able to wade through the new codebase and adapt.

I'm not convinced that the batteries/ocaml* tools were useful - can 
people weigh in on this?

Ocamlbuild should have a global directory for packages to install their 
own tag extensions, allowing most users to omit myocamlbuild.ml files 
from their directory.

"Open in" should be replaced soon in ocaml proper, implicit "open 
batteries" seems a bad idea IMHO.

Should be fixed now, a point release should come out within the week.

Needs fixing.  Added to issues tracker.

I still use ocamlbuild with the old myocamlbuild.ml to compile my projects.

<*>: pkg_batteries, thread

is the main line in my _tags file I need.

Would it help to use a wiki to keep track of these things?  All my code 
is already adapted to the new system, so I don't find regressions 
anymore to record.

I'm happy to push this forward, and there's a lot of good to add.  
Patches welcome.
