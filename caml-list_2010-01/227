Yes indeed there is.  For years we maintained an out of tree patch to
support this for Fedora/ppc64:

http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/F-12/ocaml/ocaml-3.11.0-ppc64.patch

However Fedora 13 (onwards) has relegated ppc (32 & 64 bit) support to
status of a "secondary architecture"[1], which effectively means we
don't care about it.  For this reason I dropped this patch and don't
intend to maintain it.

The patch itself seems relatively trouble-free.  We built all the
Fedora packages with it, and only a couple had problems compiling on
ppc64.  Since I never had access to a real ppc64 machine, I was never
able to determine if these build problems were because this patch is
faulty or for some other unrelated reason, so YMMV.

Rich.
