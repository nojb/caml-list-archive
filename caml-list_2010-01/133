The Batteries Included project has come under new management since David 
Teller moved on. The project has gone through a process of 
reorganization and is finally ready for a release. We've rethought a lot 
of the structure decisions of the old codebase to make it easier to use 
and develop.

Major changes:
* Builds in 10 seconds, plus 10 seconds for documentation (on my system)
* Depends only on Camomile and Findlib
* Syntax Extensions now optional
* Less magic in build system
* Allows smaller executable creation

We're using OMake instead of ocamlbuild and a much more stock ocamldoc 
for documentation generation. All the modules we provide are standard 
modules, no [module Array = struct include Array ... end] magic except 
in batteries.ml which ties everything together for convenience. Of 
course there's a bunch of bug fixes and additional functions.

We're using Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/) for version 
numbers, meaning we're taking backwards compatibility very seriously. 
This is our 1.0.0 release, but we don't expect to stay at it very long. 
We're looking forward to fixing any bugs you find.
