Thank you for your work on batteries. Here are a few comments that I
have, having "migrated" my source code to this new version.

First, I appreciate the reduction of dependencies. This makes it much
more reasonable to share code using batteries.

On the negative side, my greatest concern is about outdated
documentation : I found it very difficult to know what had changed, and
how to adapt my code. These changes range from the deletion of some
features (batteries/ocaml* tools,  myocamlbuild.ml, "open in" syntax
extension, implicit "open Batteries") to minor API changes (naming of
Standard, Data, Shell modules, no more Different_list_size exception, no
more Queue.enum...). Also, there seems to be a packaging bug which
requires using -thread in the ocamlfind command.

So, I spent a significant time replacing my old 1-line ocamlbuild
command by a real Makefile (also because of a strange and probably
unrelated linking bug which I still don't fully understand). I believe
that an updated compiling howto is really needed, as well as a list of
the main deleted features with respect to the last release, allowing
users to estimate how much change their code will need.

Other than that, I have not found any regression or other problems in
this new release of the library, and I'm looking forward to see its
further development.
