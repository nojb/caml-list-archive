So, just to be crystal clear (which in this cases is essential), can we
consider this as a statement that ExtLib will stop its development here
seeing Batteries as its own successor?  Or is it something else?

I know that de facto, large ExtLib development has stopped a while ago,
but having a statement such the above will terribly help the community
of programmers in orienting their choices and understanding the panorama
of available extended libraries. It would also help distributions to
decide where to put their packaging efforts (hint hint :-)).

If it is indeed the case that you intend to "pass the baton" to
Batteries, it would be nice to have such a notice on the ExtLib project
page at http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/ .

Thanks for your feedback,
Cheers.
