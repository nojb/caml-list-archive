FWIW, the merits of this release are almost entirely Edgar's, he took up
the whole refactoring work from the previous Batteries design on his
shoulders.

Yes, this has been discussed extensively on the batteries-devel archive.
That's why this release is called "Batteries Included 1.0.0" and not
"AAA batteries" as initially thought.

On this, I also have a very brief public service announcement: the
Debian package ocaml-batteries-included will, obviously, migrate to this
1.0.0 release. If any of the readers has good reason to want to keep
both this and the old-style Batteries please mail me, but note that the
old code is currently unmaintained, so I'd support that at worst for a
single release cycle (so you better be convincing).

Cheers.
