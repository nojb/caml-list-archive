Hello.

I've been trying to reuse the mlgame codebase, and I've encountered a 
weird issue. When linked into native code or into bytecode, the library 
works fine, and the system exits with a 0 errorlevel.

However, when trying to #require the package from the toploop, I get the 
following error.

I am wondering how to use a debugger with libraries in the toplevel. As 
/usr/bin/ocaml is bytecode and that the exception is raised from OCaml 
and not from C code, I do not have a backtrace:

My humble guess is that there is a IO conflict with the toplevel's 
interactive write/read on stdin/stdout, but I'd like to know how to 
trace that.

All the best,
