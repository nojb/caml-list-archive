Submit your paper via the web-based conference management system following
the instructions below:

 * First, please review the IEEE PDF specifications.
   http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/pubs/confstandards/pdfs/IEEE-PDF-SpecV401.pdf
   
 * Go to the Conference Management System and follow the instructions on the
   "Electronic Submission Page" that it takes you to.
   http://acis.cps.cmich.edu:8080/SERA2010/submit.html
   
 * The file that you submit should include the paper title, abstract, keywords,
   and introduction followed by the body of your paper. The author's name and
   address MUST NOT appear in this file. This is to facilitate a blind review.
   
 * Upload your full paper in two column format (not to exceed 10 single-spaced
   pages) via the web-based conference management system in PDF format, or you
   can submit your paper in the final manuscript format.
   
 * The format of the final manuscript should be in a two-column format and 8 pages
   in length. Up to an extra 2 pages (total of 8) can be purchased at registration
   time (see registration form for pricing).

 * Please select at least two keywords from the drop-down menu and check boxes.
   If you cannot find the right category in the drop-down menu then please enter
   a category for your paper in the summary. We need this information when
   determining reviewers for your paper.

Submissions, refereeing, and all correspondence will be conducted by e-mail.
All papers must be submitted through our Conference Management System.

   http://acis.cps.cmich.edu:8080/SERA2010/submit.html
 
The program committee will review each submission and judge it with respect
to its originality, significance, and relevance.
