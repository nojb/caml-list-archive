I am sorry, but I am sure of that. I ran some tests to ensure that the  
problem
is coming from that particular point.

I didn't expect to change myself such a deep feature in ocaml, but I  
hoped
that you or somebody in your team could. Could it be possible to have  
everything
8 aligned on a 32-bit platform with minimum efforts ? Any help is  
welcomed !

Is there a 64-bit PowerPC Linux (ELF) support in ocaml ? I thought it  
was only
a 64-bit PowerPC OSX (Darwin) support...

Thank you to Goswin von Brederlow and Pascal Cuoq for their answers,  
but I should
say that I really prefer to use the GC as usual, without rewriting it :)

Christophe
