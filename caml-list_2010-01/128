Theme and Goals

Applications on the web today are built using numerous
interacting services; soon off-the-shelf CPUs will host hundreds
of cores; and sensor networks will be composed from a large
number of processing units. =A0Many normal software, including
applications and system-level services, will soon need to make
effective use of thousands of computing nodes. At some level of
granularity, computation in such systems will be inherently
concurrent and communication-centred.

To exploit and harness the richness of this computing
environment, designers and programmers will utilise a rich
variety of programming paradigms, depending on the shape of the
data and control flow. Plausible candidates for such paradigms
include structured imperative concurrent programming,
stream-based programming, concurrent functions with asynchronous
message passing, higher-order types for events, and the use of
types for communications and data structures (such as session
types and linear types), to name but a few. Combinations of these
abstractions will be used even in a single application, and the
runtime environment needs to ensure seamless execution without
relying on differences in available resources such as the number
of cores.

The development of effective programming methodologies for the
coming computing paradigm demands exploration and understanding
of a wide variety of ideas and techniques. =A0This workshop aims to
offer a forum where researchers from different fields exchange
new ideas on one of the central challenges for programming in the
near future, the development of programming methodologies and
infrastructures where concurrency and distribution are the norm
rather than a marginal concern.

Topics of Interest

Submissions are invited in the general area of foundations of
programming languages for concurrency, communication and
distribution. Specific topics include: language design and
implementations for communications and/or concurrency, program
analysis, session types, multicore programming, use of message
passing in systems software, interface languages for
communication and distribution, concurrent data types,
concurrent objects and actors, web services, novel programming
methodologies for sensor networks, integration of sequential
and concurrent programming, high-level programming
abstractions for security concerns in concurrent, distributed
programming, and runtime architectures for concurrency,
scalability and/or resource allocations. Papers are welcome
which present novel and valuable ideas as well as experiences.

Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit a five-page abstract in PDF
format by 22nd January using the EasyChair proceedings
template available at:

http://www.easychair.org/easychair.zip

Abstracts and full papers should be submitted using EasyChair:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dplaces2010

Preliminary proceedings will be available at the workshop.
The post-proceedings of the workshop will be published in
a journal (the past post-proceedings were published in
ENTCS and EPTCS).

Please address enquires to am@cl.cam.ac.uk and kohei@dcs.qmul.ac.uk,
with a subject field containing "[PLACES]".
