                            COORDINATION
 12th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages
             http://discotec.project.cwi.nl/COORDINATION

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

Coordination 2010 seeks high-quality papers on programming languages
and coordination models, middleware, services, and algorithms that
separate behavior from interaction, therefore increasing modularity,
simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software
development. The conference focuses on the design and implementation
of models that allow compositional construction of large-scale
concurrent and distributed systems, including both practical and
foundational models, run-time systems, and related verification and
analysis techniques.

Past incarnations of Coordination have emphasized foundations.
However, given the increasing importance of concurrency in almost
every software domain, the organizers of Coordination 2010 are keen
to provide a strong forum for high-quality papers that address
practical aspects of concurrent programming models; for example,
application of concurrency to novel domains, comparisons of
alternative programming models on important problems, or
domain-specific languages.

* Publication *

Each paper will undergo a thorough process of review and the
conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS series.

* Program Committee Chairs *

Dave Clarke   Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
Gul Agha      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA

                                DAIS
                10th IFIP International Conference on
          Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems
                 http://discotec.project.cwi.nl/DAIS

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

The DAIS conference series addresses all aspects of distributed
applications, including their design, implementation and operation,
the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering
methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and
practice reports. This time we welcome in particular contributions
on architectures, models, technologies and platforms for large scale
and complex distributed applications and services that are related
to the latest trends towards bridging the physical/virtual worlds
based on flexible and versatile service architectures and platforms.

* Publication *

Each paper will undergo a thorough process of review and the
conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS series.

Extended versions of selected best papers published in DAIS'10 will
be invited for publication in a dedicated special issue of
Wiley Software: Practice and Experience

* Program Committee Chairs *

Frank Eliassen     University of Oslo, Norway
Ruediger Kapitza   University of Erlangen, Germany

                           FMOODS & FORTE
                12th IFIP International Conference on
      Formal Methods for Open Object-based Distributed Systems
                30th IFIP International Conference on
      FORmal TEchniques for Networked and Distributed Systems
             http://discotec.project.cwi.nl/FmoodsForte

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Scope *

The joined conference FMOODS & FORTE is a forum for fundamental 
research on theory and applications of distributed systems. The 
conference solicits original contributions that advance the science 
and technologies for distributed systems, in particular 
in the areas of:

   * component- and model-based design
   * object technology, modularity, software adaptation
   * service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid and mobile
     computing
   * software quality, reliability and security

The conference encourages contributions that combine theory and 
practice, address problems from the development of distributed 
systems, and present novel solutions with formal methods and 
theoretical foundations. FMOODS & FORTE covers distributed computing 
models and formal specification, testing and verification methods. 
The application domains include all kinds of application-level 
distributed systems, telecommunication services, Internet, embedded 
and real time systems, as well as networking and communication 
security and reliability.

* Publication *

Each paper will undergo a thorough process of review and the
conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the
LNCS series.

* Program Committee Chairs *

John Hatcliff   Kansas State University, United States of America
Elena Zucca     University of Genoa, Italy
