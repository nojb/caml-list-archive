    LoCoCo 2010 --  Workshop on Logics for Component Configuration
   Workshop of SAT at FLoC 2010, Edinburgh, Scotland, July 10, 2010
                   http://lococo2010.mancoosi.org/
                        First Call for Papers
                   
                                 
Scope:
======
Modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide
the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution,
but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large
repository of possible choices, and configuring these components according
to user needs, resource constraints, and interdependencies with other
components.  Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic
of great importance for many application domains. Some well-known examples
of complex systems of components in the world of Free and Open Source
software are the different distributions for GNU/Linux, BSD, or Eclipse
plugins.

Understanding and solving these questions is an attractive research
topic since the problems to be solved are complex and interesting for
researchers working on solving techniques, and on the other hand have
the potential of high impact on the way the software we all use
everyday is developed and deployed. Not only adequate logical
formalisms to represent a configuration problem are required, but also
sophisticated reasoning technologies to deal with large amounts of
data. Further relevant aspects include diagnosis of failed
configuration settings and an intelligent behavior dealing with user
preferences.

This workshop will focus on logic-based methods for specifying and solving
complex configuration problems for software components.  The goal of the
workshop is to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in
the area of component configuration of software systems, using different
modeling and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programming,
description logics, satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop will be
an opportunity to discuss common and complementary solutions for solving
component configuration.

Topics:
=======
Main areas of interest include, but are not restricted to:
o Configuration problems and models: knowledge representation and
  acquisition, incomplete knowledge, inconsistent knowledge, etc.
o Reasoning methods for solving configuration problems: constraint
  satisfaction and optimization, SAT solving and extensions, integer 
  programming, local search, symmetry breaking, etc.
o Interactivity: user preferences, machine learning, distributed
  environments, etc.
o Applications and tools: case studies, current challenges,
  application reports, etc.

Invited Talk
============
An invited talk will be given by Carsten Sinz (University of Karlsruhe).

MISC 2010
=========
The first Mancoosi International Solver Competition will be held in
conjunction with the LoCoCo workshop.

Important Dates
===============
Friday, March 26   Submission deadline
Friday, April 23   Notification about acceptance
Friday, May 21     Final paper due
Saturday, July 10  Workshop

Submission and Publication
==========================
We welcome submissions of various types of presentations related to
the topics of the workshop, such as
- full research papers
- abstracts of ongoing work
- tutorial overview papers
- summaries of research projects
- system descriptions, if possible including system demonstration at the
  workshop. These must provide the means to download and evaluate the
  system, with preference to distribution under an open source licence.

Papers presented at the workshop will have to carry an open access
licence agreement. We will attempt to publish the papers at an
open access archive of workshop proceedings. Details will be posted
later.

Submitted papers must not exceed a limit of 10 pages, but authors may
provide pointers to additional online resources if necessary.  Papers
may be submitted in the formats Postscript or PDF. Details of the
exact page style to be used will be posted later.  Submissions will be
handled through easychair at

  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lococo2010.
