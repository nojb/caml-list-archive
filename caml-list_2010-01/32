I believe there are several issues surrounding the QPL license that much of 
the OCaml distribution is under:

1. You do not have the right to distribute your source code freely and must 
distribute only independently (e.g. patches only).

2. The "initial developer" is given rights to your derivative work.

3. The QPL is not GPL compatible so your derivative work cannot use GPL 
libraries.

See:

  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

Note that OCaml's tools are under the QPL, including ocamllex and ocamlyacc. 
So you cannot even use that code to write a syntax highlighter for your 
editor without being subject to these requirements.

You could always ask nicely if they mind you violating their license. :-)
