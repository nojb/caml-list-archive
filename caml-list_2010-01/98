[Apologies for duplicate postings]

     The 9th International Conference on
      MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

                   MKM 2010

          http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/mkm/

      CNAM, Paris, France, 8th-10th July 2010


               CALL FOR PAPERS
    

Mathematical Knowledge Management is an innovative field at the
intersection of mathematics, computer science, library science, and
scientific publishing. Its development is driven, on the one hand, by
new technological possibilities which computer science, the Internet,
and intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by
the increasing demand by engineers and scientists for new techniques to
help in producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated
mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:.

* Representations of mathematical knowledge
* Repositories of formalized mathematics
* Mathematical digital libraries
* Diagrammatic representations
* Multi-modal representations
* Mathematical OCR
* Mathematical search and retrieval
* Deduction systems
* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
* Authoring languages and tools
* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
* Web presentation of mathematics
* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
* Computer algebra systems
* Collaboration tools for mathematics
* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows

MKM 2010 welcomes research papers and workshop proposals with links to
the above topics. The conference proceedings will be published in the
Springer-Verlag series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).

More information about the MKM conference series can be found at the MKM
Interest Group Webpage: http://www.mkm-ig.org/


Submission Categories
=====================

Papers may be submitted in one of three categories: full papers, short
papers or system descriptions.

Both full papers and system descriptions should not exceed 15 pages,
must be original and not be submitted for consideration elsewhere. Full
or system description papers that are accepted will be published in the
conference proceedings. A submission not accepted as a full paper or
system description will automatically be considered as a short paper.

Short papers are of a less formal nature. They are intended to provide a
forum for the presentation and discussion of works in progress or ideas
that are not (yet) in a suitable form for submission as a full or system
description paper. They may be up to 5 pages in LNCS style. Depending on
the number of short papers accepted, presentation may be as a short talk
or as a poster. It will be at the discretion of the programme committee
to decide whether individual short papers will be accepted for
presentation only or for presentation and publication in the conference
proceedings.

The development of working systems in the field of Mathematical
Knowledge Management is a major undertaking of significant value to our
community. Papers describing such systems, however, are particularly
difficult to compare to non-system development based research with
respect to criteria common in reviewing. For this reason, papers in the
system description category will be considered separately and an
evaluation of their special contribution with be taken into account in
the review process.


Review Process
==============

* Authors must submit an abstract by the abstract submission date.

* The full paper, of any of the three categories, should be received by
  the paper submission date.

* Authors will then be sent initial reviews of their submissions.

* Authors then have the option of, within one week, submitting a single
  response to the reviews, limited to 500 words, in which they can
  clarify any issues or anser any questions that the reviewers had about
  their submission. This response can be submitted only once and cannot
  thereafter be resubmitted or modified.

* Final reviews and acceptance rejection decisions will be sent to the
  authors by the final notification date.
