Sorry for answering very old message.  I was looking to camomile
related email and found this message.

Camomile do have substring (SubText module) and output_char (This is
done by CharEncoding module).   I'm not sure that EoF is required.
The idea behind Camomile is that channels raise End_of_File exception
when no character is available to read.  I think today most file does
not use EOF character to signify the end of file.  They simply
terminates.

As I stated, Camomile does have things you suggested.  It is different
matter whether Extlib shoud have them.  This is the matter for
judgement of Extlib team.

What is the benefit of it?
