Tools like quilt and git-rebase are now so good at handling "base +
patches" that I wouldn't say this is much of an issue these days.

At Red Hat we routinely deal with kernel + 100s of patches on top,
many of which conflict, and freely inserting and removing patches in
the middle of the stack, and rebasing, with few real issues.  (Not in
this case for licensing reasons, but so there's a clear chain of who
wrote what, and what was applied to what).
