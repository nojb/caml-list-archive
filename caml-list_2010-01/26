I use Emacs+Tuareg but I wouldn't call it my "favorite" because I loathe it. 
Two good reasons to use it are autoindentation of OCaml code with ALT+Q and 
type throwback on the currently selected expression with CTRL+C CTRL+T.

OCaIDE looked good for something Eclipse-based when I tried it:

Eclipse is grindingly slow, cumbersome and remarkably confusing for a GUI app 
but at least OCaIDE is still under active development.

There is also the OCaml Development Tools (ODT) project:

  http://ocamldt.free.fr/

but it hasn't seen an update in 11 months.

I think the best way to write a decent editor for OCaml would be to write one 
using LablGTK for the GUI and camlp4 to parse OCaml code.
