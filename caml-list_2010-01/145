Well, you create a bytecode executable under GPL. You therefore include=20
the OCaml bytecode runtime. You'd be distributing part of the bytecode=20
runtime under the GPL, and I somehow feel there's a fish in doing so.

This is just a question I'm asking myself. I do not have a hard opinion=20
on that. Im just asking to collect advice from people on this list who=20
might have wondered the same kind of things. That's all.

All the best,
