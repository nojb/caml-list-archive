Dear fellow OCaml users,

Summary: We (Citrix Systems) are looking for OCaml programmers to join our =
team
in Cambridge, UK.

We use OCaml extensively in the "xapi tool-stack": the control-plane used i=
n the
Xen Cloud Platform[1] on which the widely used XenServer server virtualisat=
ion
product[2] is based. XCP aims to provide a complete open-source cloud
infrastructure platform with a powerful management stack based on standards=
-based
APIs, support for multi-tenancy, SLA guarantees and detailed metrics for
consumption based charging.

We are looking to recruit top-class engineers to work on the tool-stack; ap=
plicants
must have a good knowledge of data structures and algorithms, experience of
programming in the context of large systems and general aesthetic good tast=
e when
it comes to code and architecture. Our code base is significant and varied:=
 over
130,000 lines of OCaml, solving problems ranging from the low-level (Xen hy=
percalls)
to the high-level (resource pool management), to the compiler-driven (gener=
ating
language bindings for our Xen datamodel).

Our ideal candidate will have:

* significant experience of applications programming in high-level language=
s (such
  as OCaml :-)
* an aptitude for implementing (and reasoning about) complex concurrent,
  distributed systems
* the skills required to contribute to both the architectural design and
  day-to-day development of a large code-base
* strong communication skills and problem solving ability
* a determination to deliver great products that perform brilliantly and me=
et
  our customers' needs

So if you want to tackle interesting and challenging programming problems a=
nd
contribute to an innovative, fast-growing product that is already used by t=
ens
of thousands of customers across the world, please don't hesitate to send m=
e
your CV.
