I acknowledge that you are not a lawyer, nor that you play one on TV.

To my understanding the LGPL requires that you be able to replace the=20
LGPL'd library by another library (including an updated version of the=20
library). To this extent, it (very roughly and very quickly) imposes=20
conditions on the stub code interfacing the two libraries, and you need=20
to be able to reproduce the compilation steps. Very roughly... I'm not a=20
lawyer either. Nor do I play one on TV.

I do not believe (but I may be mistaken) that this conflicts with the=20
static linkage of the main executable. But if you have the ocaml runtime=20
getting linked in some way or the other, then the LGPL becomes somehow=20
not very handy. Is this the main reason?

My question about GPL is mostly the following: Can you distribute GPL=20
bytecode files? Do you have any issues when 'linking' the runtime with=20
the GPL bytecode?

Or are there other issues preventing from releasing GPL OCaml code?

All the best,

--=20
