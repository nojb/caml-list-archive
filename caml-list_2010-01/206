There are many benefits:
- better visibility among other OCaml projects 
- beginners can easily find your library
- people that don't know OCaml can easily see that they are many
  libraries for OCaml, just having a look at forge.ocamlcore.org
- integration of news from your project directly into the feed of the
  forge which goes to planet.ocamlcore.org
- people that could fill a bug report have a high probability to be
  subscribed to forge.ocamlcore.org for their own projects

On the other hand, I don't like to criticize but Sourceforge is not
cristal clear with UI (I agree that GForge/forge.ocamlcore.org is also
not very good at this). Moreover, we do have a lot of problems with
tracking new release of Sourceforge projects in Debian: we cannot easily
access download section.
