      5th International Workshop on Higher-Order Rewriting
                   (Affiliated with RTA'2010)
              Wednesday July 14, 2010, Edinburgh, UK

                 http://hor.pps.jussieu.fr/10/

IMPORTANT DATES:
  March   25, 2010 : deadline electronic submission of paper
  April   20, 2010 : notification of acceptance of papers
  May     17, 2010 : deadline for final version of accepted papers

HOR 2010 is a forum to present work concerning all aspects
of higher-order rewriting. The aim is to provide an informal and
friendly setting to discuss recent work and work in progress.

HOR 2010 is part of FLoC 2010 in Edinburgh.
HOR 2007 was part of RDP 2007 in Paris, France.
HOR 2006 was part of FLoC 2006 in Seattle, USA.
HOR 2004 was part of RDP 2004 in Aachen, Germany.
HOR 2002 was part of FLoC 2002 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

TOPICS of interest include (but are not limited to):
  APPLICATIONS:   proof checking, theorem proving, generic programming,
                  declarative programming, program transformation,
                  automated termination/confluence tools
  FOUNDATIONS:    pattern matching, unification, strategies, narrowing,
                  termination, syntactic properties, type theory,
                  complexity of derivations.
  FRAMEWORKS:     term rewriting, conditional rewriting, graph rewriting,
                  net rewriting, comparisons of different frameworks.
  IMPLEMENTATION: explicit substitution, rewriting tools,
                  compilation techniques.
  SEMANTICS:      semantics of higher-order rewriting, categorical
                  rewriting, higher-order abstract syntax, games and
                  rewriting

  to be a platform to discuss ongoing research we
  are also interested in abstracts describing work
  in progress, or problems in higher-order rewriting.
  Please use the EasyChair page
