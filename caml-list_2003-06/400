In my experience, it's completely safe to use the macros no matter where the
code is called from.  You can omit them only when that would be safe, (i.e.
you don't allocate anything into the caml heap).  You can get away with not
being nice to the GC only when you don't do anything that can trigger the
collector.  This means that if you do any alloc, alloc_tuple, copy_string, 
etc., then you must use them.  It's not only for windows DLLs.
