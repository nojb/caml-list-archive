Berkeley/Oakland sounds good to me. You should note that families 
traditionally plan reunions the weekend after the 4th. I won't be available 
Monday the 14th and should devote Tuesday the 15th to business, so don't 
think I can make it before Wednesday the 16th.

So, 16th, 17th or 18th are good for me. However, my wife may object to 
Friday night, so I recommend the 16th or the 17th.

As someone said, "the best computers are the ones between our ears" (at 
least for some things).

Food: I avoid onions, sugar and fat. I don't much like ham or beets. Could 
The Little MLer make something of that?
