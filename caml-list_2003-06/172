Not really.  Chapter 6 of the reference manual ("The Objective Caml
language") was written with the intent of defining the OCaml language
and not just its current implementation, following the model of the RnRS.
This is apparent, for instance, in the fact that it explicitly says
that the evaluation order for some constructs is unspecified in the
language, while the implementation imposes a particular evaluation
order.

Still, chapter 6 is still a long way (in term of precision and ability
to reimplement the language from scratch) from a good informal
standard like RnRS.  Moreover, many users seem to find it more useful
for the documentation to describe the actual implementation in as much
details as possible, rather than an hypothetical "standardized"
subset...

It helps if the e-mail address you subscribe to the list is the same
address you're subscribing from.
