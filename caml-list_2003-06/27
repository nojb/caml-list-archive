That really is NOT true. Make is NOT installed
on a wide class of platforms (Windows).

On the other hand Python is available for Windows
and most other platforms.

So why bother with crud like make, when you can
write a Python script?

I'm lazy, I just made a list of module,
and check the file times for where to start,
but there is no reason you can't write a more
sophisticated checker -- after all, you can


	os.system('ocamldep ' + filename)

to get dependencies, then build a dependency
tree from them in Python without that much fuss.

Yeah, of course .. you could use Ocaml instead
of Python .. and that is GUARRANTEED to be installed,
since you're using it, right?

So unless I'm totally wrong .. for a single directory
build you could make a harness:

	ocamlbuild prog1 prog2 ..


that would just work, no makefile needed.
