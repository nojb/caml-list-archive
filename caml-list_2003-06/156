The same can be achivieved with type constraints. But maybe it's the
best to offer both possibilities.

I've started and played around a little bit with different ways to
extract the information from the .ml file. I think the easiest way
to do it is the write a generator for ocamldoc. I'll clean up the code

tomorrow). Then we can discuss everything else.
