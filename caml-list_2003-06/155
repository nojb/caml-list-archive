I guess annotation in the comment is preferrable, because that allows the 
interface be more specific or general than the implementation.

I have raised the same issue last year. See the thread "automatic extraction 
of mli file?" at http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200210/msg00273.html . 

My idea is to conceive the procedure as part of literate programming in OCaml, 
though the feedback indicates my idea is not popular among the OCaml gurus by 
that time.

I still believe the tool is very valuable and worthwile to develop. Or it can 
be accomplished by enhancing ocamldoc. But I didn't try it.

If anybody wants to develop the tool, I'd be glad to discuss it further.
