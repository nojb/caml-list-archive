Yeah, I didn't mean it worked in a single build instance (Xavier's
replying to my feature request in your link, and yes, hopefully
that'll make it into the next release :), I just meant it works for
generating an mli file if you just want the text file.  In
other words, if I want an mli from an ml, ocamlc -i will generate one
that I can then use for later.  The output fix will make it workable
in a makefile, which will be even better!

Now if it only mattered for decoupling compiles!  :)
