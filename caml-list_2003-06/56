>This is not an issue for the byte-code compiler, ocamlc.  Can't you use that?

This was covered earlier.  My project is a game which has "real time" 
feedback loops and it just isn't runnable on the bytecode 
compiler.  There's more detail in the archive.

The noinline workaround would be fine with me, as I've said before.  Or, 
better yet, some kind of checksum thing that also handles inlined functions 
and knows when they've changed as well.  Both would be the best, because 
with the former you could completely control when you get a rebuild, and 
with the latter you can minimize them with no performance penalty.  Both 
useful tools to have at your disposal.

Thanks, and likewise!  Even the power of functional programming has yet to 
make me productive in the face of this.  :)
