Bonjour Alan,

Welcome to the dates and time users' camp! Too bad that there is no
support for that kind of stuff in our favorite language :(

We must be a bit more precise than that: we should check that the size
field is positive and lesser or equal than 1.

In effect:

- a 0 sized char scanf specification has a special useful meaning (see
Scanf.mli for details): it means ``pick'' the current character
without reading it (in order to test its value and decide what to do
next),

- a 1 sized char scanf specification seems to be harmless.

I will try to had a static check in the type-checker (the usual Caml
way), orelse a runtime failure in Scanf (the usual way of more
conventional programming languages).

Amicalement,

Pierre Weis
