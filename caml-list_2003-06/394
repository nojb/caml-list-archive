Dear Camllists,

We're seeing some long compile times from ocamlc and ocamlc.opt.
I would like to try to identify in what part of the compiler the
time is being spent, so for the last hour I have been trying to
compile ocamlc.opt with 'ocamlopt -p' so that I can profile the compiler.
But I have not been able to figure out how to do this.

  make CAMLOPT='ocamlopt -p -nostdlib -I stdlib' opt.opt

does not seem to work.

Can anyone advise me how to build an ocamlc.opt that I can profile
with gprof?


Norman
