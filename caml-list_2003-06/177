If you want to know the difference between Camlp4 and Scheme macros, add the 
difference between Camlp4 and Lisp macros to the difference between Lisp and 
Scheme macros: C - S = (C - L) + (L - S)   :)

Lisp has much simpler syntax than O'Caml (some say that Lisp has no syntax), 
so any kind of "pre-processing" is easier. Also, when you define a Lisp 
macro, all functions, values, types, etc. that were or will be defined or set 
before you call the macro can be used in the macro definition.

As to Scheme macros, I'm familiar with them very superficially (i.e. from 
reading about them) My understanding is that they are quite a bit less 
powerful than Lisp macros, so they don't let you do "arbitrary" things, but 
the above considerations still apply.
