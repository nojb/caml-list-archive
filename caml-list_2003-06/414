Yup, private also doesn't work with tuples.

Private only works with new record types and sum types that you declared. 
Think about it. What would it mean to declare some set of polymorphic variant 
tags as "private"? 

As Jacques Garrigue said in another message, polymorphic variants are somewhat  
inimical to abstract types, and private doesn't make much sense without type 
abstraction. Since one needn't predeclare variant tags or qualify them with 
module paths, it makes sense that private doesn't apply.
