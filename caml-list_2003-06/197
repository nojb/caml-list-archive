I'll give it a try, although my answer is not authoritative...
If PF_PACKET is Linux only, as I believe it is, it is unlikely that it 
will be
added in the default Unix library, which mostly conforms to Posix 
standards.
On the other hand, it should be fairly obvious for someone to write 
another
version of socket() that supports it, and package it in a "Linux" 
module.
--f
PS: Don't assume that your question is simple because you know what 
PF_PACKET is...
