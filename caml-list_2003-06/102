Having an .mli that may or may not be machine generated would probably 
cause unnecessary problems.

You could also generate the .cmi from the .ml; this is already done if 
it doesn't already exist.  Making minor additions to the top-level 
compiler syntax to indicate whether to exclude or make abstract 
definitions in the .ml when generating the .cmi shouldn't be too 
difficult.
