IMPORTANT DATES

November 24, 2003    Deadline for submission
January 15, 2004     Notification of acceptance
February 18, 2004    Final version in electronic form
March 27-28, 2004    Workshop in Barcelona
           
AIMS AND SCOPE


Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an expressive 
semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, communication and 
interaction. It can be used for specifying a wide range of systems and 
languages in various application fields. It also has good properties as a 
metalogical framework for representing logics. In recent years, several 
languages based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed 
and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers 
with a common interest in RL and its applications, and to give them the 
opportunity to present their recent works, discuss future research 
directions, and exchange ideas. 

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,

* foundations and models of RL;
* languages based on RL, including implementation issues;
* RL as a logical framework;
* RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to
   - object-oriented systems,
   - concurrent and/or parallel systems,
   - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,
   - specification of languages and systems;
* extensions of RL, including
   - real-time and probabilistic extensions,
   - tile logic,
   - rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications;
* verification techniques for RL specifications, including 
   - equational and coherence methods, and 
   - verification of properties expressed in modal and temporal logics;
* comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims,
  including
   - rho-calculus,
   - structural operational semantics, 
   - concurrency calculi,
   - dynamic algebras.

SUBMISSIONS


Submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee for inclusion
in the proceedings, which will be available at the time of the workshop 
and are expected to be published in the Elsevier ENTCS series.

Papers must contain original contributions, be clearly written, and 
include appropriate reference to and comparison with related work. 
They must be unpublished and not submitted simultaneously for publication 
elsewhere. Papers (of at most 15 pages) should be submitted electronically, 
preferably as PDF files, to the workshop email address  

            wrla2004@sip.ucm.es

providing also a text-only abstract, and detailed contact information 
of the corresponding author.  

The final program of the workshop will also include system demonstrations 
and two invited presentations by

  Gilles Dowek               Ecole Polytechnique & INRIA, Palaiseau
  Mario Rodriguez-Artalejo   Universidad Complutense de Madrid 

Based on the quality and interest of the accepted papers, the program
committee will study the possibility of preparing a special issue of a
scientific journal in the field.
