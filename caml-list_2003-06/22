Maybe it is better to be even more explicit.

Registration of a global variable v is achieved by calling 
register_global_root(&v), with v initialized to Val_unit, before 
allocating and storing a valid value in v for the first time.

On the other hand, some ocaml libraries (which are also examples) which 
use register_global_root, do not always follow this rule. i.e. 
install_signal_handler uses it like this:

  signal_handlers = alloc(NSIG, 0);
  register_global_root(&signal_handlers);

Is this also allowed?

All this also raises a question about the remove_global_root call, are 
there any special precautions I need to take just before or just after 
calling remove_global_root? Or can it be called at any time?
