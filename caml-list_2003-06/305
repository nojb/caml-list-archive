It's me again with my get_image problem. Sorry for the word "windows" in my 
previous mail, i have to make the programm work under both Linux and windows.

I forgot to precise, it's a build with MinGW, and because of version 3 of gcc, 
I replaced -fnative-struct with -mm-bitfields in the Makefile (perhaps this has 
nothing to do with the point).

I repeated the tests on another computer also running windows (same build), 
same results: get_image gives a white image, but a black one when it's bigger 
than 300x300 pixels.

Thanks for your help,
Jean-Baptiste.



I'm also interested in participating to a ICFP team near Lyon or Grenoble.
