As far as i understand the caml gc, it only scans blocks pointing to memory
blocks allocated through caml allocation functions
The reason of this is to allow pointers C values allocated C heap to be
pointed directly by caml values
(As shown in the unix-curses exemple at
http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/htmlman/manual032.html#htoc224)

if you try to allocate C values in C malloc heap, it just won't work (your C
values won't be scanned, and those allocated in the original caml heap
only pointed by your caml values in C heap, will be reclaimed too soon)

Hope this helps ...
