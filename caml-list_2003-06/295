I've a problem using the Graphics library under Windows. Precisely,
get_image doesn't seem to work.
lineto and fil_rect work (I didn't take the time to test all the functions),
but I can't use the camlimages library.
Thanks for any help,
Jean-Baptiste.

Here is a code sample :
#load "graphics.cma";;
open Graphics;;
open_graph "";;
moveto 50 10; lineto 10 50;;
 (*I get a line, perfect.*)
let img = get_image 0 0 60 60;;
draw_image img 20 20;;
 (*the line is cut because of the clipped image, but no other line appear.*)



camlimages is able to clip images onto the graphics window, so make_image
and draw_image seem to work (I've also tested them). But when trying to
capture the graphics windows via Graphics.get_image and dump_image, I get
either a black image or a white one (perhaps depending on the size (!)).
