It looks like they are switching mirrors the last few days. It looks
like at least umn(US) and belnet (BE) have my files correctly but
twtelecom (US) seems late (and gives an error on download).

Maybe it just takes time.

One week ago my preferred mirror was deleted from the list and that gave
errors and an almost impossible situation to change till I decided to
drop all the cookies from sourceforge and select a new mirror.
