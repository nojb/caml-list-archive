 Hi all,

  I am developing a project wich uses threads, lablgl and lablglut.
  Sometimes I need to code on another machine, where I can't install
  glut-devel and in general don't have lablgl and lablglut.

  Is it possible to create a custom toplevel wich is both statically
  linked and stand-alone? I mean that it should run my .ml files without
  looking for other ocaml files on the system. I've tried with this
  command:

   ocamlmktop -thread -custom -o a.out -cclib -static -I \
  /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/lablgl -I /usr/lib/ocaml/3.06/lablglut unix.cma \
  threads.cma lablgl.cma lablglut.cma  -cclib -lXi


  but it complains about not finding Pervasives.cmi, and anyway I would
  have to take all lablgl and lablglut mli's with it. Is there a way to
  have just the toplevel around? It would be also nice to be able to be
  able to distribute such a beast with a compiled-in library.

  Thanks for attention

  Vincenzo

 PS: I can't write to the list using my ordinary SMTP, wich is 
smtp.tin.it, maybe it's been blacklisted for some reason?
