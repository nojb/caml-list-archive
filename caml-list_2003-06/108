Yeah, but not if things are changing a lot and you have big types and 
whatnot.  Cutting and pasting or doing the ocaml -i thing is a bit of a 
pain.  I could see it being a useful tool.  Basically anything that 
eliminates repetition is a positive.

Don't forget "3) having a separate interface allows you to decouple 
implementations which is important for large scale software".  Oh wait.
