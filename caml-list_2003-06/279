Precedence: bulk

Ocamldoc didn't understand the following annotations:

type srcref =
   string (** filename *) *
   int (** line number, 1 origin *) *
   int (** starting column, 1 origin *) *
   int (** ending column, 1 origin *)

Anyone else think this might be useful?

It also won't label polymorphic variant components ..
type X = [
	| `A (** an A *)
	| `B (** a B *)
]

but from the guide examples the following is
supposed to work and does:

type weather =
| Rain of int (** The comment for construtor Rain *)
| Sun (** The comment for constructor Sun *)

-------------------------------------
Minor qibble: the html formatting of
function signatures isn't very sweet.
When one overflows, the new line starts
hard on the left margin (it should be indented).
Also, if there is going to be an overflow,
all the components at the top level should be
on a separate line like:

	val f:
		A -> 

		B ->
		C ->
		D

or perhaps

	val f:
		A
		-> B (* comment .. *)
		-> C (* comment .. *)

Another minor quibble: I tried to latex
the -latex output, and it couldn't find
the style file ocamldoc.sty. I had to copy
it manually to where I needed it. But the -html
generator copies the style.css file where its needed.
