Hello, everyone--

I have an issue with name conflicts in libraries. I am working on an
application that uses both Mlgraph and Camlimages; in general, it will
render drawings in PostScript and then convert them to PNG. But both
Mlgraph and Camlimages have modules named Geometry, so if I simply try
to load both libraries in the toplevel, I get an error message saying
that

  File /opt/ocaml-3.06/lib/ocaml/mlgraph.cma is not up-to-date with \
    respect to interface Geometry

Now, I understand that if I am compiling a program, I can create
separate compilation units that isolate the functions calling on the two
different libraries; in fact I successfully compiled a small test
program that way a couple of days ago. But that's not what I want to do
at the moment. Right now I am trying to build up a set of modules
gradually and test them interactively.

Can anyone suggest a good way to handle the name conflict when using the
toplevel?

Thanks in advance.
