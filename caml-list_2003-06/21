I think that both Chris and the manual are right.  The manual actually
instructs the programmer to register a global root v "just before a valid
value is stored in v for the first time".  Key word: "just".  In other
words, as Damien says, no allocations are allowed between registration and
storing a value.

Apparently more than one reader of the manual has missed this detail.  Would
it be clearer to say "immediately before" instead of "just before"?
