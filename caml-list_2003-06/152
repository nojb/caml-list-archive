I need some asynchronous channels in my current project. Some of those
have to block when the maximum capacity is exceded, others are
one-position buffers wich should have overwrite semantics. Are there
already done libraries or should I roll my own? 

If I have to implement the buffer myself, what's the best way, a buffer
thread wich uses the Event module or rewriting everything from scratch
with condition variables to spare a thread?

Thanks for attention
