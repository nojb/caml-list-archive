I was reminded that I dropped the ball on putting some kind of 
meeting/dinner for San Francisco ocaml programmers a couple years back.  I, 
uh, got busy.  :)

Anyway, let's ressurect the plan and do it.  Nothing fancy, just a casual 
meeting.

To attempt to solve the n-body problem, please reply to me privately if 
you're interested in attending _WITH_ what dates in the evening (say, 
7pm-9pm-ish) you can make it to Berkeley/Oakland during the week of July 
14th - 18th.  Also include what kind of food you will _not_ eat if we meet 
at a restaurant.  An incredibly sophisticated program will grind over the 
data, producing the perfect meeting time and place.

Chris
