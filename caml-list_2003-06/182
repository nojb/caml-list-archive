Call for organizers:

The Advanced Functional Programming School, 2004

http://www.cs.uu.nl/~johanj/afp/

We solicit plans for organizing the next Advanced Functional Programming
School. Since 1995 there have been four Schools on Advanced Functional
Programming in

*	2002, LNCS 2638, Oxford,      UK
*	1998, LNCS 1608, Braga,       Portugal
*	1996, LNCS 1129, Olympia, WA, USA
*	1995, LNCS 925,  Baastad,     Sweden

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goals of this series of schools are:

*	Bring computer scientists, in particular young researchers and=20=

programmers,
up to date with the latest afp techniques.
*	Bridge the gap between results presented at programming =
conferences=20
and
material from introductory textbooks on functional programming.
*	Use afp techniques in "programming in the real world".

The approach we take to achieve these goals in the schools is

*	In depth lectures about afp techniques, taught by experts in the=20=

field.
*	Lectures are accompanied by practical problems to be solved by =
the
students at the school. The problems guide the students' learning to a=20=

great
extent. This implies that there has to be a lab at the school site.
*	Group work is stimulated, especially because the practical =
problems
will typically be=A0 too large for a single person.

Functional programming is interpreted broadly, to encompass languages
that are strict and lazy, pure and impure, typed and untyped,
sequential and concurrent.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lecture notes of the Advanced Functional Programming schools are
published after the school, see LNCS 925, 1129, 1608, and 2638. The
organizers are responsible for publishing the lecture notes.

Please submit a proposal for organizing the next advanced
functional programming school. Your proposal should include:

- the approximate dates
- the name of the organizers (preferably more than one)
- a programme: lecturers (a mix of young and bright, and old
and wise lecturers is preferred) and topics (keep in mind that
applications of functional programming are very important for
the school).
- a location (remember you need around 25 computers)
- a budget, including an estimation of the registration and hotel costs
   per participant.

The programme, location and budget don't have to be completely
fixed when you submit your proposal, but there should be
sufficient information to review your proposal. Your proposal will
be reviewed by the steering committee of the Advanced Functional
Programming Schools, consisting of

Pedro Henriques
Graham Hutton
Johan Jeuring
Erik Meijer
Greg Morrisett
Chris Okasaki
Simon Peyton Jones
Tim Sheard
Doaitse Swierstra
Phil Wadler

Submit your proposal to johanj@cs.uu.nl on or before
