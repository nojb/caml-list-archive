Ah ... quite so.

I knew that, of course, but hadn't given it much thought.

Hmm ... would it be unreasonable to request that this be noted in the
Unix module docs? Maybe I shouldn't take for granted that a Unix API
spells things the same as a shell, but that seems most intuitive for
people like me who have never done systems programming.

There's nothing difficult about using the octal notation, of course.
It's just unexpected, and surely I'm not the only one who wouldn't have
expected it.
