For me, the lure of GitHub is the level of automation and scripting that it
permits, so I prefer having all my packages on there simply so I can write
code to take care of release tedium (using the self-referential bindings at
https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github).

There's also the network effect of using other people's tools that are built
on top of it.  For instance, I've just been playing with continuous integra=
tion
and refreshed Mike Lin's scripts; this lets you hook up executable tests th=
at
run in the cloud (for free, for open source projects) in minutes of work:

http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html

An interesting feature of Travis is the post-success hook, which can be used
to trigger further work (such as deeper OCamlot tests, for OPAM).

You may be able to handle the Forge interaction through that mechanism, for
instance by doing an SVN commit from the Git push hook. I'm experimenting
with building ocamldoc for every package and pushing it to the gh-pages
branch (so that it's published on GitHub pages automatically on every push).

Incidentally, the scripts that convert the OCaml SVN to Git are available:
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org-scripts/tree/master/vcs-sync/svn-ocaml

They are a bit smarter than the average SVN->Git convertor and create real
git branches for SVN tags.  This may help you if you wish to migrate from
SVN to Git (even if the Forge supports git, it probably requires this=20
conversion process too).
