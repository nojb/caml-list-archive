Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Beta release of OPAM 1.1.0

We are very happy to announce the beta release of OPAM version 1.1.0!
=20
OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and
a Git-friendly development workflow which. OPAM is edited and
maintained by OCamlPro, with continuous support from OCamlLabs and the
community at large (including its main industrial users such as
Jane-Street and Citrix).
=20
Since its first official release last March[1], we have fixed many
bugs and added lots of new features and stability improvements[2]. New
features go from more metadata to the package and compiler
descriptions, to improved package pin workflow, through a much faster
update algorithm. The full changeset is included below.
=20
We are also delighted to see the growing number of contributions from
the community to both OPAM itself (35 contributors) and to its
metadata repository (100+ contributors, 500+ unique packages, 1500+
packages). It is really great to also see alternative metadata
repositories appearing in the wild (see for instance the repositories
for Android[3], Windows[4] and so on[5]). To be sure that the
community efforts will continue to benefit to everyone and to
underline our committment to OPAM, we are rehousing it at
`http://opam.ocaml.org` and switching the license to CC0 (see [6],
where 85 people are commenting on the thread).
=20
The binary installer has been updated for OSX and x86_64:
- http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam_installer.sh
=20
You can also get the new version either from Anil's unstable PPA:
    add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa-testing
    apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install opam
=20
or build it from sources at :
- http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-1.1.0-beta.tar.gz
- https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/releases/tag/1.1.0-beta
=20
NOTE: If you upgrade from OPAM 1.0, the first time you will run the
new `opam` binary it will ugrade its internal state in an incompatible
way: THIS PROCESS CANNOT BE REVERTED. We have tried hard to make this
process fault-resistant, but failures might happen. In case you have
precious data in your ~/.opam folder, it is advised to backup that
folder before you upgrade to 1.1.
=20
Happy hacking,
Thomas, on behalf on all the OPAM team
