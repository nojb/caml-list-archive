Subject: Re: [Caml-list] UFO (United Forces of OCaml)

Hello Gour,


OCaml is multi-paradigm in nature.
There are multiple ways (multiple trade-offs) a thing can be done.

Let's adopt the Open Source way:
- At first there is nothing (i remember the days when OCaml had zero MySQL
bindings)
- Then they are multiple things (the number of MySQL bindings is 3 or 4)
- Then some become unmaintained, some others gain attraction
- Then (in a few years) you end with 2 or 3 good / excellent ways to do it

Same about books, documentation, tutorials, IDEs ...
In contrast with Caml-Light, OCaml has no 'official' book, tutorial or IDE.
However i expect many to come, some to become almost forgotten,
some to be cited as a reference point (Ocaml evolves continually).  
Actually there is an 'official' OCaml 2.2 book, but somewhat obsolete now.

Just my humble opinion of course.

I understand that, as a beginner, you may consider diversity as a danger.
It seems your software is more fragile because some basic block could be
discontinued.
I would answer : the software fragility lies in the programmer,
not in the language ecosystem being too weak.  

Actually GTK 2.24 looks very great when a good theme is applied.
You can have this metal brush look. Or this white water-button look.
Or whatever look you can imagine (or design). 
Plus LablGtk is an excellent binding that makes GTK programming far much
easier.

Otherwise i would warmly welcome a Qt binding.
However, i dont wait for it, i go ahead.
Even if i switch to Qt some day i don't loose my time,
because knowing GTK, whatever language, is an asset anyway.   

I hope i am not too much rude with you,
I apologize if i am,

- Damien
