That's just the answer I was afraid to get. :-)

C(++) is certainly not on my radar. :-)

That's true, but I wonder whether I should trade type-safety for fast
and productive environment?

It is supposed to be open-source project and we do not have any
deadlines to meet, so I consider that less bugs/debugging is better.

I consider that GTK lost its course and it's not even attractive to
LInux users, what to say about Windows/Mac platforms.

That I cannot comment, but I believe it's the best what OCaml has, but
having e.g. Qt bindings would probably change the picture of OCaml &
GUI, right?

Thanks a lot.
