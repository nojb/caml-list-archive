Well, as far as I'm concerned, I haven't really looked at it.

I've come to like the higher-level constructs in lablgtk and how things
are organized. I believe they take some time to find but once you've
found them, everything seems easier and simpler.
That or Stockholm syndrom.

As far as I know, wxOCaml only has a thin layer to wx currently (it
takes time to do an API that actually looks like typical OCaml).

Apart from that, I can't say much. I'll try to get a deeper look at it.
