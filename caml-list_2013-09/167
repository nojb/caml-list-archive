Oh, btw, forgot to mention that I've used ocamlbrowser quite a lot.
It has a couple issues but it's actually very nice to browse the API of
lablgtk and other libs.

Nowadays you can run it through:
  ocamlbrowser -I $(ocamlfind query lablgtk2)
(or maybe -I +lablgtk2 but that's not as portable)

I think that it has really helped me. You select GWindow, then window
then whatever you want and you have the API for that, in a small window
that doesn't eat screen space. It doesn't do anything special but I
found it efficient.

Using Merlin too is on my TODO list.
