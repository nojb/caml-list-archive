Subject: [Caml-list] APLAS 2013 - Call for Posters and Demos

(Apologies for multiple copies)

                Call for Posters and Demos: APLAS 2013

      11th Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
                          9-11 December 2013
            Melbourne, Australia (colocated with CPP 2013)
                  http://aplas2013.soic.indiana.edu/

      Submission due: 7 October 2013 (Monday), 23:59 UTC
        Notification: 18 October 2013 (Friday)

APLAS 2013 will include a poster and demo session during the
conference. The poster session aims to give students and professionals
an opportunity to present technical materials to the research
community, and to get responses from other researchers in the field.

* Scope

Poster and demo contributions are sought in all areas of programming
languages and systems, including the following topics:

- semantics, logics, foundational theory;
- design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi;
- domain-specific languages;
- compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
- program derivation, synthesis and transformation;
- program analysis, verification, model-checking;
- logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming;
- software security;
- concurrency and parallelism;
- tools and environments for programming and implementation.

* Submission

Each presenter should e-mail a 1-2 page abstract in PDF to the poster
chair (Shin-ya Katsumata: aplas2013-poster AT kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp) by
7 October, 23:59 UTC. The abstract should include the title, style of
the presentation (poster only or poster plus demo), author(s),
affiliation(s) and summary of the work. We will announce the accepted
presentations on 18 October. We hope to accommodate every
presentation, but may restrict them (based on relevance and interest
to the community) due to space constraints. The format of the poster
will be announced later.

* Important Dates

Submission due: 7 October 2013 (Monday), 23:59 UTC
Notification: 18 October 2013 (Friday)
Conference: 9-11 December 2013 (Monday-Wednesday)
