I consider distributing binaries a failure: the failure to have source
code than can be easily and properly built on or for the corresponding
platform.

For C++ (and OCaml) you have ABI-compatibility issues because of
toolchain changes. Incompatibilities are only waiting to happen.

That said, I fully get your point but talking about prebuilt binaries is
not the right way to measure portability imho. :)
