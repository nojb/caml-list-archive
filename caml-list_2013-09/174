Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.01.0

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birthday of Ir=C3=A8ne
Joliot-Curie by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.01.0. This
is a major release that introduces type-based disambiguation of
constructors and record field labels, a whole lot of new warnings, and
many other features described in detail at the end of this mail.

It is available here: < http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html >

This is released as source for the time being, binary versions will
probably be available in the near future.

We would like to take the opportunity to thank all the contributors,
bug reporters, and packagers who are helping us make OCaml better.
Thanks also to the people who tested the beta and RC versions and
reported on the results: Byron D. Allen, David Allsop, Mathieu Barbin,
John Carr, Anil Madhavapeddy, Christophe Raffalli, David Sheets, and
if I've forgotten someone, please forgive me.

Happy hacking,

-- Damien Doligez for the OCaml team.


High-level description of the changes:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Language features:

- It is now possible to have several variant constructors or record
  fields of the same name in scope, and type information will be used
  to disambiguate which one is used -- instead of always using the
  last one.

    ocaml -w +41 # warning 41, disabled by default,
                 # warns when the last-in-scope is used without type inform=
ation

    # type t =3D A | B;;
    # type u =3D A;;
    # let x : t =3D A;;
    val x : t =3D A
    # let y =3D A;;
    Warning 41: A belongs to several types: u t
    The first one was selected. Please disambiguate if this is wrong.
    val y : u =3D A

  This slightly controversial feature can be tweaked in various ways
  through an extensive set of warning (40, 41, 42): by converting some
  of them as errors, you can disable it completely or control its
  applicability. See
    http://www.lexifi.com/blog/type-based-selection-label-and-constructors
  for a more detailed description of the feature.

  (Jacques Garrigue, Alain Frisch and Leo P. White)

- The new warnings 44 and 45 (disabled by default) can be activated to
  warn about identifiers that are used after having been shadowed by
  an `open` construct. The `open` keyword can be written `open!` to
  silence this warning (as method! silences the method warning). No
  warning-silencing variant is available for the syntax `M.(e)`.

    ocaml -w +44

    # module M =3D struct let x =3D 1 end;;
    module M : sig val x : int end

    # let x =3D 2 in let open M in x;;
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Warning 44: this open statement shadows
    the value identifier x (which is later used)
    - : int =3D 1

    # let x =3D 2 in let open! M in x;;
    - : int =3D 1

  Warning 44 concerns all kinds of shadowing, except record labels and
  variant constructors (warning 45). Those were separated out as users
  of type-based disambiguation may want to shadow them freely, and yet
  warn on usual shadowing of value variables.

  (Alain Frisch, thanks to a request of Daniel B=C3=BCnzli)

User experience:

- The -short-path option changes the way the type-checker prints types
  to pick a short representation (eg. `string` instead of
  `StringSet.elt`). Longer types are sometimes more helpful to
  understand where the type comes from, but -short-path was found to
  help readability in functor-heavy code, such as when using Jane
  Street's Core library.
  (Jacques Garrigue, with helpful feedback from Jane Street)

- The compiler now suggests possible typos on "unbound identifier" errors
  (Gabriel Scherer)

    # Unix.read_link;;
    Error: Unbound value Unix.read_link
    Did you mean readlink?

- After ten years being deprecated, infix operators (&) and (or) now
  raise an activated-by-default warning (the existing warning 3,
  Deprecated feature). Use (&&) and (||) instead. ISO-latin1
  characters in variable names are also deprecated in this way.
  (Damien Doligez)

- Infix application operators (|>) and (@@) are added to Pervasives
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

    let even x =3D x mod 2 =3D 0
    let () =3D [1;2;3] |> List.tl |> List.filter even |> List.iter print_int
    let () =3D List.iter print_int @@ List.filter even @@ List.tl [1;2;3]


Runtime:

- Runtime support for printing general stack traces, and efficient
  generation of stack traces or exception backtraces that won't be
  printed immediately
  (Jacques-Henri Jourdan and Gabriel Scherer, Alain Frisch)

- New -with-frame-pointers configure switch to add a frame pointer to
  each stack frame. This improves the effectiveness of
  debugging/profiling tools (in particular in-kernel 'perf' tool that
  doesn't support the less invasive DWARF information approach
  developed by Mark Shinwell), at the cost of a modest performance hit.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

Background work:

- A lot of debugging for GADTs in the type system, in particular GADT
  exhaustiveness checking; uncovered an old soundness bug due to
  parametrized types implicitly considered injective in constraints
  (Jacques Garrigue, Leo P. White and Jeremy Yallop)

- Jacques Garrigue also did subtle work to allow the propagation of
  types inside all patterns, including those containing polymorphic
  variants. This propagation is needed for GADT typing and type-based
  disambiguation.

- A lot of work to speedup compilation with -annot and -bin-annot by
  (Alain Frisch, with some help from Guillaume Melquiond)

- Adrien Nader integrated (thanks to careful review by Wojciech Meyer)
  a big chunk of his cross-compilation patches; full cross-compilation
  is not yet available but keeps getting closer.

- OCamlbuild benefited from lot of bugfixes and granted feature
  wishes, as well as a shiny new testsuite
  (Wojciech Meyer, Gabriel Scherer, with some help from Gabriel Kerneis)

- Damien Doligez did tedious work reorganizing the testsuite,
  reproducing bugs in exotic settings, and setting
  a continuous-integration instance to spot build failures earlier.

- Benedikt Meurer kept improving the ARM-backend (eg. CFI
  directives support) and made general cleanups of register allocation

- Pierre Chambart integrated various performance-optimization
  patches in various spots that were easy to optimize and led to
  observable improvements; he's now working on a much more ambitious
  analysis and optimization pass that is still in the prototype phase.

- A changelog message with attributions and too much detail.
  (Gabriel Scherer)

Experimental features -- will probably change in the next versions:

- The new -ppx option allows to pass ast-to-ast rewriters as external
  programs (Alain Frisch). It is still experimental, and not yet
  featureful enough for wide usage. The forthcoming integration of the
  extension_points work of Alain will make it suitable to more
  use-cases.

- Experimental OCAMLPARAM environment variable to set compilation
  option (just as from the command-line, but easier to tweak for users
  that need to set some parameters globally for whole build)
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)

- ocamlbuild has a new -plugin-tags option that allows to pass
  arbitrary tags to the compilation of the myocamlbuild.ml
  (Gabriel Scherer). This feature is still experimental, but the aim
  is to let experts distribute reusable ocamlbuild plugin as
  libraries, instead of having users copy-paste the recipe.

Some of the external contributions:

- Valentin Gatien-Baron fixed a quadratic blowup of linktime due to
  a recent optimization of partial application primitives. He also
  spotted a missing specialization of integer comparison that degraded
  compilation times.

- Anil Madhavapeddy added ocamlbuild targets foo.byte.o, foo.byte.c
  and foo.native.o for object file production (the -output-obj
  compiler option)

- Christophe Troestler significantly improved the ocamlbuild API
  documentation, found in the "signatures.mli" file exporting
  user-visible interfaces for the OCamlbuild components accessible
  from a plugin

- Beno=C3=AEt Vaugon and Chet Murthy contributed a non-invasive fix to
  manipulation of bytecode files of size > Sys.max_string_length
  (which could happen on 32bit machines)

Type system:
- PR#5759: use well-disciplined type information propagation to
  disambiguate label and constructor names
  (Jacques Garrigue, Alain Frisch and Leo P. White)
* Propagate type information towards pattern-matching, even in the presence=
 of
  polymorphic variants (discarding only information about possibly-present
  constructors). As a result, matching against absent constructors is no lo=
nger
  allowed for exact and fixed polymorphic variant types.

- tools/eqparsetree compares two parsetree ignoring location
  (Hongbo Zhang)
- ocamlopt now uses clang as assembler on OS X if available, which enables
  CFI support for OS X.
  (Benedikt Meurer)
- Added a new -short-paths option, which attempts to use the shortest
  representation for type constructors inside types, taking open modules
  into account. This can make types much more readable if your code
  uses lots of functors.
  (Jacques Garrigue)
- PR#5986: added flag -compat-32 to ocamlc, ensuring that the generated
  bytecode executable can be loaded on 32-bit hosts.
  (Xavier Leroy)

Runtime system:
* PR#6019: more efficient implementation of caml_modify() and caml_initiali=
ze().
  The new implementations are less lenient than the old ones: now,
  the destination pointer of caml_modify() must point within the minor or
  major heaps, and the destination pointer of caml_initialize() must
  point within the major heap.
  (Xavier Leroy, from an experiment by Brian Nigito, with feedback
  from Yaron Minsky and Gerd Stolpmann)

Internals:
- Moved debugger/envaux.ml to typing/envaux.ml to publish env_of_only_summa=
ry
  as part of compilerlibs, to be used on bin-annot files.
  (Fabrice Le Fessant)
