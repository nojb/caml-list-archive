The OCaml runtime is designed so that pointers in the heap can point to 
objects outside the OCaml heap, as long as they are 2-aligned. That is, 
bindings for C libraries are allowed to return C pointers (eg. allocated 
using malloc) as OCaml values. However, I do not know how many actual 
bindings make use of this feature.
