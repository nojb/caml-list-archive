It's a bit strange. Each and every time I've been feeling the same but
with Qt and GTK swapped. Only proves that people are different though.
(and makes me wonder what is the fundamental difference)

As Kakadu mentionned, I believe it's mostly a matter of themes.
Unfortunately they tend to not evolve much.

That said, visually appealing themes are much easier to write with a DSL
and that's pretty much Edje (EFL) and QtQuick. It's both simpler and
more powerful.
Hopefully, these are getting more widespread (yay, people discover DSLs
again!).

(I found that it mostly matched what I'd like for a fairly low-level
documentation =/ )
