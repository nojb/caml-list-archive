You can have a look at a huge usage of this in my ocaml introduction:
  http://form-ocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org/
The document:
  http://form-ocaml.forge.ocamlcore.org/intro_ocaml.html
The source code:
  http://forge.ocamlcore.org/scm/?group_id=3D228

You will need stog and stog-writing:
  http://zoggy.github.io/stog/
  http://zoggy.github.io/stog/stog-writing.html

Hope this helps,
