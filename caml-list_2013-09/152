While I hope this happens, I'm not holding my breath.

That's something I disagree with, or at least don't understand.

All I ask from a GUI library is a set of widget. If that is properly
provided, I don't see which influence the library has on the scale of
the application you can do.

It's one tooolkit I haven't tried. Part of the reason was the lack of a
working WebKit binding (to tk, not to ocaml) last time I started a
project.

That said, gitk does a few weird things from time to time but I'm not
sure if it's by design or if it's because of tk.
