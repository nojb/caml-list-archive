Maybe they will achieve something stable after GTK3, but nobody knows
when it will happen and it seems that GNOME will remain the only
customer at that time.

Have you seen this one: "Finally, he said, people ask whether GTK+ is
focused on creating "small apps" or "large applications," and his answer
is "small apps." In other words, GTK+ widgets are designed to make it
easy and fast to write small apps for GNOME: apps like Clocks, rather
than GIMP or Inkscape."

Frankly speaking I'm not interested to use GUI toolkit which is designed
for writing "apps like Clocks". No wonder that more & more projects
(even DEs like LXDE) are moving towards Qt.

Sure, Qt is not perfect, but the state of GTK is sad.

Here I am trying to just be practical...for only short period of time I
was running KDE desktop (~0.9.x) and the rest of the time GTK-ones (now
I use only i3). Moreover, my preferred apps were also GTK-based, but
when I see direction where it goes, it is wise to be prepare for the
future. (/me was die-hard OS2 user, but jumped onto Linux train inn
'99)

OK -- fair-enough.

I wish you all success. EFL is surely better option than GTK.

:-)

What about Tk which seems to not look bad in 8.6.x ?
