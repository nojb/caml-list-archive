Subject: [Caml-list] Call for FLoc14/ICLP Workshop proposals

(Apologies for cross postings)
Dear all,=20

Please find attached a call for workshop proposals in FLoC14, including ICL=
P's workshops which I chair.=20

FLoC14/ICLP14 will be held in Vienna on July, 2014. Workshops collocated wi=
th ICLP14 are one of the best venues for the presentation and discussion of=
 preliminary work, novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide and interes=
ted audience. Collocated workshops also provide an opportunity for presenti=
ng specialized topics and opportunities for intensive discussions and proje=
ct collaboration. The topics of the workshops collocated with ICLP 2014 may=
 cover any area related to logic programming (e.g., theory, systems, enviro=
nments, software-engineering aspects, extensions, alternative paradigms, ap=
plications), including cross-disciplinary areas.=20=20

>>> You are encouraged to propose any ICLP-related workshop or tutorials if=
 there is evidence that this will be in favor of a stronger ICLP event. Eve=
n if there is a perception that some workshop may not have a number of enou=
gh attendants, the ICLP14 organizers would still welcome all workshop propo=
sals.

Please consider putting together a proposal, and circulating it as among po=
tentially interested colleagues. The deadline is September 30, 2013.

Best regards,

Hai-Feng Guo

SUBMISSION OF WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops=
 on topics in the field of computer science, related to logic in the broad =
sense.  Each workshop proposal must indicate at least one conference to be =
affiliated with, and among those exactly one primary hosting conference.

It is suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the relevant c=
onference Workshop Chair(s) before submitting a proposal.

Proposals should be submitted electronically to EasyChair at the following =
address:  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfloc14cfw

Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific justificat=
ion of the proposed topic, its significance, and the particular benefits of=
 the workshop to the community, as well as a list of previous or related wo=
rkshops (if relevant). A second, organizational part should include:

* contact information of the workshop organizers
* proposed primary hosting conference (and possibly other affiliated confer=
ence(s))
* estimate of the audience size
* proposed format and agenda (for example, paper presentations, tutorials, =
demo sessions, etc.)
* potential invited speakers
* procedures for selecting papers and participants
* plans for dissemination, if any (for example, special issues of journals)
* duration (which may vary from one day to two days) and preferred period

The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted wor=
kshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the hosting=
 conferences and subject to the availability of space and facilities.

Further information can be found at the FLoC 2014 Workshop Guide http://vsl=
