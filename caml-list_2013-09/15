I'm using org-mode for this (http://orgmode.org/). The support for caml
uses a session, so when you evaluate / export code the previous code is
taken into account. I've used it for courses slides (exported to beamer)
and for caml exams (where the type of the expected answers is computed
from the correction, which is of course not exported).
