I've also had some binaries reported as virus. It was incredibly funny
to try to compile something only to have the content of "ocamlopt.exe"
disappear; not the file, only the content.

IIRC the same often happens with GCC.
I don't know how an antivirus heuristic could not trigger on compilers,
bytecode interpreters or VMs, bindings to many low-level and possibly
uncommon functions, installers that will require admin rights(*) and
UPX'ed files. Or the combination of all of these.

(*) Windows' UAC will trigger automatically for any executable named
"setup.exe" or "install.exe"
