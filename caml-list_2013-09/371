the kind of bindings you're describing (Lua) essentially inhibit any
improvement to the GC (such as parallelization, which is bound to happen
some day) or to the runtime. It seems like it would be much better if
bindings from C (Lua, for example) called more general functions or
bindings present in the runtime's C code aka an API. Given that it seems
like some bindings currently don't use an API but inspect values closely, I
don't see any solution other than adapting the things that require changes.
Hopefully the majority of C bindings (at least from the ocaml side) can be
moved to ctypes, and can therefore be made more generic.
