Dear all,

I'm lecturing in November at a week-long seminar on rigorous (ie functional=
) programming techniques for computational science. There is funding for be=
d, board, and part of travel costs. If you're in contact with computational=
 scientists who might be interested, could you pass this on, please? Applic=
ation deadline is 15th September.=20

Thanks,
Jeremy

OBERWOLFACH SEMINAR ON=20
MATHEMATICS FOR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTATION

Mathematisches Forschunginstitut Oberwolfach
24th to 30th November 2013
http://www.mfo.de/occasion/1348a


MOTIVATION

Computational science today depends crucially on simulations, which are typ=
ically based on algorithms that have a sound mathematical justification.  F=
or example, an iterative procedure such as Newton's method is motivated by =
appealing to the properties of twice continuously differentiable functions =
and their Taylor expansion, which also yield convergence conditions and app=
roximation estimates.

These algorithms are then implemented on a computer, using a programming la=
nguage such as Fortran or C++.  Often, the implementation will introduce ne=
w computational steps and otherwise modify the structure of the mathematica=
l algorithm - for handling or reducing round-off errors, enabling more effi=
cient memory access, exploiting parallelization, and so on.  As a result, t=
he final implementation usually looks very different from the mathematical =
algorithm, and the justification given for the latter does not directly ext=
end to the former.  But if we are to ensure the correctness of simulations,=
 we need mathematical certainty for both.

We aim to bring to the scientific programming community mathematical techni=
ques that allow us to achieve the transition from mathematical algorithm to=
 efficient implementation in a principled manner, with each step motivated =
by the application of a mathematical theorem. The intended participants are=
 students and researchers in computational science (including areas such as=
 engineering, biology, and economics), and any scientists dissatisfied with=
 state of the art in transforming mathematics into code. They will be equip=
ped subsequently to make a significant contribution to increasing the corre=
ctness of the simulations that play such an important role in current scien=
tific activity.


CONTENT

This rigorous approach to programming is most easily presented in the frame=
work of functional programming: program calculation can be reduced to strai=
ghtforward equational reasoning, provided that all program variables are im=
mutable.  Accordingly, we will introduce the basic syntax and ideas using H=
askell, currently the one of the most successful functional programming lan=
guages.  The emphasis is not on functional programming as such, and even le=
ss so on a specific language such as Haskell; but rather, on the mathematic=
s behind program development, which can then be transferred to other contex=
ts, such as imperative programming, or parallel programming.

This mathematical foundation lies in category theory, which unifies what co=
uld otherwise appear as a large collection of "bite-sized" theorems for pro=
gram development, too many for any developer to remember and use efficientl=
y.  Category theory is a broad subject: we will limit ourselves to what is =
essential as a framework for datatypes and programs (functors, universal pr=
operties, algebras, monads). The many examples, such as fusion (loop elimin=
ation), optimal bracketing (important for non-associative operations such a=
s those on floating-point numbers), or parallel programming skeletons (such=
 as Google's MapReduce), will be readily understandable and relevant to sci=
entific computing practitioners.

One of the most effective ways to counter floating-point errors and to obta=
in validated results is to use interval analysis, which however requires mo=
re complex data structures and algorithms than is common in other areas of =
scientific computation.  Extending a function on real or floating-point num=
bers to one on intervals is a matter of symbolic computation, similar to th=
e symbolic differentiation or integration that is performed by tools such a=
s Mathematica.  The problem of obtaining the best extension is complicated =
by the fact that some familiar properties (such as that x-x=3D0 for any x, =
and distributivity of multiplication over addition) do not apply to interva=
ls, and is a good source of examples for calculational programming.

Finally, we will present a larger application, a generic program for inter-=
temporal optimization with dynamic programming.  This kind of problem is ub=
iquitous in economic modeling, and hence in many integrated assessment mode=
ls, such as those aiming to compute costs of climate change. It has both al=
gebraic aspects (the organization of the computation for backward induction=
), which can be tackled with the categorical methods presented, and numeric=
al ones (the local optimization techniques), where interval analysis can be=
 used.

The Seminar is organized by:

  (pflondor@yahoo.co.uk)
