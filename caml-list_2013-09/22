Subject: [Caml-list] Final CFP Post-proceedings TYPES 2013 Types for Proofs
 and Programs (open call)

TYPES is a major forum for the presentation of research on all aspects
of type theory and its applications. The post-proceedings of TYPES
2013, which was held in Toulouse, are open to everyone, also those who
did not participate in the conference. We would like to invite all
researchers that study type systems to share their results concerning
type-based theorem proving environments or type-based formal modelling, in
particular we welcome submissions on any topic in the following list:

  - Foundations of type theory and constructive mathematics.
  - Applications of type theory.
  - Dependently-typed programming.
  - Industrial uses of type theory technology.
  - Meta-theoretic studies of type systems.
  - Proof-assistants and proof technology.
  - Formalisation of proofs in type theory.
  - Extraction of implementations from proofs.
  - Automation in computer-assisted reasoning.
  - Links between type theory and functional programming.
  - Links between type theory and object-oriented programming.
  - Type theory in linguistics.
