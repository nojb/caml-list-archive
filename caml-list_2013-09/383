OK, but this means that I can't think of OCaml code running in
different threads in a simple way - I have to consider the single
runtime lock at least (if I care about performance). So maybe the
question is: how should I understand the functioning of the single
runtime lock? For example, is starvation the only thing I need to
think about?

Could you provide some pointers to these libraries? I would be very
interested in this. One thing I didn't immediately see how to do, when
reading the Lwt docs, was to provide a user interface (connect, send,
recv etc) that did not expose the fact that co-operative threads were
in the background. It also seems to me that if someone uses my library
with their code, and their code itself uses Lwt, then there is the
possibility for strange interactions (my Lwt threads are not isolated
from their Lwt threads; with system threads and system-provided
pre-emptive scheduling, you (maybe) do get some isolation/fairness
properties).

OK! So +1 for zeromq. I will check it out. Any votes for any other
libraries? OCamlMPI?

BTW thanks to everyone for taking the time to respond to these
questions, and apologies for my ignorance.
