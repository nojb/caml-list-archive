Sounds reasonable.  I can give it a try later, but if anyone feels
like experimenting, please share your findings.

For the record, the intent of this dynamic loading is to check *at
link-time* that dynamically-loaded stubs provide all the external C
functions needed by the OCaml bytecode program.  (As opposed to
failing when the bytecode program is started.)  In other words, to
detect this problem as early as if one was doing "ocamlc -custom".

Don't worry, it's only for bytecode.  Bytecode executables are already
portable across platforms, so no special cross-compilation support is
needed.  For native code, ocamlopt links C stub libraries statically,
delegating the job to the (cross-)linker.
