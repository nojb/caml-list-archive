Subject: [Caml-list] SoSyM Special Issue on Integrated Formal Methods

SoSyM Special Issue on Integrated Formal Methods

http://www.sosym.org/
http://www.sosym.org/theme_issues/
Guest editors: Luigia Petre, =C5bo Akademi University and Einar Broch=20=20

Editors-in-chief: Robert France, Colorado State University and=20=20
Bernhard Rumpe, RWTH Aachen University

Formal methods allow the modeling and analysis of various aspects of a=20=
=20
system. Modeling languages differ in the system aspects they target,=20=20
for which models can be naturally and succinctly expressed. Numerous=20=20
techniques address model analysis in these languages, specialized for=20=20
different kinds of properties. Thus, applying formal methods may=20=20
involve the modeling of different aspects of a system through=20=20
different formal paradigms. Correspondingly, different analysis=20=20
techniques will be integrated to examine differently modeled system=20=20
views, different kinds of properties, or simply in order to cope with=20=20
the sheer complexity of the system.

In recent years there has been a great deal of interest addressing the=20=
=20
scalability of such hybrid or integrated formal models and analysis=20=20
techniques. In addition, several formal methods have matured to the=20=20
point where they can be deployed on industrial-scale applications, in=20=20
big part due to their increasing tool support. The aim of this theme=20=20
issue is to provide a resource that describes the state-of-the-art in=20=20
integrated formal methods and to outline a roadmap that addresses key=20=20
challenges in this area.

The Journal of Software and Systems Modeling (SoSyM) invites original,=20=
=20
high-quality submissions for its theme issue on =93Integrated Formal=20=20
Methods (IFM)=94 focusing on topics related to IFM, including:
   =95 Requirements for integration: challenges and road-map;=20=20
combination of (formal and semi-formal) methods for system modeling,=20=20
analysis and development; architectures.
   =95 Integration phases: all integration aspects from language design=20=
=20
through verification and analysis techniques; questions with respect=20=20
to maintainability.
   =95 Integration technologies: tools for integrating formal methods=20=20
for modeling and analysis and their adoption into software engineering=20=
=20
practice.
   =95 Integration of varied software analysis methods: challenges and=20=

simulation methodologies

extended form or in a shortened form to other journals or conferences.
It is however possible to submit extended versions of previously=20=20
published work if less than 75% of the content already appeared in a=20=20
nonjournal publication, or less than 40% in a journal publication.
Please see the SoSyM Policy Statement on Plagiarism for further=20=20
conditions (http://www.sosym.org/submission/#plagiarismstatement).
   =95 Submitted papers do not need to adhere to a particular format or=20=
=20
page limit, but should be prepared using font =93Times New Roman=94 with a=
=20=20
font size no smaller than 11 pt, and with 1.5 line spacing. Please=20=20
consult the SoSyM author information for submitting papers=20=20
(http://www.sosym.org/submission).
   =95 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers.

***
   =95 Communicate your intent to submit a paper by emailing the theme=20=
