SUBMISSION OF WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for 
workshops on topics in the field of computer science, related to logic 
in the broad sense.  Each workshop proposal must indicate at least one 
conference to be affiliated with, and among those exactly one primary 
hosting conference.

It is suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the 
relevant conference Workshop Chair(s) before submitting a proposal.

Proposals should be submitted electronically to EasyChair at the 
following address:  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc14cfw

Proposals should consist of two parts. First, a short scientific 
justification of the proposed topic, its significance, and the 
particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a list 
of previous or related workshops (if relevant). A second, organizational 
part should include:

* contact information of the workshop organizers
* proposed primary hosting conference (and possibly other affiliated 
conference(s))
* estimate of the audience size
* proposed format and agenda (for example, paper presentations, 
tutorials, demo sessions, etc.)
* potential invited speakers
* procedures for selecting papers and participants
* plans for dissemination, if any (for example, special issues of journals)
* duration (which may vary from one day to two days) and preferred period

The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted 
workshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the 
hosting conferences and subject to the availability of space and facilities.

Further information can be found at the FLoC 2014 Workshop Guide
