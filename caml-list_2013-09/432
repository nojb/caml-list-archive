Then your test suite was bad. You need enough tests to cover every
code path in your code and then some. Obviously in any complex code
you will forget / miss some. But over time your tests will improve too.

Some undecidable problem, such as termination checking, have been studied by bryon cook for a long time, and it can check termination successfully for many programs. of course, it is not complete, but most program written manually have some fixed pattern, not totally random.

I sometimes write a wrapper module around the code that runs both the
old and new code and compares the result. Only when both return the
same the value is returned. Run that with a large enough test suite or
simply use it for a while and you get good test coverage without
having to define input and output values.
