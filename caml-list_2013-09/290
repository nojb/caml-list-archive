Yes, so this is what happens if you want to just run an ocaml binary on
your Android device.  If you actually want to do anything android related
at all (other than running a binary in the shell, treating your device like
it's a linux computer) then you have to run inside a VM, so you can
actually talk to the GUI, SDK, etc...
