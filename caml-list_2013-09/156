I quite strongly disagree. That developers have to become packagers for
Windows and Mac OS X has been an unfortunate fact. It doesn't prove
anything about the stability of a software.

I actually hate that. On Windows this leads to "zlib.dll" or
"zlib1.dll". You'll find hundreds of zlib libraries with these names.
Which version, which options, which compatibility?
Binaries should be built as a whole. They need to be compatible between
them and they need to be consistent. Having software developers provide
binaries guarantees that this doesn't happen.

Hmm, that explains it: I don't want to roll my own widgets. I avoid it
like the plague.
