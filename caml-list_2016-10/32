Subject: Re: [Caml-list] ocamlbuild on Windows and bash vs. cmd

I don't have an opinion on using cmd in ocamlbuild, but I have been
looking at similar things for jenga recently. With jenga the actions
generated by the rules are of the form (prog, args) and when one wants
to to do something more complicated, they have to manually build a
shell command. In the Jane Street rules we are using bash.

Going through bash is often frustrating, even on Unix. Moreover for
the public release of Jane Street packages I'd like to avoid relying
too much on bash as it has often been a source of problems in the
past.

The solution I'm aimed at is to have the jenga rules produce actions
using a small DSL allowing pipes and other things and interpret this
DSL without the use of a third-party shell, i.e. just using system
calls and threads.

It's still a work in progress but I already have the backend part
working [1]. It's aimed at being portable on Windows. The code for
Windows is written but not yet tested, I plan to do it at some point.

I imagine that it shouldn't be too use this in ocamlbuild if the [Sh]
constructor was removed and replaced by a few other constructors to
express pipes, redirections, etc...
