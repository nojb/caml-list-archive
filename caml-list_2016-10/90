Subject: [Caml-list] PEPM 2017 Call for Poster Papers (submission deadline
 Tuesday 8th November)

CALL FOR POSTERS
Workshop on PARTIAL EVALUATION AND PROGRAM MANIPULATION (PEPM 2017)

PEPM 2017 information: http://conf.researchr.org/home/PEPM-2017
Submissions: https://pepm17.hotcrp.com/

Paris, France, January 16th - 17th, 2017
(co-located with POPL 2017)

PEPM is the premier forum for discussion of semantics-based program
manipulation.  The first ACM SIGPLAN PEPM symposium took place in
1991, and meetings have been held in affiliation with POPL every year
since 2006.  PEPM 2017 will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation, reflecting the expanded scope of
PEPM in recent years beyond the traditionally covered areas of partial
evaluation and specialization.

Posters
-------

In order to maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we
solicit submission of posters.  Poster submissions are 2-page articles
in ACM Proceedings style that present preliminary work (see
"Submission guidelines" below for more details).  If accepted, the
work will be presented as part of an interactive poster session at
PEPM.

Scope
-----

Topics of interest for PEPM 2017 include, but are not limited to:

* Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
  partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active
  libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution,
  refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

* Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
  manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
  binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated
  testing and test case generation.

* Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
  metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
  languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming,
  staged computation, and model-driven program generation and
  transformation.

* Application of the above techniques including case studies of
  program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
  projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust
  tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
  benchmarking.  Examples of application domains include legacy
  program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations,
  visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing,
  middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and
  web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation,
  and security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage
submissions describing applications of semantics-based program
manipulation techniques in new domains.  If you have a question as to
whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop,
please contact the programme chairs.

Submission guidelines
---------------------

* Posters should describe work relevant to the PEPM community, and
  must not exceed 2 pages in ACM Proceedings style.  We invite poster
  submissions that present early work not yet ready for submission to
  a conference or journal, identify new research problems, showcase
  tools and technologies developed by the author(s), or describe
  student research projects.

If accepted, the work will be presented as part of an interactive
poster session at PEPM.  At least one author of each accepted
contribution must attend the workshop and present the work.

Student participants with accepted poster papers can apply for a
SIGPLAN PAC grant to help cover travel expenses and other support.
PAC also offers other support, such as for child-care expenses during
the meeting or for travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with
physical disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of
North America and Europe.  For details on the PAC programme, see its
web page.

Publication
-----------

Posters will appear along with accepted papers in formal proceedings
published by ACM Press and in the ACM Digital Library.

Keynote
-------

Neil Jones (DIKU) will give the PEPM keynote talk, titled

   Compiling Untyped Lambda Calculus to Lower-level Code
   by Game Semantics and Partial Evaluation

Submission
----------

Posters should be submitted electronically via HotCRP.

   https://pepm17.hotcrp.com/

Authors using LaTeX to prepare their submissions should use the new
improved SIGPLAN proceedings style, and specifically the
sigplanconf.cls 9pt template.

Important Dates
---------------

 * Poster submission   : Tuesday 8th November 2016
 * Author notification : Friday 18th November 2016
 * Camera ready        : Monday 28th November 2016
 * Workshop            : Monday 16th - Tuesday 17th January 2017

The proceedings will be published 2 weeks pre-conference.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date
may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The
official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose
proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the
conference is over, the official publication date remains the first
day of the conference.).
