Subject: [Caml-list] since when does ocamlc -v tells where is the stdlib
 installed?

Hello,

---
# ocamlc -v
The OCaml compiler, version 4.03.0
Standard library directory: /home/berenger/.opam/4.03.0/lib/ocaml
---

Was it always there or is this a recent addition ?

I would need to know the ocaml version from which this behavior started.
Neither Google nor mantis were my friends. :(
