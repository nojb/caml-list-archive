                     CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

          Artificial Intelligence and Theorem Proving,
                            AITP 2017
              March 26-30, 2017, Obergurgl, Austria

                     http://aitp-conference.org/2017

                        Deadline: December 1, 2016
        https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aitp2017

BACKGROUND
Large-scale semantic processing and strong computer assistance of mathematics 
and science is our inevitable future. New combinations of AI and reasoning 
methods and tools deployed over large mathematical and scientific corpora will 
be instrumental to this task. The AITP conference is the forum for discussing 
how to get there as soon as possible, and the force driving the progress 
towards that.

TOPICS
    - AI and big-data methods in theorem proving and mathematics.
    - Collaboration between automated and interactive theorem proving.
    - Common-sense reasoning and reasoning in science.
    - Alignment and joint processing of formal, semi-formal, and informal 
      libraries.
    - Methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics and science.
    - Combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning methods.
 
SESSIONS
There will be several focused sessions on AI for ATP, ITP and mathematics, 
modern AI and big-data methods, and several sessions with contributed talks. 
The focused sessions will be based on invited talks and discussion oriented.
