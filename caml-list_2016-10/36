AIMS AND SCOPE

 LPNMR 2017 is the fourteenth in the series of international meetings
 on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum
 for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic
 reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is
 to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners
 interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming
 languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge
 representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass
 theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to
 advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as
 well as their use in practical applications. This edition of LPNMR
 will feature several workshops and a special session dedicated to the
 7th ASP Competition. A Doctoral Consortium will also be a part of
 the program.

 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished
 research on all aspects of non-monotonic approaches in logic programming
 and knowledge representation. We invite submissions of both long and
 short papers on topics detailed below.

TOPICS

 Conference topics include, but are not limited to:

 1. Foundations of LPNMR Systems:
   * Semantics of new and existing languages;
   * Action languages, causality;
   * Formalization of Commonsense Reasoning and understanding
     its laws and nature;
   * Relationships among formalisms;
   * Complexity and expressive power;
   * Inference algorithms and heuristics for LPNMR systems;
   * Extensions of traditional LPNMR languages such as new logical
     connectives or new inference capabilities;
   * Updates, revision, and other operations on LPNMR systems;
   * Uncertainty in LPNMR systems.

 2. Implementation of LPNMR systems:
   * System descriptions, comparisons, evaluations;
   * Algorithms and novel techniques for efficient evaluation;
   * LPNMR benchmarks.

 3. Applications of LPNMR:
   * Use of LPNMR in Commonsense Reasoning and other areas of KR;
   * LPNMR languages and algorithms in planning, diagnosis, argumentation,
     reasoning with preferences, decision making and policies;
   * Applications of LPNMR languages in data integration and exchange
     systems, software engineering and model checking;
   * Applications of LPNMR to bioinformatics, linguistics, psychology,
     and other sciences;
   * Integration of LPNMR systems with other computational paradigms;
   * Embedded LPNMR: Systems using LPNMR subsystems.

SUBMISSION

 LPNMR 2017 welcomes submissions of long papers (13 pages) or short papers
 (6 pages) in the following categories:

   * Technical papers
   * System descriptions
   * Application descriptions

 The indicated number of pages includes title page, references and
 figures. All submissions will be peer-reviewed and accepted papers will
 appear in the conference proceedings published in the Springer's
 Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI/LNCS) series. At least one
 author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference
 to present the work. Submissions must be written in English, present
 original research, and be formatted according to Springer's guidelines
 and technical instructions available at:

    https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/conference-proceedings-guidelines

 Paper submission will be electronic through the LPNMR-17 Easychair site:

          https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpnmr2017

 Two best papers with logic programming focus will be invited for a
 rapid publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
 An additional prize of 1000 EUR, sponsored by Springer, will be
 shared out among the best papers of the conference.

MULTIPLE SUBMISSION POLICY

 LPNMR 2017 will not accept any paper which, at the time of submission, is
 under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in
 a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit
 their papers elsewhere during LPNMR's review period. However, these
 restrictions do not apply to previous workshops with a limited audience
 and without archival proceedings.

ASSOCIATED EVENTS

 WORKSHOPS - LPNMR 2017 will include specialized workshops to be held on 
 July 3 prior to the main conference.

 ASP COMPETITION - A special session dedicated to a discussion of the
 7th ASP System Competition, including the methodology of the competition,
 benchmarks used, lessons learned and, most importantly, the results and
 the announcement of the winners.

 DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM - A mentoring event where PhD students have a change
 to present their current research, get feedback from peers and senior
 researchers, and establish contacts for the future.

VENUE

 Espoo, the second largest and the fastest growing city in Finland, is
 located right next to the capital Helsinki in the coastal Finland. Espoo is
 Northern Europe's largest high-tech and innovation hub where science,
 business and culture meet the wilderness of Nuuksio National Park and
 stunning seaside environment. Espoo's location offers excellent traffic
 connections: only half an hour from the international airport and
 harbors. The main campus of Aalto University is situated in Espoo.

 The LPNMR 2017 conference will be held in the Hanasaari Conference
 center that is located on an island of its own and is only 15 minutes
 away from Helsinki center by public transport.
