Subject: [Caml-list] AI Communications: Special Issue on Automated Reasoning

CALL FOR PAPERS 

---------------------------------
Special issue of the

AI Communications

on

Automated Reasoning
---------------------------------

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
Abstract submission: January 8, 2017
Paper submission: January 15, 2017
Notification of acceptance: April 15, 2017
Final versions: June 15, 2017

BACKGROUND
----------
This special issue follows two successful 2016 events in Automated Reasoning:
Artificial Intelligence and Theorem Proving (AITP 2016) 
(http://aitp-conference.org/)
Practical Aspects of Automated Reasoning (PAAR 2016) 
(http://cs.ru.nl/paar16/).

About PAAR:
PAAR provides a forum for developers of automated reasoning tools to
discuss and compare different implementation techniques, and for users
to discuss and communicate their applications and requirements.  PAAR
brings together different groups to concentrate on practical aspects
of the implementation and application of automated reasoning tools.

About AITP:
Large-scale semantic processing and strong computer assistance of
mathematics and science is our inevitable future. New combinations of
AI and reasoning methods and tools deployed over large mathematical
and scientific corpora will be instrumental to this task. AITP is the
forum for discussing how to get there as soon as possible, and the
force driving the progress towards that.


SCOPE AND TOPICS
----------------
The focus of the special issue will be on new combination of AI and
Automated Reasoning, and on practical applications of Automated
Reasoning.

The topics of interest include:

* Automated reasoning in propositional, first-order, higher-order and 
  non-classical logics
* AI and big-data methods in theorem proving and mathematics
* Collaboration between automated and interactive theorem proving
* Alignment and joint processing of formal, semi-formal, and informal libraries
* Implementation of provers (SAT, SMT, resolution, tableau, instantiation-
  based, rewriting, logical frameworks, etc)
* Automated reasoning tools for all kinds of practical problems and applications
* Methods for large-scale computer understanding of mathematics and science
* Common-sense reasoning and reasoning in science
* Combinations of linguistic/learning-based and semantic/reasoning methods
* Pragmatics of automated reasoning within proof assistants
* Practical experiences, usability aspects, feasibility studies
* Evaluation of implementation techniques and automated reasoning tools
* Performance aspects, benchmarking approaches
* Non-standard approaches to automated reasoning, non-standard forms of 
  automated reasoning, new applications
* Implementation techniques, optimizations techniques, strategies and 
  heuristics, fairness

Participants of AITP 2016 and PAAR 2016, as well as other authors are invited 
to submit contributions.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
---------------------
This special issue welcomes original high-quality contributions that have been 
neither published in nor simultaneously submitted to other venues. Submissions 
will be peer-reviewed using the standard refereeing procedure of the AI 
Communications.

Full papers of a maximum extension of 15 pages should be prepared according to 
the AIComm style guidelines described at the following link: 
    http://www.iospress.nl/journal/ai-communications/

Papers should be submitted through the AIComm mstracker: 
    http://mstracker.com/submit1.php?jc=aic
