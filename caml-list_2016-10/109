		       FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS 

			   TABLEAUX 2017
     26th International Conference on Automated Reasoning with
	       Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods
		  University of Brasília, Brazil
		       September 26-29, 2017

		 Submission Deadline: 25 Apr 2017

		  http://tableaux2017.cic.unb.br/


GENERAL INFORMATION
  TABLEAUX is the main international conference at which research
  on all aspects, theoretical foundations, implementation techniques,
  systems development and applications, of the mechanization of
  tableau-based reasoning and related methods is presented. The
  conference will be held in Brasília from 26-29 September 2017.

  TABLEAUX 2017 will be co-located with both the 11th International
  Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems (FroCoS 2017) and the
  8th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP
  2017). 

TOPICS
  Tableau methods offer a convenient and flexible set of tools for
  automated reasoning in classical logic, extensions of classical
  logic, and a large number of non-classical logics. For large groups
  of logics, tableau methods can be generated automatically.  Areas
  of application include verification of software and computer
  systems, deductive databases, knowledge representation and its
  required inference engines, teaching, and system diagnosis.

  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

    * tableau methods for classical and non-classical logics
      (including first-order, higher-order, modal, temporal,
      description, hybrid, intuitionistic, substructural,
      relevance, non-monotonic logics) and their proof-theoretic 
      foundations;
    * related methods (SMT, model elimination, model checking,
      connection methods, resolution, BDDs, translation approaches);
    * sequent calculi and natural deduction calculi for classical
      and non-classical logics, as tools for proof search and proof
      representation;
    * flexible, easily extendable, light weight methods for theorem
      proving;
    * novel types of calculi for theorem proving and verification
      in classical and non-classical logics;
    * systems, tools, implementations, empirical evaluations and
      applications (provers, logical frameworks, model checkers, ...);
    * implementation techniques (data structures, efficient
      algorithms, performance measurement, extensibility, ...);
    * extensions of tableau procedures with conflict-driven
      learning, generation of proofs; compact (or humanly readable)
      representation of proofs;
    * decision procedures, theoretically optimal procedures;
    * applications of automated deduction to mathematics, software 
      development, verification, deductive and temporal
      databases, knowledge representation, ontologies, fault
      diagnosis or teaching. 

  We also welcome papers describing applications of tableau
  procedures to real world examples. Such papers should be tailored
  to the tableau community and should focus on the role of
  reasoning, and logical aspects of the solution.

WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS
  Proposals for Workshops and Tutorial sessions have been solicited
  in a separate call, which can be found at
    http://tableaux2017.cic.unb.br/#cfw.

PUBLICATION DETAILS
  The conference proceedings will published in the Springer
  LNAI/LNCS series, as in previous editions.

SUBMISSIONS
  Submissions are invited in two categories:

    A  Research papers, which describe original theoretical
       research, original algorithms, or applications, with length
       up to 15 pages.
    B  System descriptions, with length up to 9 pages.

  Submissions will be reviewed by the PC, possibly with the help of
  external reviewers, taking into account readability, relevance
  and originality.

  For category A, theoretical results and algorithms must be
  original, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions
  will be reviewed taking into account correctness, theoretical
  elegance, and possible implementability. 

  For category B submissions, a working implementation must be
  accessible via the internet, which includes sources. The aim of a
  system description is to make the system available in such a way
  that users can use it, understand it, and build on it.

  Accepted papers in both categories will be published in the
  conference proceedings. Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the
  llncs style and must be submitted electronically as PDF files via
  the EasyChair system:
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tableaux2017.

  For all accepted papers at least one author is required to attend
  the conference and present the paper. A paper title and a short
  abstract of about 100 words must be submitted before the paper
  submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions
  will be made available at the conference website. Formatting
  instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained via
  http://www.springer.com/lncs.

BEST PAPER AWARD
  The TABLEAUX 2017 Best Paper Award will be presented to the best 
  submission nominated and chosen by the Program Committee among 
  the accepted papers. The eligibility criteria will place emphasis 
  on the originality and significance of the contribution, but 
  readability and the overall technical quality, including correctness
  and completeness of results, will be also considered. The TABLEAUX 
  Best Paper Award was established in 2015 and it is a permanent 
  initiative of TABLEAUX.

                        FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

                            FroCoS 2017
  11th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
                           Brasilia, Brazil
                        September 25-29th, 2017

GENERAL INFORMATION
  The 11th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
  (FroCoS 2017) will be held in Brasilia, Brazil, between September 25 to
  September 29, 2017. Its main goal is to disseminate and promote
  progress in research areas related to the development of techniques
  for the integration, combination, and modularization of formal
  systems together with their analysis.

  FroCoS 2017 will be co-located with the 26th International
  Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related
  Methods (TABLEAUX 2017) and the 8th International Conference on
  Interactive Theorem­Proving (ITP 2017). The local organization of 
  all events will be organised  by Claudia Nalon (USB, Brazil), 
  Daniele Nantes (UnB, Brazil), Elaine Pimentel (UFRN, Brazil) and 
  João Marcos (UFRN, Brazil). 

SCOPE OF CONFERENCE 
  In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,
  program development and verification, artificial intelligence,
  knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an
  obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems
  for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized
  systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general
  purpose systems. This has led---in many research areas---to the
  development of techniques and methods for the combination and
  integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their
  modularization and analysis.

  The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
  (FroCoS) traditionally focusses on these types of research questions
  and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2017 seeks to offer a
  common forum for research in the general area of combination,
  modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on
  logic-based ones, and of their practical use.

  Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
    * combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order,
      temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics);
    * combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving;
    * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability
      procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical 
      frameworks;
    * combinations and modularity in ontologies;
    * integration of equational and other theories into deductive
      systems;
    * hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint
      propagation;
    * hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural
      language semantics;
    * combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems;
    * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and
      specifications;
    * integration of data structures into constraint logic
      programming and deduction;
    * combinations and modularity in term rewriting;
    * applications of methods and techniques to the verification and
      analysis of information systems.
