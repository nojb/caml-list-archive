Subject: [Caml-list] DL 2017, Call for Papers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          CALL FOR PAPERS
       30th International Workshop on Description Logics, DL 2017
           July 18th to July 21st, 2017 - Montpellier, France
                       http://dl.kr.org/dl2017/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic research 
community. It is the forum at which those interested in description logics, 
both from academia and industry, meet to discuss ideas, share information and 
compare experiences. The workshop will be held in Montpellier, France from 
July 18th to July 21st, 2017.

Important Dates (Firm Deadlines)
============
Paper registration deadline:
   April 28, 2017
Paper submission deadline:
   May 8, 2017
Notification of acceptance:
   June 12,  2017
Camera-ready copies:  
   July 3, 2017
Workshop: 
   July 18-21, 2017

Since we wanted the DL submission deadlines to be after the IJCAI notification 
date, the schedule is tight and NO DEADLINE EXTENSIONS will be possible. 


Invited Speakers
=============
* Markus Kr√∂tzsch, Technical University of Dresden
* Andreas Pieris, University of Edinburgh
* Uli Sattler, University of Manchester


Workshop Scope
=============
We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics, including but 
not limited to:
* Foundations of description logics: decidability and complexity of reasoning, 
  expressive power, novel inference problems, inconsistency management, 
  reasoning techniques, and modularity aspects
* Extensions of description logics: closed-world and nonmonotonic reasoning, 
  epistemic reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, 
  query answering, reasoning over dynamic information
* Integration of description logics with other formalisms: object-oriented 
  representation languages, database query languages, constraint-based 
  programming, logic programming, and rule-based systems
* Applications and use areas of description logics: ontology engineering, 
  ontology languages, databases, ontology-based data access, semi-structured 
  data, graph structured data, linked data, document management, natural 
  language, learning, planning, Semantic Web, cloud computing, conceptual 
  modelling, web services, business processes
* Systems and tools around description logics: reasoners, software tools for 
  and using description logic reasoning (e.g. ontology editors, database 
  schema design, query optimisation, and data integration tools), 
  implementation and optimisation techniques, benchmarking, evaluation, 
  modelling


Submissions
==========
* Submissions may be of two types:
(1) Papers accepted at some conference can be submitted as accepted elsewhere 
    together with a 1-page abstract that also specifies where the paper has 
    been accepted. 
(2) Other submissions consist of 11 pages LNCS plus references. There is no 
    page limit on the list of references. If the paper should not appear in 
    the proceedings, an additional 1-page abstract has to be submitted.

* For submissions with an additional 1-page abstract, only the abstract
  is published in the proceedings. The abstracts might not be indexed in
  dblp. This option is designed for authors who wish to announce results
  that have been published elsewhere, or which the authors intend to
  submit or have already submitted to a venue with an incompatible prior/
  concurrent publication policy. 
* All submissions may optionally include a clearly marked appendix
  (e.g., with additional proofs or evaluation data). The appendix will
  be read at the discretion of the reviewers and not included in the
  proceedings. The appendix does not need to be in LNCS format. 
* Submission page: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dl2017
* Accepted papers and 1-page abstracts will be made available electronically 
  in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings series (http://www.CEUR-ws.org/).
* Accepted submissions, be they full papers or 1-page abstracts, will be 
  selected for either oral or poster presentation at the workshop. Submissions 
  will be judged solely based upon their content, and the type of submission 
  will have no bearing on the decision between oral and poster presentation.
