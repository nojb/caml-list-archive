About iFM

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

iFM 2017 is concerned with how the application of formal methods may involv=
e modelling

different aspects of a system which are best expressed using different form=
alisms.

Correspondingly, different analysis techniques may be used to examine diffe=
rent system

views, different kinds of properties, or simply in order to cope with the s=
heer

complexity of the system. The iFM conference series seeks to further resear=
ch into hybrid

approaches to formal modelling and analysis; i.e., the combination of (form=
al and semi-

formal) methods for system development, regarding modelling and analysis, a=
nd covering

all aspects from language design through verification and analysis techniqu=
es to tools

and their integration into software engineering practice.



Workshops can have the duration of one or two days. Prospective workshop or=
ganizers are

requested to follow the guidelines below and are encouraged to contact the =
workshop

chairs if any questions arise.



The purpose of the workshops is to provide participants with a friendly, in=
teractive

atmosphere for presenting novel ideas and discussing their application.



The workshops take place on September 18-19, 2017.
