The 26th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-26)
Gothenburg, Sweden

6-11 August 2017

http://www.cade-26.info

CALL FOR PAPERS

CADE is the major international forum at which research on all aspects
of automated deduction is presented. High-quality submissions on the
general topic of automated deduction, including foundations,
applications, implementations, theoretical results, practical
experiences and user studies are solicited.

Key dates:
  Abstract deadline:        11 February 2017
  Submission deadline:      18 February 2017

* Logics of interest include propositional, first-order, equational,
  higher-order, classical, description, modal, temporal, many-valued,
  constructive, other non-classical, meta-logics, logical frameworks, type
  theory, set theory, as well as any combination thereof.

* Paradigms of interest include theorem proving, model building, constraint
  solving, computer algebra, model checking, proof checking, and their
  integration.

* Methods of interest include resolution, superposition, completion,
  saturation, term rewriting, decision procedures, model elimination,
  connection methods, tableaux, sequent calculi, natural deduction, as
  well as their supporting algorithms and data structures, including
  matching, unification, orderings, induction, indexing techniques, proof
  presentation and explanation, proof planning.

* Applications of interest include program analysis, verification and
  synthesis of software and hardware, formal methods, computational logic,
  computer mathematics, natural language processing, computational
  linguistics, knowledge representation, ontology reasoning, deductive
  databases, declarative programming, robotics, planning, and other areas
  of artificial intelligence.

Submissions can be made in two categories: regular papers and system
descriptions. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 15 pages
excluding references for regular papers and 10 pages excluding
references for system descriptions. Submissions must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. They will be judged on
relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and
readability. System descriptions must contain a link to a working
system and will also be judged on usefulness and design. Proofs of
theoretical results that do not fit in the page limit, executables of
systems, and input data of experiments should be made available, via a
reference to a website or in an appendix of the paper. For papers
containing experimental evaluations, all data needed to rerun the
experiments must be available. Reviewers will be encouraged to
consider this additional material, but submissions must be
self-contained within the respective page limit; considering the
additional material should not be necessary to assess the merits of a
submission. The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period
where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer
comments. The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the rebuttal
period.

The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer
LNCS/LNAI series. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can
be obtained at

http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

At every CADE conference the Program Committee selects one of the
accepted papers to receive the CADE Best Paper Award. The award
recognizes a paper that the Program Committee collegially evaluates as
the best in terms of originality and significance, having substantial
confidence in its correctness. Overall technical quality,
completeness, scholarly accuracy, and readability are also
considered. Characteristics associated with a best paper include, for
instance, introduction of a strong new technique or approach, solution
of a long-standing open problem, introduction and solution of an
interesting and important new problem, highly innovative application
of known ideas or existing techniques, and presentation of a new
system of outstanding power. Under exceptional circumstances, the
Program Committee may give two awards (ex aequo) or give no award.

IMPORTANT DATES
  Abstract deadline:        11 February 2017
  Submission deadline:      18 February 2017
  Rebuttal phase:           8  April    2017

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

The 26th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-26)
Gothenburg, Sweden

6-11 August 2017

http://www.cade-26.info

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

Workshop proposals for CADE-26 are solicited. The workshops will take
place on August 6-7 2017, before the main conference. Both
well-established workshops and newer ones are encouraged. Similarly,
proposals for workshops with a tight focus on a core automated
reasoning specialization, as well as those with a broader, more
applied focus, are very welcome.

Please provide the following information in your application document:
+ Workshop title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days) and preferred
  day(s).
+ Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is the
  workshop relevant for CADE?
+ Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case
  information on previous meetings should be given (e.g., links to the
  program, number of submissions, number of participants).
+ What are the plans for publication?

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Tutorial proposals for CADE-26 are solicited. Tutorials are expected
to be either half-day or full-day events, with a theoretical or
applied focus, on a topic of interest for CADE-26. Proposals should
provide the following information:

+ Tutorial title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed tutorial duration (from half a day to one days) and the
  preferred day.
+ Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.
+ Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously.

CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for tutorials that
would like this service.

CALL FOR SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), which evaluates automated theorem
proving systems for classical logics, has become an integral part of the
CADE conferences.

Further system competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to foster
the development of automated reasoning systems in all areas relevant for
automated deduction in a broader sense. Proposals should include the
following information:

+ Competition title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Duration and schedule of the competition.
+ Room/space requirements.
+ Description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.
+ Is the competition new or has it been organized before?
  In the latter case information on previous competitions should be given.
+ What computing resources are required and how will they be provided?

IMPORTANT DATES

Workshop/Tutorials/System Competitions:
  Submission deadline:       5 December 2016
  Notification:              19 December 2016
