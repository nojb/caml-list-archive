Dear OCaml users and developers,

I looked into the fact that ocamlbuild requires bash/cygwin to run. Actuall=
y it does very little use of bash and I think cmd + ln + rm would work quit=
e well.

From comments in various list I understood that people had issues with esca=
ping for cmd. I agree that this is a bit nasty, but not rocket science eith=
er. I guess the main issue is that for cmd not only space and tab are comma=
nd argument separators, but also equal (=3D), comma (,) and semicolon (;). =
So for cmd a=3Db,c;d is the same as a b c d which is the same as a , =3D , =
b =3D;=3D c=3D=3Dd. Essentially cmd treats unquoted pieces as sed 's/[\t =
=3D,;]+/ /g'. If a name contains any of these characters, one has to quote =
it for cmd, but not for bash. Since =3D and , are not that uncommon in file=
 names, I guess this resulted in issues.

BUT cmd splits the command line only into command names, complete argument =
lists and file names for redirection. That is if you call e.g. ocamlc, cmd =
just replaces shell variables and extracts the executable name, but does no=
t split up the argument list into individual pieces. bash on Windows does t=
his neither, because (afaik) Windows has at the lowest level no mechanism t=
o pass individual arguments to an executable. The command gets a string and=
 splitting this string and even globing is the business of the executable. =
So it is rather odd that this behaves substantially different for bash and =
for cmd. The only thing which needs to be quoted properly are command names=
 and file names of redirections.

There might be issue with shell special characters. There are those which a=
re not allowed in file names "\/:*?<>| and those allowed in filenames &(). =
I guess those not allowed in filenames don't need any special treatment, si=
nce one can't do that much with them except their special shell use. The ot=
her 3 one should be escape with ^. There is no way to quote shell special c=
haracters with cmd - they must be escaped with ^.

The only real issue is that some people seem to use build rules with "real"=
 bash stuff in it - well if you do this I guess you anyway have a cygwin ar=
ound.

So I wonder if it would be appreciated by the community to have an ocamlbui=
ld (e.g. as a configure option) which uses cmd instead of bash. I think if =
one does the escaping properly, this should be good for the large majority =
of projects out there.

Ocamlc seems to run fine without cygwin, but I didn't test other tools like=
 ocamllex or menhir as yet. Are there known issues?

Best regards,

Michael
