-- ABOUT ETAPS --

ETAPS is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to software science. ETAPS,
established in 1998, is a confederation of five main annual
conferences, accompanied by satellite workshops. ETAPS 2017 is the
twentieth event in the series.


-- MAIN CONFERENCES (24-28 April) --

    * ESOP: European Symposium on Programming
        (PC chair Hongseok Yang, University of Oxford, UK)
    * FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering
        (PC chairs Marieke Huisman, Universiteit Twente, The
      Netherlands, and Julia Rubin, University of British Columbia,
      Canada)
    * FoSSaCS: Foundations of Software Science
        and Computation Structures
        (PC chairs Javier Esparza, Technische Universit=C3=A4t M=C3=BCnchen,
      Germany, Andrzej Murawski, University of Warwick, UK)
    * POST: Principles of Security and Trust
        (PC chairs Matteo Maffei, Universit=C3=A4t des Saarlandes, Germany,
         Mark D. Ryan, University of Birmingham, UK)
    * TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for
        the Construction and Analysis of Systems
        (PC chairs Axel Legay, INRIA Rennes, France,
         and Tiziana Margaria, LERO, Ireland)

TACAS '17 hosts the 6th Competition on Software Verification
(SV-COMP).

      Michael Ernst (University of Washington, USA)
      Kim G. Larsen (Aalborg University, DK)

    * FoSSaCS invited speaker:
      Joel Ouaknine (University of Oxford, UK)
    * TACAS invited speaker:
      Dino Distefano (Facebook and Queen Mary University of London, UK)


-- IMPORTANT DATES --

    * Abstracts due (ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS, TACAS): 14 October 2016
    * Papers due: 21 October 2016
    * Rebuttal (ESOP and FoSSaCS only): 7-9 December 2016
    * Notification: 22 December 2016
    * Camera-ready versions due: 20 January 2017


-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --

ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers
and tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the
proceedings and have presentations during the conference.

ESOP and FoSSaCS accept only research papers.

A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one
of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.

Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere (this
does not apply to abstracts). In particular, simultaneous submission
of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is
forbidden. The proceedings will be published in the Advanced Research
in Computing and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Papers must follow the formatting guidelines specified by Springer at
the URL

    http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

and be submitted electronically in pdf through the EasyChair author
interface of the respective conference.

Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be
rejected immediately.

FASE will use a light-weight double-blind review process (see
http://www.etaps.org/2017/fase).


- Research papers

FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pp (excluding
bibliography of max 2 pp) for research papers, whereas POST allows at
most 20 pp (excluding bibliography of max 2 pp) and ESOP 25 pp
(excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication
in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page
limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers
must be understandable without them.

In addition to regular research papers, TACAS solicits also case study
papers (at most 15 pp, excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).

Both TACAS and FASE solicit also regular tool papers (at most 15 pp,
excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).

The rationale of a separate page limit for the bibliography is to
remove the possibility to win space for the body of a
paper by cutting the bibliography, a practise that has a negative
effect on our competitiveness as a community.


- Tool demonstration papers

Submissions should consist of two parts:

* The first part, at most 4 pages, should describe the tool
    presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) and
    provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustness of
    the tool. (This part will be included in the proceedings.)

* The second part, at most 6 pages, should explain how the
    demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, including
    screen dumps and examples. (This part will be not be included in the
    proceedings, but will be evaluated.

ESOP and FoSSaCS do not accept tool demonstration papers.

TACAS has a page limit of 6 pages for tool demonstrations.


-- SATELLITE EVENTS (22-23 April, 29 April) --

The following satellite workshops will take place before and after the
main conferences: BX, CREST, DICE-FOPARA, FESCA, GALOP, GaM, HotSpot,
LiVe, MARS, MBT, PLACES, QAPL, SannellaFest, SNR, SynCoP-PV,
VerifyThis, VPT.


-- HOST CITY --

Uppsala city holds a rich history, having for long periods been the
political, religious and academic centre of Sweden.  Uppsala
University is over 500 years old and ranked among the top 100 in the
World and has hosted many great scientists over the years, for
instance Carl von Linn=C3=A9, Anders Celsius and Anders Jonas =C3=85ngstr=
=C3=B6m. The
proximity to the capital of Sweden, Stockholm, provides additional
benefits as a potential site for arranging both pre- and post congress
tours, as well as for excursions or tourism.


-- HOST INSTITUTION --

ETAPS 2017 is hosted by the Department of Information Technology,
Uppsala University.
