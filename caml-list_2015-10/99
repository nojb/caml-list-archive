Actually, I asked that question a bit prematurely, but any answers to
number 2 are still welcome-I'd like to know about any and all options.


For the record, for number 1, you can get the associated profiling with a
vanilla ocamlbuild/oasis setup without any hairy plugin by doing:
ocaml setup.ml <options options options> -tag profile

From there, just executing your program like normal will have it poop out a
little gmon.out that you can work with with gprof. As far as how good it
is, it's as good as gprof/gmon because that's what it is behind the scenes.
