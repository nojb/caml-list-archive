I faced a similar issue with luajit recently. Except that for luajit it
is completely hopeless. Absolutely completely hopeless.

I would expect some things to have already been done for luajit in
openwrt and would advise you to check there. I forgot to look at it
myself.

What I'm currently doing is to setup a small private toolchain based on
a static musl for the libc, libfirm/cparser for the C compiler, pcc-libs
for the C runtime and binutils (cparser is a single multi-target binary
that knows how to invoke binutils properly across archs). Obviously I'm
not entirely happy with that but in practice it doesn't need much more
CPU time and it should just work (I haven't packaged it fully yet but I
can't think of possible issues there).

I haven't checked your pull request in details but the approach
(complemented with XL's input in particular) seemed good to me. In any
case, I am sorry that I forgot the check about endianness or more
probably (it's been some time already) that I thought I would be able to
solve the incompatibility itself quite quickly. Thanks for fixing that
and adding one. :)
