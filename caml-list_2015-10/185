Yes - but I wasn't taking the compilation model as fixed. I was (purely hyp=
othetically, obviously!) imagining that flexlink (or some such) linker was =
still there and that it would generate the appropriate .def/.a files to all=
ow the dll to be compiled, as it would also have access to the required .cm=
i files. That's quite similar to what flexlink already does, isn't it - jus=
t generating an import library to trick the actual/underlying linker rather=
 than building separate tables embedded into .o/.obj files which get linked=
 as well.=20

But...=20

... that sounds like the real "elevator explanation" for why things are as =
they are!
