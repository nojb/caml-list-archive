==========================================================================

Graphs  are  used almost  everywhere  when  representing or modelling
structures and systems,  not only in applied  and theoretical computer
science, but  also in, e.g.,  natural and engineering  sciences. Graph
transformation  and  graph  grammars  are  the  fundamental modelling
paradigms  for  describing,  formalizing, and  analyzing  graphs that
change  over  time  when  modelling, e.g.,  dynamic  data structures,
systems,   or   models.   The  International   Conference   on Graph
Transformation (ICGT)  series aims to bring  together researchers from
different areas in this context and  to provide a forum for presenting
new results, discussing  novel ideas and sharing  experience. In order
to foster  a lively  exchange of  perspectives on  the subject  of the
conference,  the programme  committee  of the  ninth  edition of ICGT
encourages   all    kinds   of   contributions   related    to graph
transformation. Topics of interest include, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO the
following subjects:

    - General models of graph transformation (e.g., high-level, adhesive,
      node, edge, and hyperedge replacement systems)
    - Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems
    - Graph theoretical properties of graph languages
    - Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages
    - Logical aspects of graph transformation
    - Computational models based on graph transformation
    - Structuring and modularization concepts for graph transformation 
systems
    - Hierarchical graphs and decompositions of graphs
    - Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation
    - Modelling and analysis of dynamic data structures
    - Term graph rewriting
    - Graph transformation and Petri nets
    - Ontologies and ontology evolution
    - Graph databases
    - Modelling and realizing software architectures, refactoring, 
evolution,
      workflows, business processes, access control, security policies,
      service-oriented applications, semantic web, ...
    - Natural language processing, natural computing, bioinformatics,
      quantum computing, ubiquitous computing, visual computing,
      image generation, natural and engineering sciences, ...
    - Model-driven development and model transformation based on
      graph transformation
    - Model checking, program verification, simulation and animation
    - Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages,
      domain-specific languages, and visual languages
    - Graph transformation languages and tool support
    - Efficient algorithms (pattern matching, graph traversal etc.)


The 9th  International Conference on Graph  Transformation (ICGT 2016)
will   be    held   in    Vienna,   Austria,    as   a    STAF event
(http://staf2016.conf.tuwien.ac.at/). The conference takes place under
the     auspices    of     EATCS    (http://www.eatcs.org/), EASST
(http://www.easst.org/), and IFIP (http://www.ifip.org/) WG 1.3.

Paper Submission
----------------

Papers are solicited in three categories:

* Research papers (limited to 16 pages in Springer LNCS format)
   describe innovative contributions and are evaluated with respect to
   their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional
   material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final
   version may be included in a clearly marked appendix.

* Case studies (limited to 12 pages in Springer LNCS format)
   describe applications of graph transformations in any application
   domain.

* Tool presentation papers (limited to 12 pages in Springer LNCS
   format) demonstrate the main features and functionality of
   graph-based tools. A tool presentation paper may have an appendix
   with a detailed demo description (up to 5 pages), which will be
   reviewed but not included in the proceedings.

Papers can be submitted at 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icgt2016.
Submitted papers must use Springer's LNCS format 
(http://www.springer.com/lncs).
Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or 
submission of
material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed. The page
limits are strict and include references.

Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (http://www.springer.com/lncs) series.
