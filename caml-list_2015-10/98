Subject: [Caml-list] Automated Instrumentation for Profiling

--001a113f19f26c95a005220bba01
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

So, I'm looking to do some performance profiling of some libraries and
tools. I would like some tools that are more language facilitated than an
alternative of using something like oprofile because while oprofile is
good, you can only guess at what is consuming the most time in your actual
ocaml source because all the function names have been lost by that time.

I found ocamlviz, and that seems pretty good, but I'm looking for something
else because we plan to move away from using camlp4 toward ppx. Introducing
this will mean an additional hurdle to overcome once the transition is
complete in terms of customizing the build chain twice.

In any case, I guess what I'd really like to know is:

1) How good are the ocamlcp and ocamloptp tools and how would you get a
vanilla oasis/ocamlbuild combo to easily start using them instead?

2) Are there any ppx based profiling tools out there? I need both memory
and time profiling to be done. OCamlviz was great because it had a graph-I
don't necessarily need a dedicated gui, but some way to visualize the data
would be very helpful.
