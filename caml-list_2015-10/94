Scope
--------

CAV 2016 is the 28th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the theory=
 and
practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software
systems. CAV considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware a=
nd
software verification while expanding to new domains such as biological sys=
tems
and computer security. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical
results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification
tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their
implementation. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the
Springer LNCS series. A selection of papers will be invited to a special is=
sue
of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations
* Algorithms and tools for system synthesis
* Mathematical and logical foundations of verification and synthesis
* Specifications and correctness criteria for programs and systems
* Deductive verification using proof assistants
* Hardware verification techniques
* Program analysis and software verification
* Software synthesis
* Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification
* Compositional and abstraction-based techniques for verification
* Probabilistic and statistical approaches to verification
* Verification methods for parallel and concurrent systems
* Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology
* Decision procedures and solvers for verification and synthesis
* Applications and case studies in verification and synthesis
* Verification in industrial practice
* New application areas for algorithmic verification and synthesis
* Formal models and methods for security
* Formal models and methods for biological systems

Paper Submission
------------------------

*** NEW this year: Double-blind submissions ***

Submissions on a wide range of topics are sought, particularly ones that
identify new research directions. CAV 2016 is not limited to topics discuss=
ed
in previous instances of the conference. Authors concerned about the
appropriateness of a topic may communicate by electronic mail with the
conference chairs prior to submission.

As explained below, CAV 2016 will follow a lightweight double-blind review
process. Submissions that are not "blinded" will be rejected without review.

Submissions will be in two categories: Regular Papers and Tool Papers.

* Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages in LNCS format, not counting
references. These papers should contain original research and sufficient de=
tail
to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.  Papers will be
evaluated on basis of a combination of correctness, technical depth,
significance, novelty, clarity, and elegance. We welcome papers on theory, =
case
studies and comparisons with existing experimental research, as well as
combinations of new theory with experimental evaluation. A strong theoretic=
al
paper is not required to have an experimental component. On the other hand,
strong papers reproducing and comparing existing results experimentally do =
not
require new theoretical insights.

* Tool Papers should not exceed 6 pages, not counting references. These pap=
ers
should describe system and implementation aspects of a tool with a large
(potential) user base (experiments not required, rehash of theory strongly
discouraged). Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in =
any
conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to =
the
tool are reported and implemented.

Unlike last year, there is no separate Short Paper category.

Prior to the registration deadline, the authors will register their paper by
uploading information on the submission title, abstract (of at most 300 wor=
ds),
authors, topics, and conflicts to the conference web site. Papers that are =
not
registered on time will be rejected.

We encourage authors to provide any supplementary material that is required=
 to
support the claims made in the paper, such as detailed proofs or experiment=
al
data. These materials should be uploaded at submission time, as a single pd=
f or
a tarball, not via a URL. It will be made available to reviewers only after
they have submitted their first-draft reviews and hence need not be anonymi=
zed.
Reviewers are under no obligation to look at the supplementary material but=
 may
refer to it if they have questions about the material in the body of the pa=
per.

Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission=
 of
material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.

The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors wi=
ll
have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit
further reviews after the rebuttal period.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format. Submission will be via the HotCRP
system. The submission URL will be available on the website of the conferen=
ce
closer to the deadline.

Lightweight Double-Blind Reviewing Process
-------------------------------------------------------------

CAV 2016 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. This mea=
ns
that committee members will not have access to authors' names or affiliatio=
ns
as they review a paper; however, authors' names will be revealed once revie=
ws
have been submitted and online discussion has begun.

To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and
(2) references to authors' own related work should be in the third person
(e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the =
work
of ...").

The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come t=
o an
initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible f=
or
them to discover the authors if they were to try.  Nothing should be done in
the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of revie=
wing
the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not =
be
omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate
their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.  For
instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks =
on
their research ideas. A document answering frequently asked questions about=
 the
double-blind review process is available on the conference website.
