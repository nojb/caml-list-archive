Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml core on Github

Hello,

As announced at the OCaml workshop last September, the development
sources for the core OCaml system are now hosted at Github,
ocaml/ocaml project.  (Before, this Github repository was a read-only
mirror of a master SVN repository hosted at Inria.)

Those of you who track the OCaml development version via SVN at
http://caml.inria.fr/svn/ocaml/ should switch to Git at
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.git instead.  The SVN repo remains
available for a few more weeks, but is no longer updated.
All other users should be unaffected by this change.

- Xavier Leroy
