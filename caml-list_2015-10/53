* Objectives and scope

    TASE is an international symposium that aims to bring together 
researchers
    and developers from academia and industry with interests in the 
theoretical
    aspects of software engineering. Modern society is increasingly 
dependent
    on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This 
poses
    new challenges to current software engineering methodologies that 
need to
    be enhanced using modern results from theoretical computer science.

    We invite submissions of research papers on topics covering all 
theoretical
    aspects of software engineering, including, but not limited to, the
    following:


    + Abstract interpretation
    + Algebraic and co-algebraic specifications
    + Aspect oriented software
    + Component-based systems
    + Cyber-physical systems
    + Deductive verification
    + Distributed and concurrent systems
    + Embedded and real-time systems
    + Feature-oriented software
    + Formal verification and program semantics
    + Integration of formal methods
    + Language design
    + Model checking and theorem proving
    + Object-oriented systems
    + Program logics and calculi
    + Quantum computation
    + Run-time verification and monitoring
    + Service-oriented and cloud computing
    + Software architecture
    + Software testing and quality assurance
    + Software security and reliability
    + Static analysis of programs
    + Type systems and behavioural typing
    + Tools exploiting theoretical results
