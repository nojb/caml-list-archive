Sure, that is a solution.

Maybe I was unclear to begin with.  I wanted a way to use *only*
oasis/buildtool to achieve my goal.  That is, I didn't want to involve
system-specific tools to copy the source from the project source dir
into the build dir before building. I couldn't find a way to use
oasis/buildtool to achieve that, so I sent an email to the list. *I*
consider the lack of a way to do that a deficiency in oasis/buildtool.

(Do note that it's completely acceptable to just say that this use case
isn't one that you see any value in and that the hack of copying the
source is the way to achieve a build that doesn't leave *anything*
behind in the source dir.)
