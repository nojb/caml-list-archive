You need to look in otherlibs/win32unix for the Windows sources. otherlibs/=
win32unix/write.c has intnat.

FWIW, this might be pulling itself into my native Windows OPAM port - we're=
 interested in Windows/Cygwin cross-compilers (i.e. ocamlopt being a Cygwin=
 executable which outputs native Windows executables using mingw64/msvc and=
 vice versa) and it makes sense to unify the build process at the same time=
 as trying to do that.

I did some preliminary work too a few years ago getting configure's output =
to match the template files in config/ - a good initial step would be to ke=
ep Makefile.nt but "hide" it from the user by having configure set which Ma=
kefile actually gets called at the toplevel (i.e. you say make world and co=
nfigure sets things up so that that is actually make -f Makefile.nt world i=
f necessary). Quite apart from breaking mainline OCaml, the change will be =
pretty invasive to forks and other branches being worked on!=20
