That sounds like it would definitely be a good benefit to the community and
I'd be really happy to do it. I know that ppx is the successor to camlp4,
and I have a mind to teach myself the sort of magic where I can annotate a
type with some code generating function because I appreciate the power.

But right now, my extra curricular work is just ridiculously over loaded.
In my free time I'm teaching myself Coq, compiler construction with llvm,
taking a coursera course working on a shingled disassembler, working on an
ocamljava backend for ctypes and a ocaml link to CZMQ. I love what I do -
coding and learning all day long - but I have human limits, and I just
don't think I would be able to pick it up for probably 6-8 months. Possibly
something else will come along before then, whether that be even more
compelling challenges or that ocamlviz is seconded by something better.

So, I really honestly would, but I don't think I can. :(
