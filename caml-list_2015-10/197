Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Is this the right place to discuss camlp5?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

To my knowledge, nobody has contributed parsing of attributes and
extensions (a change to the OCaml syntax whose use is central to many of
the ppx extensions) to camlp4 or camlp5 (which implement their own OCaml
parsers and thus need to be updated accordingly). It would not necessarily
be too difficult to do so, but that means that currently you cannot combine
camlp{4,5} and PPX extensions within the same source file.

There is another way to understand your question: if you have developed
camlp{4,5} extensions, how hard is it to port them to ppx, or conversely to
port a ppx extension to camlp{4,5}? My answer would be "rather easy",
knowing that there are two separate aspects:

- The first thing an extension does is to parse some part of the user input
to recognize extension-specific code. This is relatively easy to do using
both systems, but done in a completely different ways, so this part (the
"frontend") of the extension needs to be completely rewritten. In addition,
ppx is more restricted than camlp{4,5} in terms of the flexibility to
change the syntax (this is a feature), so some things that are easy to do
for camlp{4,5} extensions may require some thoughts about how to express
this with extensions/attributes instead.

- Once the extension has recognized the information it relies on within the
user source code, it will do some extension-specific stuff and spit some
AST out. This is very easy to port from one extension to the other, and
most of this part of the code (the "backend") can be reused.

The respective size of frontend and backend differs depending on the
extension. The more complex the frontend part, the harder the transition
from one system to another (this also applies to porting an extension from
camlp4 to camlp5 or vice-versa).
