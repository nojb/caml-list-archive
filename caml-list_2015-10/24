Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml Programmer Needed - Machine Learning Startup

What I read is

"Required experience:
- developing with C/C++/Python/Go in a Linux environment with a focus
on performance, concurrency, and correctness.
...
"

=46rom what I understand, they just dropped the requirement of having an
experience in OCaml, since good programmers can easily be taught to
use OCaml without prior exposition.
