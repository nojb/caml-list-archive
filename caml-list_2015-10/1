First, why not just copy everything in the new directory:
% cp -R . /tmp/my_build_dir; cd /tmp/my_build_dir
% ocaml setup.ml -configure
% ocaml setup.ml -build

Maybe I miss some context to understand why this simple solution is not
enough.

Going back at the other points. There are 3 categories of files:
- the ones that are really generated at build time: setup.log, setup.data
  -> they probably need to follow the indication provided -C. This is a bug
- the ones that are generated by the underlying build system: _build
(ocamlbuild)
  -> as you wrote "-build -build-dir /tmp/my_build_dir -no-links" should be
enough
- the ones that are generated by the dynamic mode, which is a hack to
prevent adding the files that other tools need:
  -> these ones are tricky because they should have been in the source
directory right from the beginning and being able to apply -C to them is
equivalent to make sure that "ocamlfind"/"ocamlbuild"/other build tools
will use -C and the source directory... This is clearly not trivial to
assume that all tools will do.

My initial proposal to "cp" the files and build from the copy would
probably solve your problem without assuming that all tools comply with -C.
Tell me if it solves your problem.

Regards
Sylvain

<br>
I&#39;ll try to explain how I&#39;d like to use oasis/buildtool by looking =
how<br>
Haskell&#39;s Cabal lets me do it:<br>
<br>
- Configure without generating anything in the current dir:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 % runhaskell Setup.hs --builddir /tmp/my_build_dir<br>

=C2=A0 anything in the current dir:<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 % runhaskell Setup.hs --builddir /tmp/my_build_dir<br>
<br>
Comparing this to oasis/buildtool (assuming I&#39;ve a pre-existing<br>
`<a href=3D"http://setup.ml" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">setup.ml<=
