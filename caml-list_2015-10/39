Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml projects with tests

Dear all,

Recently the topic was discussed here and several testing frameworks were
mentionned.

I am wondering whether there are well established projects that actually
use tests (unit tests and others) and that could be used as sources of
inspiration?

Thanks,

SÃ©bastien.
