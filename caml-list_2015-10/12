OASIS is mostly a glue system that mixes various systems, including system
tools. Under the hood, the setup.ml generated by OASIS will anyway use "cp"
or any ther system tools:
https://github.com/ocaml/oasis/blob/master/src/oasis/OASISFileUtil.ml#L124

I acknowledge that there is a value in your use case, but right now it is a
corner case for my personal usage. The hack should be enough to unblock
you. If you have an idea how to solve it without the hack, I will be glad
to merge a pull request:
https://github.com/ocaml/oasis

&gt; &gt; &gt; I must admit that I totally miss the whole point of the disc=

&gt; &gt; &gt; probably if you can make a summary of what you precisely nee=
d in the<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; BTS, I will be able to understand the problem better.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately I don&#39;t know enough about `oasis` to understand=
 that bug<br>
&gt; &gt; report :(<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll try to explain how I&#39;d like to use oasis/buildtool b=
y looking how<br>
&gt; &gt; Haskell&#39;s Cabal lets me do it:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - Configure without generating anything in the current dir:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0% runhaskell Setup.hs --builddir /tmp/my_build=
_dir<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - Build using the just generated configuration, again without put=
ting<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0anything in the current dir:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0% runhaskell Setup.hs --builddir /tmp/my_build=
_dir<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Comparing this to oasis/buildtool (assuming I&#39;ve a pre-existi=
ng<br>
&gt; &gt; `<a href=3D"http://setup.ml" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank"=
>setup.ml</a>` generated with `oasis setup -setup-update dynamic` to<br>
&gt; &gt; minimize the amount of build-related stuff in the project):<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - Configure<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0% ocaml <a href=3D"http://setup.ml" rel=3D"nor=
eferrer" target=3D"_blank">setup.ml</a> -configure<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0This generates a file, `setup.data` in the current di=
r.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve found no<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0way to have it generated in a dedicated build dir.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; - Build<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0% ocaml <a href=3D"http://setup.ml" rel=3D"nor=
eferrer" target=3D"_blank">setup.ml</a> -build -build-dir /tmp/my_build_dir=
 -no-links<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0This builds in the mentioned dir, but it also generat=
es a `setup.log`<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0in the current dir!<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I thought that `-C` could offer a way to achieve this, but it doe=
sn&#39;t:<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0% mkdir /tmp/my_build_dir; cd /tmp/my_build_di=

&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Error: Reference to undefined global `OASISDyn=
Run&#39;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not convinced `-C` *should* be the way to achieve what I =
want.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully this makes it clearer what I mean.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; First, why not just copy everything in the new directory:<br>
&gt; % cp -R . /tmp/my_build_dir; cd /tmp/my_build_dir<br>
&gt; % ocaml <a href=3D"http://setup.ml" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blan=
k">setup.ml</a> -configure<br>
&gt; % ocaml <a href=3D"http://setup.ml" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blan=
k">setup.ml</a> -build<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Maybe I miss some context to understand why this simple solution is no=
t<br>
&gt; enough.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Going back at the other points. There are 3 categories of files:<br>
&gt; - the ones that are really generated at build time: setup.log, setup.d=
ata<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0-&gt; they probably need to follow the indication provided=
 -C. This is a bug<br>
&gt; - the ones that are generated by the underlying build system: _build<b=
r>
&gt; (ocamlbuild)<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0-&gt; as you wrote &quot;-build -build-dir /tmp/my_build_d=
ir -no-links&quot; should be<br>
&gt; enough<br>
&gt; - the ones that are generated by the dynamic mode, which is a hack to<=
br>
&gt; prevent adding the files that other tools need:<br>
&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0-&gt; these ones are tricky because they should have been =
in the source<br>
&gt; directory right from the beginning and being able to apply -C to them =

y would<br>
&gt; probably solve your problem without assuming that all tools comply<br>
