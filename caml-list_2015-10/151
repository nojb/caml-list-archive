PROPOSALS
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ICFP 2016
&nbsp;21st ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp;September 18-24, 2016
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nara, Japan
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp;http://icfpconference.org/icfp2016/

The 21st ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
will be held in Nara, Japan on September 18-24, 2016. ICFP provides a
forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the
design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2016 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN. These events should be less formal and more focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and foster the exchange of new ideas. The preference is for one-day
events, but other schedules can also be considered.

The workshops are scheduled to occur on September 18 (the day
before ICFP) and September 22-24 (the three days after ICFP).
