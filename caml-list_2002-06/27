If there is any Code, I would be interested in it too.

And if there are sequencer-/midi-programs in OCaml,
I would be interested a lot.

I need the possibility to work on Audio-formats as well as
creating them via a (midi-)-sequencer.

Better than using ready-to-use-programs I would prefer
extensible systems, where I can add the funcionality
I need.

Maybe we are three interested people now and can start a little project?
Or are there any such projects?

Ciao,
   Oliver
