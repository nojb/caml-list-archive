I think that Don Syme and his Microsoft Cambridge colleagues did a
great job with adding parametric polymorphism to the .NET framework --
something that was initially overlooked in .NET --, and I'm very happy
that they chose core Caml to demonstrate this extension in action.

By the way, for those of you who are in the Paris area: Don Syme will
give a talk on F# at INRIA Rocquencourt on the morning of June 14th,
and everyone is welcome to attend.  E-mail me privately for more info.
