I will certainly mention this to the aforementioned

There is a fair amount of joke in what I wrote. I am a caml 
rider and penguin breeder, not a plane hijacker or suicide 
bomber. I advocate the technology I like best, and, from a 
professional standpoint, I integrate it in the projects I am 
assigned by my clients. I am professionally uninterested in 
MS products, albeit primarily for aesthetic reasons and 
personal taste.

Even you were affiliated with Microsoft or Dyadic software, 
you would still be entitled to free thought. I actually wish 
to thank you for sharing an interesting bit of information 
with me about APL and .NET.
