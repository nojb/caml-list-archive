Well, I've written a very small prototype game, using
objects. Container objects are somewhat tricky (lots of weird typing
errors) but not impossible to define. However, if I can't save the
game state, I'll have to trash everything and ``simulate'' a class
model using conventional datatypes (not necessarily a bad thing, but I
would have been nice to use classical interactive fiction programming
style).

So, I have to ask : Will we be able to marshall objects soon ? There
seem to be some (unused) code fragments in extern.c...
