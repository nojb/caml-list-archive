Thank you for all the good suggestions. We are currently using Bigarrays and
mmap to read images from files, simulating the dcams. We map the whole
file into a bigarray and use ad-hoc functions to extract the rgb data
without worriying much about headers. This is OK  for now, but we may be
interested in the future in interfacing with the camlimages library.

So, the next question is: Can we use Obj.magic to convert a bigarray to a
string without copying data? Will this trick work   with boundary checks
turned off, so that we can have the advantage of mmap and no bound checks
at the same time?

Thanks again,

       Fernando Alegre
