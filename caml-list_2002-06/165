Well, there exists an aproximation: "ocamlfind guess" try to guess a
META file for a library that is to be installed.

Anyway, the problem reported by Christian is more subtle: he needs a
mapping between modules used in sources (as reported by ocamldep) and
findlib modules.
AFAIK there is no such a tool and even if it will be available it can
only be an aproximation, obviously.

Cheers.
