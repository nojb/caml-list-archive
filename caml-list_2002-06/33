Ok, ...

But i was talking about packaging dependencies and
interaction with the debian autobuilders, which don't know (yet ?) how
to build a part of the source and then build another pakage and then do
it again.

But then i could build an alternative toplevel in another package later
on, or maybve simply add ledit to the ocaml source, but i am not sure if
Xavier would agree with this later on, anyway, it is my problem.

Friendly,
