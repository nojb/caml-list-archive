Why not have a system of submission/referee for adding functions to
existing library (I am often mising for instance the usual List.flat_map
or List.rev_append in list.mli) or adding new library to the standard
OCaml ?=20

There should exist some clearly written rules to respect, and the
referees should check that these rules are respected. The referees could
also ask for modification and so on ..

I do not think the INRIA team spend a lot of time adapting the libraries
when they do incompatible change to OCaml. And moreover, some libraries
could be maintained outside of INRIA (by the guy who created the
library) ?

I think this is interesting, because we often write some small library
of function that could be useful to every body ... so it is a nice way
to share them.

among the useful missing library that I am sure many people have
allready written, there are: library for multiset (using Map or
something better), partial order, etc ...

Morever, people could also submit optimized replacement for existing
libraries (using a compatible interface ans semantics, this is hard to
check for the referre). So this way we could get nice, complete and
efficient libraries for OCaml !
