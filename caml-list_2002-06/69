Subject: [Caml-list] Compiler killer code?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

Precedence: bulk

Is the type inference algorithm guaranteed to termintate? I 
ask because I have accidentally attempted to evaluate a 
(meaningless) function which almost hanged my Athlon.

The killer code is the following:

type t = t -> t
let f (x:t) :t = f f


If I type this into the toplevel, it starts to allocate 
memory by the tens of megabytes, until I have to kill it to 
prevent a system crash. I let it reach approximately 128MB 
before killing it. (BTW, that was with ocaml 3.04+13 
2002-06-05.)

Is the language really supposed to accept such garbage as 
that which I wrote?
