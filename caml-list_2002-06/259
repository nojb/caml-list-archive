I don't think that the problem is about moving towards "their"
technologies but moving OCaml and its tools towards "their" problem
domain. It's definitely not the job of INRIA to do this, though some
help might make this task easier for the commercial programmers among us
(not me).

This usually boils down to adhering to or defining somewhat accepted
standards. E.g., I suppose that many programmers would be happy about
locale support or libraries in the distribution that handle some
high-level standard internet protocols, etc.

It might be a good idea to define some set of rules that allows people
external to INRIA to write libraries in such a way that they could be
accepted in the standard distribution. Or even better, to define and
implement standard packaging schemes that make seamless integration of 3rd
party libraries easy. Then the community could much more effectively take
over the burden of providing OCaml-libraries and tools for commercial use.
