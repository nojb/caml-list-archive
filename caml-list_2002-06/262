I happen to be an APL programmer... And, yes, it is an amazing
programming language. With almost nothing in common with OCaml, except,
possibly, the not being a mainstream language.

Please. Microsoft is not the evil incarnated. I believe that Microsoft
is good for a lot of corporate customers. The thing you must educate
people is that there are other good alternatives, if they work for them.
Make them aware and make the choose. Starting from the point of view
that Microsoft is bad is as bad not being educated. In case you wonder,
I am not affiliated in any way to Microsoft or Dyadic Software. I am a
free thinker. And yes, was also a Penguin breeder, back in the days when
a 486 50MHz was the Ferrari of Personal Computing.
