There is no traditional name for the directory containing dynamically loaded 
libraries, i.e. libraries that are not linked with "-l" into the executable.
"libexec" is intended for executables that are run as a result of library
calls, and that are not in PATH. I chose "libexec" because that was most
close to DLLs.

I don't know if this is a good name, however, and I can change it again in 
the findlib distribution. I think the point is whether everybody familiar
with filesystem conventions finds the DLL directory immediately.
