Hi

A file_descr_of_int function might seem meaningless at first, but with
inheritance of descriptors under Unix, some programs are intended to
be executed with a particular file descriptor configuration, eg. fd 3
is data stream, fd 4 is control, etc. OK, under Linux or BSD you can open
/proc/fd/xx or /fd/xx, but that's not really standard.

For the other direction, I'd suggest a "name_of_file_descr" function,
which, given a file descriptor, gives a platform-dependent string, for
debugging purposes. Under Unix, it could return the FD in decimal
format ; under other OSes, it could return a hexadecimal pointer
value.
