hello,

Let's quote the lsm website (http://lsm.abul.org):

"From July, 9th to July, 13th 2002 will take place near Bordeaux the 
third Libre Software Meeting. [..]
The goal of the Libre Software Meeting is to set up a single place 
where as many people as possible will be able to share information 
and gather their energies towards large scale projects."

There are looking for speech and I really think that it will be nice to
hear something about ocaml or maybe specific stuff in the ocaml
package. 
Does anyone want to do that ?
