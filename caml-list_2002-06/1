Hi, all, I have to raise another question about recursive type in Ocaml.

Now I want to define a type and a class, both of which are recursive
defined as follows:
----------------
type ty1 =
   | Int of int
   | String of string
   | Class of typeClass

class virtual typeClass =
   object
      method virtual typeCon : ty1
   end;;
-----------------
However, it does not work. 
I can use another way to solve it by define ty1 as 'a ty1. Besides this
way, is there any method to solve it? What's more, what's the common way
to define such types?

Thanks,
Dengping
