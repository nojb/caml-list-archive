Is not Field(obj,0) still a *pointer* to a double hash table, and so 
unique to a particular compilation?
I have a crummy type reflection module which exports this pointer so 
that by comparison of types at runtime an imported object created under 
another program can be amended with the current version of this pointer.
I have a vague memory that reflection is a theoretical no-go for ML. Is 
this true?
