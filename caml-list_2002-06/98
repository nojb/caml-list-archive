No one can object to this -- just like no one can object to "regular
exercice at the gym is good for you"; it's just that few have the
fortitute to actually do it.  Developing a good test suite takes about
as much effort as writing the software being tested.

For OCaml, we have some test suites for a few specific libraries and
run-time facilities, but that's about it.  Compilers and type-checkers
are even harder to test than run-time libraries.

So, if anyone wants to tackle this challenge, that would be very
useful indeed, but be aware that it's a huge task.
