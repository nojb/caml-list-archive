                             Research Position

    Useful Logics, Types, Rewriting, and their Automation (ULTRA) Group
                        Computer Science Department
                School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences
                           Heriot-Watt University
                          Edinburgh, Scotland, UK

Description of the Position

   A research position is available working on modular reasoning and
   compositional analysis for software at Heriot-Watt University working
   with Joe Wells.  The position is in the ULTRA (Useful Logics, Types,
   Rewriting, and their Automation) group in the Computer Science
   Department in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences
   (formerly the Department of Computing and Electrical Engineering) at
   Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.  The
   position involves close collaboration with both the EC-funded DART
   (Dynamic Assembly, Reconfiguration, and Type-checking) project
   (members: Genova Univ., Heriot-Watt Univ., Imperial Coll., and Torino
   Univ.) and the EC, EPSRC, NATO, and NSF-funded Church Project
   (members: Boston Coll., Boston Univ., Harvard Univ., Heriot-Watt
   Univ., Wellesley Coll., etc.).

   It will be helpful if the researcher is competent in 1 or more of the
   following knowledge areas which are likely to be used in the project.

     * Formal calculi for reasoning about the meaning of computer systems
       (including computer programs), especially those with aspects of
       (a) modules, linking, and loading, (b) concurrency, (c) mobility,
       (d) staged compilation, (e) objects, (f) resource usage, etc.
     * Analysis of systems represented in formal calculi.
     * Constraint solving and unification.
     * Type systems, especially those with intersection and union types.
     * Programming languages used for any of the above.

   The duration of the position is from 6 months to 2.5 years, depending
   on the circumstances of the researcher, with extensions possible
   depending on salary, experience, performance, and funding.
   Applications to spend a shorter period (e.g., the sabbatical leave of
   an established academic) will be considered.  The initial salary will
   be commensurate with qualifications and experience in the range from
   19681 GBP to 26491 GBP per year.  The position is available
   immediately, with the ideal start date being 2002-09-01.  It is
   preferred that before starting the researcher will have completed a
   Ph.D. in a  relevant discipline within Computer Science.  Very good
   Ph.D. students who want to spend a year of their studies this way will
   be considered.  Applicants from outside the European Economic Area
   (EEA) will be considered.

   The researcher will probably collaborate on 1 or more of the following
   activities.  The specific activities will be matched to the strengths
   of the researcher.

     * Designing new type systems for compositional (modular) analysis of
       systems that may involve one or more aspects of concurrency,
       mobility, modularity, objects, run-time code generation, etc.
     * Designing analysis algorithms for the new type systems.
     * Designing theories (e.g., "calculi") for reasoning about the
       meaning of dynamic software assembly, i.e., doing in a
       non-traditional order one or more of type checking, code
       generation, linking, loading, etc.
     * Making software systems incorporating the new type systems,
       algorithms, and calculi.
     * Writing scientific reports on the work done.

Applying for the Position

   Please use the reference code 106/02/L to help prevent your
   application from getting mixed up.  Please convert Microsoft Word
   documents to a public, standard, and non-proprietary format.  The best
   format is PDF, because some of our staff will encounter difficulties
   with HTML or PostScript.

   To formally apply for this position, please do as many as possible of
   the items in the following list by 2002-07-24.  The first 2 are
   absolutely necessary and the 4th is quite important.

     * Cause 3  reference letters to be sent.  (If someone in the
       Heriot-Watt Personnel Office tells you the letters are not needed
       yet, please ignore them, because we want to see the letters before
       choosing who to interview.)
     * Send the following yourself:
          + your complete curriculum vitae, and
          + contact details for the people writing your reference
            letters.
     * Optionally, also send either of the following:
          + a brief statement about why your research accomplishments and
            interests are a good match for the position, and
          + up to 3 relevant publications of yours.
     * Get the Heriot-Watt Personnel Office to send you an "application
       pack".  (This contains an application form, an equal opportunities
       monitoring form, information for applicants with disabilities, and
       some additional information about Heriot-Watt and the position.)
       Fill out and return the application form and optionally the equal
       opportunities monitoring form.  If your curriculum vitae is well
       constructed, then some information requested will be redundant, so
       just write "see c.v." in those blanks, but return the form anyway.
     * It is helpful to inform Joe Wells that you are applying so that he
       knows to ask our personnel office for your application materials.
     * Anyone who might need a work permit if hired (usually someone who
       is not a citizen of an EEA country) should also do the following.
       In addition to possibly being e-mailed or faxed, each letter of
       reference should also be sent by post on official-looking headed
       stationery paper and should include details on your whereabouts
       over the last two years.  A work permit application also needs
       copies of any degree certificates, so it is a good idea to send
       those also at the same time as you send the rest of your
       application.

   For your information, the standard solicitation for a reference letter
   by Heriot-Watt Personnel Office asks the letter writer for details of:

     * the capacity in which they know the candidate,
     * the candidate's skills, abilities and performance in relation to
       the post applied for,
     * the candidate's employment record including details of the
       candidate's role and service dates,
     * their view of the candidate's suitability for the post as a whole,
       in light of the attached details and their knowledge of the
       candidate's experience and abilities,
     * any further relevant information which would assist us in making
       an appointment.
