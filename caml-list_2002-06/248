Well, this is not exactly about marshalling code : I'm not asking
Ocaml to be able to transfer pieces of code between different
programs. Just being able to save an object and reload it in the same
executable later would suffice : since Caml can save closures under
the same constraints, the reason why objects can't be saved must be
something else.
