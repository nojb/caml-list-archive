no line numbers, this is a recurrent complaint :-)

it does stop at the point.

I normally do 'b' to backstep one step and then 'u' one or several times
to go up the stack trace.

if you use windows and use the debugger under emacs, there is a problem 
with crlf vs lf. In order to get the cursor at the right position when
using 
camldebug, I have now learned to do

dos2unix *.ml*
