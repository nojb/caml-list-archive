Normally, the Http_client.pipeline run method will return when the pipeline
is empty, or raise an exception. My XML-RPC code you're working from will,
if the run method raises an exception, re-call it. It's been a while since
I've had time to work on it, and I'm afraid I'm a bit sparse on comments,
but I think I did this to deal with a problem in non-blocking connects that
take a while to complete. If I recall correctly, some exeception handlers in
Http_client weren't getting invoked when they should have, but this problem
went away after one of the times I recompiled it (And I've never seen it
happen since, which is why I never reported a bug). I kept my attempt at a
workaround in the XML-RPC code in place just in case. So, a possible
explanation, assuming the server bits are working as intended: The run
method is getting called (Possibly more than once) with something in the
Http_client.pipeline that's not completing, causing to poll forever waiting
for more information. Have you tried changing the Http_client.pipeline
options in xmlRPCNet.ml to set all the verbose options true for better
debugging of just where it's running into problems?
