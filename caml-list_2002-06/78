Can I ask a dumb-and-uninformed question about this work?

I was under the impression that the CLR as it's currently shipped could not 
do parametric polymorphism.  [Xavier's post from last year listing what 
isn't supported is here:  http://caml.inria.fr/archives/200102/msg00190.html]

So, this work uses a runtime extension (there seem to be some dlls listed 
in the ppt on the site), or a workaround was found?

In other words, if I write an F# applet, can I put it on a webpage like a 
java applet, or would the user need to download and install dlls to extend 
their runtime for it to work?

Thanks,
Chris

PS.  Why F#?  The last thing we need are more symbolic characters in our 
language names!  :)  What was wrong with caml.net, just the compatibility 
issues?
