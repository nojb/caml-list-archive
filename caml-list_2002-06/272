I also think it would be nice to have one big polymorphic data-structures
library ( a la C++ Standard Template Library ) including both mutable and
non-mutable structures and most of the common algorithms - and perhaps some
"misc" functions for strings and others.... If some people are interested by
opening a SourceForge ( or other CVS ) account to enable such development,
that will enable the whole community to design and write such a library.

Once it'll be complete and safe, I don't think there will be any problem for
putting it into the official distribution.
