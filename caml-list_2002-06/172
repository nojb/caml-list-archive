Since it's now summer time, is anyone willing to write an interactive
fiction game (i.e. à la Zork or Adventure, although not necessarily in
that particular (fantasy) style) in French (and in Ocaml, of course) ?
The lack of IF games in french is frustrating. Plus, I guess it would
be really fun to write such a game in Ocaml, given that current IF
systems are half-baked, improvised languages.

In particular, natural language processing routines for french
(parsing/unparsing) would be needed.
