I'm just starting to use the ocaml debugger.  I notice that when doing a
backtrace, the different stack frames are identified as character positions
in the source code file, but no line numbers are given.  This is a pretty
major annoyance.  However, when you go up and down the call stack, you get
the line numbers.  Is there any way to put the line numbers in the
backtrace as well?

I also would like a way to stop execution at the point at which an
exception was raised.  There was a bug in my code that raised an exception,
and the debugger was not helpful in tracking it down.  The last location I
could step through before the exception was raised bore no relation to
where the bug was occurring.  I'm not really sure why this was the case.

Sorry to sound so critical; ocaml is really the best language around.
