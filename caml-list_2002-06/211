My proposal for "shlibs" was just for the sake of example, and isn't
very descriptive.  I like "stublibs" or "libexec" better, actually.

Keep in mind that there is only one OCaml standard library directory.
So, non-packaged libraries tend to install in `ocamlc -where`/LIBNAME,
and would put their DLLs in `ocamlc -where`/stublibs.  Hence,
I'm not sure the second directory /usr/local/lib/ocaml/stublibs
would be used a lot.  But it doesn't hurt.

On a related issue, to facilitate the transition from the current
scheme, it might be worth adding /usr/lib/ocaml as a third
directory, at least for the next two releases or so.

I don't think so.  The hardcoding in ld.so seems to come from a desire
to facilitate disaster recovery: even if the ld.so cache or
configuration files get accidentally wiped, a reasonable number of
dynamically-linked utility programs still run.  There is less to worry
about wiping OCaml's ld.conf file.
