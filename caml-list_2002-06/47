Track down single coercions (_ :> t2) and replace them with full ones
(_ : t1 :> t2) as much possible. This improves predictability and
performance.

What is your patch? Classes are already parametric, no?

Probably. As I explained some time ago, a few exponentials have been
tamed recently to linear or quadratic.
Note that now single coercion shouldn't bother you for performance
anymore, but they may be slightly weaker than before in some cases.
