You are more than welcome. Thank you both, instead, for the 
continual improvements to O'Caml. I enjoy programming in 
O'Caml more than in any other language.

I'll keep in mind your comment about the caml-bugs reporting 
system. If I notice any strange behavior in the CVS version 
I'll ask you guys through that address.
