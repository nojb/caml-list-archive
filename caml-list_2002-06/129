OK, if it's just for debugging, and only intended to run under Unix,
you could use the following:

     external int_of_filedesc: Unix.file_descr -> int = "%identity"

Not really.  It's a typedef of void *.  Values of this type look like
small integers, but no guarantees of this kind are given in the Win32
specs.  Moreover, a Unix.file_descr under Windows is not a HANDLE, but
a pair of a HANDLE and a flag saying whether it's a socket or not.

See, we really need type abstraction to hide these details :-)  And
also to catch common errors like confusing the "fd" and "length"
parameters to the read() or write() functions (in C).
