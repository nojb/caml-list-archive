Hi, Markus, 

You are right. After I removed all the "module A = struct ... end"  
from the ml and mli files, it's ok now. 

But I still can not figure out why all my original files works well if I
enter the ocaml mode and 

# #use "a.mli"
# #use "a.ml"

I think that it should be consistent in both ways.
