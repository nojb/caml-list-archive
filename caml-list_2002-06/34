I have some at_exit functions that must execute before my program
exits, but I also want to see a traceback of any exception that
occurs.  Can I catch the exception, print a traceback like the one you
get when you exit and then call exit?  Or can I catch the exception,
execute the at_exit functions, and then re-raise the exception?  How
*do* you re-raise an exception, anyway?  Do you just catch the
exception and raise it?
