Hi list,

the new version of findlib (ocamlfind) is now available and can be
downloaded at the usual place:

http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/findlib-0.7.tar.gz

The on-line documentation is available here:

http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/findlib/
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/documentation/findlib/quickstart.html

List of changes:

- DLLs: There are now two styles of installation: DLLs can be
  installed in the package directories (like before), or in a shared
  directory "libexec". For the first style, there is now an option
  "ldconf" that determines whether the ld.conf file is to be updated,
  and if so, which file. The latter style is enabled by simply creating
  a directory "libexec" in the site-lib directory.

- "ocamlfind install" preserves now the mtime of the files.

- "ocamlfind printconf" is more flexible, and easier to call from scripts.

- "ocamlfind browser" calls ocamlbrowser with the right -I options.

- "ocamlfind query": -descendants implies now -recursive.

- "ocamlfind ocamldep": -native-filter and -bytecode-filter for more
  exact dependency generation.

- There may be now postinstall and postremove scripts.

- "ocamlfind pkg/cmd": This syntax can be used to call the program cmd
  that is installed in the package directory for pkg. Intended to
  simplify the invocation of programs that are installed in package
  directories and not in XXX/bin, which may be useful for package-
  related tools.

- Findlib has now a toolbox containing helpful programs besides
  ocamlfind. For the beginning, there is a Makefile wizard that
  can be called by "ocamlfind findlib/make_wizard".

- #use "topfind" instead of #use "findlib" to avoid name clashes
  in a certain configuration. #use "findlib" and #use "ocamlfind"
  are still supported for backward compatibility if the name clash
  does not occur.

- Fix: bytecode threads work again. (The wrong unix library was
  linked for recent O'Caml versions.)

- Many smaller improvements; the docs have been updated.
