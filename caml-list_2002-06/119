Hello,

This is just a short answer, since I am currently behind a poor PPP line.

You may know that output/input_values are DANGEROUS. 
There is no type checking of input values. 
Once you use output/input_values, you are away from the ML type safety.
Careless use of ML value I/O makes your program easily explode:

# let oc = open_out_bin "data";;
# output_value oc 1;;
# close_out oc

# let ic = open_in "data"
# (input_value ic : float);;
Seg. fault

Also note that between different programs, functions cannot be exchangable,
since they are just expressed as pointers which are only valid inside
one program.

Carefully check whether your two programs exchange values of the same type...
