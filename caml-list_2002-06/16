If such a module (for apache) would exist, it should/would be named
mod_ocaml, not ocaml_mod.
But this only makes sense for scripting languages, because
you are always able to start an executable directly. This
can be an ocaml-program too.
If you have a mod_perl, then the advantage of this is, that
you can start perl-code without relaunching the application
every time again; and the problem of relaunching a perl-script
over and over again is, that there is a compilation of the
script, every time you start it.
With mod_perl, the scripts will not be recompiled again,
because it can be eval'd.

Ciao,
