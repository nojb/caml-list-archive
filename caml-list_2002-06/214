I've heard the CEO of a 170 people  software company
declare: "Our clients don't want no Ocaml stuff! They don't
want no technology. They want *real_world* products on
*real_world* platforms: COBOL and .NET, that's what they want."

No comment. But if Ocaml could somehow "run on .NET", people
like the above CEO (an ex-mathematician and IBM researcher,
by the way) would be a whole lot more interested in Ocaml.
