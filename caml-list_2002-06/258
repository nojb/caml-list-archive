What's so surprising about this?  This man chose a particular line of
business where customers are not interested in new or advanced stuff.
Just like you could choose to manage a McDonald's and have no
professional interest in gourmet food or fine wines.

I'm not disturbed in the least by the fact that many computer
professionals couldn't care less about what we do.  (And conversely :-)
What I am concerned about is the well-meaning suggestions that we
should move towards "their" technologies in the vague hope that they
will pay more attention then.  They won't.

Again, I think this is a fallacy.  By the same logic:

"if OCaml could somehow 'look like COBOL', people like the above CEO 
 would be a lot more interested in OCaml".

"if Bordeaux red wines were carbonated, McDonald's would be a lot more
 interested in selling them".

You can make your own parallels: it's fun :-)

By a combination of demand and availability (of a machine running said
architecture).

Not at all.  .NET isn't just a (virtual) machine instruction set: it's
a whole infrastructure, including memory management, data
representation formats, systems services, libraries, etc.  All these
replace (and conflict with) those we have in the OCaml implementation.

Our past experiments in retargeting the OCaml implementation to .Net
failed because of this.  For more details, and an explanation of why
.Net is a real straight-jacket for innovative programming languages,
see a previous post of mine:
