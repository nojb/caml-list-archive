Hello.

I need some advice on a project I will have to start in a 
few days. I need to write code to perform spectral analysis 
of digital signals. I do not know the details yet, but I 
know that I will have to perform Fourier trasformations on 
fairly large arrays, let us say in the neighborhood 2^16 
samples. Since the data comes from text files, I would like 
to use Ocaml/Ocamllex/Ocamlyacc, but will I be able to 
perform the numerical part at a decent speed? I realize 
"decent" here could mean just about anything, but since I 
have no real time specs, I simply have to crunch the data 
fast enough (on a fast enough PC) so as to prevent the user 
from getting exceedingly bored and frustrated between 
commands. Are there any optimized FFT (and signal analysis) 
libraries for Ocaml, or should I code the whole thing from 
scratch?

I would appreciate any ideas from anyone having some 
previous signal analysis experience with Ocaml.

Thank you very much.

Alex
