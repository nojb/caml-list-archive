         Objective Caml version 3.04+13 (2002-06-05)

# let k = [ 3; 2 ; 1];;
val k : int list = [3; 2; 1]
# List.sort compare k;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]


Does this solve your problem? You have to realize that 
functions (like Pervasives.compare) are first class citizens 
in O'Caml. That is, you can pass a function like List.sort 
*another function* as a actual parameter.

This is a fairly elementary question. You should try to 
avoid posting questions like this on this list; however, I 
am more than willing to lend a hand, insofar as possible, so 
you can write to me personally, but please mention "Caml" in 
the subject.
