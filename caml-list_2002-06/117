Well, because file descriptors are an abstract data type.  
What makes you think that they are integers?  None of the integer
operations make any sense on file descriptors, e.g. adding or
multiplying two file descriptors.

It is true that under Unix, file descriptors happen to be implemented
as integers, but that's purely accidental.  E.g. under Windows,
Unix.file_descr is not implemented by integers.

Within well-typed code, no.  With typing hacks, yes.  But what would
you want to do this?
