I would go for stublibs myself, but the findlib folk seems keen on
libexec. Maybe we should have a long discution here on that, or you
would decide and we keep that, i don't know, i would need more opinion
on this.

Yes, altough findlib seems to be able to know about it and install thing
in /usr/local/lib, if we need to.

We will keep the full separate directory stuff active in the meantime,
/usr/lib/ocaml is one of those dirs anyway, so there should be no
problem.

Ok, ...

But then, i would argue for some more switch for ocaml (an ocamlc
-wherestubs or even a ocamlc -wherelocal) so that installation programs
not using findlib can have a greater control on where to install their
stuff.
