Well, let's all together choose a name and make it the 'traditional' name for
everyone.

There are two points to consider here :

 1) right now, the only thing we will put in this directory are stub
    libraries that are supposed to be dynamically loaded (the
    dllxxx.so).
 
    => so stublibs or dlls or something such is a good name, I think in
    this approach, stublib is a good name, since it distinguish between
    the stub libraries and the other libraries (well either the C libs
    (in /usr/lib) or the ocaml .cma (in /usr/lib/ocaml and its sublibs.

 2) In the future, more stuff may benefit from this same dynamic loading
    mechanism, which will not necessarily be only the stub libraries. If
    this happen to be the case, we will not want to change the name
    later on, and should choose a more generic name.

    => dlls, or dynlibs or something such would be a good choice here,
    but the real question is to know if this is something that may
    happen in the future or not.

Thus, myself i would choose between :

  o /usr/lib/ocaml/stublibs if we will only ever put stub libs in this
    directory.

  o /usr/lib/ocaml/dynlibs if we will later on also put other libs in this
    directory.

But then, we could have a multiple directories layout, with one being
for stublibs, and others for other kind of dynamic loading libs (or .cma),
So i would go with stublibs.

Are there comments on this, or can i go ahead with this ?
