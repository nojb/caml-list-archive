OK. Now I have this simple problem : I can use Direct Rendering from X
with my Voodoo card in 15 bits, and correct color translation in 24 bits.
is that right ?

Who said computer science is not an exact one ?

Great. Thanks for the tip. Euh, and what if I have to test several colors
? Oh, yes, here it is :

let screen_from_color c =
  set_color x;
  plot 0 0;
  point_color 0 0;;
 
Right ? I'll try it now.

\bye, and thanks again.
