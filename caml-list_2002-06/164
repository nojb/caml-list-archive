My understanding of this is that you would need to hand write the META
files, and use that, i don't think there is an automated tool, and i
also don't really think it is easily possible to write one given the
current state of things, since the info about what library provides
which module is not available easily in the .ml file. (this is exactly
what the META files are all about, if i understood this thing correctly,
but then, i don't use findlib myself).
