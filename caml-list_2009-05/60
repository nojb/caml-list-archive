Thanks, good to know.  I had only taken a superficial look at the
implementation and didn't see any problem with global roots, but even
if this might be true now, I wasn't sure whether this would remain so
in the future.

Right, since allocations are prohibited anyway, one doesn't need to
protect the passed value and won't need local roots.  I guess the
documentation could still be clarified in this respect, because the
explicit prohibition of using the local root (de)registration
functions suggests that these operations are not guaranteed to be
sound and that this might also extend to global roots.

Markus
