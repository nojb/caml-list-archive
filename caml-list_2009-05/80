Thank you, sensei :-)

I am curious if passing unboxed floats is possible in the current
Ocaml data model?

As for proposed options - I tend to vote for #3 (and implement it if
there is a consensus). Still there is a plenty of low-power/embedded
x86 hardware that does not support SSE2. And one will be able to
compare x87 and SSE2 backends performance to convince him/herself that
the play really worths the candle :-)
