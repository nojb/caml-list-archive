I am volunteer to be reviewer.
However, I think it should not be a criteria to be a mother tongue english 
for many reason:
"Non mother tongue english" people use "simple" english and does not 
understand very advanced english. Mother tongue english are tempted to 
fully use english.
I think a reviewer with just basic english would be "very good"...

Anyway, just my opinion...
