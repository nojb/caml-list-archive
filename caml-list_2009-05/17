Probably label_counter exceeds 100000 and local labels overlap L1xxxxx
and L2xxxxxx labels that ocamlopt uses for some internal purposes.
Does your module really need more that 100000 labels? What does your
code do?

In theory you can hack ocamlopt, making internally used labels to
start from 1000000 and 2000000 or more. See files asmcomp/<your
architecture>/emit.mlp and asmcomp/emitaux.ml.

No, I think it's not possible. If you need to do some action
conditionally, how can you manage without jumps and labels?
