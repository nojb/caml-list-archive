I was thinking (if it is possible) to use simple "function call" for
doing float operation. This will be very inefficient, but will provide a
very simple compatible layer.

The more obvious package I see, is the linux kernel or the libc6:
http://packages.debian.org/lenny/linux-image-2.6.26-2-486
http://packages.debian.org/lenny/linux-image-2.6.26-1-686-bigmem
http://packages.debian.org/lenny/libc6
http://packages.debian.org/lenny/libc6-i686

AFAIK, there is no way for the package manager to do a real difference
(no tag). However, the installer has some clue about which one to choose
and install the best one for linux and libc6. Once installed, it is
always updated in the good way, because the arch is embeded into the
package name.

I think linux and libc6 should be considered as exceptions, because they
really provide an important benefit for overall optimization.

For other package, if there is possible optimization, a version with and
without optimization is embedded into the package and chosen at runtime.
Example libavcodec provide i686 and i486 version:
http://packages.debian.org/sid/i386/libavcodec52/filelist

So in conclusion, there is always a "default" non SSE2 alternative for
package that can provide an optimized version. I don't know any package
that are SSE2-only.

Im my opinion, Debian will probably refuse to ship a package that only
provide SSE2-only version (but I am talking from my point of view).
