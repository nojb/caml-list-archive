The dual of sums is products.  Open (labelled) sums are "polymorphic 
variants".  Their duals are open (labelled) products are "rows" (which 
O'Caml already supports, through its objects).

See TAPL for a nice introduction to the type theory of labelled records 
with subtyping (i.e. rows).

Jacques

PS: note that O'Caml's products are positional while its sums are 
labelled, so the duality present in the theory isn't as clear there.  
The better dual for O'Caml's sums is really records.
