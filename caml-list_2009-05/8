Ok, I'm glad I left this to people who are familiar with ARM assembly
programming.  :-)

Awesome, but now I'm confused because the arm.S you included has lots
of .global pseudo-ops.  Do you not compile it with Apple's as?

What's your app?  How are you managing the interface between Cocoa and OCam=

I am very interested in any and all information needed to get a
correct OCaml port suitable for use in App Store applications.  Please
share!

BTW, I've added an issue in mantis[1] now that I know this is more
than a configuration problem.
