As you said (in the deleted part) there are plenty of cpus without
SSE2 around and Debian will continue to support them. That does not
really mean i486 at 25MHz will be used but it is the common bottom
line that can easily be supported.

Having ocaml require SSE2 is quite unacceptable for someone with a Via
C7 cpu (they don't have SSE2, right?) Is it really that much work for
ocaml to use option 3?
