I believe the motivation is to make good performance tractible in ocamlopt so 
it is more about the ease of code generation rather than the inherent 
performance characteristics of the two approaches.

As I understand it, this is very much a problem with ocamlopt and not with 
gcc. Specifically, floating point code compiled by ocamlopt on x86 gives 
mediocre performance for unknown reasons. Hence there is a desire to use more 
modern solutions that simplify the generation of performant code.
