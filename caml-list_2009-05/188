It's version 0.15 (that comes with current version of GODI). There is a 
version 0.17 now, but according to the change log, your fix is already 
in version 0.15. I could give it a try with version 0.17 (if it's just 
to change flexlink without having to recompile the whole installation).

Thanks,

Hans Ole
