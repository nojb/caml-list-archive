You should ask Xavier but I personally don't think that two Windows
ports (Cygwin is quite a different beast) are really the problem for
INRIA. They use (almost) the same C runtime library, the same
makefiles and I don't know a single Ocaml bug that was MSVC or Mingw
specific.

Yes, you have two different emit_nt.mlp and emit.mlp, but the only way
to make things simpler is to abandon MASM syntax completely. In
principle it's possible - GNU as under Windows generates the same COFF
files as MASM, although many Windows people that are not familiar with
AT&T syntax would not be very glad...

I also would like to retain support for i386. Hopefully, one more code
generator (mostly a copy/paste combination of two already existing
ones) would not require too much efforts to support.

Don't quite understand what is "predictable behavior" - any generator
should conform to specs. In my tests x87 and SSE2 backends show the
same results (otherwise it would be called a bug).
