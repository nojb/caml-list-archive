Hi Dimitry,

LexiFi for instance _is_ clearly interested by a sse2 32bit code generator.

One should probably have the following in mind and/or ask the following questions:

- it is probably not a good idea to support both backends (sse2 and old stack fp 
i386 architecture). It will be necessary to make a choice (especially taking in 
account the limited INRIA resources and the burden of already supporting 
different windows ports).

- would INRIA be ok to switch to a sse2 code generator (based on Dimitry's patch 
- supposing that he is ok to donate it to INRIA - or Xavier's work or whatever)?

- I also guess that a sse2 code generator would be simpler than the current one 
(that has to support this horrible fp stack architecture) and would therefore be 
a better candidate for further enhancements.

- what is the opinion on this list, as a switch to a sse2 backend would exclude 
"old" processors from being OCaml compatible (I don't have a precise list at 
hand for now) ?

My opinion is that this support of legacy hardware is not important, but I guess 
others are arguing in opposite directions... :-)

But again, having better floating point performance (and predictable behaviour, 
compared to the bytecode version) would be a big plus for some applications.

Best regards,

Jean-Marc
