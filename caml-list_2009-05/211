of related meetings on various aspects of the intelligent treatment of
mathematical information by computers.

The event incorporates the Calculemus and Mathematical Knowledge
Management conferences and a selection of workshops:

    * Compact Computer Algebra
    * Towards a Digital Mathematics Library
    * Mathematical User Interfaces
    * OpenMath
    * Pen-Based Mathematical Computation
    * W3C Workshop on Using Ink in Multimodal Applications

On the conference pages, you will also see the preliminary program and
