There are actually 4 Windows ports if you include MSVC64! I'm not sure at
this stage that it's possible to reduce the number - I think you'll find
that there are enough users on both sides with enough
hard/impossible-to-work-around requirements (probably to do with external
libraries) such that you'd never be able to decide between just MinGW or
just MSVC. The Cygwin port, although obviously requiring extra work and
support, is more like supporting a separate flavour of UNIX than a separate
Windows port, I think.

+1 I've still got a few quite useable Pentium 3 machines knocking around...
it would seem a shame if a lack of compiler rather than OS support ever
caused them to be retired. That said, the power and noise will probably be
what retires them first...
