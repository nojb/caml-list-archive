I'm happy to provide a unified patch containing everything
we use to cross-compile OCaml for iPhone.  Note that our
patches are against OCaml 3.10.2.  This is simpler for us because
we started with patches by Toshiyuki Maeda that are for 3.10.2.
I would imagine that the changes for 3.11 are minimal, but we
haven't tried it yet.  When we move to 3.11, I'd be happy to
provide new patches (if nobody else does so earlier).

Yes, Apple assumes all developers use their IDE, Xcode.  You can
extract working command lines from the Xcode build log,
painfully.

Here's a little script that shows how we run the cross-compiling
version of gcc.  Although Nathaniel Gray has already posted his,
it might be helpful to have two independent sets.

This is for compiling to the iPhoneOS 2.2 environment.
Differences for other environments are straightforward.

    #!/bin/sh
    PLATFORM=/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform
    SDK=/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS2.2.sdk
    CC="$PLATFORM/Developer/usr/bin/gcc -arch armv6 -isysroot $PLATFORM/$SDK"
    $CC "$@"
