I think *accurate* English is more difficult for a non native than
*basic* English is for a native, hence their preference. As an
anecdotal evidence, the easiest papers I've read on functional
programming happen to be written by native English speakers (I'm
french).

Moreover, a good translation should also translate the tone of the
authors. Any distortion would be very difficult to recover from. It
may even be important to choose between British and American, and be
consistent with that choice=85 I consider myself fluent, yet *this* is
completely out of my reach.

Cheers,
Loup
