In fact, I have done some testing about this sometimes ago and comme to
the conclusion that "-handling on windows is quite weird. If and only if
there is a space (or other problematic char) in your commannd/arg name
you can use quoting. Otherwise it will be reported as an error.

I think it is not directly related to OCaml.

Maybe, I am not totaly right with my conclusion, but I can give you a
simple tips: 

Use Unix.create_process et al that take array as arguments. It always
use the good quoting.
