Maybe this point can be discussed. I think 3 ports for windows is a bit
too much... I don't know Dimitry point of view, but maybe INRIA can just
consider MSVC (or mingw). If this is a way to free INRIA resources, it
is a good option.

I would like to say "go on", but SSE2 will limit OCaml to P4 on i386.
In Debian, this is the "low limit" of our build daemon. I think it is
quite dangerous not having the option of the older code generator...

If INRIA choose to switch to SSE2 there should be at least still a way
to compile on older architecture. Doesn't mean that INRIA need to keep
the old code generator, but should provide a simple emulation for it. In
this case, we will have good performance on new arch for float and we
will still be able to compile on old arch.

I would say that "the performance of legacy hardware is not important"
-- support is still important.

Indeed.
