If the idea is to provide better code generation on x86 going forwards with 
minimal effort then I'd have thought an LLVM-based backend would be the 
obvious choice. My tests with HLVM showed that numerical code can be a 
whopping 8x faster than today's ocamlopt on x86 and, of course, LLVM is 
improving much more rapidly.

LLVM can probably replace the x86, x64 and ppc backends. LLVM also seems like 
a sane approach to providing a native-code top level via its existing JIT 
functionality.
