I was mostly joking about this - don't worry :-)

Even VMWare aren't doing this.  However, it's now relatively common to
have the CPU lie about the true capabilities of its instruction set
(by faking the return from CPUID, which in Linux means that
/proc/cpuinfo flags doesn't give the true picture).  This is done so
that guests can be migrated across machines in a cluser which have
different capabilities.  VMWare called this 'EVC clustering'.

OCaml on ancient pre-SSE2 hardware (for new distributions - they can
keep using RHEL 5 on older hardware).
