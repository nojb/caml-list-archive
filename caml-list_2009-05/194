Subject: 10 jobs in declarative programming

   TEN DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING CONSULTANTS SOUGHT


Semmle and LogicBlox are creating a platform for declarative
programming in Datalog, a pure logic programming language.
Semmle is based in Oxford, headed by Oege de Moor;
LogicBlox is based in Atlanta, headed by Molham Aref.

To configure our solution at a number of large corporate
clients in the retail, insurance and software quality
industries, we urgently require 10 full-time staff to 
act as consultants. These consultants will work with 
clients to write custom queries in Datalog, and to create 
user interfaces in a declarative framework.

This is a unique opportunity to change the way enterprise 
software is constructed, and to become part of the revolution
to adopt declarative programming in mainstream applications.

Semmle and LogicBlox offer a vibrant, intellectually
stimulating environment to work on exciting applications of
cutting-edge technology. 

Requirements:
You must be passionate about simplifying the construction
of complex software systems. A good undergraduate degree in 
computer science or related discipline is necessary. Substantial 
programming experience, and familarity with declarative 
programming (both functional and logic) is a must. Some 
travel will be required.

Starting date and renumeration:
The openings are available immediately. The renumeration depends
on experience and qualifications; it is especially competitive 
for recent graduates.

Further information:
To find out more about this opportunity, write to
Oege de Moor (oege@semmle.com) and Molham Aref 
(molham@logicblox.com).

To apply:
Send a CV and the names of three referees (at least two of
whom must be able to comment on your programming abilities)
to recruit@semmle.com, by June 12.
