Well, I can provide a complete garbage collected VM. :-)

The hard part of writing an LLVM backend for ocamlopt is probably getting LLVM 
to generate code that is compatible with OCaml's GC, particularly the stack. 
However, I believe Gordon Henriksen already did this:

  "Included in the pending LLVM garbage collection code generation  
changeset is an Ocaml frametable emitter." -
  http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2007-November/011527.html

Unfortunately, I will not have any spare time until my next book is out...

Did any of the OCaml+LLVM student projects get funded in the end?
