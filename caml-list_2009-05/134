Hello Markus,

I had a similar issue. The probles seems to be in the first line of  
the files ./lib/type_class.mli and ./lib/type_class.ml.
It looks like
(*pp cpp $ARCH_FLAGS *)
which, on Mac OS X, should be changed to
(*pp gcc -E -xc $ARCH_FLAGS *)

Unfortunately, I don't know how to "productize" such change.

-- Valentyn.
