Right now we're mostly focused on getting iPhone applications
completed and accepted by Apple.  We've built the interface layer
by hand, a little bit at a time as required.   So there are
wrappers only for the parts of Cocoa Touch we use, and there are
a few rough edges.  It wouldn't make a good teaching environment
in its current form.

The cross-compiler does work though, and it builds working
applications.  I'll be sending the rest of our patches shortly.
Creating wrappers for all of Cocoa Touch would be a very big job
but it might be possible to implement a small subset for
students.

Right now the best we can do is probably to offer advice on some
things that did and didn't work for us.  As we make progress
perhaps we'll be in a position to do more.
