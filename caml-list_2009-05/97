                         3rd CALL FOR PAPERS

                  The 2009 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

               To be held in conjunction with ICFP 2009
                      on Sunday, August 30, 2009
                      in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK

               http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/ml2009/

                   -------------------------------
                   DEADLINE EXTENDED until May 17!
                   -------------------------------

GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP

ML is a family of programming languages that includes dialects known
as Standard ML, Objective Caml, and F#.  The development of these
languages has inspired a large amount of computer science research,
both practical and theoretical.  This workshop aims to provide a forum
to encourage discussion and research on ML and related technology
(higher-order, typed, or strict languages).

The 2009 Work shop on ML will be held in conjunction with the 14th ACM
SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2009)
in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.  Previous instances were ML 2005 in
Tallinn, Estonia, ML 2006 in Portland, Oregon, USA, ML 2007 in
Freiburg, Germany, and ML 2008 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada).


IMPORTANT DATES

Submission:      Sunday, May 17, 2009 (EXTENDED!)
Notification:    Friday, May 29, 2009
Final revision:  Monday, June 15, 2009
Workshop:        Sunday, August 30, 2009


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

We seek papers on topics related to ML, including, but not limited to:

* applications:  case studies, experience reports, pearls, etc.
* extensions:  higher forms of polymorphism, generic programming,
  objects, concurrency, distribution and mobility, semi-structured
  data handling, etc.
* type systems:  inference, effects, overloading, modules, contracts,
  specifications and assertions, dynamic typing, error reporting, etc.
* implementation:  compilers, interpreters, type checkers, partial
  evaluators, runtime systems, garbage collectors, etc.
* environments:  libraries, tools, editors, debuggers, cross-language
  interoperability, functional data structures, etc.
* semantics:  operational, denotational, program equivalence,
  parametricity, mechanization, etc.

Submitted papers should describe new ideas, experimental results,
ML-related projects, or informed positions regarding proposals for
next-generation ML-style languages.  In order to encourage lively
discussion, submitted papers may describe work in progress.  All
papers will be judged on a combination of correctness, significance,
novelty, clarity, and interest to the community.

All paper submissions must be in English and at most 12 pages total
length in the standard ACM SIGPLAN two-column conference format (9pt).
Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the
ACM Digital Library.

More details about the submission procedure will be announced later
on the Workshop web page.
