 CALCULEMUS 2010 - Call for Participation
------------------------------------------

17th Symposium on the Integration of
Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning

CNAM, Paris, France, July 6-7, 2010

http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/calculemus/

*******************************************
    >>>> Registration is now open! <<<<
          (via CICM registration)

 http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/registration.html

 Registration deadline: July 4, 2010
*******************************************

Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of computer
algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning, the interactive
theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the automated theorem provers
(ATP).

Currently, symbolic computation is divided into several (more or less)
independent branches: traditional ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised
reasoning) as well as newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge
management, theory exploration, etc.) The main concern of the Calculemus
community is to bring these developments together in order to facilitate the
theory, design, and implementation of integrated systems for computer
mathematics that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer scientists
and engineers in their every day business.

Calculemus 2010 will be held jointly with AISC 2010 and MKM 2010 (confederated
in the Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics, CICM 2010) in Paris
(France).

Topics of Interest
==================

The scope of Calculemus covers all aspects of the interplay of mechanised
reasoning and computer algebra, including cross-fertilisation between those two
research areas, as well as the development of integrated systems that transcend
both computer algebra and theorem proving. Potential topics of interest
include:

  * Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)
  * Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)
  * Case studies and applications that both involve computer algebra and
    mechanised reasoning
  * Representation of mathematics in computer algebra
  * Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP
  * Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving
  * Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction
  * Mathematical computation in PA and ATP
  * Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for computer
    mathematics
  * Infrastructure for mathematical services
  * Theory exploration techniques

Accepted Papers
===============

This year, 7 full papers have been accepted for presentation at the conference.
These papers are the following:

  * Formal Proof of SCHUR Conjugate Function
    Franck Butelle, Florent Hivert, Micaela Mayero and Frédéric Toumazet

  * Symbolic Domain Decomposition
    Jacques Carette, Alan Sexton, Volker Sorge and Stephen Watt

  * A Formal Quantifier Elimination for Algebraically Closed Fields
    Cyril Cohen and Assia Mahboubi

  * Computing in Coq with Infinite Algebraic Data Structures
    Cesar Dominguez and Julio Rubio

  * Formally Verified Conditions for Regularity of Interval Matrices
    Ioana Pasca

  * Reducing Expression Size using Rule-Based Integration
    Albert Rich and David Jeffrey

  * A Unified Formal Description of Arithmetic and Set Theoretical Data Types
    Paul Tarau

In addition, there will be short presentations for extended abstracts on
emerging trends, and possibly, sessions dedicated to demos.

Invited Speakers
================

Andrea Asperti    (University of Bologna, Italy)
Jacques Carette   (McMaster University, Canada)

Proceedings
===========

The proceedings of full papers of the conference will be published as a volume
in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) by
Springer-Verlag. In addition to the formal proceedings published by Springer,
we will provide links to online versions of the published papers from the
conference website.

Extended abstracts on emerging trends will be published as a technical report
of CEDRIC (CNAM/ENSIIE) and will be electronically available. These papers are
expected to be describing work in progress.

Important Dates
===============

The registration deadline is July 4, 2010.
The Calculemus conference is on July 6-7, 2010.
