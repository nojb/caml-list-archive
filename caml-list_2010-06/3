Hi. Deliberately going of topic...

I'm far to be an expert on the field and I'd appreciate a bit of
guidance...

I was under the impression the hypergraph partitioning is the leading
strategy to reduce the size of a BDD. When dealing with real size
problems, finding a suitable order to work with BDDs is essential. Last
week I've implemented an heuristic (FORCE) to derive a static ordering
from my graph, but I then discovered that the bdd package I'm using
(buddy bdd) deals pretty badly with static ordering taking a cubic time
on the # of variables to set up a bdd with this order. 

The other option I have is to partition the graph in clusters and then
use the buddy dynamic ordering that "apparently' works well ... To cut a
long story short, this is what led me to hypergraph partitioning. Now
you are saying that they are not often implemented and I'm wondering if
I'm completely off track here and there are other heuristics to compute
a suitable block order and therefore reduce the size of a bdd ... MINCE
for example uses hypergraph partitioning in order to find a suitable
variable ordering ...

thanks !
