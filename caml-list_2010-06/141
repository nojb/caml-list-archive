"In the context of telecommunications and computing  a device or

Do you have an example of old code not being able to compile anymore
because of that change? If so you should probably fill in a bug
report.

As for forward compatibility (ie programs coded with 3.12 in mind
might not compile with 3.10) this is a price I am happy to pay in
order to have a language that's constantly improving. I think that
this is feeling that is shared by many.

And, last but nor least, older does not necessarily mean more stable.
You seem to use those interchangeably in your mail. Windows 3.11 is
old...
