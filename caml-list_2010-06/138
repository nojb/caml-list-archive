The 3.12 version number is just minor increment. It should keep =20
backward compatibility with the 3.x branch as much as possible.

Yes, this feature is cool. We agree on this point. However not all =20
systems will be updated to 3.12 as soon as the final version is out. =20
Most users rely on their linux distribution ocaml (Debian stable is =20
still stuck at 3.10 for instance).

For syntax sugar extensions, such as { loc; name; _ }, your "don't use =20
it" conclusion can be understood. But for code stabilization syntax =20
extensions, such as { ... ; _ }, it's an other story. Users stuck with =20
more stable versions of the compiler should be able to use more stable =20
versions of software compiled with it.
