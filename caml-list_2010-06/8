The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial 
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of 
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning, 
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to 
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to 
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 17th LPAR
will be held in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

Conference Chair: Steffen Hoelldobler
Programme Chairs: Chris Fermueller, Andrei Voronkov

Submissions of two kinds are welcome:
* Regular papers that describe solid new research results. 
* Experimental and tool papers that describe implementations of systems, 
  report experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented systems.

See the web site http://www.computational-logic.org/lpar-17/Home.html for all
the details.

                    LPAR-17 WORKSHOPS October 10th, 2010

        ============================================================
        APS 5 - 5th International Workshop on Analytic Proof Systems
        ============================================================
              http://www.logic.at/staff/chrisf/ws/LPAR-AS-5.html

Analyticity is a topic that connects foundational issues in logic with 
applications, mainly in automated deduction and analysis of proofs. The 
workshop is primarily intended to enhance awareness for its topic and to 
promote corresponding discussions and contacts between experienced experts 
and younger colleagues. The submission deadline is 10th September.

Organizers: Matthias Baaz, Christian Fermueller

   ==========================================================================
   IWIL 2010 - The 8th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics
   ==========================================================================
            http://www.eprover.org/EVENTS/IWIL-2010/iwil-2010.html

IWIL has been unusually sucessful in bringing together many talented 
developers, and thus in sharing information about successful implementation 
techniques for automated reasoning systems and similar programs.  We are 
looking for contributions describing implementation techniques for and 
implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem provers for various 
logics, logic programming systems, and related technologies. The submission 
deadline is 9th August.

Organizers: Evgenia Ternovska, Stephan Schulz, Geoff Sutcliffe
