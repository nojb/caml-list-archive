ok all, it has to be considered as forward compatibility, speaking at =20
ocaml point-of-view, this POV is likely the one most of you have.
However, at source POV (where OCaml is seen as a tool), this can be =20
seen as backward compatibility: the source code we write could be =20
backward compatible with older versions of OCaml. Anyway, I will stop =20
here the terminology fight and use your POV...

This specific ( { ; _} ) forward compatibility with ocaml <3.12 is =20
possible for a little cost. It's just about removing the extra =20
underscore characters. Anyway if the preprocessing script does not =20
come out of the ocaml 3.12 box, I will have to do it. Other developers =20
may have to so as well.
Mainly because this coverage check is a must-do and because I do not =20
want to force a general update to OCaml 3.12 when that can be avoided. =20
The coverage check has to be done only once, at "developer's" side, =20
using 3.12. Once the changes are done, stripped code can easily be =20
compiled using older versions of OCaml, at "user's" side.
