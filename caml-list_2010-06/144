Software development is not your perfect and ideal world. Would you =20
buy a brand new car because your current two-month-old car does not =20
have seat belt reminders? New warnings are almost the only =20
improvements I'm interested in 3.12.

Sometimes you have to support old compiler versions (this choice is =20
not yours) and you need a complete confidence in all the thousands =20
record pattern matchings of your application, some of them (maybe 30%) =20
are intentionally left incomplete in order to keep the code as simple =20
as possible.

Without preprocessing scripts, I will not be able to insert extra "_" =20
for masking intentionally-left-incomplete pattern matchings. The =20
compilation log will be polluted by hundred warnings (false-positive). =20
Finally, the catch of the few remaining should-not-be-incomplete =20
pattern matchings (true-positive) will be very hard.

Anyway, I'm running out of arguments and the problem is still there... =20
I would have wasted less time in having the scripts setup than in =20
arguing here.
