                       Formal Engineering Methods

                      Submission deadline: September 15th, 2010
                      -----------------------------------------


Many interest groups from a research perspective are in favour of the
creation of this workshop.

For more than a decade now, the two communities of UML and formal methods
have been working together to produce a simultaneously practical (via UML)
and rigorous (via formal methods) approach to software engineering.

UML is the de facto standard for modelling various aspects of software
systems in both industry and academia, despite the inconvenience that its
current specification is complex and its syntax imprecise.

The fact that the UML semantics is too informal have led many researchers
to formalize it with all kinds of existing formal languages, like OCL, Z,
B, CSP, VDM, Petri Nets, UPPAAL, HOL, Coq, PVS etc.

This third edition of the workshop will be open to various subjects as the
main objective is to encourage new initiatives of building bridges between
informal, semi-formal and formal notations.


Topics:
======

This workshop seeks contributions from researchers and practitioners
interested in all aspects of integrating UML and formal methods. To this
end, we solicit papers (no more than 8 pages long) related to, but not
limited to, the following principal topics:

·        Consistent specifications, model transformations (QVT technologies,
          transformation repositories). Transformations to make models more
          analyzable so as to make them executable.

·        Automation of traceability through transformations

·        Refinement techniques: developing detailed design from a UML
          abstract specification

·        Refinement of OCL specification as well

·        Formal reasoning on models for code generation

·        Technologies for compositional verification of models

·        Specification of a formal semantics for the UML.
          Giving an abstract syntax to UML diagrams

·        Formal validation and verification of software

·        Co-modeling methods formal/informal mapping techniques

·        End-to-end methodologies or software process
          engineering,correct-by-construction design providing and
          supporting tools for safety-critical embedded systems design


Workshop Format
===============
This full-day workshop will consist of an introduction of the topic by the
workshop organizers, presentations of accepted papers, and in depth
discussion of previously identified subjects emerging from the
submissions. A summary of the discussions will be made available.


Submission and Publication
