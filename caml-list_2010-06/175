              !!! Application Deadline Approaching !!!


The Embedded System Research Unit (http://es.fbk.eu) of the
Information and Communication Technology Center of the Bruno Kessler
Foundation, Trento, Italy, is seeking candidates for Post-Doc
positions, to be hosted according to the call of proposal "Trentino -
The Trentino programme of research, training and mobility of
post-doctoral researchers", to be funded by the Autonomous Province of
Trento, see:
http://www.uniricerca.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_uniricerca/news/call_1_post_doc_2010_incoming_en.1273589322.pdf

Applications are invited in the broad field of formal verification
and planning. Topics of interest include:

- Model Checking 
- Safety Analysis
- Schedulability
- Planning and Run-time Monitoring 

Project proposals may have a duration of between two and three years.

Candidate Profile
=================

The ideal candidate should have a PhD degree in computer science,
mathematics or electronic engineering, combine solid theoretical
background and software development skills, and have some degree of
autonomy.

The candidate should be able to work in a collaborative environment,
with a strong commitment to reaching research excellence and achieving
assigned objectives.

In depth previous experience in at least one of the following areas
will be considered favorably:

- Symbolic Model Checking
- Propositional Satisfiability
- Satisfiability Modulo Theory
- Requirements Analysis
- Constraint Solving and Optimization
- Monitoring and Diagnosability
- Software Verification
- Safety Analysis (FTA, FMEA)

We draw attention on the following requirements stated in the call for
proposal.

(1) The proposing researcher must have a PhD, obtained in Italy or
    abroad no more than three years before the deadline of this call.

(2) The proposing researcher must not have had any working
    relationship (including any fellowship, scholarship, research
    grant, contract, cooperation) with any research organizations
    which have their registered office or operating centres inside
    Trento Province, longer than 30 days on the whole, during the two
    years before the deadline of this call.

Applications and Inquiries
==========================

Potential candidates should express their interest and/or inquire for
further information by sending email to <jobs[at]fbk[dot]eu>.

Applications should contain a statement of interest, with a Curriculum
Vitae, and the names of three reference persons. PDF format is
strongly encouraged.

Emails will be automatically processed and should have

       'RIF: ES/postdoc' 

as subject.

Potential candidates will be interviewed in order to define the
objectives of the research activities and to obtain the endorsement of
the hosting institution. If successful, they will be required to
complete the application through the PAT site by July 13th, 2010.

The applications will be evaluated by an independent team of experts.

The Embedded System Research Unit
=================================

The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including
researchers, post-Doc, PhD students, and programmers. The
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in
the fields of design and verification of embedded systems.

Current research directions include:

* Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the
  verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid
  systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink)

* Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics
  (consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,
  cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis)

* Model-based engineering and formal verification of aerospace systems
  using model checking techniques, on-board reasoning systems for autonomous
  vehicles using planning techniques

* Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional
  techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic
  verification techniques

The unit develops and maintains several tools:

* the NuSMV symbolic model checker (http://nusmv.fbk.eu)

* the MathSAT SMT solver (http://mathsat.fbk.eu)

* the Formal Safety Analysis Platform FSAP (http://fsap.fbk.eu)

* the Requirements Analysis Tool RAT (http://rat.fbk.eu)

The unit is currently involved in several research projects, funded by
the European Union, the European Space Agency, the European Railway
Agency, as well as in industrial technology transfer projects. The
projects aim at applying research results to key application domains
such as space, avionics, railways, hardware design and mobile embedded
applications.

A list of past and present projects, the unit has been involved in,
include:

- MISSA (http://es.fbk.eu/index.php?n=Projects.MISSA)
- COCONUT (http://es.fbk.eu/index.php?n=Projects.COCONUT)
- EURAILCHECK (https://es.fbk.eu/projects/eurailcheck/)
- OMC-ARE (https://es.fbk.eu/index.php?n=Projects.OMCARE)
- COMPASS (http://compass.informatik.rwth-aachen.de)

The Embedded Systems (ES) Unit is part of the Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) Center of Fondazione Bruno Kessler
(FBK), formerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a private non-profit
research centre established by the government of Autonomous Province
of Trento (PAT) in 1976. The institute, through its ICT Center, is
active in the areas of Information Technology, Microsystems, and
Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and Interfaces. Today, FBK is an
internationally recognized research institute, collaborating with
industries, universities, and public and private laboratories in Italy
and abroad. The institute's applied and basic research activities aim
at resolving real-world problems, driven by the need for technological
innovation in society and industry.

Location
========

Trento is a lively town of about 100.000 inhabitants, located 130 km
south of the border between Italy and Austria. It is well known for
the beauty of its mountains and lakes, and it offers the possibility
to practice a wide range of sports. Trento enjoys a rich cultural and
historical heritage, and it is the ideal starting point for day trips
to famous towns such as Venice or Verona, as well as to enjoy great
naturalistic journeys. Detailed information about Trento and its
region can be found at http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en.
