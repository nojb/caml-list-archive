I have received a request to put the OCaml logo on the identi.ca OCaml
group[1].  In looking for a copy of the logo, the only source I can find
is the logos page[2].  These logos are not very high-resolution,
however; when I extract the camel from the largest ones, it still has to
be scaled up for identi.ca.  Is there a higher-resolution, possibly even
SVG, version of the logo available anywhere?  Preferably just the camel
(identi.ca logos must be square), but the camel can likely be extracted
from a composite image.

Also, is there any existing policy I should be aware of in using the
camel logo for this?

Thanks,
- Michael
