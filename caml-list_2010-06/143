The trailing _ in a record match is not required.  It is allowed in
3.12, and in combination with an optional warning flag it can be used
to check for incomplete record matches.  Why is any preprocessing
needed?  If an application is written to require OCaml 3.12.x or
later, why would you expect it to compile with an earlier version?

How is this a bigger "backward compatibility" break than first-class
modules or the "let open Module in" syntax?
