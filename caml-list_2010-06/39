I'm not sure I agree on this one since in the second case the
parentheses are not needed. And if you put the annotation in the
second component (as you suggest your second message) then we are back
to most important first and without parentheses :

let f =3D function
| `Leaf s, _ -> ...
| `Node l, _ -> ...

That's true and certainly a good argument for the second form if you
already know the type of your annotations and have such needs. However
if you want to keep that polymorphic (the annotation is a convenience
for the client) it results in a type variable per case which becomes
heavy.

I can understand that. It's true that it may make you think that you
are able to get a non-annotated value by just dropping the first
component. On the other hand the rule is quite simple, you always work
with pairs, period.

Yes, that's mainly a discussion about taste.

Thanks for your comments,
