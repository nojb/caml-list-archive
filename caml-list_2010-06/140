Backward compatibility is the ability for the 3.12 compiler to compile
source code written for the 3.11 or earlier version. And this is
(mostly) achieved.

What you're asking for is "forward compatibility". An no one really
wants that, because it would prevent any new feature in the compiler
exept on those rare major version.
