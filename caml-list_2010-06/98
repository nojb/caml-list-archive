			CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
	     AISC 2010 - 10th International Conference on 
	   ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION 
	    CNAM, Paris, France, July 5th - July 6th, 2010
		   [http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/aisc/]

as part of CICM 2010 - Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
                     [http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Artificial  Intelligence and  Symbolic Computation  are two  views and
approaches for automating  problem solving, in particular mathematical
problem solving, and  AISC is the conference on  all topics related to
applying  Artificial  Intelligence   to  Symbolic  Computation  or  to
applying Symbolic Computation to Artificial Intelligence.  This year's
AISC conference will consist of presentations of high-quality original
research papers, short presentations and invited talks.

As part of the Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics it will
be co-located with  the 17th Symposium on the  Integration of Symbolic
Computation  and  Mechanised   Reasoning  (Calculemus  2010)  and  9th
International  Conference on  Mathematical  Knowledge Management  (MKM
2010), and  a number of workshops  and a doctoral  programme. For more
information see http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/

Registration to the conference is now open and online at 

            http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/registration.html

Registration includes  one hard-copy of the  Springer LNAI proceedings
of  the  CICM  conferences   and  one  social  event.  Information  on
accommodation and  travelling is also  available on the CICM  2010 web
pages.
