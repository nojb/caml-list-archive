Call for Papers 


International Workshop on Programming Support Innovations for 
Emerging Distributed Applications 
(PSI EtA - ψη 2010)


October 17, 2010
Reno/Tahoe NEVADA, USA
Held in conjunction with SPLASH 2010

URL: http://research.cs.vt.edu/vtspaces/workshop/

Objectives
	Distribution has become a necessity for the majority of computing domains, but developing distributed applications remains a highly delicate and complex task. Several emerging distributed computing and application domains, including cloud computing, service-oriented  computing, stream processing, sensor networks, and context-aware computing, pose unprecedented challenges to the programmer. Applications in these domains can deliver tangible benefits to the user once they enter the mainstream of industrial software development. What is hindering the wide adoption and use of these applications is the prevalence of ad-hoc programming practices in their software development process. The goal of this workshop is to explore programming support innovations that can address the incongruence between the advanced programming requirements of emerging distributed applications and the current state of the art of their programming support. To that end, the workshop will provide a venue fo!
 r free and open discussions among academic researchers and industry practitioners of distributed applications.

Possible topics for contributions include, but are not limited to:
	
	-Programming frameworks
	-Domain specific languages
	-Code generators
	-Middleware systems
	-Program transformation systems
	-Extensible languages
	-Component technologies
	-Product-line architectures
	-Advanced separation of concerns

Submission Guidelines
	All papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, through EasyChair. Submissions 	must not exceed 5 pages, in the ACM SIGPLAN 10 point format. Templates for Word and LaTeX 	are available at http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm.

	-Submission deadline: August 9, 2010
	-Acceptance notification: September 6, 2010
	-Camera-ready deadline: October 4, 2010
	-Workshop day: October 17, 2010
