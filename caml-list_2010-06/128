                        CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
                 The 9th International Conference on
                  MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

                               MKM 2010

                     http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/mkm/

                CNAM, Paris, France, 8th-9th July 2010

as part of CICM 2010 - Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
                       http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/

Mathematical  Knowledge  Management  is  an innovative  field  at  the
intersection  of mathematics, computer  science, library  science, and
scientific publishing. Its development is  driven, on the one hand, by
new technological possibilities  which computer science, the Internet,
and intelligent knowledge processing offer, and, on the other hand, by
the increasing  demand by engineers and scientists  for new techniques
to   help  in   producing,  transmitting,   consuming,   and  managing
sophisticated mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. More  information about the  MKM conference series  can be
found at the MKM Interest Group Webpage: http://www.mkm-ig.org/

As  part of the  Conferences on  Intelligent Computer  Mathematics, it
will  be co-located  with the  17th  Symposium on  the Integration  of
Symbolic  Computation and Mechanised  Reasoning (Calculemus  2010) and
the  10th  International  Conference  on Artificial  Intelligence  and
Symbolic  Computation (AISC  2010), and  a number  of workshops  and a
doctoral programme. For more information, see http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/

Registration to the conference is now open and online at

           http://cicm2010.cnam.fr/registration.html

Registration includes  one hard-copy of the  Springer LNAI proceedings
of  the  CICM  conferences   and  one  social  event.  Information  on
accommodation and  travelling is also  available on the CICM  2010 web
pages.
