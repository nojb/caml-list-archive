This year, I'm again helping to organize Formal Aspects of
Security and Trust.  It's been a very high quality workshop
in recent years, with LNCS post-proceedings expected again
for this year.

Citeseer's most recent impact page (2007) lists it 80th for
impact among 581 CS venues.  That puts FAST a bit behind
ICALP and ESORICS (74, 76) but ahead of the Journal of
Artificial Intelligence and FMCAD (91, 98).

Have you been working on something that might be suitable?  

We have two categories of papers, full papers at 15 pages
and short ones at 5 pages.  Short papers can summarize your
recent work published elsewhere, or they can report work in
progress.  There is no simultaneous publication restriction
for short papers.  When appropriate, the PC can invite short
paper authors to expand them to full papers for the LNCS
post-proceedings.

I'd be very pleased if you'd consider submitting something
in either category.  And it'd be great to see you in Pisa in
September.  

Best -- 

	Joshua

OVERVIEW OF FAST

The seventh International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Security
and Trust (FAST2010) aims at continuing the successful efforts
of the previous FAST workshops, fostering cooperation among
researchers in the areas of security and trust.

Computing and network infrastructures have become pervasive, and
now they carry a great deal of economic activity.  Thus, society
needs well matching security and trust mechanisms.  Interactions
increasingly span several enterprises and involve loosely
structured communities of individuals.  Participants in these
activities must control interactions with their partners based
on trust policies and business logic.  Trust-based decisions
effectively determine the security goals for shared information
and for access to sensitive or valuable resources.

FAST focuses on the formal models of security and trust that are
needed to state goals and policies for these interactions.  We also
seek new and innovative techniques for establishing consequences of
these formal models.  Implementation approaches for such techniques
are also welcome.

PROCEEDINGS

As done for the previous issues of FAST, the post-proceedings of the
workshop will be published with LNCS (under negotiation).
A special journal issue is also planned.


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

We seek papers presenting original contributions. Two types of
submissions are possible:

(1) short papers, up to 5 pages in LNCS format,
(2) full papers, up to 15 pages in LNCS format.

Submissions should clearly state their category (1 or 2).
Author's full name, address, and e-mail must appear on the first page.

Short papers as well as full papers will be included in the
informal proceedings distributed at the workshop.  After the
workshop, authors of short papers which are judged mature enough
for publication will be invited to submit full papers. These
will be reviewed according to the usual refereeing procedures,
and accepted papers will be published in the post-proceedings in
LNCS.

Simultaneous submission of full papers to a journal or
conference/workshop with formal proceedings justifies rejection.
Short papers at FAST are not formally published, so this
restriction does not apply to them.  However, related
publications and overlapping submissions must be cited
explicitly in short papers.
