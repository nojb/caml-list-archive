Well, there are indeed two ways to call OCaml code from another JVM =
language:
  - by callbacks;
  - by scripting.

Callback from a JVM language work similarly to callback from C to
either ocamlc- or ocamlopt-compiled code. This is described in the
fourth chapter of [1], original callbacks being described by the chapter =
[2].
However, beware that the representation of OCaml values is going
to change in the upcoming 2.0 version of OCaml-Java.

Scripting is based on the "javax.script" package introduced by JDK 1.6.
It allows to execute arbitrary OCaml code, and can call OCaml compiled
code. It is slower than callbacks, as the script code has to be compiled
at runtime.


Finally, here are some key points that may help you making up your mind:
  - performance in version 2.0 should stand between ocamlc and ocamlopt;
  - version 2.0 will be based on JDK 1.7;
  - hopefully an alpha version should be released during summer, with =
the
    goal of having a stable version by the end of the year (current =
target of
    JDK 1.7 release).


Feel free to ask for further explanations if needed.
