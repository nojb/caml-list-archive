That exception was raised when forcing a lazy value (Lazy.force catches
it and re-raises it).  So you'll need to wrap the expression following
the "lazy" keyword with a handler for Invalid_argument, and you might
be able to use Printexc.print_backtrace from there.  But I don't know
why the standard backtrace printer can't "see" into the closure being
forced.
