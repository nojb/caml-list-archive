             Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS 2010)

                               2nd Call for Papers
     7th International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Component Software

                             October 14-16, 2010
                            Universidade do Minho
                              Guimaraes, Portugal


                          www.di.uminho.pt/facs2010/


Scope & Topics:

The component-based software development approach has emerged as a
promising paradigm to cope with an ever increasing complexity of
present-day software solutions by bringing sound production and
engineering principles into software engineering. However, many
conceptual and technological issues remain in component-based software
development theory and practice that pose challenging research
questions.

FACS 2010 is concerned with how formal methods can or should be used
to make component-based software development succeed. Formal methods
consist of mathematically-based techniques for the specification,
development, and verification of software and hardware systems. They
have shown their great utility for providing the formal foundations of
component-based software and working out challenging issues such as
mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, or
rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and
certification.

The objective of FACS 2010 is to bring together researchers and
practitioners in the areas of component software and formal methods in
order to promote a deeper understanding of the component-based
software development paradigm and its applications. The workshop seeks
to address all common aspects of component software and formal
methods.  FACS aims at developing a community-based understanding of
relevant and emerging research problems through formal paper
presentations and lively discussions. Possible topics include, but are
not limited to:

- formal models for software components and component interaction
- design and verification methods for component software component
- composition and deployment: models, calculi, languages
- component testing, re-engineering and reuse
- specification of extra-functional properties in component software
- certification of components and software architectures
- component software vs. object orientation, multi-agent systems, and
  aspect-oriented development
- components for real-time, safety-critical, secure and/or embedded systems
- standard models for software components (e.g. Fractal, GCM, etc.)
- industrial or experience reports, and case studies in component software
- partial behavior models for software components
- update and reconfiguration of component architectures
- component systems evolution and maintenance
- formal methods and modeling languages for components
- trust models for components
- cyber-physical component-based systems
- autonomic components and self-managed applications
- formal and rigorous approaches to software adaptation and 
self-adaptive systems
- formal aspects of Web services and business processes
- component-based Web services and service-oriented architectures
- QoS issues in Web services, multi-agent systems and component-based
  systems


Context:
FACS'10 is the 7th event in a series of workshops, founded by the
International Institute for Software Technology of the United Nations
University (UNU-IIST). The first FACS workshop was co-located with
FM'03 (Pisa, Italy, September 2003). The following FACS workshops were
organized as standalone events, respectively at UNU-IIST in Macau
(October 2005), at Charles University in Prague (September 2006), at
INRIA in Sophia-Antipolis (September 2007), and at University of
Malaga in Spain (September 2008).  FACS'09 was part of the Formal
Methods Week in Eindhoven (October 2009).

Publication:
We solicit two categories of high-quality submissions on research
results and/or experience: research papers (LNCS format, not exceeding
18 pages including bibliography and figures) describing a technical
contribution in depth and doctoral abstracts (2 pages, LNCS format)
concisely capturing PhD-work-in-progress, referring theme, context,
research questions, envisaged contributions, and partial results.
Submissions to the workshop should present original research which is
unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will
be judged on the basis of originality, relevance, technical soundness
and presentation quality.

Submission of papers will be in electronic form via Easychair,
accessible through the workshop website. The final version of the
paper must be prepared in LaTeX, adhering to the LNCS format. The
post-proceedings of the workshop will be published as a volume in
Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science.  Authors of accepted
papers should provide all the electronic files of the final version of
their paper according to the instructions provided at the LNCS home
page (www.springer.com/lncs).

As in previous years, we plan to publish extended versions of selected
papers in a special issue of Science of Computer Programming.
