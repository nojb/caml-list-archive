My apologies but I did not explain myself correctly. The problem here is
that I am trying to automate the conversion to string of the data
structure read from the s-expressions. I have the following:

let string_of_experiment_data data =
   let data = sexp_of_experiment_data data in
   Sexplib.Sexp.to_string_hum data

The problem here is that the "to_string_hum" escapes certain characters,
but I need to have the strings "not escaped". So my question is: is
their any way I can tell sexplib to output a string but not escape
it? Otherwise I will have to hand encode this stuff 8-(

I am aware of this as it is indicated in your documentation and
the ocaml tutorial site. I also searched for a means to "unescape"
the result from "to_string_hum", which would also work. However
I cannot find a String.unescape. This issue has already been pointed
out. A possible solution would be to use the old.

  Token.eval_string

and I cannot seem to use the equivalent of the new camlp4. The
equivalent:

open Camlp4.PreCast
open Syntax
let eval_string s = Camlp4.Struct.Token.Eval.string ~strict:() s

does not compile (Error: Unbound module Camlp4.PreCast).

Can anyone suggest a solution or correction?

TIA,
Hugo F.
