Subject: [Caml-list] parsing XML configuration file

Dear All

I'm coding a program (the POESIA [opensource content filter] monitor -
see www.poesia-filter.org) whose configuration file is an XML file.

The choice of an XML syntax is (in part) "political", because XML is
a fancy buzzword and might attract some people. Actually, I could
change it.

The configuration file is a shallow tree (a bit like Apache
configuration [which I know is not XML])

In XML parlance, the DTD or Schema of the parsed XML file is fixed by
me (it mimicks all the configuration bell & whistle I need), but of
course I may need to evolve it.

I'm currently using PXP for that purpose, but I might be wrong.

Should I consider switching to other Ocaml XML parsers (in particular
yaxpo) to parse such a file (whose DTD is fixed by me, and which is
mostly a shallow tree, not a recursive one..).

Yes I know my question is a bit vague, but I beg for advice.

Regards.
