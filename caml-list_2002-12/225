There is already : debian-ocaml-maint@lists.debian.org :))))

Altough it is more about maintainership of ocaml related packages, so
it doesn't really count.

Also, i believe it is ok to speak about windows specific stuff on this
list, not everyone will feel concerned and the people who are unix users will
maybe not respond, but it is also interesting to know what will (and
will not) work on windows, and what problems they are there. I believe
that most unix users here feel that maybe some day they will want to run
their ocaml program on windows also, and thus these things are of
interrest to them (be it only to confort them in the choie of using UNIX
for developpment and not Windows :))).
