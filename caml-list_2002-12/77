Regarding debian packaging you can look at the following packages, which
are written in ocaml and distributed as debian packages:

- advi
- cameleon
- fort
- ledit
- unison

If you are also looking for debian packaging of ocaml libraries you can
find a lot of packages, look for packages which are named using the
pattern lib*-ocaml and/or lib*-ocaml-dev.

Anyway I think that debian specific questions are a bit OT on this list
so for more info on this please ask on
debian-ocaml-maint@lists.debian.org mailing lists (archives available at
http://lists.debian.org/debian-ocaml-maint/).

Hope this helps,
Cheers.
