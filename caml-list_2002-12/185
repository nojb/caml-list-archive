The C-- team are keenly interested in this possibility.  Fermin Reig
wrote some code for OCaml that emits a version of C-- that looks
somewhat different from our current version.  We have hopes of
adapting that in the future, but right now we are more concerned with
getting our C-- to work better.  (Right now it runs hello world on
three platforms, but it doesn't actually do anything useful.)
