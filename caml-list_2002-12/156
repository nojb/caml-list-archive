I was wondaring if anyone is familiar with a little
language implementation that is suitable to be
embedded in an ocaml program. I realize that it
wouldn't be that hard to do, especially in ocaml, but
hate to duplicate work someone else has already done.
There aren't really that many requirements, just the
ability to look at passed in data structures a return
a result based off of them. 


At first I thought that ocaml itself would be the best
scriping langauge but I havn't figured out how to link
in code compiled with ocamlopt. In fact, I don't think
it is possible at the moment. 

Basically I just need a simple way to extend a running
ocaml program.

Thanks,
Eric
