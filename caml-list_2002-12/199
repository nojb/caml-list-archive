Well, yes, i think nor i, nor the two other authors are using it
anymore. Simply i have no more time for it, so sadly i can no more do
developpment for it. I still maintain the debian package of it, so it
will ever build with the latest ocaml, but no more.

Nice to see that you still use it, i thought nobody used it anymore.

It is GPLed code, feel free to work on it yourself. I think Pascal Cuoq
has access to the CVS repository, but we can migrate it to a
savannah/sourceforge project or something such.

Don't know about this one, i was not the primary author, just used it
and added the functions i needed, and tried to work some on auto
generation using the begining of the c2caml C header parsing tool which
i hopped would generate me at least part of the bindings from the gtk+ C
headers.
