I am pleased to announce the release of version 0.3 of the
BDBFS user-level NFS3 server (an NFS3 server written in OCaml).
You can get it here:

http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~stein/bdbfs/

BDBFS is a portable, user-level NFS fileserver. It implements
version 3 of the NFS protocol as defined in RFC 1813.

BDBFS stands for Berkeley DataBase File System. BDBFS is
implemented in OCaml (release 3.06) and can be compiled either
to native code or bytecodes for the OCaml virtual machine. BDBFS
stores files, metadata (directories, inodes, the superblock) as
key:value pairs using the Berkeley Database (BDB) library.

It would be great to have some users (besides myself)!

This is a beta release. However, it passed all the
connectathon 2003 NFS3 tests and an hour of postmark
stress-testing.
