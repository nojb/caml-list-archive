I assume your plateform is x86 on Debian. Because of the small number
of registers, tail-recursion is limited to 5 arguments (if my memory
serves me well). For more arguments, a tail-rec is not a loop on
x86. Perhaps this could be your problem (just a guess, I encountered
it several years ago and reported to the mailing list). Then you might
merge several arguments into a tuple or record.  Or switch to
plateform with more registers!

Just a wild guess! The Caml team will confirm (or infirm) it.
