There is is no warranty from the language definition, nor from the
implementor team, that the marshalling functions will never be
modified: imagine we find a new way to get data files much more
compact, then yes, sure, we will implement this new scheme as soon as
possible!

However, the modification of the output of marshalling functions is a
dramatic event, and in case of dramatic events the Caml team very
often provide translation programs fro the users. In the unlikely
event that the implementors do not provide such a tool, I'm pretty
sure that somebody in this list will rapidly contribute something
useful to translate from the old to the new format :)

All the best for the next year,
