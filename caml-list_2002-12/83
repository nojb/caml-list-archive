Subject: [Caml-list] another question about pcre_exec
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk

Dose the int array returned by pcre_exec contain the offsets of all the 
matches or the first match from pos?

However as i tried, it seems that it returned the first match offects,
then why it return a int array  not a turple of int*int which refers to 
(from, to) ?


thanks
