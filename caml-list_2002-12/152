BTW, I've looked into the code. I may be wrong, but it seems that there
are
problems with memory management. Authors think that in C "sizeof(char*)"
gives maximum length of string or something like that, so they allocate
memory like this: this_arg = (char *) ap_pcalloc(r->pool, sizeof(char
*));

Another interesting example that I would not comment:
p->key = (char**)ap_pcalloc(r->pool, sizeof (char **) * 255);

Nice tool anyway. :-)
