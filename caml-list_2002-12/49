Subject: [Caml-list] Memory leak with native code.

I have a fairly complex program that has numerous callbacks between
Ocaml, C and back to Ocaml (I'm using Debian's 3.06).

If I compile my program byte-code, it works well.

However, if I compile it native, it seems to leak memory, just consuming
more and more memory as it runs.

I was wondering if anyone has any pointers on how to debug this kind of
issue.  I've checked the C stubs, and I think I'm using the macros
correctly.

I guess what would be helpful would be any pointers on what might be
different between bytecode and native.  I do use callbacks, but the main
program is in Ocaml.

Thanks,
David Brown
