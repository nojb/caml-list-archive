Has been any discussion on the possibility of using C-- (www.cminusminus.org) 
as a compiler back-end for O'Caml? (I took a look through the archives, but 
didn't see anything relevant.) I'm not suggesting that things would be better 
or worse than they are now, I'm just interested in the thoughts of the O'Caml 
team.

Since there's already a back-end that generates very efficient native code, is 
there any benefit to moving to this type of model? Are there specific issues 
that have been addressed in the existing native code generator that preclude 
the use of C--?

Thanks,

	- j
