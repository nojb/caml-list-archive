Julian Assange, the creator and maintainer of the www.ocaml.org Web site,
is looking for a new maintainer to take care of that site.  

As I understand it, this is a light job: just update the "News"
section and add or update some links when appropriate.  However, in
the interest of continuity, it would be good if the new maintainer
could commit for, say, a couple of years.

We (the OCaml team) could do the maintenance if we had to, but I like
the idea of a Caml site that is run by enthusiastic users...

If there are any volunteers, please contact me and I'll put you in
touch with Julian.

And, of course, many thanks to Julian for his efforts and support.
