Well, I haven't built a real application with it, but I have produced a
few simple pages, and it worked fine for that.

I was a little disappointed because I was hoping for something that
allowed using arbitrary OCaml code; mod_ocaml only supports an embedding
scripting model:

  <?ocml <html> do_stuff () ;; </html> ?>

but it looks like a good tool for quick-and-dirty dynamic Web sites.
