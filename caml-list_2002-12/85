The matching engine needs extra workspace. This wasn't mentioned in the
documentation (added now). You'll rarely need this function anyway. Better
use "exec", "exec_all" or "extract", "extract_all" for your purposes.

It contains the offsets of the first, whole match followed by the
offsets of matched subpatterns (introduced with parentheses in the
pattern string).

Because there can be arbitrarily many subpatterns. E.g. try this:

  let t = pcre_exec ~pat:"a(bc)"  s ;;

  t = [|0; 3; 1; 3; 0; 0|]

The whole match ranges from character 0 to 3 (exclusive), the first
subgroup from 1 to 3. The remaining zeroes belong to the extra workspace.

Using "extract" will make things clearer. Then the result is:

  [|"abc"; "bc"|]

With "exec" you can extract strings of matched (sub)patterns more
efficiently if you do not want to access all of them.
