Ocaml Server Pages seems to have some of your reqirments.

First, it receives and parses the query string.
Second, it compiles the ocaml script and execute the binary.

If someone has time to combine these two tools, it'll be great, isn't it?

ps: You can download osp from
http://www.rogare.com/index.php?inc=downloads/ocaml/ocaml,
and you can download some fixes and view examples from
