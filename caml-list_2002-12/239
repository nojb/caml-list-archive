Yes (that is, Chinese/Korean/... "yes". English "no"), there is no
more development of mlgtk.

I prefer it for these reasons too, but none of my current projects
needs a GUI, so it's difficult for me to keep finding time to
work on it.

That is because mlgtk is buggy, or at least because it only works
if used as intended.  I started to understand how gtk's reference
counting was supposed to work just before I started to have no
more time available available for mlgtk, so I never had time
to fix this "bug".

It's more the second one :) but everything will work fine if you
don't try to free any gtk objects (and even if you do, it's 
only a memory leak, you might never notice :) ).

Do you really need it, or are you asking just out of curiosity?
I could make an effort and implement it, if you need it (and
as Sven pointed out, the source is available :) ).
