Yaxpo is a nonvalidating parser, so if you require the DTD validation, 
you should keep using PXP. If you do not require the DTD validation, 
for parsing some flat XML stored in a file, there is no particular 
reason why you should switch, since PXP and Yaxpo both do this fine.

The only situation in general in which you really have to use Yaxpo 
instead of PXP is when you need to achieve weird control effects with 
stopping and restarting the parser; I don't think this is the case for 
you. Otherwise, the differences between the parsers are not that much. 
They have different styles of data models, which may be significant. 
Yaxpo has fewer dependencies. Because of all the CPS constructs Yaxpo 
uses internally, PXP is probably faster (although I haven't tested it).
