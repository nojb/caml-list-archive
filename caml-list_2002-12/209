This is another implementation than lablgl, right ?

So, now we have 2 (possibly 3) OpenGL implmentation for ocaml, the same
situation we had some time ago with labltk and camltk.

Would you care to comment about the difference between your bindings and
the lablgl bindings, the reason which made you implement a new
alternative and the problems there would be in unifying both
implementations ?

Would it also be possible to use it with lablgtk, do you think ?
