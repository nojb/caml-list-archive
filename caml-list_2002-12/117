Yes, this was my feeble attempt to work around the precision loss
using only what is available, i.e. sprintf.  However, as you say:

If that was really the best approximation, there would be nothing to
argue.  But both 0.10000000000000001 and 0.1 read back as identical
floats, so the latter should be printed instead, but sprintf (on
Linux at least) is too stupid to realize this.
