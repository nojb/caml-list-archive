Is there any equivalent to .ocamlinit from the command line?  I'd like
to have different shell scripts which invoke ocaml instances with
different modules loaded and opened.  But I can't figure out any
effective way to do the module-opening from the invoking script.  (I
suppose I could create a .ocamlinit file on the fly, but that seems too
awful.)  It seems like a simple solution would be to have a command-line
option to specify some initial commands to be executed (or a file
containing such commands).
