Well, playing devil's advocate, I might suggest that there should also be a
separate list for OCaml on Unix systems, or perhaps on Linux systems only,
or on Debian only, or ...

Seriously, though, one of the things I most appreciate about OCaml is the
fact that it has an excellent-quality implementation on Win32 and that the
developers do not treat Win32 as a "second-class citizen" as far as release
schedules, prominence in the documentation, and so forth.  If the main list
is to include OS-specific discussions at all, I would hope that Win32
discussions would be encouraged as much as any other OS.  Creating a
separate, additional list for those discussions would only create confusion
and splinter the community, as far as I can tell.

Is anybody concerned that Win32-specific discussions are occupying too much
bandwidth on the list?  I've never noticed this to be the case (though I
suppose I may have a biased perspective here).  As long as the volume of
messages on the subject remains manageable, I think it's a bit silly to
worry that non-Win32 subscribers will be annoyed by the content of those
messages.  Uninterested, perhaps, but we hardly need a separate list for
each topic that some users might be uninterested in.

Subject: ocaml w32 list? RE: [Caml-list] lablGL + cygwin


Would anyone else be interested in a ocaml on w32
(cygwin,mingw,win2k,....)
mail list.  As some who does not care for w32, I would not like to
clutter this mail list with the unpleasant details of w32.  Would it
be worth having a ocaml-w32 list where I and others can share the
misfortunes/mysteries of running ocaml on various versions of w32
without anoying the rest of the world?  -David Gurr
