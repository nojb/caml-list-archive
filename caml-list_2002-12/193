This is a hard problem, to my knowledge not solved in the literature.
There are instances of interpreters that provide type-extensibility,
but none that also support separate compilation.  We have solved this
problem through some heavy use of ML modules.  I am still working on
the paper that describes this solution.  But you can get some hints
from an unpublished manuscript `Toward A Calculus of Signatures' at
  http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/pubs/sigcalc-abstract.html 
The part you want is the extended example in Section 2.
