We've written an implementation of Lua, version 2.5, for Ocaml.
It's currently bundled with our nascent Quick C-- compiler at
www.cminusminus.org.  I'd like to split it out as a separate
distribution, but we're rather short of help at the moment and I'm
trying to get the papers written first.  Anyway, as far as I know
it's completely compatible with the C version, although a few library
functions are missing.  We've been fairly happy.

If you want to play with it, download and build Quick C--, then go to
the lua subdirectory and type `mk lua.ps'---that will give you the
documentation for the API.  The documentation for the language can
probably be had from lua.org, but if they don't keep manuals for old
versions, let me know and I'll put one in our CVS archive.
