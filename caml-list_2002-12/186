Does it (C--) work? I.e. are there any working compilers, that implement
specification more recent then may 1999? More recent specification
include stuff needed (well, maybe ,,usefull'' would be better word)
in compilation of functional languages. Last time I checked Quick C--
was able to generate some code for SPARC (only), but there was a lot of
,,unknown'' instructions or something similar.
