Subject: [Caml-list] .ocamlinit equivalent from the command line?

Is there any equivalent to .ocamlinit from the command line?  I'd like
to have different shell scripts which invoke ocaml instances with
different modules loaded and opened.  But I can't figure out any
effective way to do the module-opening from the invoking script.  (I
suppose I could create a .ocamlinit file on the fly, but that seems too
awful.)  It seems like a simple solution would be to have a command-line
option to specify some initial commands to be executed (or a file
containing such commands).
