Currently it's also not possible because MinGW/MSVC builds use the same
makefiles. But I believe both can be fixed because the sentense

seems to be not very correct (it is possible to built both static and
dynamic Win32 library from the same objects files, although with some
linker warnings. Of course, some modifications to sources/makefiles are
required).
