As far as I know the best (and simpler) way to do this for reasonable
number of URLs bindings (say thousands but not millions) is to create
a Hashtlbl.t or Map.t and dump it to file using output_value (then
read it back with input_value). In any case, I would start with this
solution, since it provides cross-platform persistency with 4 lines of
Caml code. A fast and easy way to obtain fast and good results!

Merry Christmas :)

PS: Remember that input_value and output_value are not type safe. Be
careful to use some cautious programming methodology, such as the
trick I described once in this list, to define your own input and
output functions in the same phrase, in order to ensure their provably
correlated behaviour.
