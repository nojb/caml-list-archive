[SUBMISSIONS]

There are three categories of submissions:

- regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results
  (12 pages / 30 minute talks);

- short papers reporting on interesting work in progress and/or
  preliminary results (7 pages / 15 minute talks);

- system and experimental papers describing implementation or evaluation
  of experimental systems and containing a link to a working system
  (4 pages / 10 minute presentation).

Submissions should:

- contain original contributions that have not been published or submitted
  to other conferences/journals in parallel with this conference;

- clearly state the problem being addressed, the goal of the work,
  the results achieved, and the relation to other works;

- be in PS or PDF and formatted according to Springer LNCS Instructions
  for authors: http://www.springeronline.com;

- be in English and in a form that can be immediately included in the
  proceedings  without major revision;

- be attached (if necessary) by an appendix that contains proofs etc.
  However, the paper must be self-contained without the appendix in that
  reviewers may not read the appendix;

- be sent electronically (as a PostScript or PDF file) through the
  submissions link to the conference website:
  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=psi2014 not later than
  January 20, 2014.

Submitted regular papers that are judged to have limited merit may be
accepted as short papers, with up to seven pages in the proceedings.
At the time of submission, authors should indicate if they wish to have
their submission considered as a short paper in the case it is not
accepted as a regular one.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register, attend the
conference and present the paper.

[CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS]

A preliminary book of tutorial, invited and accepted contributions will be
handed out at the conference. The final versions of the invited, regular
and short papers presented at the conference will be published by
Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series after the
conference. One can find the proceedings of the previous seven conferences
in LNCS, Vol. 1181, 1755, 2244, 2890, 4378, 5947, and 7162.

[LOCATION]

The conference will be held in Peterhof (also known as Petrodvorets), a suburb
of St. Petersburg located on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland. The
town is one of St. Petersburg's most famous and popular visitor attractions
thanks to its palaces, fountains and parks. Founded as a summer residence of
Peter the Great, the area is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and
is often referred to as "the Russian Versaille".
For more information see http://www.saint-petersburg.com/peterhof.

[TRAVELLING]

You can fly directly to St Petersburg (Pulkovo Airport) or travel via Moscow.
Going from Moscow, you can take take a train - the fastest takes about four
hours and now costs EUR 117 one way. There are also quite a few overnight
trains, which cost from EUR 71 to EUR 106 2nd class one way and take about
8 hours. All direct trains depart from Moskva Oktiabrskaya (October Station,
the former Moscow Leningradsky Station) and arrive at Sankt-Peterburg Glavnyi
(Main Station).
