CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop, San Diego, USA

Tuesday January 21, 2014

Co-located with POPL 2014

PLMW web page: http://plmw2014.inria.fr/

After the resounding success of the first two Programming Languages
Mentoring Workshops at POPL 2012 and POPL 2013, we proudly announce the
3rd SIGPLAN Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW), co-located
with POPL 2014 and organised by Amal Ahmed, Benjamin C. Pierce, and Alan
Schmitt.

The purpose of this mentoring workshop is to encourage graduate
students and senior undergraduate students to pursue careers in
programming language research. This workshop will provide technical
sessions on cutting-edge research in programming languages, and
mentoring sessions on how to prepare for a research career. We will
bring together leaders in programming language research from academia
and industry to give talks on their research areas. The workshop will
engage students in a process of imagining how they might contribute to
our research community.

We especially encourage women and underrepresented minority students
to attend PLMW.

This workshop is part of the activities surrounding POPL, the Symposium
on Principles of Programming Languages, and takes place the day before
the main conference. One goal of the workshop is to make the POPL
conference more accessible to newcomers. We hope that participants will
stay through the entire conference.

A number of sponsors have generously donated scholarship funds for
qualified students to attend PLMW. These scholarships should cover
reasonable expenses (airfare, hotel, and registration fees) for
attendance at both the workshop and the POPL conference.

Students attending this year will get one year free student membership
of SIGPLAN, unless they prefer to opt out during their application.

The workshop registration is open to all. Students with alternative
sources of funding are welcome.

APPLICATION for PLMW scholarship: 

The scholarship application can be accessed from the workshop web site
(http://plmw2014.inria.fr/). The deadline for full consideration of
funding is 10th December, 2013. Selected participants will be notified
from Friday 14th December, and will need to register for the workshop by
December 24th.
