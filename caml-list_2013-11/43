Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ocaml-infra] Migration plan and bug hunt for
 ocaml.org - http://preview.ocaml.org

I must admit I'm a bit lost in this message that mixes process
discussions with a request for participation.

Would you consider sending a separate mail formulated purely as a call
for participation (focusing on the "please help us this week" part
only), with some details on what you're looking for? If I understand
correctly, this is not about the phoney content of the new website,
but about its look&feel and general user interaction (if this is
correct, you should stress it). Giving a couple of examples of bugs
you've fixed in the past that correspond to what you're looking for
now would be helpful.
