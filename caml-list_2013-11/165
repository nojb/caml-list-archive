Dear caml-list,<br>
<br>
As some of you may have noticed, the new OCaml.org site is now live!<br>
<br>
The DNS may still be propagating so if <a href=3D"http://ocaml.org" target=
=3D"_blank">http://ocaml.org</a> hasn&#39;t updated for you then try <a hre=
f=3D"http://166.78.252.20" target=3D"_blank">http://166.78.252.20</a>. =A0T=
his post is in two parts: the first is the announcement and the second is a=
 call for content.<br>


<br>
<br>
### New OCaml.org website design!<br>
<br>
The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the O=
Caml ecosystem. It&#39;s the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over th=
e last several months and I&#39;d specifically like to thank Christophe, As=
hish and Philippe for their dedication (the commit logs speak volumes).<br>


<br>
We began this journey just over 8 months ago with paper, pencils and a lot =
of ideas. This led to a comprehensive set of wireframes and walk-throughs o=
f the site [1], which then developed into a collection of Photoshop mockups=
 [2]. =A0In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style s=
heets, which we&#39;ve adapted to fit our needs across the site.<br>


<br>
Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and =
workflow we aspired to, both as maintainers and contributors. =A0This led u=
s to develop completely new tools for Markdown and templating in OCaml [3, =
4, 5], which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all. =A0Working on a=
ll these things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I&#39;ll wr=
ite about separately) but the result has been worth the effort.<br>


<br>
The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to =
make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure =
and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information o=
n packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forw=
ard will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community b=
ecome involved in the generation and curation of content. =A0This brings me=
 to the second part of this post.<br>


<br>
<br>
### Call for content<br>
<br>
We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could=
 do with refreshing and gaps that could be filled. =A0As a community driven=
 site, we need ongoing contributions to ensure that the site best reflects =
its members.<br>


<br>
For example, if you do commercial work on OCaml then maybe you&#39;d like t=
o add yourself to the support page [6]? Perhaps there are tutorials you can=
 help to complete, like 99 problems [7]? =A0If you&#39;re not sure where to=
 begin, there are already a number of content issues you could contribute t=
o [8].<br>


<br>
Although we&#39;ve gone through a bug-hunt already, feedback on the site is=
 still very welcome. =A0You can either create an issue on the tracker (pref=
erred), or email the infrastructure list.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s fantastic how far we&#39;ve come and I look forward to the next ph=
ase!<br>
