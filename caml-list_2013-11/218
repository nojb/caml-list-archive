19th - 20th June 2014

Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão
Instituto Politécnico de Bragança



Relevant Dates:

Paper submission: March 9, 2014

Registration: May 5, 2014 
SLATE Symposium: June 19-20


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

We often use languages. First, to communicate between ourselves. Later,
to communicate with computers. And more recently, with the advent of
networks, we found a way to make computers communicate between
themselves. All these different forms of communication use languages,
different languages, but that still share many similarities. In SLATE we
are interested in discussing these languages. 

SLATE is born from a group of researchers that share the fascination by
the way languages work, being them natural or artificial. This group
organized over a decade two different conferences: XATA, with interest
in XML as the de facto language for computer interaction; and CoRTA,
with interest in Compilers and related techniques to understand computer
languages. SLATE arrives as the generalization of these two conferences
into the abstraction of languages. 

Being languages such a broad subject, SLATE is organized in three main
tracks: 

1. HCL Track: Processing Human-Computer Languages 
The HCL track is where researchers, developers and educators exchange
ideas and information on the latest academic or industrial work on
language design, processing, assessment and applications. 

2. CCL Track: Processing Computer-Computer Languages

The CCL track main goal is to provide a broad space for discussion about
the XML mark-up language: examples of usage and associated
technologies. 


3. HHL Track: Processing Human-Human Languages 

The HHL track is dedicated to the discussion of research projects and
ideas involving natural language processing and their industrial
application. 



A detailed topic list for each one of these tracks is presented below. 



HCL Track: Processing Human-Computer Languages 



Programming language concepts and methodologies; 
Language and Grammars, design, formal specification and quality; 
Design of novel language constructs and their implementation; 
Domain Specific Languages design and implementation; 
Programming tools; 
Programming, refactoring and debugging environments; 
Dynamic and static analysis: Program Slicing; 
Program Comprehension;
Program Visualization and Animation;
Compilation and interpretation techniques; 
Code generation and optimization;
Programming Languages teaching methods;



CCL Track: Processing Computer-Computer Languages 

Semantic Web and Ontologies; 
Methodologies for specification in XML 
XML compression, serialization and merging 
XML Parsing and Querying; 
XML Structuring 
XML Transformation 
XML Security 
Web Services -- Architectures and Practical Cases 
Web Technologies and Frameworks 
XML Libraries and digital repositories 
E-learning systems, standards and interoperability 
Serialization languages 

HHL Track: Processing Human-Human Languages 

Computational morphology, syntax and semantics; 
Machine translation and tools for computer assisted translation; 
Computational terminology and lexicography; 
Speech synthesis and understanding; 
Information retrieval, extraction and automatic question answering; 
Corpora linguistics; 
NLP system and resource evaluation; 
Public tools and resources for NLP; 
Ontologies and knowledge representation; 
Statistical Methods applied to NLP; 
Language teaching support tools.

Language-driven software development

“Language-driven software development” consists in applying computer
language design and implementation techniques to build conventional
software.  In this talk we will review two different language-driven
development approaches: domain-specific languages (DLSs), and
language-oriented architectures (LOAs). The DSL approach focuses on the
provision of languages specialized in different application aspects,
which are used by developers, and even by domain experts, during
application construction and maintenance. The LOA strategy, in its turn,
conceives applications themselves as coordinated collections of language
processors, which can be developed using language implementation tools
(parser generators, attribute grammar-based systems, etc.). In addition
to presenting these approaches, we will use case studies from the fields
of knowledge-based systems, e-Learning, semi-structured data processing,
and Digital Humanities as illustrative examples.   



SLATE Publication Policy and Authors Information 

All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings,
under an ISBN reference, on paper and digital support. They will also
integrate the OASIcs series
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/oasics/). 

Selected papers’ authors should have the opportunity to publish extended
versions of their papers in a special issue of ComSIS: Computer Science
and Information Systems. 

Papers should be written using the OASIcs LaTeX template, using the
English language, and should not exceed 16 pages. Please refer to the
submissions page in the website for details about the document
preparation. 

Contact and Updates 

Updates are regularly posted in the symposium webpage and notified
through different social networks (check the symposium webpage for
