Subject: [Caml-list] Migration plan and bug hunt for ocaml.org -
 http://preview.ocaml.org

Dear caml-list,

We're close to releasing the new design of ocaml.org but need help from the=
 community to identify and fix bugs before we switch next week.

Ashish, Christophe, Philippe and I have been discussing how we should go ab=
out this and below is the plan for migration.  If you'd like to discuss any=
 of this, then the infrastructure list is the best place to do so (cced).

1. We've made a new branch on the main ocaml.org repository [1] with the re=
design.  This branch is a fork of the main one and we've simply cleaned up =
and replayed our git commits there.

2. We've built a live version of the new site, which is visible at http://p=
review.ocaml.org - this is rebuilt every few minutes from the branch mentio=
ned above.=20=20

3. Over the course of one week, we ask the community to review the new site=
 and report any bugs or problems on the issue tracker [2]. We triage those =
bugs to identify any blockers and work on those first.  This is the phase w=
e'll be in from *today*.

4. After one week (7 days), and after blocking bugs have been fixed, we mer=
ge the site into the main branch.  This would effectively present the new s=
ite to the world.=20=20

During the above, we would not be able to accept any new pull requests on t=
he old site but would be happy to accept them on the new branch.  Hence, re=
stricting the time frame to one week.=20=20

Please note that the above is only intended to merge the *design* and *tool=
chain* for the new site.  Specifically, we've created new landing pages, ha=
ve new style sheets and have restructured the site's contents as well as ma=
de some new libraries [3, 4].  The new toolchain means people can write fil=
es in markdown, which makes contributing content a lot easier.=20=20

Since the files are on GitHub, people don't even need to clone the site loc=
ally to make simple edits (or even add new pages). Just click the 'Edit thi=
s page' link in the footer to be taken to the right file in the repository =
and GitHub's editing and pull request features will allow you to make chang=
es and submit updates, all from within your browser [5].=20=20

There is still work to be done on adding new features but the above changes=
 are already a great improvement to the site and are ready to be reviewed a=
nd merged.
