14th International Conference on
Runtime Verification
September 22 =96 25, 2014
Toronto, Canada
http://rv2014.imag.fr/


Scope:

Runtime verification is concerned with monitoring and analysis of software =
and hardware system executions. Runtime verification techniques are crucial=
 for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they are significantl=
y more powerful and versatile than conventional testing, and more practical=
 than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prio=
r to deployment, for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and aft=
er deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for provid=
ing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair. Topics =
of interest to the conference include:

	=95 specification languages
	=95 specification mining
	=95 program instrumentation
	=95 monitor construction techniques
	=95 logging, recording, and replay
	=95 fault detection, localization, containment, recovery and repair
	=95 program steering and adaptation
	=95 metrics and statistical information gathering
	=95 combination of static and dynamic analyses
	=95 program execution visualization
	=95 monitoring techniques for safety/mission-critical systems
	=95 monitoring distributed systems, cloud services, and big data applicati=
ons
	=95 monitoring security and privacy policies
Application areas of runtime verification include safety/mission-critical s=
ystems, enterprise and systems software, autonomous and reactive control sy=
stems, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and pri=
vacy.

Technical Research Papers Track:

Technical research papers can be submitted in two categories: regular and s=
hort papers. Papers in both categories will be reviewed by the conference P=
rogram Committee. All accepted technical papers will appear in an LNCS volu=
me. Submitted papers must use the LNCS style. At least one author of each a=
ccepted paper must attend RV=9214 to present the paper. Papers must be subm=
itted electronically using theEasyChair system.


	=95 Regular papers (up to 15 pages) should present original unpublished re=
sults. Theoretical and experimental papers as well as papers on application=
s of runtime verification and case studies are all welcome. A non-monetary =
Best Paper Award will be given. A selection of accepted regular papers will=
 be invited to appear in a special issue of the Springer Journal on Formal =
Methods in System Design.
	=95 Short papers (up to 5 pages) may present novel but not necessarily tho=
roughly worked out ideas, for example emerging runtime verification techniq=
ues and applications, or techniques and applications that establish relatio=
nships between runtime verification and other domains. Accepted short paper=
s will be presented in special short talk (10 minutes) and poster sessions.

Tool Demonstrations Track:

The aim of the RV 2014 tool demonstration track is to provide an opportunit=
y for researchers and practitioners to show and to discuss the latest advan=
ces, experiences and challenges in devising and developing reliable softwar=
e tools for runtime verification. Tool demonstration papers will be reviewe=
d by the Tools Track Program Committee. All accepted tool demonstration pap=
ers will appear in the conference proceedings LNCS volume. Submitted papers=
 must use the LNCS style. At least one author of each accepted paper must a=
ttend RV=9214 to present the paper. Papers must be submitted electronically=
 using the EasyChair system.

Tool papers should meet the following criteria:

	=95 A tool paper should present a new tool, a new tool component or novel =
extensions to existing tools supporting runtime verification. Each submissi=
on should be original and not published previously in a tool paper form.
	=95 Each submission must not exceed 8 pages in the LNCS/Springer proceedin=
g format, including all text, references and figures. The paper must be wri=
tten in English and provided in PDF format.
	=95 Each submission must be accompanied at the time of the submission by a=
 short screencast (between 5-10 minutes), with voice and overlay text comme=
ntary illustrating the demonstration of the tool (a link to it should be pr=
ovided in the paper).
	=95 The paper must include information on tool availability, maturity, sel=
ected experimental results and it should provide a link to a website contai=
ning the theoretical background and user guide. Furthermore, we strongly en=
courage authors to make their tools and benchmarks available with their sub=
mission.
	=95 Each tool paper must include a script in an appendix (not included in =
the page count) describing how the demo will be conducted during the confer=
ence presentation with screenshots presenting step-by-step the tool=92s cap=
abilities, highlighting the main characteristics and the usage.
=20
Evaluation

Each submission will be reviewed by at least four members of the tool demon=
stration track program committee. The evaluation criteria will include:

	=95 the presentation quality
	=95 the availability (possibly in a open-source format) of the software.
	=95 the relevance for the Runtime Verification audience
	=95 the technical soundness of the presented tool
	=95 the originality of the underlying ideas

Competition on Software for Runtime Verification (CSRV-2014)

 A satellite event of RV=9214 is the first International Competition on Sof=
tware for Runtime Verification (CRVS=9214). The main aims of CSRV-2014 comp=
etition are to:

	=95 Stimulate the development of new efficient and practical runtime verif=
ication tools and the maintenance of the already developed ones.
	=95 Produce a benchmark suite for runtime verification tools, by sharing c=
ase studies and programs that researchers and developers can use in the fut=
ure to test and to validate their prototypes.
	=95 Discuss the metrics employed for comparing the tools.
	=95 Provide a comparison of the tools running with different benchmarks an=
d evaluating using different criteria.
	=95 Enhance the visibility of presented tools among the different communit=
ies (software engineering, formal methods and automated verification, distr=
ibuted computing, security, and safety-critical systems) involved in softwa=
re monitoring.
CRVS=9214 will follow the following time line:

	=95 Declaration of intent: December 15, 2013
	=95 Deadline for submission of benchmarks: March 1, 2014
	=95 Monitoring tool submission: June 1, 2014
	=95 Notification: July 1, 2014
