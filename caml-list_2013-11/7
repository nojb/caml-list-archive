CiE 2014 is the tenth conference organized by CiE (Computability in 
Europe), a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer 
scientists, philosophers, physicists and others interested in  new 
developments in computability and their underlying significance for the 
real world. Previous meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), 
Swansea (2006), Siena (2007), Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponte 
Dalgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambridge (2012), and Milan (2013).

The motto of CiE 2014 "Language, Life, Limits" intends to put a special 
focus on  relations  between computational linguistics, natural and 
biological computing, and more traditional fields of computability theory.

This is to be understood in its broadest sense including computational 
aspects of problems in linguistics, studying models of computation and 
algorithms inspired by physical and biological approaches as well as 
exhibiting limits (and non-limits) of computability when considering 
different models of computation arising from such approaches.

As with previous CiE conferences the allover glueing perspective is to 
strengthen the mutual benefits of analyzing traditional and new 
computational paradigms in their corresponding frameworks both with 
respect to practical applications and a deeper theoretical understanding.
