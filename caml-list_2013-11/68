Ok, great.

Jeff Meister was talking about writing more type safe bindings. I think tha=
t would be fine as long as it wraps the existing less-safe bindings so peop=
le can continue to use them. I tried using LLVM from Haskell and had a lot =
of problems because they'd used every trick in the book to write the most t=
ype safe possible bindings and it makes it much harder to learn and use. I'=
d personally much rather see more complete bindings...

BTW, what are your thoughts on MSJIT? I just started reading about it and i=
t seems very underwhelming. Sounds like they're struggling to refactor thei=
r C++ code so they're reinventing things but not doing it significantly bet=
ter. So I don't think I'll be rushing to switch to MSJIT unless they actual=
ly deprecate the old JIT.

Cheers,
Jon.

Sorry, realized the previous letter was phrased ambiguously.
I'm asking because I do want to break existing bindings. The changes would =
mainly touch two areas:
1) Memory management. I want to get rid of most or all of dispose functions=
 and allow to use OCaml's GC.
2) Llvm_target interface is very outdated and it could be updated to integr=
ate much better with the TargetMachine interface.

There are also two or three Llvm functions which need minor changes.

I'm not going to change APIs in any way which needs nontrivial, significant=
 fixes to clients, there's simply no need.
