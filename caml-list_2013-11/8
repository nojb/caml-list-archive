Out of belligerent curiosity only, is that definitely true? lazy.mli doesn'=
t create an opaque type for 'a Lazy.t so wouldn't

external ( !! ) : 'a lazy_t -> 'a =3D "%lazy_force"

in pervasives.ml/mli work out of the box and to all intents and purposes ha=
ve the right effect?

Even if you wanted to have the neater type 'a Lazy.t -> 'a, lazy.ml only re=
fers to a handful of trivial externals and constants in obj.ml and only req=
uires ( <> ) and ( || ) from Pervasives. Isn't it the case that as Pervasiv=
es would then only refer to a *type* in Lazy that you wouldn't have the (pr=
esumably unwanted) side-effect of even "Hello World" being linked with Lazy?

So either with some very minor internal code duplication (or a bit of pre-p=
rocessing), is there anything else which means that you couldn't add that d=
eclaration to Pervasives without the circular dependency?

I agree that it probably doesn't belong there (although I can see the other=
 side, given that the lazy keyword is, um, "pervasive") - just curious as t=
o if it's possible :o)
