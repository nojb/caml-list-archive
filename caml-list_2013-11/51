Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ocaml-infra] Migration plan and bug hunt for
 ocaml.org - http://preview.ocaml.org

I'd say it thjs way: Your help may consist in reporting bugs (which would b=
e fixed by someone else) or fixing bugs, or fixing the contents (this mainl=
y means "text contents"), etc.
But please concentrate, for the 7 following days, on things that would prev=
ent this new site from replacing the current one.
(Then, we will work on the rest, i.e., things that need to be fixed but are=
 not blocking.)

For "text contents", the "Edit this page" on the bottom of most pages shoul=
d lead you to the right file to edit. :)

Cheers,
Philippe
