Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] final release of OPAM 1.1.0

After a while staged as RC, we are proud to announce the final release of O=
PAM 1.1.0 !

Thanks again to those who have helped testing and fixing the last few issue=
s.


=3D=3D Important note =3D=3D

The repository format has been improved with incompatible new features ; to
account for this, the _new_ repository is now hosted at opam.ocaml.org, and
the legacy repository at opam.ocamlpro.com is kept to support OPAM=20
1.0 installations, but is unlikely to benefit from many package updates.
Migration to opam.ocaml.org will be done automatically as soon as you upgra=
de
your OPAM version.

You're still free, of course, to use any third-party repositories instead o=
r in addition.


=3D=3D Installing =3D=3D

NOTE: When switching from 1.0, the internal state will need to be upgraded.
THIS PROCESS CANNOT BE REVERTED. We have tried hard to make it fault-
resistant, but failures might happen. In case you have precious data in you=
r=20
~/.opam folder, it is advised to backup that folder before you upgrade to=
=20
1.1.0.

Using the binary installer:
- download and run http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam_installer.sh
=20
Using the .deb packages from Anil's PPA (binaries are currently synching, s=
ee [1]):
    add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
    apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install opam

For OSX users, the homebrew package will be updated shortly.
=20
or build it from sources at :
- http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-1.1.0.tar.gz
- https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/tag/1.1.0

=3D=3D For those who haven't been paying attention =3D=3D

OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and
a Git-friendly development workflow. OPAM is edited and
maintained by OCamlPro, with continuous support from OCamlLabs and the
community at large (including its main industrial users such as
Jane-Street and Citrix).

The "official" package repository is now hosted at https://opam.ocaml.org, =
synchronised with the
Git repository at http://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository, where you can co=
ntribute new packages
descriptions. Those are under a CC0 license, a.k.a. public domain, to ensur=
e they will always
belong to the community.

Thanks to all of you who have helped build this repository and made OPAM su=
ch a success.


=3D=3D Changes =3D=3D

Too many to list here, see
https://raw.github.com/OCamlPro/opam/1.1.0/CHANGES

For packagers, some new fields have appeared in the OPAM description format:
- `depexts` provides facilities for dealing with system (non ocaml) depende=
ncies
- `messages`, `post-messages` can be used to notify the user eg. of licensi=
ng information,
  or help her  troobleshoot at package installation.
- `available` supersedes `ocaml-version` and `os` constraints, and can cont=
ain
  more expressive formulas

Also, we have integrated the main package repository with Travis, which wil=
l help us=20
to improve the quality of contributions (see [2]).


Enjoy !

Thomas,  Louis and all the OPAM team
