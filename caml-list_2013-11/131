We would like to invite you to also transmit your press releases (see copy=
=20
below) with our medical industry-specific yet inexpensive press release=20
distribution service.

The good news is that our Medical E-News Daily=E2=84=A2 (Email News Service=
) -- a=20
very focused, news release distribution service -- can announce your=20
important event directly to key company executives and physicians throughou=
t the US,=20
Canada, EU/EC and PacRim. Based in Irvine CA, we have served clients such=
=20
as Harvard Univ School of Public Health, Larry King Foundation, Mayo Clinic=
,=20
Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, MIT, Mt Sinai School of=
=20
Medicine, New York Stem Cell Foundation, major universities like Columbia=
=20
Univ, Cornell Univ Weill Medical College, Duke Univ, Florida State Univ, Ge=
orge=20
Washington Univ Ctr for Intl Health, Johns Hopkins Univ, Penn State Univ,=
=20
Stanford Univ, Tufts Univ, Univ of Maryland, Univ of Memphis, Univ of Miami=
,=20
Univ of Vermont, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, Virginia=
=20
Tech, plus hundreds of key medical associations.

It is a more cost-effective, marketing/PR B2B solution, than the wire=20
services or in-house lists. Your professionally-edited & polished release w=
ould=20
be received worldwide in dozens of key medical sectors -- so you don=E2=80=
=99t have=20
to rent separate, expensive lists, or purchase pricey special wire service=
=20
circuits.

We will also post at our website, the logo or conference banner that is=20
used in each press release that we transmit for our industry-leading Medica=
l=20
E-News Daily=E2=84=A2 (Email News Service), now in its 13th year.=20
http://www.biomedical-market-news.com/resources.html (The banner is also ho=
tlinked back to your=20
website.)

And, if you order a new press release before Nov 30 2013, we will also:=20
include your logo or conference banner and hyperlink in our monthly Calenda=
r=20
Newsletter ($200 per issue), plus an editorial listing ($149 per listing pe=
r=20
issue).

Please note there is no additional charge for these items, which are worth=
=20
a lot more than the very modest price of each press release. And, there is=
=20
no extra charge for over 400 words in your press releases, for nationwide=
=20
distribution, or for including all medical industry sectors.

Our current best package deal is: 1 press release transmittal for a base=20
price of only $499 (reg. $800):

http://www.biomedical-market-news.com/cgi-local/SoftCart.exe/online-store/s=
cstore/p-000000000424.html?E+scstore
Or, order 2 campaigns for just $979 or 3 campaigns for only $1,399.=20

Many nonprofit medical associations, private and public companies,=20
universities and corporate meeting planners use our press release service -=
- because=20
it provides a more timely and focused call-to-action. With our proactive=20
"push" service, each announcement arrives directly into a key contact=E2=80=
=99s email=20
inbox. Compare this proactive messaging to wire or online calendar services=
=20
that post only a few lines of text at their website or 3rd party sites. Tha=
t=20
passive, archaic method is less effective, since releases do not land=20
directly in front of each key person).
Demographics:=C2=A0http://www.biomedical-market-news.com/demographics.html
Order form:       www.biomedical-market-news.com/e-campaigns

You can reach thousands of physicians, & all licensed US/Canadian medical=
=20
centers, hospitals, schools of medicine, organ & tissue transplant centers,=
 &=20
much more. Each press release transmittal also includes:

=E2=80=A2 Every FDA-licensed medical product manufacturer & medical establi=
shment=20
in the US & Canada
=E2=80=A2 Those include: cardiology, surgery, orthopedic, biotech, biomed,=
=20
nanotech, device, dialysis, equipment & so on
=E2=80=A2 Closely related organizations, such as CROs, distributors, pharma=
cy=20
compounders, clinical labs, packagers, molders, sterilizers, regulatory=20
consultants & many other vital categories
=E2=80=A2 Headquarters offices of 3,500 medical associations will receive y=
our=20
press release.
=E2=80=A2 Product distributors, component manufacturers, VCs, and tens of t=
housands=20
of doctors, physicians, surgeons, researchers & hospital staff (all key=20
depts)
=E2=80=A2 All of the medical publications featured in Bacon=E2=80=99s, Oxbr=
idge and other=20
directories -- supplemented with over 15,000 specific medical reporters in=
=20
over 100 different specialty areas.

We look forward to continuing to work together to help market your events,=
=20
build your brand and boost registrations. I can be reached at any time on m=

CiE 2014 is the tenth conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe)=
, a<BR>
European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists,<BR>
philosophers, physicists and others interested in=C2=A0 new developments in=
<BR>
computability and their underlying significance for the real world. Previou=
s<BR>
meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007)=
,<BR>
Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponte Dalgada (2010), Sofia (2011), Cambr=
idge<BR>
(2012), and Milan (2013).<BR>
<BR>
The motto of CiE 2014 "Language, Life, Limits" intends to put a special foc=
us on<BR>
relations=C2=A0 between computational linguistics, natural and biological c=
omputing,<BR>
and more traditional fields of computability theory.<BR>
<BR>
This is to be understood in its broadest sense including computational aspe=
cts<BR>
of problems in linguistics, studying models of computation and algorithms<B=
R>
inspired by physical and biological approaches as well as exhibiting limits=
 (and<BR>
non-limits) of computability when considering different models of computati=
on<BR>
arising from such approaches.<BR>
<BR>
As with previous CiE conferences the allover glueing perspective is to<BR>
strengthen the mutual benefits of analyzing traditional and new computation=
al<BR>
paradigms in their corresponding frameworks both with respect to practical<=
BR>
applications and a deeper theoretical understanding.<BR>

The PROGRAMME COMMITTEE cordially invites all researchers (European and<BR>
non-European) in computability related areas to submit their papers (in PDF=
<BR>
format, max 10 pages using the LNCS style) for presentation at CiE 2014.<BR>
<BR>
The submission site https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcie2014 i=
s open.<BR>
<BR>
For submission instructions consult<BR>
http://cie2014.inf.elte.hu/?Submission_Instructions<BR>
<BR>
We particularly invite papers that build bridges between different parts of=
 the<BR>
research community.<BR>
<BR>
The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer Verlag.<BR>
