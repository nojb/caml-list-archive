Subject: [Caml-list] Call for Workshops: Conf. Intelligent Computer
 Mathematics (CICM 2014)

     CICM 2014 - Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
        July 7-11, 2014 at University of Coimbra, Portugal

             http://www.cicm-conference.org/2014

             *** Call for Workshop Proposals ***

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater
opportunities arise  for intelligent mathematical  computation.  While
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we  are now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these
areas.
The Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offer a
venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.

CICM has been held annually  as a joint meeting since 2008, colocating
related conferences  and workshops to advance work  in these subjects.
Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend
(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen
(Germany 2012) and Bath (U.K. 2013).

This is  a call for proposals for  workshops to be held  at CICM 2014,
which will be held in Coimbra (Portugal), July 7-11 next year.

The principal tracks of the 2014 meeting will be

  Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)
  DML (Towards a Digital Mathematics Library)
  MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)
  Systems and Projects

Some of the workshops that have been held at past CICM meetings are:

  Automated Reasoning: Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice
  Compact Computer Algebra
  Empirically Successful Automated Reasoning for Mathematics
  Intelligent Proof Search
  Mathematical user Interfaces
  OpenMath
  Pen-Based Mathematical Computation
  Programming languages for Mechanized Mathematics Systems
  SCIEnce

Proposals for workshops  to be held at CICM  2014 are solicited.  Both
well-established workshops and newer or brand new ones are encouraged.

Please provide the following information:
 
 + Workshop title.
 + Names and affiliations of organizers.
 + Brief description of workshop goals and/or topics.
 + Proposed workshop duration (half a day up to two days is possible).
 + If the workshop has met previously, please include the conference 
   affiliation for the previous meeting. If the workshop is new, 
   please indicate so.

Fees for conference participants will be levied on a per-day basis, so
workshop-only participation  is possible. The CICM  organizers plan to
make available a small amount towards partial reimbursement for travel
expenses of invited speakers. Also, CICM will take care of copying and
distributing  informal printed  proceedings for  workshops  that would
like this service, as well  as permanently archived open access online
proceedings with CEUR-WS.org.

All proposals should be sent via email to

             cicm-organizers@lists.jacobs-university.de 

for consideration by the CICM 2014 organizers:

 Local Organization Chair:       Pedro Quaresma  (U. Coimbra, Portugal)

 System & Projects Track Chair:  Alan Sexton     (U. Birmingham, UK)

Important dates:

 Deadline for proposal submissions:                   January 17, 2014
 Acceptance/rejection notification:                   February 3, 2014
 Workshop dates:                                       July 7-11, 2014
