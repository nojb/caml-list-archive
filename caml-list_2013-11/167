Subject: 	PhD Studentship on ABCD
Date: 	Wed, 20 Nov 2013 13:04:00 +0000
From: 	Philip Wadler <wadler@inf.ed.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I'd be grateful if you could circulate the following. Students from the
UK or EU are preferred, but studentships may be available for overseas
students with strong qualifications. We especially welcome applications
from women and minorities.

Yours, -- P


We are recruiting for one PhD student to work on design and
implementation of programming languages. The post is on the project
"From Data Types to Session Types: A Basis for Concurrency and
Distribution".

The project has particular emphasis on putting theory into practice,
embedding session types in a range of programming languages and applying 
them to realistic case studies. The research programme is joint between 
the University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, and Imperial College 
London, and includes collaboration with Amazon, Cognizant, Red Hat, 
VMware, and the Ocean Observatories Initiative. We have a programme 
grant funded by EPSRC for five years from 20 May 2013.

The successful candidate will join a team responsible for extending the
functional web programming language Links with session types to support
concurrency and distribution. We will test our techniques by providing a 
library to access Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing
infrastructure, and perform empirical experiments to assess how our
language design impacts the performance of programmers.

You should possess an undergraduate degree in a relevant area, or being
nearing completion of same, or have comparable experience. You should
have evidence of ability to undertake research and communicate well. You 
should have a background in programming languages, including type
systems, and programming and software engineering skills.

It is desirable for candidates to also have one or more of the
following: a combination of theoretical and practical skills; experience 
of web programming or cloud programming; knowledge of the theory or 
practice of concurrent and distributed systems; knowledge of linear 
logic; or training in empirical measurement of programming tasks. We 
especially welcome applications from women and minorities.

We seek applicants at an international level of excellence. The School
of Informatics at Edinburgh is among the strongest in the world, and
Edinburgh is known as a cultural centre providing a high quality of life.

The successful candidate will receive a studentship covering tuition and 
subsistence. Students from the UK or EU are preferred, but studentships 
may be available for overseas students with strong qualifications. 
Applications should be received by 13 December to be eligible for the 
full range of scholarships. Consult the University of Edinburgh website 
for details of how to apply 
<http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/postgraduate/apply/overview>. 



Enquiries can be addressed to: Prof. Philip Wadler (wadler@inf.ed.ac.uk
<mailto:wadler@inf.ed.ac.uk>), Principal Investigator of the ABCD project.
