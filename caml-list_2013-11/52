Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Migration plan and bug hunt for ocaml.org -
 http://preview.ocaml.org

Amir,

Are all bugs related to redesign are marked with `redesign` tag? I
ask, because very small count of opened bugs are tagged with
`redesign`. Can I rely on tagged questions  when I will check is my
bug reported or not?

Kind regards,
Kakadu
