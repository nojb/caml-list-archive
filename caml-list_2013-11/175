Call For Papers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
--------
This conference track brings the opportunity for researchers and developers=
 from industry and the academic world to report the state of the art and ex=
change ideas about the support that should be provided in order to enforce =
confidentiality, security and reliability on the next generation of softwar=
e technologies enabling collaborations among people. Such a support will en=
hance the level of quality and of user trust on services involving collabor=
ation with unknown remote parties.=20
Nowadays widespread use of small, smart devices, such as smart cards, phone=
s, and tablets, connected by the ubiquitous public Internet network, enable=
 us to easily access a vast range of useful services. Such devices allow pe=
ople to perform every day activities that either play a role in a collabora=
tive task or are actually supported by some real-time or asynchronous colla=
boration technology.=20
Example services are the trading of goods, remote writing or signing of dig=
ital documents, joining social networks or work groups, remotely locating s=
omeone or something, and even services improving our ability to observe/con=
trol the environment
around us.=20
In this context, applications that hold or exchange sensitive user data, li=
ke i.e. ATM cards storing security pin-codes, or healthcare applications us=
ing biometric data, need special protection against software failures or ma=
licious behavior of downloaded code, that may expose the user to highly und=
esired consequences, such as threats to confidentiality and even financial =
or health danger.=20
This is even more true since the trend is indeed towards integration, that =
is, not to have many specialized access devices but a single, multi-purpose=
 host handling many (or all) kinds of user services and its related data to=
gether, even though with limited computing resources, such as any small dev=
ice hosting a Java or .Net run-time environment.=20
Moreover, inherent mobility and distribution of these small, open computing=
 devices increases the complexity of the solutions to be adopted for handli=
ng secure and reliable execution of untrusted code, in order to ensure the =
data confidentiality strongly required by the applications.  As a consequen=
ce, new and specially designed techniques  can be devised and applied in or=
der to reach the goal of increasing the trust on such a distributed computi=
ng environment to a level of strength matching with the high strength of th=
e above safety critical requirements.

Submission is encouraged, but not limited, to the following topics:
	- Verification techniques tailored to embedded software
	- Novel testing and validation algorithms=20
	- Dependability assessment techniques=20
	- Model-based validation and testing techniques for security
	- Analysis of threats and countermeasures to the security of smart devices
	- Static and run-time techniques for byte-code level verification and vali=
dation
	- Validation testing of safety critical technologies
	- Validation of large-scale distributed applications
	- Software testing in multi-core environments=20
	- Risk-based approaches to software validation
	- Assessing security and robustness of applications=20=20
	- New software architectures for securing software on collaboration devices
	- Performance analysis of security-related features
	- Performance and QoS testing
	- Testing and analysis tools

The conference proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society P=
ress. Special Issues of several international journals have been programmed=
 with submission open by invitation only to authors of high quality papers.=
