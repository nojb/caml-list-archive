Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] New OCaml.org design is now live!

Dear caml-list,

As some of you may have noticed, the new OCaml.org site is now live!=20=20

The DNS may still be propagating so if http://ocaml.org hasn't updated for =
you then try http://166.78.252.20.  This post is in two parts: the first is=
 the announcement and the second is a call for content.


### New OCaml.org website design!

The new site represents a major milestone in the continuing growth of the O=
Caml ecosystem. It's the culmination of a lot of volunteer work over the la=
st several months and I'd specifically like to thank Christophe, Ashish and=
 Philippe for their dedication (the commit logs speak volumes).=20=20

We began this journey just over 8 months ago with paper, pencils and a lot =
of ideas. This led to a comprehensive set of wireframes and walk-throughs o=
f the site [1], which then developed into a collection of Photoshop mockups=
 [2].  In turn, these formed the basis for the html templates and style she=
ets, which we've adapted to fit our needs across the site.=20=20

Alongside the design process, we also considered the kind of structure and =
workflow we aspired to, both as maintainers and contributors.  This led us =
to develop completely new tools for Markdown and templating in OCaml [3, 4,=
 5], which are now available in OPAM for the benefit all.  Working on all t=
hese things in parallel definitely had it challenges (which I'll write abou=
t separately) but the result has been worth the effort.=20=20

The journey is ongoing and we still have many more improvements we hope to =
make. The site you see today primarily improves upon the design, structure =
and workflows but in time, we also intend to incorporate more information o=
n packages and documentation. With the new tooling, moving the website forw=
ard will become much easier and I hope that more members of the community b=
ecome involved in the generation and curation of content.  This brings me t=
o the second part of this post.


### Call for content

We have lots of great content on the website but there are parts that could=
 do with refreshing and gaps that could be filled.  As a community driven s=
ite, we need ongoing contributions to ensure that the site best reflects it=
s members.=20=20

For example, if you do commercial work on OCaml then maybe you'd like to ad=
d yourself to the support page [6]? Perhaps there are tutorials you can hel=
p to complete, like 99 problems [7]?  If you're not sure where to begin, th=
ere are already a number of content issues you could contribute to [8].=20=
=20

Although we've gone through a bug-hunt already, feedback on the site is sti=
ll very welcome.  You can either create an issue on the tracker (preferred)=
, or email the infrastructure list.=20

It's fantastic how far we've come and I look forward to the next phase!

Best wishes,
Amir
