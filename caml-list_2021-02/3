=0D
PACMPL issue ICFP 2021 also welcomes submissions in two separate=0D
categories =E2=80=94 Functional Pearls and Experience Reports =E2=80=94 t=
hat must be=0D
marked as such when submitted and that need not report original=0D
research results. Detailed guidelines on both categories are given at=0D
the end of this call.=0D
=0D
Please contact the associate editor if you have questions or are=0D
concerned about the appropriateness of a topic.=0D
=0D
=0D
### Preparation of submissions=0D
=0D
**Deadline**: The deadline for submissions is **Tuesday, March 2, 2021**,=
=0D
Anywhere on Earth (<https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe>).=0D
This deadline will be strictly enforced.=0D
=0D
**Formatting**: Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black=0D
and white on US Letter sized paper, and interpretable by common PDF=0D
tools. All submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template that is=0D=

available (in both LaTeX and Word formats) from=0D
<https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions>. =0D
=0D
There is a limit of **25 pages for a full paper or Functional Pearl**=0D
and **12 pages for an Experience Report**; in either case, the=0D
bibliography will not be counted against these limits. Submissions=0D
that exceed the page limits or, for other reasons, do not meet the=0D
requirements for formatting, will be summarily rejected. Supplementary=0D=

material can and should be **separately** submitted (see below).=0D
=0D
See also PACMPL's Information and Guidelines for Authors at=0D
<https://pacmpl.acm.org/authors.cfm>.=0D
=0D
**Submission**: Submissions will be accepted at <https://icfp21.hotcrp.co=
m/>=0D
=0D
Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the=0D
submission deadline using the same web interface.=0D
=0D
**Author Response Period**: Authors will have a 72-hour period,=0D
starting at 17:00 UTC on **Tuesday, April 20, 2021**, to read reviews=0D
and respond to them.=0D
=0D
**Supplementary Material**: Authors have the option to attach=0D
supplementary material to a submission, on the understanding that=0D
reviewers may choose not to look at it. This supplementary material=0D
should **not** be submitted as part of the main document; instead, it=0D
should be uploaded as a **separate** PDF document or tarball.=0D
=0D
Supplementary material should be uploaded **at submission time**, not=0D
by providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository.=0D=

=0D
Authors are free to upload both anonymized and non-anonymized=0D
supplementary material. Anonymized supplementary material will be=0D
visible to reviewers immediately; non-anonymized supplementary=0D
material will be revealed to reviewers only after they have submitted=0D
their review of the paper and learned the identity of the author(s).=0D
=0D
**Authorship Policies**: All submissions are expected to comply with=0D
the ACM Policies for Authorship that are detailed at=0D
<https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors>.=0D
=0D
**Republication Policies**: Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's=0D
republication policy, as explained on the web at=0D
<http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication>.=0D
=0D
### Review Process=0D
=0D
This section outlines the two-stage process with lightweight=0D
double-blind reviewing that will be used to select papers for PACMPL=0D
issue ICFP 2021.  We anticipate that there will be a need to clarify=0D
and expand on this process, and we will maintain a list of frequently=0D
asked questions and answers on the PACMPL issue website to address=0D
common concerns.=0D
=0D
**PACMPL issue ICFP 2021 will employ a two-stage review process.** The=0D=

 first stage in the review process will assess submitted papers using=0D
 the criteria stated above and will allow for feedback and input on=0D
 initial reviews through the author response period mentioned=0D
 previously. As a result of the review process, a set of papers will be=0D=

 conditionally accepted and all other papers will be rejected.=0D
 Authors will be notified of these decisions on **May 7, 2021**.=0D
=0D
Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with=0D
committee reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions. After four=0D
weeks (June 4, 2021), the authors will provide a second=0D
submission. The second and final reviewing phase assesses whether the=0D
mandatory revisions have been adequately addressed by the authors and=0D
thereby determines the final accept/reject status of the paper. The=0D
intent and expectation is that the mandatory revisions can be=0D
addressed within four weeks and hence that conditionally accepted=0D
papers will in general be accepted in the second phase.=0D
=0D
The second submission should clearly identify how the mandatory=0D
revisions were addressed. To that end, the second submission must be=0D
accompanied by a cover letter mapping each mandatory revision request=0D
to specific parts of the paper. The cover letter will facilitate a=0D
quick second review, allowing for confirmation of final acceptance=0D
within two weeks. Conversely, the absence of a cover letter will be=0D
grounds for the paper=E2=80=99s rejection.=0D
=0D
**PACMPL issue ICFP 2021 will employ a lightweight double-blind=0D
 reviewing process.** To facilitate this, submitted papers must=0D
 adhere to two rules:=0D
=0D
 1. **author names and institutions must be omitted**, and=0D
 2. **references to authors' own related work should be in the third=0D
 person** (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather=0D
 "We build on the work of ...").=0D
=0D
The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an=0D
initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it=0D
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to=0D
try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the=0D
submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult=0D
(e.g., important background references should not be omitted or=0D
anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate=0D
their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally=0D
would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the=0D
web or give talks on their research ideas.=0D
=0D
### Information for Authors of Accepted Papers=0D
=0D
* As a condition of acceptance, final versions of all papers must=0D
 adhere to the new ACM Small format. The page limit for the final=0D
 versions of papers will be increased by two pages to help authors=0D
 respond to reviewer comments and mandatory revisions: **27 pages=0D
 plus bibliography for a regular paper or Functional Pearl, 14 pages=0D
 plus bibliography for an Experience Report**.=0D
=0D
* Authors of accepted submissions will be required to agree to one of=0D
 the three ACM licensing options: open access on payment of a fee=0D
 (**recommended**, and SIGPLAN can cover the cost as described next);=0D
 copyright transfer to ACM; or retaining copyright but granting ACM=0D
 exclusive publication rights.  Further information about ACM author=0D
 rights is available from <http://authors.acm.org>.=0D
=0D
* PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, and authors are encouraged to=0D
  publish their work under a CC-BY license. Gold Open Access=0D
  guarantees permanent free online access to the definitive version in=0D=

  the ACM Digital Library, and the recommended CC-BY option also=0D
  allows anyone to copy and distribute the work with attribution.=0D
  Gold Open Access has been made possible by generous funding through=0D
  ACM SIGPLAN, which will cover all open access costs in the event=0D
  authors cannot. Authors who can cover the costs may do so by paying=0D
  an Article Processing Charge (APC). PACMPL, SIGPLAN, and ACM=0D
  Headquarters are committed to exploring routes to making Gold Open=0D
  Access publication both affordable and sustainable.=0D
=0D
* ACM offers authors a range of copyright options, one of which is=0D
 Creative Commons CC-BY publication; this is the option recommended=0D
 by the PACMPL editorial board. A reasoned argument in favour of this=0D
 option can be found in the article [Why=0D
 CC-BY?](https://oaspa.org/why-cc-by/) published by OASPA, the Open=0D
 Access Scholarly Publishers Association.=0D

* ACM Author-Izer is a unique service that enables ACM authors to=0D
 generate and post links on either their home page or institutional=0D
 repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their=0D
 articles from the ACM Digital Library at no charge. Downloads=0D
 through Author-Izer links are captured in official ACM statistics,=0D
 improving the accuracy of usage and impact=0D
 measurements. Consistently linking to the definitive version of an=0D
 ACM article should reduce user confusion over article=0D
 versioning. After an article has been published and assigned to the=0D
 appropriate ACM Author Profile pages, authors should visit=0D
 <http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service> to learn=0D
 how to create links for free downloads from the ACM DL.=0D
=0D
* The official publication date is the date the papers are made=0D
 available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to *two=0D
 weeks prior* to the first day of the conference. The official=0D
 publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related=0D
 to published work.=0D
=0D
* Authors of each accepted submission are invited to attend and be=0D
 available for the presentation of that paper at the conference. The=0D
 schedule for presentations will be determined and shared with authors=0D=

 after the full program has been selected.=0D

### Artifact Evaluation=0D
=0D
Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase=0D
of the review process will be encouraged (but not required) to submit=0D
supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. These items will then be=0D=

reviewed by an Artifact Evaluation Committee, separate from the paper=0D
Review Committee, whose task is to assess how the artifacts support=0D
the work described in the associated paper. Papers that go through the=0D=

Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of=0D
approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of accepted papers=0D
will be encouraged to make the supporting materials publicly available=0D=

upon publication of the papers, for example, by including them as=0D
"source materials" in the ACM Digital Library.  An additional seal=0D
will mark papers whose artifacts are made available, as outlined in=0D
the ACM guidelines for artifact badging.=0D
=0D
Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and will not=0D
influence the final decision regarding paper acceptance.=0D
=0D
### Special categories of papers=0D
=0D
In addition to research papers, PACMPL issue ICFP solicits two kinds=0D
of papers that do not require original research contributions:=0D
Functional Pearls, which are full papers, and Experience Reports,=0D
which are limited to half the length of a full paper. Authors=0D
submitting such papers should consider the following guidelines.=0D
=0D
#### Functional Pearls=0D
=0D
A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to=0D
functional programming. Examples include, but are not limited to:=0D
=0D
 * a new and thought-provoking way of looking at an old idea=0D
=0D
 * an instructive example of program calculation or proof=0D
=0D
 * a nifty presentation of an old or new data structure=0D
=0D
 * an interesting application of functional programming techniques=0D
=0D
 * a novel use or exposition of functional programming in the classroom=0D=

=0D
While pearls often demonstrate an idea through the development of a=0D
short program, there is no requirement or expectation that they do=0D
so. Thus, they encompass the notions of theoretical and educational=0D
pearls.=0D
=0D
Functional Pearls are valued as highly and judged as rigorously as=0D
ordinary papers, but using somewhat different criteria. In particular,=0D=

a pearl is not required to report original research, but, it should be=0D=

concise, instructive, and entertaining. A pearl is likely to be=0D
rejected if its readers get bored, if the material gets too=0D
complicated, if too much specialized knowledge is needed, or if the=0D
writing is inelegant. The key to writing a good pearl is polishing.=0D
=0D
A submission that is intended to be treated as a pearl must be marked=0D
as such on the submission web page, and should contain the words=0D
"Functional Pearl" somewhere in its title or subtitle. These steps=0D
will alert reviewers to use the appropriate evaluation=0D
criteria. Pearls will be combined with ordinary papers, however, for=0D
the purpose of computing the conference's acceptance rate.=0D
=0D
#### Experience Reports=0D
=0D
The purpose of an Experience Report is to help create a body of=0D
published, refereed, citable evidence that functional programming=0D
really works -- or to describe what obstacles prevent it from=0D
working.=0D
=0D
Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:=
=0D
=0D
 * insights gained from real-world projects using functional programming=0D=

=0D
 * comparison of functional programming with conventional programming=0D
   in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum=0D
=0D
 * project-management, business, or legal issues encountered when=0D
   using functional programming in a real-world project=0D
=0D
 * curricular issues encountered when using functional programming in=0D
   education=0D
=0D
 * real-world constraints that created special challenges for an=0D
   implementation of a functional language or for functional=0D
   programming in general=0D
=0D
An Experience Report is distinguished from a normal PACMPL issue ICFP=0D
paper by its title, by its length, and by the criteria used to=0D
evaluate it.=0D
=0D
 * Both in the papers and in any citations, the title of each=0D
   accepted Experience Report must end with the words "(Experience=0D
   Report)" in parentheses. The acceptance rate for Experience=0D
   Reports will be computed and reported separately from the rate for=0D
   ordinary papers.=0D
=0D
 * Experience Report submissions can be at most 12 pages long,=0D
   excluding bibliography.=0D
=0D
 * Each Experience Report accepted to the PACMPL issue will be=0D
   presented at the conference, but depending on the number of=0D
   Experience Reports and regular papers accepted, authors of=0D
   Experience reports may be asked to give shorter talks.=0D
=0D
 * Because the purpose of Experience Reports is to enable our=0D
   community to accumulate a body of evidence about the efficacy of=0D
   functional programming, an acceptable Experience Report need not=0D
   add to the body of knowledge of the functional-programming=0D
   community by presenting novel results or conclusions. It is=0D
   sufficient if the Report states a clear thesis and provides=0D
   supporting evidence. The thesis must be relevant to the PACMPL=0D
   issue, but it need not be novel.=0D
=0D
The review committee will accept or reject Experience Reports based on=0D=

whether they judge the evidence to be convincing. Anecdotal evidence=0D
will be acceptable provided it is well argued and the author explains=0D
what efforts were made to gather as much evidence as=0D
possible. Typically, more convincing evidence is obtained from papers=0D
which show how functional programming was used than from papers which=0D
only say that functional programming was used. The most convincing=0D
evidence often includes comparisons of situations before and after the=0D=

introduction or discontinuation of functional programming. Evidence=0D
drawn from a single person's experience may be sufficient, but more=0D
weight will be given to evidence drawn from the experience of groups=0D
of people.=0D
=0D
An Experience Report should be short and to the point: it should make=0D
a claim about how well functional programming worked on a particular=0D
project and why, and produce evidence to substantiate this claim. If=0D
functional programming worked in this case in the same ways it has=0D
worked for others, the paper need only summarize the results;=0D
the main part of the paper should discuss how well it worked and in=0D
what context. Most readers will not want to know all the details of=0D
the project and its implementation, but the paper should characterize=0D
the project and its context well enough so that readers can judge to=0D
what degree this experience is relevant to their own projects. The=0D
paper should take care to highlight any unusual aspects of the=0D
project. Specifics about the project are more valuable than=0D
generalities about functional programming; for example, it is more=0D
valuable to say that the team delivered its software a month ahead of=0D
schedule than it is to say that functional programming made the team=0D
more productive.=0D
=0D
If the paper not only describes experience but also presents new=0D
technical results, or if the experience refutes cherished beliefs of=0D
the functional-programming community, it may be better to submit it as=0D=

a full paper, which will be judged by the usual criteria of novelty,=0D
originality, and relevance. The associate editor will be happy to=0D
advise on any concerns about which category to submit to.=0D
