Yes, one of the reason for writing the framework was to be able to 
implement F#-like active patterns.  I think it should be reasonably 
straightforward to do -- in fact, I'd expect design considerations to 
take up more time than actual implementation work (although I say that 
from the perspective of being already familiar with the "patterns" 
framework, of course).  If I remember rightly, there's a note at the end 
of the ICFP07 active patterns paper about using polymorphic variants to 
add active patterns in OCaml, which seems like it might be a good 
starting point.

You might also be interested in the "views" feature of Martin Jambon's 
"Micmatch", which is along the same lines as active patterns:
