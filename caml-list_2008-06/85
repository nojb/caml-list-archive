That's really great news!

This feature might be useful for other projects. Do you plan to make it 
available as a stand-alone library (maybe together with other 
Windows-related hacks)? Does it support Cygwin symlinks?

Already fixed in CVS HEAD (many of the Makefiles are now shared between 
Unix and Windows ports).

This is no longer true with the version in CVS HEAD, to become 3.11. Now 
there is some hackery at link time to allow using the same set of object 
files for linking statically or dynamically (for stub code dlls). Also, 
ocamlmklib is available for all the Windows ports.

Indeed. I've found that it is sometimes necessary (and it seems to be 
always sufficient) to add extra quotes around the whole command line.
E.g. to call emacs on a file "foo bar" (without the quotes) from OCaml, 
here what I do:

Sys.command "\"\"C:\\Program Files\\emacs-22.1\\bin\\emacs\" \"foo bar\"\""

That is, one passes this command line to cmd.exe:

""C:\Program Files\emacs-22.1\bin\emacs" "foo bar""

As weird as it may look, the quotes around the program and argument 
names are not escaped.
