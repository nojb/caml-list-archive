Hi,

First, thanks for your work for the windows platform.

I've just tried this beta. Overall it worked quite well (it compiled
during about one hour on a quite recent machine and installed 260MB of
data) but failed in the end. Here are the last lines (I haven't logged
everything but this could be enough) :

> + /home/Administrateur/godi-rocketboost-20080615/run/ocamlrun-3.09.3/byterun/ocamlfatrun /home/Administrateur/godi-rocketboost-20080615/godi-tools-boot/boot_console delete -f godi-tools

I have time to install godi from scratch so if you need anything,
don't hesitate. :)


Btw, is there any chance the PATH gets automatically updated ?
I've installed ocaml by hand several times but I keep on forgetting this step.

Thanks.
