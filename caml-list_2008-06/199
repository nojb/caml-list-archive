        =======================================================
        Associate Professorship in Theoretical Computer Science
        =======================================================


The Faculty of Computer Science of the Technische Universität München
invites applications for a tenured associate professorship (W2)
in theoretical computer science.

The Faculty seeks candidates with an excellent
research record in formal methods for
qualitative and quantitative analysis of systems, with
applications to the safety and security of software-intensive,
embedded, web-based, or mobile systems.

The Faculty is particularly interested in candidates that can
contribute to the Graduate School (Graduiertenkolleg)
"Program and Model Analysis", starting in July 2008. The goal of the
School is the development of analysis techniques combining methods from
static analysis, model checking, theorem proving and abstract
interpretation.

Successful candidates will be teaching in the Bachelor and Master
programmes of the Faculty. Interest in interdisciplinary cooperations within
the University is expected.

Applicants should have a doctorate and a Habilitation or
equivalent qualification, and be at most 52 years old.

The Technische Universität München gives priority to
applicants with disabilities in the case of equal
qualification. The University has the strategic goal of substantially
increasing the participation of women in research and teaching, and so
female scientists are encouraged to apply.

Applications including a CV and a list of publications
should be sent before August 8 to the Dean of the Faculty of Computer
Science at the following address

Fakultät für Informatik
Technische Universität München
Boltzmannstr. 3
85748 Garching bei München
