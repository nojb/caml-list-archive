Dear All,

I am a computer science student from India. I am working on some security
protocols under my research internship. For analysis of the protocols, I
need to run 'GNYtool' developed by David Monniaux.
http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~monniaux/download/gnytool.tar.gz

I have compiled the tool using 'Ocaml' compiler but I am not able to
figure out how to use the tool. Could anybody please help me out.

Thanking you,

- Abhishek Daiya
