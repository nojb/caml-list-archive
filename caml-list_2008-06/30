everyone--

My "OCaml Network Application Environment" project is not abandoned.  =20=

I'm just not as fast as we would like at producing maintenance =20
releases when the compiler system changes break my code.  Sorry about =20=

that.  Anyway, I have made some minor updates and pushed out a new set =20=

of release files.  Here are the highlights...

	<http://sourceforge.net/projects/ocnae>

There's lots more unreleased in CVS, in case anyone wants to go =20
peeking at it.  I've just released the relatively stable stuff.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D OCaml NAE Core Foundation (cf) library =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This distribution is the Objective Caml Network Application =20
Environment (NAE)
Core Foundation library, which is a collection of miscellaneous =20
extensions to
the Objective Caml standard library.

Highlighted features include:

- Functional streams and stream processors (extended).
- Functional bootstrapped skew-binomial heap.
- Functional red-black binary tree (associative array).
- Functional sets based on red-black binary tree.
- Functional real-time catenable deque.
- Functional LL(x) parsing using state-exception monad.
- Functional lazy deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
- Functional lexical analyzer (using lazy DFA and monadic parser).
- Functional substring list manipulation (message buffer chains).
- Gregorian calendar date manipulation.
- Standard time manipulation.
- System time in Temps Atomique International (TAI).
- Unicode transcoding.
- Universal resource identifier (URI) manipulation.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D OCaml NAE Network Extensions (nx) library =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This distribution is the Objective Caml Network Application =20
Environment (NAE)
"Network Extensions" library, which is a set of low-level interfaces =20
designed
for advanced network programming.

Highlights include...

- Extended socket interface (supports more options, and UDP w/=20
multicast).
- I/O event multiplexing (with Unix.select).

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D OCaml NAE Reactive I/O Monad (iom) library =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=


This distribution is the Objective Caml Network Application =20
Environment (NAE)
Reactive I/O Monad library, which implements I/O monad functions =20
designed to
facilitate writing of concurrent, reactive, single-threaded network =20
application
services in a functional style.

Note: see the ISSUES file for a list of open problems in this release.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D Required Components =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

This library requires the following external components:

- Objective Caml (v3.10.0 or newer)
- Findlib (tested with v1.1.2p1)
