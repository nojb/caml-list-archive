CALL FOR PAPERS

2008 Workshop on Automated Reasoning
Bridging the Gap between Theory and Practice

30th-31st July 2008

University of Birmingham
In conjunction with Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics

http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/workshops/arw/

*** 2-side Extended Abstracts Due: 13th June 2008 ***
================================================================
Invited Speakers
----------------

Professor Steve Linton
University of St. Andrews
Title TBA

Dr Andrew Ireland
Heriot-Watt University
Cooperative Reasoning for Automatic Software Verification

================================================================
Topics
------

The workshop will cover the full breadth and diversity of automated
reasoning and will include topics such as:

Theorem proving in classical and non-classical logics

Reasoning systems and mechanisms:
   Description logics
   Equational reasoning, unification
   Induction
   Constraint Satisfaction
   Combining reasoning systems
   Specialised decision procedures

Formal methods in software analysis:
   Verification
   Formal Modelling

Non-classical inference:
   Non-monotonic reasoning, abduction
   Intuitionistic reasoning

Logic-based knowledge representation:
   Ontology specification,
   Domain specific reasoning (spatial, temporal, epistemic etc.)

Reasoning for agents (or about agents)
Interactive theorem proving
Implementation issues and empirical results
Applications of automated reasoning
================================================================
Submissions
-----------

We invite interested persons to submit a camera-ready, two-page
extended abstract about recent work or work in progress, or a system
description. Anyone wishing to attend but not interested in presenting
should send a shorter position statement (1/2 - 1 page).

Submissions should be sent in in either Postscript or PDF format by
email to the workshop organisers at: L.A.Dennis@liverpool.ac.uk

Please use the LaTeX style file provided on the workshop web page:

http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/custom/arw/arw08_latex.tar

Each submission should include the names and complete addresses
(including email) of all authors. Correspondence will be sent to the
first author, unless otherwise indicated. The main objective of the
abstracts is to spread information about recent work in our community,
and we expect to accept most in-topic submissions, but we may ask for
revisions.

Abstracts will be published in informal workshop notes and be made
available on the internet.
================================================================
Presentations
-------------

Each workshop attendee will be allocated a 5 minute slot (or a 10
minute slot, depending on time constraints), for a short talk to
introduce their research. Each attendee will also be allocated space
in a poster session, where they can further present and discuss their
work. Please prepare posters for the event.
================================================================
Studentships
------------

A limited number of studentships will be available to fund travel and
accomodation expenses. Applications for studentships will require
written proof of student status, and must be received by the deadline
below. Payment is made by cheque during or after the symposium.

To indicate your interest, please send a short email to Louise
Dennis (L.A.Dennis@liverpool.ac.uk) any time before 1st June 2008.
================================================================
ARW Meal --------

We will organise a workshop meal. Details coming soon...
