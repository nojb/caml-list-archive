Important dates

Proposal Deadline: June 27, 2008, 0:00 UTC
Notification:      July 14, 2008

DEFUN 2008 invites functional programmers who know how to solve
problems with functional progamming to give talks and lead tutorials
at the The ICFP Developer Tracks.

We want to know about your favorite programming techniques, powerful
libraries, and engineering approaches you've used that the world
should know about and apply to other projects. We want to know how to
be productive using functional programming, write better code, and
avoid common pitfalls.

We invite proposals for presentations in the following categories:

How-to talks:
  45-minute "how-to" talks that provide specific information on how to
  solve specific problems using functional programming. These talks
  focus on concrete examples, but provide useful information for
  developers working on different projects or in different contexts.

  Examples:
  - "How I made Haskell an extension language for SAP R/3."
  - "How I replaced /sbin/init by a Scheme program."
  - "How I hooked up my home appliances to an Erlang control system."
  - "How I got an SML program to drive my BMW."

General language tutorials:
  Half-day general language tutorials for specific functional
  languages, given by recognized experts for the respective languages.

Technology tutorials:
  Half-day tutorials on techniques, technologies, or solving specific
  problems in functional programming.

  Examples:
  - how to make the best use of specific FP programming techniques
  - how to inject FP into a development team used to more conventional
    technologies
  - how to connect FP to existing libraries / frameworks / platforms
  - how to deliver high-performance systems with FP
  - how to deliver high-reliability systems with FP

Remember that your audience will include computing professionals who
are not academics and who may not already be experts on functional
programming.

Presenters of tutorials will receive free registration to ICFP 2008.

Submission guidelines

Submit a proposal of 150 words or less for either a 45-minute talk
with a short Q&A session at the end, or a 300-word-or-less proposal
for a 3-hour tutorial, where you present your material, but also give
participants a chance to practice it on their own laptops.

Some advice:
- Give it a simple and straightforward title or name; avoid fancy
  titles or puns that would make it harder for attendees to figure out
  what you'll be talking about.
- Clearly identify the level of the talk: What knowledge should people
  have when they come to the presentation or tutorial?
- Explain why people will want to attend:
  is the language or library useful for a wide range of attendees? Is
  the pitfall you're identifying common enough that a wide range of
  attendees is likely to encounter it?
- Explain what benefits attendees are expected to take home to their
  own projects.
- For a tutorial, explain how you want to structure the time, and what
  you expect to have attendees to do on their laptops. List what
  software you'll expect attendees to have installed prior to coming.

Submit your proposal in plain text electronically to
defun-2008-submission-AT-deinprogramm.de by the beginning of Friday,
June 27, Universal Coordinated Time.
