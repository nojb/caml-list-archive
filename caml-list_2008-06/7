This is not a TeX bug, as you correctly surmised...

ocamldoc should be doing this -- the \catcode value for # is 6 (The TeXbook,
pp. 37, 343) which means that it cannot be used as a basic character. Note
that # only needs to be written \# -- the braces are unnecessary as \# is a
parameter-less macro (in fact, it's a \chardef). From what I can see, the
bug is on line 89 of ocamldoc/odoc_latex.ml. Without seeing the faulty TeX
file, I can't confirm it for certain, but I would imagine that the problem
is that \verb is being used inside a \def or \newcommand which won't work
without a lot of (unnecessary) \catcode trickery surrounding the macro
definition. You could possibly say that it's a bug in LaTeX because \verb
should really be declared \outer in the LaTeX sources but that's a bit
off-topic for this list...
