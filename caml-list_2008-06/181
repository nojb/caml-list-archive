Hi,

Thanks for the quick response! I've encountered another strange one  
that may be related. The code below compiles only if you remove the  
underscore in the method "_a". The error message is similar to the  
earlier one, but I think it's a different problem?

class ['a] node d =
     object
         method _d : 'a = d
         method p (x : 'a) = "<data>"
     end

class ['a] pnode data =
     object (self)
         inherit ['a] node data
         (* doesn't compile with the underscore in "_a" *)
         method _a = self
         method p = function `P p -> p#name
     end

Yit
