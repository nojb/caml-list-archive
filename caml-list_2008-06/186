ICFP 2008 poster session
September 21, 2008
Call for presentation proposals

ICFP 2008 will feature a poster session for researchers and
practitioners, including students.  The session will provide friendly
feedback for work that is in gestation or ongoing, as well as
opportunities to meet each other and exchange ideas.  We welcome poster
submissions on all ICFP topics, especially presentations of

  - applications of and to functional programming;
  - recent work presented at more distant venues; and
  - ongoing work, whether or not submitted to ICFP.

There will be no formal proceedings, but presenters will be invited to
submit working notes, demo code, and other materials to supplement their
abstract and poster.  These materials will be released informally on a
Web page dedicated to the poster session.  An accepted submission is not
intended to replace conference or journal publication.

Persons interested in presenting a poster are invited to submit a
one-page abstract in SIGPLAN conference style
    http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

    https://www.softconf.com/s08/icfp08-posters/submit.html
by June 30, 2008.  The program committee will review the submissions
for relevance and interest, and notify the authors by July 14, 2008.
Accepted posters must be presented by the authors in person on Sunday,
September 21, 2008.
