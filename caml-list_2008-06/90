Currently I don't have such plans. For now, just get the library from 
https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/godi-bootstrap/godi-tools/trunk/console-src/godi-sys-win32/ (module Godi_file, in the parallel dir godi-sys-unix there is an implementation for POSIX).

It can read and resolve symlinks. For creating symlinks it just calls
Cygwin's /bin/ln for now.

Cool.

That's great. Thanks for doing that. I'll see how to integrate flexdll -
is it needed before ocaml is built, or can it be installed later? (That
looks like a bootstrap problem.)

Interesting. Nevertheless, really helpful is only something predictable.
There is no good information from Microsoft.
