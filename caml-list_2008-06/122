Agreed, and the man pages lag behind the options supported by the
binaries too.  I guess someone needs to contribute a patch to fix
this ...

/me laughs :-)

camlp4 is ... how shall I put this ... very very powerful, but also
only 'lightly' documented.  The situation has slightly improved with
the camlp4 wiki (http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Camlp4) but
one could write a book about camlp4, and I wish someone would.
