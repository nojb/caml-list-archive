Indeed, the fix for PR#4350 is in typecore.ml/1.190.2.5, and it is
about delayed checks changing type levels, and losing polymorphism.
In you specific case, this is the delayed check about sequences
(here you should have a warning if x has a concrete type other than
unit).

So yes, this is the fix you need to avoid the above problem, and
other loss of polymorphism related to delayed checks.
