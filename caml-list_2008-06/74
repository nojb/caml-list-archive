Hello,

There will be a talk on Fortress ( a new OO/Functional language from Sun) 
on Wednesday June 25 at 6:30pm in Manhattan. 

Abstract:

The Java Programming Language revolutionized programming with two simple 
concepts:   "Write once run anywhere", and Garbage Collection.  This led 
to a big step up in programmer productivity.  Project Fortress does it 
again.    This time we give you multiprocessor performance without 
having to code threads, locks, or load balancing.  Can you say "Implicit 
Parallelism" and "Transactional Memory"?  We also give you a growable 
language (small fixed core), strong static typing (more errors caught at 
compile time), and mathematical notation.   This talk will focus on the 
strengths of Fortress as a programming language, as well as a deep dive 
into implementation issues.

More information is available at http://lisp.meetup.com/59

-Jeff
