Thanks, Nicolas.  That's useful to know.

The solution I've adopted for now is to change the default quotation 
expander to a function that just slots in my lexer before calling the 
original expander.  This means that I can use my custom lexical syntax 
inside the << >> delimiters and I can use those delimiters either around 
the whole program or around a particular term.  I think this'll be fine 
for my needs, although it would be nice to be able to customize the 
lexer that's used for regular code as well.

Jeremy
