See if the latest DJGPP distribution (available on oak.oakland.edu and
mirror sites) has a graphics driver for your card. Some drivers,
especially the newest ones, are not included in the Caml Light
distribution.

Otherwise, it may be that your card is a plain vanilla VGA, in which
case all you can get is 320x200 in 256 colors (which is the default in
Caml Light if you don't install any driver).
