I strongly disagree with this statement. If you get a lot of warning, it means
you have a particular style of programming (for instance catching all
exceptions in most of the handler). Then what you really needs is a compiler
option to discard a particular warning (or class or warning) so you only get
the warnings which are relevant to you programming style.
