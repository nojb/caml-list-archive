Subject: Irrelevant variables in patterns 
Status: O


I understand your "point de vue". But then to catch the mispelling of an
exception, the only solution I can see is a different syntax for constructors
and variables at least in pattern (a quote in front of the constructeur in
pattern only).

I think this is important to find a solution to the mispelling problem,
because it's a common bug which is sometimes tricky to discover.

Christophe.
