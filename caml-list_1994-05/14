Yes - Daniel de Rauglaudre suggests (and I agree) that we capitalize
constructors, and not capitalize variables.

Another simple solution is to disallow variables in case/match/try
which do not actually occur in the body.  If you really want to have
such variables around, then put an underscore in front of the name.
