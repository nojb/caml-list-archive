Ok, but as long as "Out_of_memory" and "catch_break" are exceptions, if you
don't write the ten cases, this is likely to be a bug !!

Moreover, if you need to catch an exception, it means you want to do something
with it, which is in general specific to this exception. So you have to write
all the branches in most cases (the syntax "A | B | C ->" is then very
usefull).

Furthermore, I just asked for a warning ! this would catch the attention of
the programmer on a likely bug. but if he knowns what he is doing, he is free
to do so.

Christophe.
