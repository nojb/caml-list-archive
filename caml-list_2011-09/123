FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS:

                    TURING CENTENARY CONFERENCE
                       http://www.cie2012.eu

         Computability in Europe 2012: How the World Computes
                      University of Cambridge
                     Cambridge, 18-23 June 2012

CiE 2012 is one of a series of special events, running throughout the Alan
Turing Year, celebrating Turing's unique impact on mathematics, computing,
computer science, informatics, morphogenesis, artificial intelligence,
philosophy and computational aspects of physics, biology, linguistics,
economics and the wider scientific world.

Its central theme is the computability-theoretic concerns underlying the
broad spectrum of Turing's interests, and the contemporary research areas
founded upon and animated by them. In this sense, CiE 2012, held in
Cambridge in the week running up to the centenary of Turing's birthday,
deals with the essential core of what made Turing's contribution so
influential and long-lasting.

CiE 2012 promises to be an event worthy of the remarkable scientific
career it commemorates.

PLENARY SPEAKERS include:
Andrew Hodges (Oxford, Special Invited Lecture), Ian Stewart (Warwick,
Special Public Lecture), Dorit Aharonov (Jerusalem), Veronica Becher
(Buenos Aires), Lenore Blum (Carnegie Mellon), Rodney Downey (Wellington),
Yuri Gurevich (Microsoft), Juris Hartmanis (Cornell), Richard Jozsa
(Cambridge), Stuart Kauffman (Vermont/ Santa Fe), James Murray
(Washington/ Oxford, Microsoft Research Lecture), Stuart Shieber
(Harvard), Paul Smolensky (Johns Hopkins) and Leslie Valiant (Harvard,
jointly organised lecture with King's College).

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS and informal presentations are now invited for this
historic event.

For submission details, see:
http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/WScie12/give-page.php?12

The CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS will be published by LNCS, Springer-Verlag.
There will also be post-conference publications, drawing on contributions
presented at the conference.
