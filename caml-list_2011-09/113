Subject: [Caml-list] 'The Incomputable' - Registration opens

__________________________________________________________________________
Registration is now open:

          June 12-15, 2012 - Turing Centenary Workshop on
                       "THE INCOMPUTABLE"
 at the Kavli Royal Society International Centre, Chicheley Hall, UK

            www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/inc/

THE INCOMPUTABLE is a major multidisciplinary workshop of the 6-month
Isaac Newton Institute programme - "Semantics and Syntax: A Legacy of Alan
Turing" (SAS).

It is one of a series of special events, running throughout the Alan
Turing Year, celebrating Turing's unique impact on mathematics, computing,
computer science, informatics, morphogenesis, philosophy and the wider
scientific world. It is held in association with the Turing Centenary
Conference (CiE 2012) in Cambridge the following week, which will run up
to the June 23rd centenary of Turing's birth, and the weekend of
celebrations in Cambridge, Manchester, Bletchley Park, and around the
world.

There will be plenary talks from: Samson Abramsky, Martin Davis, Seth
Lloyd, Philip Maini, Yuri Matiyasevich, Istvan Nemeti/ Hajnal Andreka,
Gerald Sacks, Theodore A Slaman, Robert I Soare, Vlatko Vedral and Anton
Zeilinger.

Invited Special Session speakers include: Klaus Ambos-Spies, Marat M
Arslanov, Mark Bishop, Cristian Calude, Douglas Cenzer, Peter Cholak,
Jennifer Chubb, Bob Coecke, Jose Felix Costa, Vincent Danos, Rodney
Downey, Steven Ericsson-Zenith, Luciano Floridi, Sy Friedman, Sergey
Goncharov, Noam Greenberg, Joel Hamkins, Valentina Harizanov, Denis
Hirschfeldt, Mark Hogarth, Elham Kashefi, Julia Knight, Antonin Kucera,
Andrew Lewis, Giuseppe Longo, Antonio Montalban, Andre Nies, Mehrnoosh
Sadrzadeh, Richard A Shore, Aaron Sloman, Andrea Sorbi, Ivan Soskov,
Alexandra Soskova, Christof Teuscher, John Tucker, Jan van Leeuwen,
Kumaraswamy (Vela) Velupillai, Peter Wegner, Philip Welch, Jiri
Wiedermann.

There will be provision for informal discussions, small research
workshops, and project planning meetings.

THE INCOMPUTABLE, generously supported by the John Templeton Foundation,
promises to be a historic event, bringing the mathematical theory of
incomputability centre-stage once again. Attendance is limited to 120
participants - up to 60 accommodated on-site - so early registration is
advised.

The registration page is at:

http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/inc/give-page.php?26

Note: Speakers are already registered, and SAS participants have their own
arrangements, and should contact the Isaac Newton Institute directly, if
they have not already done so.

Organisers: S Barry Cooper and Mariya Soskova
