                          Final Call for Papers
                          =====================

                  14th International Symposium on 
      Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2012)

            http://research.microsoft.com/~crusso/padl12

         Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, January 23-24, 2012
                    Co-located with ACM POPL'12
       
      Abstract/Paper submission deadline: September 10th/17th, 2011

                      Conference Description
                      ======================

   Declarative languages build on sound theoretical bases to provide attractive frameworks for application development. These languages have been successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from data base management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems.

   New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new application areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel problems raise numerous interesting research issues. Well-known questions include designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well.

   PADL is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative concepts, including, functional, logic, constraints, etc. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

   * Innovative applications of declarative languages
   * Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
   * Practical applications of theoretical results
   * New language developments and their impact on applications
   * Declarative languages and Software Engineering
   * Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
   * Practical experiences and industrial applications
   * Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
   * Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and 
     reactive languages.

   PADL'12 welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to applications and implementation of declarative languages. In this occasion PADL is co-located, as traditionally, with ACM POPL, which will be held immediately following PADL, January 25-27. The symposium will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.



              Important Dates and Submission Guidelines
              =========================================

              Abstract Submission:    September 10, 2011
              Paper Submission:       September 17, 2011
              Notification:             October 22, 2011
              Camera-ready:             November 5, 2011
              Symposium:             January 23-24, 2012

   Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF using the Springer LNCS format. The submission will be done through EasyChair conference system. If electronic submission is impossible, please contact the program chairs for information on how to submit hard copies. All submissions must be original work written in English. Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. PADL'12 will accept both technical and application papers:

   * Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished
     research results. Technical papers must not exceed 15 pages in
     Springer LNCS format.
   * Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical
     applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or
     in areas of research other than Computer Science. Application
     papers will be published in the Springer-Verlag conference
     proceedings, and will be presented in a separate session.
     Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or
     real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of
     declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering
     solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative)
     are solicited. The limit for application papers is 6 pages in
     Springer LNCS format.
