Subject: [Caml-list] Mathematics of Program Construction - first call for papers

FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

11th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC 2012)
Madrid, Spain, 25-27 June 2012
http://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/mpc2012



BACKGROUND

The biennial MPC conferences aim to promote the development of
mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical
and effective in the process of constructing computer programs,
broadly interpreted.

The 2012 MPC conference will be held in Madrid, Spain, from 25th to
27th June 2012.  The previous conferences were held in Twente, The
Netherlands (1989), Oxford, UK (1992), Kloster Irsee, Germany (1995),
Marstrand, Sweden (1998), Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000), Dagstuhl,
Germany (2002), Stirling, UK (2004, colocated with AMAST), Kuressaare,
Estonia (2006, colocated with AMAST), Marseille, France (2008), and
Québec City, Canada (2010, colocated with AMAST).


TOPICS

Papers are solicited on mathematical methods and tools put to use in
program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to
support for program construction in programming languages and systems.
The notion of "program" is broad, from algorithms to hardware.  Some
typical areas are type systems, program analysis and transformation,
programming-language semantics, security, and program logics.
Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance
to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome,
provided that their mathematical basis is evident.


INVITED SPEAKERS

To be arranged.


IMPORTANT DATES

  * Submission of abstracts       09 January 2012
  * Submission of full papers     16 January 2012
  * Notification to authors:      19 March 2012
  * Final version:                16 April 2012


SUBMISSION

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, 10 to 20 lines)
must be submitted by 09 January 2012. Full papers (pdf) adhering to
the LaTeX llncs style must be submitted by 16 January 2012. There is
no official page limit, but authors should strive for brevity. The
web-based system EasyChair will be used for submission
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mpc2012).

Papers must report previously unpublished work, and not be submitted
concurrently to another conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.
Please feel free to write to mpc2012@easychair.org with any questions
about academic matters.

The proceedings of MPC 2012 will be published in Springer-Verlag's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, as have all the previous
editions. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to transfer
copyright to Springer for this purpose. After the conference, we plan
that the authors of the best papers will be invited to submit revised
versions to a special issue of the Elsevier journal Science of
Computer Programming.
