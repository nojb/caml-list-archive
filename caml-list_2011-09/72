Subject: [Caml-list] Functional Programming eXchange 2012: Call for abstracts

Hello all,

I’m sending this email to several mailing lists so my apologies if you
see this twice.

Functional Programming eXchange is a developer conference that focuses
on functional programming. The 2012 edition will take place on Friday
March 16th March 2012, at the Skills Matter eXchange, in London.
Typically talks are explore concepts that often crop up in functional
programming such as parallelism or domain specific languages, look at
frameworks built in functional languages or are cases studies of using
functional programming in industry.

Previous speakers have included: Simon Peyton Jones, Miles Sabin,
David Pollak, Adam Granicz, Antonio Cisternino, Tomas Petricek, Jonas
Boner, and Viktor Klang.

Videos of the talks at the previous events can be found here:
http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/functionalpx-2011
http://skillsmatter.com/event/cloud-grid/functional-programming-exchange-2009

If you are interested at speaking at this conference please send a
talk abstract to talks_functionalpx@skillsmatter.com.

I’m aiming to make the decision about which talks have been chosen
around 14th October so if you submit an abstract expect to hear from
me around this time.

Kind regards,
Robert
