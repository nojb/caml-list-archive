Well, this was developed for Mylife in a project where the sender was
written in Python. (I don't have access to this code anymore, though,
since I left Mylife.)

What's missing here is that you need to bind the queue to an exchange.
Remember that t_sender only sends the message to the exchange amq.direct
with a routing key of test_xy_routing_key. It does not send the message
to test_xy directly (which is not possible). Without binding, the
exchange just drops unroutable messages.

Don't know exactly how to bind in Python, but watch out for a method
queue_bind.
