Subject: Re: [Caml-list] separate compilation

#stuff are generally for interactive top-level use.
#use and #load definitely are. They can't be compiled.

First, compile interface files:
ocamlc -c a.mli
then compile your ml :
ocamlc -c a.ml
because your ml uses (at least it seems to) information contained in
your mli file.

If your files depend on other files that are in other directories, you
may need to use -I, like in
ocamlc -c -I lib/stuff plop.ml
if you have for instance a dependance on a module contained in lib/stuff.
(Notice that modules on which you depend have to be compiled)

And to use mli information, it has to be compiled (into a cmi file).

Cheers,
