Subject: [Caml-list] Jane street's core (et al.) post-hurricane code release

This release comes right after an earthquake and a hurricane so you know 
this is going to be strong stuff!
This is our latest and greatest release of Jane street Core and 
supporting libraries. For this release we've decided to move towards a 
versioning scheme that is more coherent to our internal system so 
everything is version 107.01.
With this release Sexplib Typeconv and Bin-prot are no longer included. 
This is because we've merged back with Markus's version and now release 
them from ocamlforge. They are packaged with oasis thus bringing you the 
easiest to build, most portable release yet.
Sexplib and Bin-prot have had version bumps to fix compatibility issues 
found while packaging Core. You should grab the latest version while 
they are hot at:

_Sexplib (7.0.2) : https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/sexplib/
_Bin-prot (2.0.3): https://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/bin-prot/
   This release of bin-prot also includes contributions by Stéphane 
Glondu to make it portable on all the architectures that debian is 
compiled for. Thank you Stéphane!

All the other libraries are download-able from our own webpage 
(http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/13)
The released libraries now all come with a [doc] build target that 
extracts the ocamldoc HTML documentation. This documentation can also be 
browsed online on our website.

_Fieldslib(107.01): Just a version bump
_Core(107.01): Core's support for Timezones has been improved. The 
effort to provide a coherent,typesafe approach to programming carries on 
with new types and module to deal with identifiers, ip host/port couple 
etc...
_Core_extended(107.01):
   New wrapper for Posix_clocks.
   More function to handle backward and forward compatibility in sexp 
Sexp_extended.
   [Types] is a module used to do type runtime introspection of ocaml 
values (by using an universal value).

New in this release:

_Variantslib(107.01): A syntax extension to scaffold constructor 
functions and accessors automatically from variant type definitions.
_Patdiff(107.01): Patdiff is a nifty diffing code utility that generates 
diffs designed to be read by humans and not computers. It uses the 
patience-diff algorithm to do inter-line and intra-line and diffs.
