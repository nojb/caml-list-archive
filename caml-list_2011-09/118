Out of curiosity I redid the same tests on the native build, and the 
following works :

ocamlmklib -cclib /usr/lib/driver.so wrapper.o mylib.cmx -o mylib

It appears that the library is linked when "ocamlopt -shared" is called 
though, so the library is statically linked in the dynamically linked 
module. Which is fine actually, it does solve my problem.

I guess I don't really need the bytecode version, but if there is a way 
to do it, please satisfy my curiosity ;)

Thanks and cheers,
