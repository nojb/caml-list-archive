Subject: [Caml-list] Lwt and exceptions

The Lwt doc states that you should not use "raise" when using Lwt
but use Lwt.fail instead.

So, is it still OK to call functions (for instance from the stdlib)
that may raise an exception, provided we catch it soon enough ?
And by "soon enough" I mean: before an Lwt call that could schedule
another thread.
