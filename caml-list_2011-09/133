Subject: [Caml-list] A small patch for ocamlc 3.12.1 to find reudundant opens

Hi,

I have written a patch to detect redundant opens in OCaml source code,
which is useful to keep your opened module list minimum. Keeping the
list smaller is good to avoid name space contamination.

You can obtain the latest diff for OCaml 3.12.1 from my repo at
https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/mutated_ocaml . After cloning, get
it by:

    hg diff -r ocaml-3.12.1-11110 -r redundant_open_warning

After patching, building is as usual:

    make core coreboot world opt opt.opt install # Beware what you are doing!

I have found nearly 150 redundant opens in OCaml source code! You
should check your OCaml code with it, too!
