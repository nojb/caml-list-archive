Subject: [Caml-list] Hashtbl or Set?


I need a somewhat large (thousands) set of strings, created once during
startup and never modified after.  What is a better choice, a (string,
unit) Hashtbl.t or the Set module?  If the Set module still uses trees
as it did when I was young :-), access will be logarithmic versus
constant for Hashtbl.  But on the other hand a hash function must
examine all of every string while the comparison of 2 strings stops at
the first nonmatching character.

I am thinking about the time to build the set as well as the probing
time.
