If the world tended to be ideal at some point, I'd say it should be a
compiler option, like
   # ocamlopt -unshared-litteral-strings
 (or -shared-literral-strings)
Sometimes it's painful that strings are mutable, but otherwise, it
would be painful too (maybe less often, I don't know). I believe that
the worst is to have *both* mutable strings *and* the necessity to
copy them every time mutability makes it weird.

When I teach programming using OCaml, I really dislike having to
explain that we have to live with this awful semantics (fortunately
the language has stunning great qualities).

Well, I guess this discussion has occurred thousands of times already.
Sorry for that.

Cheers,
