I guess, not (and it has been answered already). In fact, I was wondering
if Lwt's authors would be against adding a function like:

	let wrap f x = try Lwt.return (f x) with e -> Lwt.fail e

It is stupid, trivial, etc… but looks what we need most of the time, no?
Instead of doing it in our own code, it could land in Lwt directly.
But, if it gets integrated into Lwt proper, users should be warned about
its behaviour. (especially with impure functions).
