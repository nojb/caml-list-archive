Subject: [Caml-list] Towards a really native =?WINDOWS-1252?Q?toplevel=85?= ocamlnat w/o as/ld

Hello,

I thought I'd just give a quick status update on the ocamlnat issue we've been working on for some time now (in a new thread since this is not strictly related to the linear scan patch). Right now we have working versions of ocamlnat for amd64 and i386 running on Linux and OS X (other systems should be supported as well, windows might need a short patch) which do no longer depend on external assemblers and linkers, the opcode emission and linking is done in-process.

The code for the amd64 version is available in the "ocamlnat-jit-amd64" branch of my "ocaml-experimental" repository at:

https://github.com/bmeurer/ocaml-experimental/tree/ocamlnat-jit-amd64

I'll push the i386 version once cleaned up and integrated with the approach implemented for the amd64 version now. It should be noted that there's still some room left for optimizations (i.e. use short jumps whenever possible, etc.), but the results so far are already quite promising: The new ocamlnat beats both the old ocamlnat as well as the byte code toplevel in every benchmark I've tried. I'll prepare a detailed comparison when time permits.

Benedikt
