Subject: [Caml-list] Invitation to attend workshop on Virtual Machines and Intermediate
 Languages (VMIL) @ SPLASH 2011

Dear colleagues,

we would like to invite you to attend the workshop on
Virtual Machines and Intermediate Languages (VMIL 2011),
which will be co-located with SPLASH. Please note that the early
registration deadline for SPLASH is Sept. 23 and that it is required
that you register for the workshop participation.

This workshop is a forum for research in virtual machines
(VM) and intermediate languages (IL). It is dedicated to
identifying programming mechanisms and constructs that are
currently realized as code transformations or implemented in
libraries but should rather be supported at VM and IL level.

Besides the presentation of accepted papers, the workshop features an
invited talk by

Lars Bak, Google

For more details on the format and program of the workshop please see
our homepage:

http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/vmil/

We look forward to meeting you at the workshop.

Best regards,
Christoph Bockisch, Hridesh Rajan, Michael Haupt and Robert
Dyer
VMIL 2011 Organizers
