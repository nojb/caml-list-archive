               CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS - iFM & ABZ 2012

       9th International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods
     3rd International Conference on Abstract State Machines (ASM),
                          Alloy, B, VDM, and Z

                           18 - 22 June 2012
                            CNR Pisa, Italy

                     http://ifm-abz.isti.cnr.it/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The iFM and ABZ conferences are co-located in order to host a joint
conference in honour of Egon Boerger's 65th birthday. The conferences
are organized by the Formal Methods && Tools Lab at CNR/ISTI and take
place at the Area della Ricerca del CNR in Pisa on June 18-22, 2012.

The iFM conference series seeks to further research on the combination
of (formal and semi-formal) methods for system development, regarding
modeling and analysis, and covering all aspects from language design
through verification and analysis techniques to tools and their
integration into software engineering practice.

The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of five
related state-based and machine-based formal methods, Abstract State
Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual
foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the
design and analysis of hardware and software systems.

We invite you to submit proposals for one day workshops in the areas
covered by the iFM and ABZ conferences. In particular workshops on
challenging new, emerging fields are sought.

iFM & ABZ workshop proposals should include:

* workshop title, acronym, and a brief description of its scope/goals
* names, affiliations, and very brief CV of the workshop organizers
* format of the workshop and its duration and selection procedure
* expected number of participants
* form of proceedings

Proposals (at most 2 pages) should be sent to the workshop chairs:
Maurice ter Beek (maurice.terbeek@isti.cnr.it) and
Angelo Gargantini (angelo.gargantini@unibg.it)

The deadline for submissions is October 15, 2011.
Notifications will be sent by November 30, 2011.

Workshops with informal proceedings can be assisted in printing and
distribution by the iFM & ABZ 2012 organizing committee.
Workshop participants will be offered registration for iFM & ABZ 2012
with a special discount fee.

More information on iFM & ABZ 2012: http://ifm-abz.isti.cnr.it
Further enquiries can be made to the workshop chairs.
