                            CALL FOR PAPERS
                      ===========================

        ============================================================
                  The 18th International Conference on 
        Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning
        ============================================================

                   Merida, Venezuela - March 11-15, 2012
        http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/events/lpar18/ 


The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial 
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of 
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning, 
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to 
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to 
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 18th LPAR 
will be held in Merida, Venezuela.

Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in Computer 
Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational to the applied.
At one extreme, it underlies computability and complexity theory and the formal 
semantics of programming languages. At the other extreme, it drives billions 
of gates every day in the digital circuits of processors of all kinds. Logic 
is in itself a powerful programming paradigm, but it is also the quintessential 
specification language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems to 
networked infrastructures. Logical techniques link implementation and 
specification through formal methods such as automated theorem proving and 
model checking. Logic is also the stuff of knowledge representation and 
artificial intelligence. Because of its ubiquity, logic has acquired a central 
role in Computer Science education.

Topics
------
New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome.
Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open 
questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  * Automated reasoning
  * Verification
  * Interactive theorem proving and proof assistants
  * Model checking
  * Implementations of logic
  * Satisfiability modulo theories
  * Rewriting and unification
  * Logic programming
  * Satisfiability checking
  * Constraint programming
  * Decision procedures
  * Logic and games
  * Logic and the Web
  * Ontologies and large knowledge bases
  * Logic and databases
  * Modal and temporal logics
  * Program analysis
  * Foundations of security
  * Description logics
  * Non-monotonic reasoning
  * Uncertainty reasoning
  * Logics for vague and inconsistent data
  * Specification using logic
  * Logic in artificial intelligence
  * Logic and types
  * Logical foundations of programming
  * Logical aspects of concurrency
  * Logic and computational complexity
  * Knowledge representation and reasoning
  * Logic of distributed systems

Programme Chairs
----------------
  * Nikolaj Bjorner
  * Andrei Voronkov

Conference Chair
----------------
  * Geoff Sutcliffe

Local Arrangements Chair
------------------------
  * Blanca Abraham

Submission Details
------------------
Submissions of two kinds are welcome:

  * Regular papers that describe solid new research results. They can be
    up to 15 pages long in LNCS style, including figures and references,
    but excluding appendices (that reviewers are not required to read).
  * Experimental and tool papers that describe implementations of systems,
    report experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented
    systems. They can be up to 8 pages long in the LNCS style.

Both types of papers can be electronically submitted in PDF via EasyChar:
    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar18. 
Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract a week 
before the paper submission deadline (see below).

Participation
-------------
Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them 
will be present at the conference.

---------------
  * Abstract submission: 23 October 2011
  * Paper submission: 1 November 2011
  * Notification of acceptance: 20 December 2011
  * Camera-ready papers: 10 January 2012
