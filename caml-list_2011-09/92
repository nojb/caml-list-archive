Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Lwt and exceptions

Yes, it's essential to do this for many common functions such as Hashtbl.find. The nice thing about Lwt is that you control yielding, so as long as you catch the exception locally and "convert" it into the Lwt monad, everything works great.

The occasional exception leak is really hard to track down though, if you let one propagate by mistake. Ban OCaml exceptions! :)
