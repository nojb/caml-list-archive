The Netnumber module of Ocamlnet actually does this:

https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netstring/netnumber.mli
https://godirepo.camlcity.org/svn/lib-ocamlnet2/trunk/code/src/netstring/netnumber.mlp

Netnumber is fairly standalone, so you could just copy it to your
project if you don't want all of Ocamlnet.
