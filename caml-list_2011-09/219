    <font size="-1">Hi all,<br>
      <br>
      This mail announces the new release of ODT: 2.0. <br>
      ODT (OCaml Development Tools) is an Eclipse plug-in for OCaml.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, ODT is still alive. All releases are not always announced on
      this <br>
      mailing list, as ODT might not be enough developed to be really
      useful<br>
      for industrial developments.<br>
      <br>
      However, after a long period of development and tests, the 2.0
      release<br>
      came out. It brings new functionalities, like separate and
      conditional <br>
      compilation and camlp4 support. It also becomes more mature.<br>
      <br>
      ODT needs a lot of feedback to be more robust, and also to decide<br>
      the development priorities.<br>
      <br>
      Don't hesitate to try ODT, even for fun. ODT can be installed as
      explained<br>
      into the install notes (<a
        href="http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?article5">http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?article5</a>).
      <br>
      The tutorial has also been rewritten and screenshots have been
      updated.<br>
      The release news (with more technical information) is available at
      <br>
      <a href="http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?breve23">http://ocamldt.free.fr/spip.php?breve23</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Thanks a lot for using ODT.<br>
      <br>
      Emmanuel<br>
