Subject: [Caml-list] (announcement) OCAPIC 2.5, tutorial

Dear all,

during this summer, a few changes have happened for OCAPIC.
OCAPIC is about programming PIC18 micro-controllers using OCaml (the complete language with a modified runtime library) rather than assembly (PIC ASM or subsets of C).

- a new look for the website, and a new URL (the former one is still valid)
  http://www.algo-prog.info/ocapic/

- a new major version for OCAPIC (2.5)
 The list of new features is available on the download page:
 http://www.algo-prog.info/ocapic/web/index.php?id=Download

- and more importantly, a tutorial (in both French and English) for those who want to explore this particular world of PIC micro-controllers in OCaml.
 As a PIC environment simulator is part of OCAPIC, you can even experiment PIC programming without having any PIC hardware.
 http://www.algo-prog.info/ocapic/web/index.php?id=Documentation

Feel free to send feedback or ask questions.

Cheers,
Philippe Wang
