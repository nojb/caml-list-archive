You may be able to use ideas/implementation from the Int63 module:

http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-df/html/Int63.html
or
http://www.janestreet.com/ocaml/janestreet-ocamldocs/core/Int63.html

The Int63 module uses int internally on 64bit OCaml installations and
Int64.t internally on 32bit OCaml installations.  I am not familiar
with the details but it may be adaptable to your needs.
