mingw32-ocaml can cross-compile, Debian and Fedora includes it.
You'll need to cross-compile all the OCaml (and native) libs you use though (Fedora might provide pre-cross-compiled libs, not sure).

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy way to cross-compile for Win64 in Debian
(might be possible if an mingw-w64-ocaml package is created based on mingw-w64), but 32-bit
executables run just there too.

That'd work of course, but you have the inconvenience of booting windows everytime.

Not that I know of, but one could be written using ocaml-win32 (or lablgtk).
Is your app purely console based otherwise, or does its Unix version have a GUI?

Does that mean that you don't use 3rdparty libs, or only use
ones that can be compiled to pure bytecode (without native code)?
If so cross-compiling with mingw32-ocaml should work fairly well.

Another alternative would be to distribute ocamlrun.exe alongside your program.
