Thanks, I tried the following combinations (with the bytecode version, 
not the native one):

-cclib -l$(DLLPATH)$(DLLNAME)$(DLLEXT)
-cclib -L$(DLLPATH) -cclib -l$(DLLNAME)$(DLLEXT)
-L$(DLLPATH) -cclib -l$(DLLNAME)$(DLLEXT)
-cclib -l$(DLLPATH)$(DLLNAME)
-cclib -L$(DLLPATH) -cclib -l$(DLLNAME)
-L$(DLLPATH) -cclib -l$(DLLNAME)

Where $(DLLPATH) is the full path to my driver, such as /usr/lib/, 
$(DLLNAME) is driver file name without the extension, such as driver, 
and $(DLLEXT) is the extension, such as .so, such that the full .so path 
is /usr/lib/driver.so.

None of them works; I still get the "undefined symbol" error. The option 
does appear with ocamlobjinfo though. For instance, here is the result 
of ocamlobjinfo on the .cma using the last command:

Extra C object files: -lcryptoki -ldriver
Extra C options: -L/usr/lib/
Extra dynamically-loaded libraries: -lcryptoki

Shouldn't the -ldriver option appear in the extra dynamically-loaded 
libraries as well?

I might try Jeremie's more direct approach if everything else fails.

Cheers,
