"-l$(DLLNAME)" refers to "lib$(DLLNAME).so". It is to be used with
system shared libraries that use that convention. If you want to link to
something not using this convention, using the full path (without -l/-L)
might work on Linux, but keep in mind that not using lib$(DLLNAME).so
might be on purpose (e.g. to suggest that this .so should be dlopen()-ed
and not ld-linked).

Where does cryptoki come from?

Actually, I should have read more carefully your first mail... Jeremie's
(and Daniel's) approach are clearly the way to go: write a C stub around
dlopen() once and for all. I was instead thinking about drivers written
in OCaml that were using system shared libraries in my replies.
