Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Jane street's core (et al.) post-hurricane code release

Hi,

this seems like a good occasion to announce the availability of the
latest versions of Jane Street Core, Core Extended, and related
libraries (type-conv, bin-prot, sexplib, fieldslib, variantslib) in
Godi.  Your preprocessing problem should be fixed in the latest
versions of these packages.  For manual installation you may need to
download some of them from OCaml Forge instead, which is more
up-to-date.  All packages should build on both Linux and Mac OS X.
Jane Street's "patdiff" tool should also become available in Godi some
time later today.

Regards,
Markus
