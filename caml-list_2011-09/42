Subject: [Caml-list] ocaml munin plugin example

Hi all,

A quick and dirty Munin plugin I currently use to monitor my traffic 
consumption: http://is.gd/2tUKFM

I have a limited plan (3GB) on an USB 3G stick (ppp0 interface), better 
to monitor it.

I store the ppp0 RX and TX traffic in a SQLite3 database in a 5 min 
basis with a cron:

*/5 *  *   *   * \
     sqlite3 /home/mihamina/accouting \
    "INSERT INTO ifconfig VALUES(NULL, DATETIME('NOW')  \
      $(/sbin/ifconfig ppp0 | sed 's/:/ /g' \
    | awk '/RX bytes/{print ",", $3, "," ,$8, ")"}')"

Need to store the counters in a persistent way because when 
deconnecting/reconnecting, counters reset.

I realized later there was an easier way by parsing /proc/net/dev 
instead of parsing ifconfig output. I'll switch to that later.

I'll blog it later too... :-)
