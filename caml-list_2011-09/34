*********************************************************************

Dear Colleague,

    In consideration of various requests from current and prospective 
authors,
we have decided to extend the deadline of the RuleML2011@BRF 
Challenge. This
will allow current authors to refine their demo papers and enable 
prospective
authors to join the upcoming RuleML2011@BRF 
(http://2011.ruleml.org/america).

The updated important dates for the Challenge event are as follows:
* Sept. 16th, 2011 - Submission deadline for demo papers (EXTENDED)
* Sept. 23th, 2011 - Submission deadline for demo systems (EXTENDED)
* Sept. 30th, 2011 - Notification of accepted demo papers and systems
* Oct.   7th, 2011 - Camera ready papers

Submissions are composed of an open-source or commercial demo, and a 
paper
describing the research, implementation and technical details behind 
it.
Both paper and demo have to be submitted to this website:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ruleml2011challenge

Please notice that to better disseminate your work all demos should 
also be
uploaded here: http://2011.ruleml.org/america/?page_id=184

Accepted papers will be published as CEUR Workshop Proceedings.
More details on the paper format, upload procedure and evaluation 
criteria can
be found on the Challenge section of the main symposium site:
http://2011.ruleml.org/america/?page_id=113

RuleML-2011@BRF aims to emphasize the synergy between high-quality 
research
and industries in rule modeling, markup and reasoning, with particular 
focus
on rule usability in the Web environment. RuleML2011@BRF has already 
committed
a rich assembly of speakers from academia, industry and standards 
organizations:
- Keynotes: Christian de Sainte Marie (IBM ILOG), Marcus Spies 
(Ludwig-Maximilians
   University, Munich), Paul Vincent, (CTO Business Rules & CEP, TIBCO
   Software) and Jan Vanthienen (KU Leuven, World Authority on Decision
   Tables).
- An OMG presentation will be given by Said Tabet (EMC) and one from
   NIEM and OASIS by David Webber (Oracle Corporation).
- Special invited demos will be presented by Jans Aasman (Franz Inc.)
   and by Benjamin Grosof (Vulcan Inc.).

Best regards,
     The RuleML2011@BRF Challenge Chairs
