Subject: compilation of lablgl examples.

Hello,
I have a problem with compiling the laglgl examples. I
can run them with the top level:
lablgl -labels simple.ml

but 

ocamlc -I /usr/lib/ocaml/labltk  -I 
/usr/lib/ocaml/lablGL -I /usr/lib/labltk.cma
lablgl.cma togl.cmo simple.ml -o program

gives the following output:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ltk8.0
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Error while building custom runtime system

I have libtk8.0.so.1 in /usr/lib
so I guess that the library really should be found,
also the fact that the toplevel works seems to support
that this library indeed is existing and usable.
Does anyone else have similar problems?

I am running debian/woody.

BR
Peter Rönnquist
