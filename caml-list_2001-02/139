Those kind of tuning are easy to do when using some interactive system;
that's why we worked hard to provide interactive versions of our *tk
GUI, so that there is no need to recompile to only change some integer
value. Evidently, an interactive interface builder could also do the
same, but it is not necessary ...

Hope this helps,
