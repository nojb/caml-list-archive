In the following code I would like to apply the method inc or dec to the
object obj. However, what is the syntax I should use? At all comments below
the compilation fails.

class class1 =
  object (self)
    val mutable x = 1
    method inc step = x <- x+step    
    method dec step = x <- x+step
    method get () = x
  end

let main () =
  let method_to_call =
    if Random.int 2 = 0 then 
      inc   (* pointer to inc-method in class1 *)
    else
      dec   (* pointer to dec-method in class1 *)
  in
  let obj = new class1 in
  obj#method_to_call 2;    (* apply pointer to method in class1 *)
  obj#get ()
