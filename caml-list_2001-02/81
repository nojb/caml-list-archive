Have a look at the basic Objective Caml examples at adress

http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/Examples/oc/basics/eng.html

Calling the Caml compiler:
  to compile the file hello.ml to executable program a.out type
    ocamlc hello.ml
  to compile the file hello.ml to executable program hello type
    ocamlc -o hello hello.ml


To try interactively: call the Caml interactive system
        ocaml

Then type in (don't forget the initial # sign, that
indicates a directive)

        #use "loadall.ml";;

Hope this helps,
