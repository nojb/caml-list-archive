Or, along similar lines,
there could be a member of the consortium
consisting of individuals.

Influence in the Consortium could be proportional to this group's
total contribution.

Government of this group could be by annual election
of a benign dictator or small committee (no doubt there are other possible means).

My guess is that many people on this mailing list
would be happy to part with a modest amount of money
in order to help out - admittedly in a small way - with Ocaml development.

	Actually, I'd consider three levels: add a 
level for individuals. The contribution should be enough
to cover administrative overheads, the main communal benefit
would be the existence of a 'registry' of serious
Caml users. Such a list would help us to know each other,
and also help to convince management that there really
is more than one Caml programmer in the world :-)
