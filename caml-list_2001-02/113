I'm not really sure it bites that many, but I'd like to be told
otherwise. It does really hit you when  trying to 
implement Chris Okasakis elegant bootstrapped data structures, or
emulate object oriented things with modules.  (Together with first-class
and recursive structure, you can model quite a bit of object oriented
stuff, but I'm not sure how natural or efficient this appproach is.)

If I had the time, I'd do it, but I don't really. It should be easy to
deconstruct the Moscow ML sources
and transplant the ideas to Ocaml (at least to the bytecode
interpreter). I can give pointers to whoever tries to do that.
