	Of course .. although that will not provide information
about who the people are: is X a commercial programmer available for
Caml work, a researcher, a student, or what?
 
	Personally .. I'm applying for C++ jobs, but I'd
just love to be paid to write Ocaml. In my last job,
I got to choose the language to use to implement another
language, and of course chose Ocaml... but this was
a rare opportunity, as was the previous job working
on yet another language with a compiler written in
Ocaml. It would be _so_ nice not to have to go back to C++ ... :-)
