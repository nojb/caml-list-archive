Hi,

Jacques, I think that you may know what the problem is with the slow lablgl 
(I hope you know).  My problem is that glxinfo says that I have direct rendering 
enabled and gears.c (not ocaml version) run really fast but the planet.ml 
and tennis.ml run slow. I suspect as Sven Luther suggest that it does not 
use the correct library for accelerated open gl.
I tried ldd on lablgl but it does not use dynamic libraries so maybe I must 
compile lablgl myself and link with some static accelrated library? Right 
know I don't know how to proceed.
I have installed ocaml, labgl from debian woody (no lablgtk+).

Thank you

Peter Rönnquist

lucky you, ...

I have a bi celeron box, and DRI freeze it solid some times, so no luck

Don't know, it worked for me.

notice, if you use lablgtk+ lablgl, you will need to add doublebuffering 
to some examples, as they will not run without it.

Like said, they have a tendency to freeze my box, so i disabled DRI. here 
on my home box, i have not yet finished writing DRI support for my permedia3 
based card.

But my guess is that you are not using the accelerated libraries.

What does glxinfo says to you ? 

Maybe there is a problem with the fact that ocaml is doing static linking,
 and not dynamic linking.

Yes, using a back buffer should improve speed, but also improve fluidity 
of the display.

Hope this help, i think writing to jacques directly about this is more advised 
...

Friendly,
