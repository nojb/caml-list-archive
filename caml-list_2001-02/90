Regarding spams and such, ...

The best idea to have an open list without to much spam is to :

  * limit posting to subscribers only.

  * review posts of non-subscribers, thus limiting spam.

  * Step in if a flamewar errupts, and try to halt it.

This would need a moderator, but would heighten the list troughput, and also lower the work done by the moderator.

BTW, does INRIA not have a mailing list manager or something such ?
