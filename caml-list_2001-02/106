Any volunteers ? Currently I have no time for documentation, sorry.
By the way, we can discuss that on the lablgtk list.

Do not forget that any "external" declaration also amounts to an
Obj.magic, and there are 955 of them in lablgtk.
Seriously, most Obj.magic in lablgtk amount to a cast of an external
after checking its validity, and I see no way to avoid that.
What should disappear after ocaml 3.01 is release is the use of
     external coerce ... = "%identity"
which is an equivalent of Obj.magic used to go around some limitations
of the type system. There are 24 of them, but they will not be needed
anymore thanks to variance annotations in types.
