I don't want to offend, but perhaps you could create a separate list for
consortium topics? By Xavier's own admission, most of the individuals reading
the list will not be targeted as potential members of the consortium, and it
is anyways an important enough topic to deserve its own forum. (Besides, I
assume that at some point consortium members will get their own list in any
case.) Also, it has been generating a considerable amount of traffic of late
which has little to do with Caml programming per se, which I at least regard
as the primary topic for this list...

Of course, this is not to say that I wouldn't still like to see announcements
and updates on any major consortium developments on this list, but I would
like to see the administrative wranglings and bureaucratic details disappear.
