The original Camltk (which is slightly different from labl/tk) is also
used and supported by Jun and me. It is stable and works very well.

As Xavier mentioned (and as the Caml examples at
http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/Examples/oc/camltk demonstrate) Caml/tk
is a must for simple GUIs (with a slightly simpler than MMM way of
abusing of the text widget).

Camltk is maintained up to date: it works also with the 8.3 version of
tcl/tk, including for the Caml Light version of the library.

[Personnal alleluia and auto compliment]
The Caml team's support to Caml users is decidedly incredibly good:
we effectively maintain what we promised to maintain :)

As Sven, I don't use threads for writing GUIs.
