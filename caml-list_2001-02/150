I agree, if the OCaml developers at INRIA disband and no one else picks
up development, commercial software developers who took a chance on this 
research language will be screwed. So we commercial users have a lot of 
incentive to pay.

As an individual OCaml programmer, I have a lot of incentive to see OCaml 
succeed. Companies are made up of individuals, some of whom have been a 
continuous nuisance to their managers to join the Consortium ;-).

Being "orphaned" is my biggest fear wrt Ocaml. So far the open source
moves and the formation of the Consortium have gone a good way towards 
allaying that fear.
