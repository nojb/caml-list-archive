The main problem is that membership to the Consortium generates
paperwork costing more than 50 Euros (which is approximately 50
US$). If INRIA was flexible enough in accepting donations, then it
would be pretty easy to do as you suggest. Unfortunately, for each
amount of money arriving here, there must be an invoice prepared by
INRIA (and possibly a formal contract, but I am not a specialist of
those issues).

I think that for the time being we should try to set up the Consortium
with members supporting it with amounts starting from 2 kE, as stated
in the membership agreement. We already have a few members in the
pipeline, but we clearly need more.
