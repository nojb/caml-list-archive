	I tend to write abbreviated idiomatic script flavoured by

	Static typing today is not strong enough to express the actual
typing, so there is always some compromise/balance between static and
dynamic checking. I find it is difficult to engineer a good balance.
Ideally, I could change that balance easily, however it is even harder
to 'meta-engineer' code so that it is easy to change.

	I'm not sure how: these two declarations are for variant 
components of _distinct_ types.

[Try using variants .. ]

	Thats a good idea .. although I must say that Felix is not (yet)
a 'huge' or  'optimising' compiler :-)
