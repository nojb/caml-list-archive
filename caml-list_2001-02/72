Thank you for your help Jacques, as Sven Luther
mentioned he helped me and pointed me to the developer
packages of tcl and tk.

Now I am trying to get the lablgl examples to run
fast. I get accelrated gl with the c version of gears
(900 fps). But the performance of the planet.ml and
tennis.ml is nowhere near this performance. I guess
that dri must be used by lablgl if it is available. 

Do you get good performance? Maybe the drawing in
these examples are done to the window directly and not
to the "back/offscreen" buffer? Thus the slower
performance?

Best Regards
Peter Rönnquist
