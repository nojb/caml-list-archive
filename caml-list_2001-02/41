I can give you the list of actual Caml list subscribers who are more
or less serious (serious enough to suffer the mail avalanche from the
list!).

I propose to publish it on the list with a trivial encoding algorithm
(to prevent direct usage via some kind of robot). As an exiting
alternative way of publishing this list, I can put it on the Caml Web
site as a binary file obtained via the Objective Caml output_value
facility. This would not be cryptographically bullet proof, but at
least deliciously recursive!

If any of you disagrees with the publication of this list of address,
please let me know it.
