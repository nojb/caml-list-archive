Unison (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison) has a fairly
sophisticated GUI written on top of lablgtk, with help at the beginning
from Jacques Garrigue, who ported it from our Tk version.  We have lots
of users who run it on Windows with no problem.

There have been some annoyances with developing for Windows, but in
general things work fine.
