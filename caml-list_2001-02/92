> What about creating a non-profit association or something such,

To me, this is an excellent idea, but the best would probably be that
someone external to INRIA creates such an association (or a groupment
of such associations). Indeed, it would be a bit strange if INRIA
created an association which would become a member of a Consortium
leaded by INRIA itself. There could be even be several such
associations, as long as each of them is able to gather at least 2
kEuros. (The more members, the better :-)
