Pierre,

I don't think this is a good idea at all. 

One registers to the caml-list either to listen or to participate to the
discussions related to Caml. The implicit contract (in such mailing lists)
between the subscriber and the administrator is that names and addresses are
only used for the purpose of redistribution of messages ---nothing else---
and that this data is kept private. I think we should keep very tightly to
this clear implicit policy.

If we wish to count the number of Ocaml supporters (for whatever reason) it
should be done by some other means. 

More seriously, if you wish to publish a list of names and/or emails, you
should only list those people who explicitly requested to be listed. You
should certainly not, by default, list all those who did not said that they
would not like to be listed: this would be a change of (implicit) contract
without an explicit agreement.

        -Didier.
