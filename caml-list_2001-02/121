OK, you're right, I deserved that :-)

Sure, but it seems to me that even if such things are implemented 
with Obj.magic under the hood we ought to come up with new names and 
eventually move "approved and safe usages" to the Sys module. I am 
probably under the influence of Modula-3 and Ada here...

Cool, but you also write in another message

I think for this problem we need some dynamic typing in the language. It 
seems the Clean and Mercury languages have or will adopt such a solution; 
I don't know about Haskell. This is the same issue as with safe
marshalling right, so we are told that there is some help on the way.

Then ocaml will have to become like something else. It won't be the
first time.
