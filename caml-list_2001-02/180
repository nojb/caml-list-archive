Having been in that world, I agree, if you're doing professional work you
want to pay all the $$ for the full MS developers kit and have Ocaml
working with that.

This is actually where a Consortium is helpful. Maintaining the port is 
actually "engineering effort" (no pejorative intended) and if the
companies making big $$ in that big market kick in the money you can hire
an engineer full time to keep the port going, getting back ends for the 
.NET VM, low level bindings to Windows libraries, etc. Not my interest,
but it's not helping competitors and allows INRIA to use their time to 
help us all.
