There is only one descriptor, and it is shared between the two
channels.  Thus if you close both channels, then the descriptor gets
closed twice.  If it was reopened in-between (for example in a
multithreaded program), then some unrelated part of your program will
have its descriptor closed under its feet.

So you must close the out_channel that was returned by
Unix.open_connection, but not the in_channel; and this is true whether
you called Unix.shutdown_connection or not.


Warning: I have not tested it.
