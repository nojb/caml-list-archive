Let's start with one such associtation, there can be more later one.

I am not familiar with association law, but it seems to me that there is need for various members, maybe a little fee to pay, not sure (well for french associations), and an annual meeting or somethign such.

I am not sure how well the frnech association law handle non-french members, and err, lets call it virtual meetings. 

Maybe someone is familiar with this, or i could ask around.

Friendly,
