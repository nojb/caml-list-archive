This message is for those working on the English 
translation of the O'Reilly Caml book.

When trying to build the book on a RedHat 6.2 Linux box,
I get an error about a missing file aho.caa-ps.  It looks
like this file is supposed to be built from a file aho.caa,
which doesn't exist in the cvs archive.  It also appears 
that there are other files with a .caa extension that are 
missing.

I encountered this error originally with

  fais_le really-all-compil

When that didn't work, I tried the individual steps:

  fais_le images-clean (to clean up image files)
  fais_le images-install (OK)
  fais_le build-ml-tex-files (breaks on missing file aho.caa-ps)

Anyone else having this problem?
