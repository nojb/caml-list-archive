mmm, ...

mlgtk is more easy to use, but maybe a little less complete. go to :

http://cristal.inria.fr/~cuoq/mlgtk.html

to download it.

lablgtk is more complex to understand, at least at first, but is more complex,
and may have more developpment going on right now, and maybe more users.

Both have some example to tell you how it works, and an absolute lacka of
documentation apart the source code (which is easier to read on mlgtk side,
which mostly follows gtk+ for which doc is available).

And i think neither of them are available in binary form for windows, you will
have to compile them yourslef (both should work, i think).
