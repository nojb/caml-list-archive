	As an individual I _do_ care if Ocaml stops,
since I have invested considerable amounts of _my_ time and effort
into it, whereas companies have the resources to amortise risk,
and the 'big boss' didn't invest his money, and will still get
paid his salary.

	I only have one short life, and I have a vested interest
in Ocaml succeeding commercially that is far more important
to me than a small change in profits of some company.
This interest is not merely to obtain money from work,
but also to contribute to better practice, so I can feel
my life is worthwhile.

	Therefore, it would be useful if I could register that
interest, even if my financial contribution is small compared
to a large company: ultimately, Ocaml programs have to be written
by people.

	A Consortium may benefit from having both corporate members
and individuals, for example companies may be able to get more code
more cheaply from a pool of individuals who would be grateful for
_some_ funding for work they might well have done anyhow.
