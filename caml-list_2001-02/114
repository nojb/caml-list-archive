That's false: in a consortium, one pays a fee for one year, and by the end
of that year, there's no more membership, so no more value, and no
investment. A stock exchange wouldn't work in the same way, if one 
had to re-buy its own stocks every year, would it ?

The idea of setting up facilities to create associations able to gather
the required 2K euro or wathever amount looks better and simpler: as soom
as the first one will be released, anybody else would just have to
cut-and-paste its status to create a new one. 

Another solution would
be to fix a minimal annual amount, and to give a representativeness
proportionnal to one's contribution: that way, it wouldn't be necessary to
create more than one association. Moreover, this association would just be
a way to externalise administrative tasks, from the INRIA's point of view.
