The problem that many of the extra code written for Ocaml don't work in the
Windows version was my reason to convert to cygwin. Also, that ocamldebug
works is a real bonus.

Currently it is a big pain trying to compile packages like PXP for windows,
even if you normally succeed after a while.

I don't really know how to solve this problem, but one solution could be to
have more packages precompiled for windows, for example pxp, lablgtk (incl
necessary dlls).....

Until we do that, doing serious developing on a windows platform is hard.

While we are on this topic, some observations (trying to coordinate my
windows based Ocaml development with the rest
of my team (they use Linux, I have a laptop and use Win2000)) that can be
considered feedback:

1. findlib etc dont work on windows, and there is enough of  a difference
between make and nmake that most make scripts break.
That causes a bunch of packages to be difficult to build under windows
(difficult enough to put off novice programmers that
I'm trying to get hooked on Ocaml)
2. I guess 1. stems from dbm not being available on windows. Would it be
difficult to have an interface to Sleepycat's version on windows,
and make that part of the standard distrib?
3. Since fork() doesnt work on windows, I cant use most of the web-server
type stuff written in Ocaml. It would be nice to have
a (medusa,thttpd,zeus) style single threaded web-server based on equeues. It
would also rock -- performance wise (upto a certain
number of users I guess)

Well, since I'm not a professional programmer, I don't
qualify to discuss this. My goal when I wrote this suggestion
was to point out changes that are IMHO good for the future
development of ocaml for windows. (I don't see how to support
dynamic loading of native code without this.)

I think you are right. However, note that Mingw32
doesn't depend on nonstandard dlls, and produces code
that is compatible with msvc.

I was thinking of one standard ocaml dll (something like
"ocamlrun.dll"), that would be shared by all ocaml executables.
Is it really a burden?

It wouldn't be easy, would it?

This point is very important. If you want this, I don't
see how to avoid using the ocaml dll I proposed: you don't
want one gc per dll, do you?

Well, it looks like a lot of work for the Consortium !
