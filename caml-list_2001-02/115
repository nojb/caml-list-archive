Yes but all beginers do the same mistake. May be the toplevel prompt should be
changed to something else (different from #). This would not change our life
but there would be less newcommers asking where is the use, cd, quit and al
function.

On a similar topic, the behaviour of printf that cannot be used in a partial
application should be pointed out more strongly in the manual (red huge bold font)
and more explicitely than the cryptic sentence :

If too few arguments are provided, printing stops just before converting the 
first missing argument. 

Again a student lost a day this week trying to understand why he did not get parts of
his results on the screen. Sure he will not do the mistake again !
 
Another solution would be to eta expand printf functions after it has been typed
This would be externaly cleaner but may be not internaly. But, the code for 
supporting this function in  the compiler is already so bloated anyway.
