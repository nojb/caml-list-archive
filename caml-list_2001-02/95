There are quite a few general web sites about French associations. If
you look for "association loi 1901" at google.com (for non-French
speakers, this means "non-profit", roughly speaking), you'll get at
least one page of very relevant (French) pointers.

As far as I know, members of such an association may come from all
over the world, and are not necessarily individuals. (I mean that a
small company which couldn't afford 2kE to be a member oc the Caml
Consortium could be a member of an association member of the
Consortium.)
