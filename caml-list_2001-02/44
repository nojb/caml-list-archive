Xavier,

Please speculate on the future development direction of graphical support
in OCaml.

Do you anticipate both Tk and GTk being supported?

Do you anticipate GTk support being ultimately more desirable and supported
than Tk?  If so, what are some of the reasons?

To what degree does threading affect the answer?
