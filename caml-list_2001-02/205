What is the recommended way to develop in OCaml on Windows 2000? The Caml 
for Windows terminal is nice, but I am sure there is a better way to develop 
than count the number of characters based on "Characters 17:18, Unbound 
value y"!

Is there an integrated emacs mode (like for Mozart-Oz)? Can I use it to 
track compiler e.g. the old C-x `? Tools to debug? Other suggestions?

Post + email to me would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Doik.

p.s. the language looks great!
