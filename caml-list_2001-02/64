About TK/GTK

I agree with Xavier about TK : very stable, for very simple GUIs, it
has its place in the distribution.

GTK is very powerful and LablGTK makes it easy to build GUIs with GTK,
even complex windows. I find LablGTK stable. And I like the themes :-)
But GTK is so heavy and can sometimes be so slow !

My opinion is that lablgtk should be in the standard OCaml distribution,
since it allows the use of OCaml for the development of
large user-friendly applications : all information needed displayed in 
one place, easy selection and modification of information, 
information representation sticking to the end user's mental pictures,
...
The lack of support for such a modern GUI would be a handicap for 
the use of OCaml in 'window-interactive' applications.

However, I'm not claiming GTK is the best GUI of the world. I
don't even know all GUIs. Anyway, another GUI will soon come to 
replace it, maybe with 3D-virtual-reality-glasses ...
