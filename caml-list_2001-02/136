I don't agree with that. The idea of the Consortium is not for companies
to get their money back: they pay for the warranty that OCaml continues.
If you decide that OCaml has to be used in your company, you may take
some advantages on paying. It is sponsoring, nothing else.

Yes you loose: you loose all the applications that you wrote in OCaml!
Of course, if your idea is not to use OCaml, may I recommend you this:
don't pay.

The Consortium is for companies: for people who make strategic decisions
like using the language. It is not for individuals: as an individual, of
course, you don't care that OCaml stops. But if you are the boss of a big
company and decide to use it, it can be terrible if it no more supported.

If you are a company, the most you decide using OCaml, the most you
have interest to finance the Consortium.
