	I agree. I'm an example.

	Actually, I don't think it is 'functional' programming
that is really so important as the _approach_ to programming,
as exemplified by the Ocaml team.

	Programming involves 'compromises': Ocaml, for example,
isn't a functional programming language: it provides facilities
for functional, procedural and object oriented development.
Thus, referential transparency is lost,
but what the developers have refused to compromise is the 
static type system.

	What is important here, in my opinion, is that the
decisions are not made entirely by guessing, or by consensus,
or by experience, although these factors surely count,
but instead, where possible, decisions are informed and rational: 
based on having done some actual theory.

	It is this basis in theory which, in my opinion,
is the strength of 'functional' languages, rather than
the functional paradigm itself.

	Another example of similar work is the logic programming
language Mercury.
