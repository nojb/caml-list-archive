What about creating a non-profit association or something such, where indiviudal members could apply, and give smaller than 2KE donations, and then they could become 1 member of the consortium.

This would limit the paperwork on part of the consortium, achieve the needed result, but well, would need other kind of paper work to create said association.

Also i don't know anything of international associations law, as well as the possibility to do such without ever meeting in person. I think it has already been done, i read somethign about such a thing somewhere, and then naturally, there is the example of debian.
