Dear Camlers,

It is our pleasure to announce the first distribution of FaCiLe, a
Functional Constraint Library over integer finite domain entirely
written in OCaml 3.00.

It offers all usual constraints systems facilities to create and
manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions and
constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints and
search goals. FaCiLe allows as well to build easily user-defined
constraints and goals (including recursive ones) from scratch or by
combining simple primitives, making pervasive use of OCaml
higher-order functionals to provide a simple and flexible user
interface. FaCiLe efficiency compares well with current commercial
solvers while productivity is boosted by the host language, yielding
substantially more concise, maintainable and safer code.

FaCiLe distribution includes sources, examples and a generic Makefile,
which presently should work on all platforms where the OCaml compiler
can be installed (but has only been tested on Linux/Unix). It is
available with documentation by anonymous FTP at:

	ftp://ftp.recherche.enac.fr/pub/facile

There is also a web site where general information can be found:

	http://www.recherche.enac.fr/opti/facile

Comments, questions and bug reports are welcome and should be sent
to
	mailto:facile@recherche.enac.fr.

Enjoy !
