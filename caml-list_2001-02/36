Sorry it was my fault, I found the problem. I simplified things a 
little bit in the above example. The program as it is works fine. 
But when I was testing the program I made the following:

Thread.start Tk.mainLoop();;

And now the menus don't work any more. What I want to do is start 
a Tk application in it's own thread and  be able to draw to the canvas 
interactively  at the sam time. If I press one the simple buttons the 
application stops, only the menus don't work.
