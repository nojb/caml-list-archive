No, this is not the reason. The problem with findlib (and other packages) is
that there are no shell scripts under Windows. Findlib uses scripts for
configuration, and for the installation of new packages. It is possible to
replace these scripts by O'Caml programs; but it is not a simple task.

Of course, there is a second problem: I neither have a Windows system nor the
VC compiler. (Ok, there is now the cygwin port, but it should be compatible
enough such that findlib works (with little effort), so the cygwin port is not
the problem.)

I would appreciate such a server, too.
