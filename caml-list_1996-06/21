Yet another hack for the Web in Caml:

OVERVIEW:

The V6 Engine is to the Web what pipes are in Unix systems: a
compositional device to combine document processing. To be easily
integrated in the Web architecture, V6 is available as a personal proxy.
Relying on a common skeleton architecture and Web related libraries, V6
can be easily configured to support various sets of filters while remaining
portable and browser independent. The filters may act on the requests
emitted by the browser (or other web client) or on the document returned by
a server, or both.

In the current release (Release 1), the available filters include
  - flexible caching
  - request redirection
  - HTML filtering (based on NoShit)
  - global history
  - on-the-fly full text indexing (requires FFW)

V6 can be used to support many other navigation aids and Web-related
tools in a uniform, browser independent way. In addition, V6 can also be
used as a traditional http server: this is particularly useful to serve
private files without needing access to the site-wide http server, or to
interface to local, private applications (mail, ...) through the CGI
interface.

V6 is written in Objective Caml. This version runs only on Unix platforms.
It has been tested mostly on Linux (1.2.13 ELF), but is known to run
on Alpha OSF1, Solaris, SunOS 4.1.x.
