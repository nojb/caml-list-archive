Yes, the coercion is unsafe and a dynamic check is needed.  As you mention,
this could be implemented with dynamics (values carrying their types) and a
typecase.

Yes, this is a typical  example where such a construction would be
convenient. The  way to solve it now is to declare a data type with one
constructor for each different kind of objet that you want to retreive
from the collection (as you would do in ML without objects).

Yes, it is. However, dynamics and typecase complicate the language, its
semantics, and its implementation; so, we preferred not to include them.
