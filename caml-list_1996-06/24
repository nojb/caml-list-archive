Actually, the graphics windows is only available under the interactive
toplevel application. Batch-compiled programs, with or without the
-custom option, cannot use it.

Now that Tk is available for Windows, it's conceivable that CamlTk
could be ported to Windows. However, we at INRIA have almost no
manpower to develop for Windows, so we'll have to wait until someone
volunteers to do the Windows port of CamlTk.

Definitely yes. Objective Caml for Windows is a 100% Win32 application
(no MSDOS code inside), so it has full access to the Win32 API through
the C interface.
