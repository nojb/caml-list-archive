Subject: CaML tk lib. under Windows FAQ?
Sender: weis
Status: O


Probably an FAQ... what is the status of the CaML Tk library
with regard to the Win-32 port of Object-CaML?

- Are the plans for it be ported 'eventually' as part of the official
distirbution?

- Has anyone attempted/begun a port (the latest iteration of tcl/tk for WIn-32
is reputed to be pretty stable so it seems an obvious thing to try)?
