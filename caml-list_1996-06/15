What alternatives are available to implement graphical interfaces on
Ocaml programs?  If I understand the user manual correctly, the builtin
graphics library allows only one window open at any time.  Moreover,
the graphics module under Windows seems to be incompatible with the
-custom option.  Camltk would be an obvious choice for Unix, but what
about those users who for some reason want run the same programs under
Windows 95?  Obviously I could write a wrapper for C functions in the
Windows library (or can I?), at the cost of portability.  Is there a
better approach?
