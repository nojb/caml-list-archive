Release 1.01 of Objective Caml is now available.
This is a bug-fix release that corrects the main problems
reported with 1.00. The main changes are:

* Object-oriented extensions:
    instance variables can now be omitted in class types;
    some error messages have been made clearer;
    several bugs fixes.

* Typing: better report of type incompatibilities; 
  non-generalizable type variables in a struct...end no longer flagged
  immediately as an error;
  name clashes during "open" avoided.

* Fixed bug in output_value where identical data structures
  could have different external representations; this bug caused wrong
  "inconsistent assumptions" errors when checking compatibility of
  interfaces at link-time.

* Standard library: fixed bug in Array.blit on overlapping array sections.

* Unmarshaling from strings now working.

* ocamlc, ocamlopt: new flags -intf and -impl to force compilation as
  an implementation/an interface, regardless of file extension;
  overflow bug on wide-range integer pattern-matchings fixed.

* ocamlc: fixed bytecode generation bug causing problems with compilation
  units defining more than 256 values

* ocamlopt, all platforms:
  fixed GC bug in "let rec" over data structures;
  link startup file first, fixes "undefined symbol" errors with some
  libraries.

* ocamlopt, Intel x86:
  more efficient calling sequence for calling C functions;
  floating-point wars, chapter 5: don't use float stack for holding
  float pseudo-registers, stack-allocating them is just as efficient.

* ocamlopt, Alpha and Intel x86: more compact calling sequence for garbage
  collection.

* ocamllex: generated automata no longer use callbacks for refilling
  the input buffer (works better with threads); character literals
  correctly skipped inside actions.

* ocamldep: "-I" directories now searched in the right order

* Thread library: incompatibilities with callbacks, signals, and
  dynamic linking removed; scheduling bug with Thread.wait fixed.

* New "dbm" library, interfaces with NDBM.
