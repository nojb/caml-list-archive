the :> operator make possible to coerce an expression from a type t1 to a
super type t (this coercion is safe), but how to go from t to t1 ???
(ok, a dynamic check is need, this operation can raise an exception)

When one use collections of object, this kind of feature is useful. isn't it ?

I first believed that using pattern like (x : t1) -> can do the job,
(a kind of typecase construction as it is the case in modula 3).

is it possible ???
