  80086 [main] ocaml 1604 stackdump: Dumping stack trace to
ocamlrun.exe.stackdump
bash: [1516: 1] tcsetattr: Not a character device

data$ ocaml.exe
        Objective Caml version 3.01

# fdas

Hi,

I guess I went too fast sending my message yesterday. I had rebuilt a
cvs Ocaml on a couple months old cygwin and it did not work. Then I
got a new cygwin and it still did not work. This morning I rebuilt
Ocaml on the new cygwin and it does work.
