Thanks, it is Perl that allows multiple adjacent underlines in a numeric
literal. I was wondering why I had thought that Ada allowed that. While
I've never felt the desire to use underlines as anything other than comma 
replacements in a numeric literal, if this were going to be added to OCaml
I see no reason not to go with the Perl approach. 

Perl is certainly ugly, and even worse the Perlers stole our mascot. 
However, that shouldn't prejudice us against this feature. Even a broken
clock is right twice a day. :-)
