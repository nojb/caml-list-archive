Does someone out there have an out-of-the box solution for adding composition and an equivalent for Haskell's $ operator to OCaml?

I've been using let (<<) f g x = f (g x) for composition, but an equivalent for the $ operator eludes me, as it needs to be right associative and of low precedence.  Maybe someone with some Haskell envy has figured something out using camlp4?
