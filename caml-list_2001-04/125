I agree with your conclusions, however you're perhaps slightly too
harsh with MLj: for developing applet-sized programs, for instance,
the limitations of MLj (whole-program compilation, size limitations)
are acceptable.

François Rouaix hacked together a Caml plugin for Netscape a few years
ago.  It sort of worked (under Unix and with Caml actually running in
a different process and communicating over a pipe), but he sort of
lost interest in it.  I have doubts on the cleanliness and stability
of the Netscape plugin API :-)  Also, the same technical tricks might
not work under Windows...

At any rate, I believe Web applets are a totally uninteresting
application area.  Most Web designers seem happy with JavaScript
hacks, and in many years of intense Web surfing, I came across an
interesting Java applet only once (Certicom's excellent tutorial on
elliptic curve cryptography).

Because I'm lazy.  And it's a somehow more subtle change than you think.  
(The patch you mention misses a number of issues.)
