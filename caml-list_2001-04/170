For simplicity, this would require that polymorphic variant
constructors obey to the rule `UIDENT (meaning that a polymorphic
variant constructors must start with an upper case letter). Otherwise
we would depend on the ``longest match'' rule or careful use of
spaces, as exemplify by:

        Objective Caml version 3.01

# (fun _ _ -> 1) `poi`gee;;
- : int = 1

On the other hand, the new infix identifiers would start by a lower
case letter (as usual value identifiers).

As soon as those simple problems have been checked and resolved, I
think this notation is a reasonable way to have infix identifiers in
the spirit of the current syntax, i.e. with no infix declarations,
just based on lexical analysis.

Hope this helps,
