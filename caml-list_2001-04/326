Oops, you're right of course. Given that there seems to be no solution, I
guess a little extra parenthesization is your only "pure OCaml option" option. 

I've only seen the $ used heavily in code that uses the do notation, where 
OCaml might use (gasp!) imperative code with ;, so I've never been tempted 
to write a syntax extension for this.
