If you are going to make new versions of the standard libraries, it's a
good moment for doing some unifications of these libraries:

for example will be good if all "collection" modules (List,Array,
String, Map, Set, Hashtbl) will have similar sets of functions:

for examples - fold's, map's, etc in String,
iteri, mapi, foldi in String, Array, Map, Set etc.

or, for example, types 'a List.t, 'a Array.t for simplifing of usage
Array and List as parameters for functors. etc.


or include functions print:
String.print 
Char.print 
...

instead of print_string etc.

String.compare: string -> string -> int
Char.compare: char -> char -> int
etc.

And many others changes of the same kind.

Anton
