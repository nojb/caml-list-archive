How do you do subtypes in Ocaml? I'm writing a parser in which I want
literals to be treated as expressions, but I also want to be able to treat
them as literals in other contexts; ie, I need to be able to ensure that
I'm being passed a literal at one point (for case statements), but I don't
want to have to treat literals specially when they're being used somewhere
in which a normal expression is allowable.

This may be a stupid question, but I can't find an answer I can understand
in the docs.
