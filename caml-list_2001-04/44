I must admit to being a tiny bit lost in this labling discussion since I'm relatively new at caml and don't understand all the implications that people are talking about, but it appears people are now discussing enforcing typing labels even on labled non-optional parameters?  Documentation has been cited as a reason.  I would simply note that trying to force people to document their code simply doesn't work that well in practice.  However, forcing people to be verbose in spite of themselves does tend to amount to a mess.

I find OCaml pretty wordy as it is (no overloading being a big problem here, since the types all float into the names, as someone said), and making it moreso seems to me to be a mistake.  I also feel (like Patrick) that there are more important things (overloading, module recursion, generics) that need fixing than labeling right now.

However, I've only written maybe a 1000 lines so far, so we'll see how I feel when I've written more.
