The BNF is ambigous (as most grammars). So you can't say which is the right way
to set the parentheses:

(if false then print_int 2); print_int 3   -- OR
if false then (print_int 2; print_int 3)

Both ways are correct if you only look at the grammar. However, in the O'Caml
manual there is a precedence table (section 6.7) determining that "if" has
higher precedence than ";". So the first way is what the compiler interprets.

In the precedence table "match" has lower precedence than ";".

You can use begin ... end (or (...) which is the same) everywhere in
expressions. But I don't recommend it because it makes code unreadable which is
another cause for errors.

I personally have no problems with "if" because it is in the same style as in
the first structured programming language I've learned (Pascal).

If you have problems I would recommend to use Emacs as editor with one of the
two O'Caml modes. It automatically indents the code, so you see:

if false then print_int 2;
print_int 3

and _not_

if false then print_int 2;
  print_int 3

which would mean that you did it wrong.
