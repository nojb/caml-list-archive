Dear Camlers,

This is the announce of the first release of ActiveDvi, a DVI 
previewer/presenter written in O'Caml, with some eye candy effects for
your cool conference talks.

It features the normal DVI preview and the followings:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion (using graphics package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

       Using mldvi.sty included in the source package, you can embed
       these effects in your TeX files easily.

The source code and information are available at 
    http://pauillac.inria.fr/activedvi/

Contributions and comments are welcome.
