I don't know if you've considered it before, but one idea I've toyed with
is an ocamlbrowser that looks and feels like a SmallTalk browser. The way
smalltalk browsers can be set up seems to fit Benjamin's requirements (as
well as my own).

Is there anyone else interested in a browser with a smalltalk-style
layout?

PS
  Sorry my previous email replying about using Unix in toplevel didn't
answer the original question... someone else did so correctly though.
