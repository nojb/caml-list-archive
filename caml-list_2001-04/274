Hi,

I occasionally have a problem with the toplevel running in Emacs (20.4.1, Tuareg mode) under 
Windows NT. When I use modules like
 
module Mymod = 
struct
	....
end;;

place the cursor at "end;;" and type C-E the toplevel hangs and Emacs doesn't
react any more until I shut down the toplevel in the Windows Task Manager. This happens
not with every "module end;;" construct but I already had some of this situations. When I read
the file with the "module end;;" construct with "#use "file.ml" then it works. Did anybody have 
similar experiences and is there any way around?
