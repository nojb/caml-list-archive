I agree with Fergus on this. Clearly one can make a mess with overloading, 
but used with good taste it really makes programs better. I've always
found it interesting that fans of type inference tell us how great it is
not to be burdened with writing out explicit type information (which many 
programmers would consider helpful documentation) only to be left sticking
it onto function names. Labels help us a bit here (thanks Jacques!) but 
a little bit of overloading really helps.  

In C++, well, .... I agree that the combination of implicit conversions
and overloading is a disaster.

Well, Jean Ichbiah and his Green team put it in so I imagine they thought
it could be used to write more maintainable code. Anyways, the AQS doesn't 
ban overloading but states the obvious

     Limit overloading to widely used subprograms that perform similar
     actions on arguments of different types (Nissen and Wallis 1984). 

and other obvious rules of thumb.

See "In Defense of the Use Clause" by Jean-Pierre Rosen at

That's really not an appropriate way to argue, now is it?
