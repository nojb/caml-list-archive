I'm writing some bindings to zlib (compression library) and was wondering
how the garbage collector would work with threading.

The zlib library needs two buffers, one to get data from, and one to put
data in.  Is it safe to pass the result of String_val(x) into a C routine?
If I have threads running, could the garbage collector run while my C
routine is running?

Thanks,
Dave Brown
