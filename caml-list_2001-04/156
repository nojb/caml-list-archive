I think it would be nicer to keep the labels in the standard library,
but allow the omission of explicit labels in calls (at least in cases
where this is unambiguous), as in the current "classic" mode.
Then those who wish to can use labels, and those who don't wish to
don't have to.

You could also have a "style-checking" compiler option to require labels
in calls if the function is defined with labels.  But unlike the current
"-labels" option, this option should just restrict you to a subset of
the language; it should not permit any programs that are not permitted
with the default options.

One problem with this approach is that it leads to mixing of different
styles, since any given piece of code may contain calls to several
different libraries, and with your proposed approach the style used
in the caller is determined by how the callee is written.


[Note: I haven't actually written any non-trivial OCaml programs.
This is just my opinion based on experience with other languages.]
