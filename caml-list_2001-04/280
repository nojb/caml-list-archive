That is the reason I stopped using tuareg.

I really like tuareg, but it hanged my emacs too often.

I tried to understand what went wrong but failed. I think that Windows is
the problem, since the creator of tuareg never gets it.

I use Windows 2000. Are there people out there using tuareg on Windows?

Subject: [Caml-list] toplevel is hanging


Hi,

I occasionally have a problem with the toplevel running in Emacs (20.4.1,
Tuareg mode) under
Windows NT. When I use modules like

module Mymod =
struct
	....
end;;

place the cursor at "end;;" and type C-E the toplevel hangs and Emacs
doesn't
react any more until I shut down the toplevel in the Windows Task Manager.
This happens
not with every "module end;;" construct but I already had some of this
situations. When I read
the file with the "module end;;" construct with "#use "file.ml" then it
works. Did anybody have
similar experiences and is there any way around?
