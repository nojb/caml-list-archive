I also get it, essentially the toplevel always crashed when you
get some kind of type-error or undefined. Note below that the
function 'g' isn't defined.

I run the latest cygwin (since it is so easy to update, just run
setup.exe again and it updates the necessary parts).

I didn't get that kind of behaviour using the pre 3.01 cygwin-versions.
Maybe the error isn't that you need the latest cygwin,
but the same cygwin that was used to build ocaml. (I used the
binary installs.)

You could try to download the source and recompile it locally.

Hi Alan,

thanks  for your reply. The toplevel also chrashes when I use it directly.
I downloaded and installed the latest  cygwin version. But the toplevel
still chrashes when using an undefined symbol.
