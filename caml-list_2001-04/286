I was not aware of CamlIDL, or even of IDL itself until just now.  The
major difference I can see from a quick look at the docs is that the
IDL system converts ML data structures into C data structures and back
again for every function invocation.  Mine simply allocates a string
of the appropriate size for each structure and leaves it in there.
