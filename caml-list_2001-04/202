I guess like many people reading this list, I'm very tired with this
thread. I definitely vote for this choice: when a function as been
defined with labels, it has to be called with labelled arguments. Does
it solve all incompatibility problems between classic and label mode ?
If yes, I vote twice!

I see a strong analogy between unlabelled/labelled arguments of
functions and tuples/records types: both are defining product types,
records are usually useful when there are a large numbers of
components, and when you do not want to remember the order of
them. And moreover the { r with ... } construct allows some kind of
default values in records. But could we imagine any useful application
to a record-like type where a record contains both labelled and
non-labelled fields?  I don't think so.
