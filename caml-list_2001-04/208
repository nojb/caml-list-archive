	Neither do I. But I've been a member of a Standards committee
for a long time, as has Fergus Henderson, and I'm sure he'd agree
that the practical experience is that further quirks and anomalies
usually emerge even after the best effort to finalise the design
of both a language and it's libraries. I added 'step 4' to the
list to account for this. :-)

	In fact, because of the very strong support for theory
and mathematics, the merger may be satisfactory after step 4,
rather than 5, 6, 7, or perhaps never :-)
