Yes! Any graph! This is something I so much miss in Ocamlbrowser that I've almost
started putting it in several times already. Fortunately, I respect too much J.
Garrigue's work to mess with his code (or theory) and I have abandoned the project.

My own style of coding relies too much in piecewise construction of signatures and
modules and I would like to navigate the graph enormously... I can't help with
coding it, but I promise to make a thorough test of it if anybody obliges!

BTW I use ocamlbrowser very much indeed. Thanks Mr. Garrigue.
