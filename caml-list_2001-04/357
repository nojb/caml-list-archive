Hello,

may I ask, which literate programming tool INRIA uses for extracting
documentation from their OCaml-sources (e.g. library documentation)? I
think it would be nice if users could also benefit from this tool and
provide some kind of "standard documentation" for their work.

I know that there is "ocamlweb", but it would still be interesting to
see how you go about documenting things...

Best regards,
Markus Mottl
