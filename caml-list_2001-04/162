	I beg to differ. The current status is the result
of an incomplete merger of two communities, who have agreed
to use a common tool (ocaml with two modes) to unify the
ocaml development environment and provide a vehicle for
experiments leading to further unification of the language.

	The next step is surely to further unify our efforts,
by eliminating the duality in the languages that shared tool
processes. It is OK, IMHO, to introduce a duality in 
the libraries to do this. Now the theoreticians and implementors
can focus their attention better.

	The next step is to eliminate the duality in the libraries.
This will probably require some cleanups in the core language,
as well as some willingness for users to migrate.

	It is likely there will be a further cleanup.
So we have done step 1 of a four (4) step process.

	I've always thought finishing a job was a sensible
high priority.
