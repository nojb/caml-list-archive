Ah, thanks.  I have a strange talent for breaking things, I've found over the years.  The first thing I try never works.  I'd make a good tester.  :)

Why is this?  I can think of a few reasonable arguments:

- if you want speed you'll compile to native
- bytecode is for size, and inlining hoses this
- you tested it on real-size apps and found cache coherency made non-inlines faster
- it's hard for some reason I don't understand
- haven't gotten around to it yet
- ???
