Subject: [Caml-list] any way to "clear" the toplevel?
Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk


I'm working on a multimodule project, and I use the toplevel a lot.  I
have my makefile output a file from the list of bytecode objects
(the file's named "top") which looks like this:

#load "math2d.cmo";;
#load "pointers.cmo";;
#load "ccd.cmo";;
#load "armparse.cmo";;

Then, when I load the toplevel, I type #use "top";; and voila, my
project's in the toplevel.  When I edit the main file and exec it in
the toplevel, it uses the modules above just fine.

The problem is, if I edit any of the files loaded, and then try to
#use "top";; again, I get 

File armparse.cmo is not up-to-date with respect to interface Armparse

And my new stuff doesn't load.  Is there anything I can do about this?
The optimal solution would be to be able to flush a specific interface
and reload it (I tried #load "foo.cmi";; but it errors), but it'd be
acceptable to simply reinit the toplevel as well.   I currently have
to kill the process and start it over.

Am I missing something?

Chris
