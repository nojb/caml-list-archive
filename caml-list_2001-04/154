I think your analysis is correct here.
Note that I indeed started this discussion because the classic mode
had a theoretical problem: maintaining two modes with their technical
subtleties can become cumbersome.

Also, there is some room left to make the label mode more
user-friendly, like allowing you to omit labels in some unambiguous
cases.

Well, after listening to reactions, I think this next step first means
reducing the number of duplicated labelized libraries, by admitting
that we don't need labels in all libraries: Objective Label tried to
offer a unified view with labels everywhere, but this is not practical
with OCaml.  In particular, traditional OCaml users are not willing to
migrate.

Then, further integration will only happen by natural adaptation:
the standard library will stay without labels, but outside of that
people choose the library whose design they like, be it with or
without labels.  This is no longer a problem of being in one or the
other community.

I'm not sure I follow you here: step 2 is clean-up of the semantics,
step 3 is partial clean-up of the libraries (the remaining part being
really a problem of taste). I do not see what is left to clean-up
then: user libraries are designed by user themselves, we cannot edict
design directives for them.

Anyway, I agree with you: it may be time to do some clean up after the
merger, and this would improve the usability of the language.

Cheers,

Jacques Garrigue
