So far, I understand.

I do not understand much of this sentence. 
Moreover, I am a bit worried by  the use of the words I've emphasized.

Since these two points are the same, that is, provide alternative labeled
versions of some functions, could they be solved in the same way (introduce
a prime version of module M v.s. introduction primed definitions of
identifier f), so as to avoid dupplicating conventions.

Also, before you chose names for the primed modules, can you find a uniform
convention (c.f. Stdlabels and Lunix that you keep using in examples).  Or,
could these modules have the same name but be defined in a subdirectory of
the stdlib?

Cheers,

        Didier
