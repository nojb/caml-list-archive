Hello,

When I tried to install OCaml 3.01 native Win32 port, it complained
that there was no hard disk drive with 300K bytes or more space left.
On the system, the only hard disk drive has 40G bytes space.  Is this
a known bug?

I guess the archive extracter has problem with checking disk space
when available space is more than 4G bytes (2^32 bytes), but I have
not tested it closely.

If archive format is well-known one (such as zip), possibly I can
extract the files directly (not by executing it), but I could not find
out what format it is in.

I downloaded the port from:
    ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/ocaml-3.01-win.exe

I tried this under Windows 2000 as a Power User (not as
Administrator).  Cygwin is not installed.

Any suggestion is welcome.  Thank you.

ITO Tsuyoshi  <tsuyoshi@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp>
