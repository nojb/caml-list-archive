I am fairly new to ocaml - have looked at it a few months ago and now
I want to write a program for a researcher.  The program will analyse
a lot of data.  I will be developing the program on Linux and most of
the users will be Windows users.

On Linux, I would use postgresql as the database backend but
postgresql would not run on all the windows systems.  What are the
alternatives when using ocaml to write this program with?  

Johann
