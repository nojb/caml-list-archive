Hi,
    In response to the recent query about string libraries I took my own
advice and ported the Mosml substring library to OCaml. This exercise
raised a question which I've had before but never seen asked or answered, 
namely, why doesn't OCaml use something like SML's order datatype
GREATER | EQUAL | LESS for comparison rather than an integer? It seems
against the spirit of static typing. What's the rationale? Efficiency? 
Hysterical raisins? 

    Another unrelated trifling question concerns the syntax of numerical 
literals. Would it be possible to allow a la Ada the insertion of _s in 
a numerical literal so instead of 1000000,10000000,and 100000000 we could 
write 1_000_000, 10_000_000, 100_000_000? Of course, as in Ada, you could 
allow wrongly positioned or superfluous _s (1_00_00_______0) but I think 
this trivial change can make reading numbers a bit nicer.
