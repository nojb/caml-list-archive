I'd like to stress a simple user's viewpoint regarding the 
evolutions of Ocaml, namely to try to Keep It Simple, Sirs. Please.

We've been using ocaml since 1995 since it enables us to 
achieves a fairly good balance of clean and efficient code: 
modular, reusable, type checked. 

(Btw, many thanks to the excellent job done by Xavier and his team !)

With all its new features, we would love to see the learning curve 
and verbosity be kept at a reasonable level. Although Ocaml includes 
advanced features such as lazy structures, classes, labels, stream 
parsers, parameterized modules, to name a few, these are not of 
mandatory use when learning the core language. 

Please to not repell future Ocaml users with mandatory features 
that may be difficult to grasp to newcomers. (We do not all work at
Inria)

As a research language, Ocaml will evolve, but thank you again for
taking 
into account users with various skill levels, and for resisting to the 
need to add things.
