Yes, but you want both.  You link the .cmos (or .cmas) in, but you also need a path to their .cmi files, which is what the include dirs are for.  It might be nice if there was some way to also have the .cmi files onboard with the toplevel (or in libraries), so it was just all there with no need for other stuff.  I'm not going to implement that, though.  ;)
