Arrghhh, the Ada syntax allows arbitrary placement but no additional _s,
let this serve as an example to those who don't go right for the formal
syntax :-(. Here's the relevant part

based_numeral ::=
        extended_digit {[underline] extended_digit}

extended_digit ::= digit | A | B | C | D | E | F

I was reminded of this feature of Ada when I was hacking some (OCaml, not
Ada!) config files and I had to look carefully at a params to make sure I
got the number of zeroes right.
