Discussions about syntax generally degenerate into quarrels because it
is often a question of taste and find a consensus is extremely hard.
Adopting it as "standard one" is then not possible. And there is too
much code written in OCaml by all users.

I wrote this "revised" syntax but I don't think that many people use
it. I have no idea of the number, but probably very few. Except me, I
just know two persons, one of them already not agreeing one of my
choices. I agree to improve this syntax, to change things (I mean in
the Camlp4 distribution), but only if there are more than 3 persons
interested.

Well, everybody can make his own syntax, e.g. starting from the file
treating the normal syntax (etc/pa_o.ml) or the file of the revised
syntax (meta/pa_r.ml). This revised syntax, even dating from several
years, is just an experiment. I would have liked that people
experiment other possible syntaxes, but it seems that it is not a
subject interesting many people.

Less than genealogy, in any case...
