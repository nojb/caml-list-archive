I agree with this.  I'd be happy with MLj-level functionality for what I want to do.  I wonder how hard it would be to use their work for ocaml.  Is this something that would be good to handle at the C-- level, or are there no types down there so it wouldn't work since the JVM wants types?  I'm not very familiar with C--...are people using it?  It seems like the asmcomp files do something with it, but they don't emit intermediate code as much as intermediate datastructures.  Do they match C-- and it's not emited as a file to save time?

Really?  I find tons of cool applets that are used for teaching small concepts, everything from sorting to solving PDEs.  I think of them as interactive illustrations in papers, not as full fledged applications.
