You could use MySQL on Windows, and access your database through the MySQL ODBC
driver (with MyODBC).
See http://www.mysql.com for MySQL 
and (for example) http://maxence.guesdon.free.fr for the OCamlODBC library.

I never tried MySQL nor OCamlODBC on Windows so let me know if you manage to use
it. I may help you if you encounter some problems.
