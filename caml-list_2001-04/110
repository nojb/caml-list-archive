(sorry, this post may be slightly off-topic)

It seems than a few OCaml users have considered various approaches for
running Caml programs on the Java VM. Has there been some attempt to do
it the other way round, that is to run Java on the OCaml runtime system ?

It could be with the full OCaml VM, or maybe more realistically, with a
specialized VM using only the OCaml memory model (GC and block layout)
and thread scheduling. Would it be difficult to implement (in C for
instance) a Java VM on top of the OCaml runtime system ?
