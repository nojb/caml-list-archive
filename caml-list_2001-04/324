Right, but since I just have my makefile output a "top" file that looks like this now:

#init;;
#load "blah.cmo";;
...

It just works for me.  Restarting the toplevel inside emacs was a big pain, not to mention that doing it too many times on Win98 would crash the OS :).  I just have to #use "top";; whenever I change a library.  It's not too bad...the 80/20 rule applies here.  :)

I'm really getting into the toplevel for development.  We'll see how that opinion evolves as my project gets bigger.
