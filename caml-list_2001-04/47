Ok. My reaction is mainly motivated by the fact that
1) I would like to have only one mode eventually (*)
2) I am ready to make a little effort on my side to achieve this

Now, I agree I should try a bit more labels before arguing in favor of
them :-) However, I just converted one 2kloc program I am working on in
a few minutes.

I did not switch to labels before just because
1) it was not the default mode and I am quite lazy
2) I have bad manners (I mean, I do not use labels) and my mother (I
mean the classic mode) did not forbid me to keep them

As a result I used labels once in the code I just converted when
defining a function, but never but never used them when calling any
function. I guess the same is true for other users.

Ok, I am switching to -modern... After all, maybe the only change you
have to make for the moment to encourage people to use labels is to make
-modern the default mode and give a pragma for switching to classic
mode/to modern mode (in addition to the command-line flags).

Judicaël.

(*) I tried once to do some copy-paste from a code I found in labltk
examples into some of my code and had to switch to modern mode to use it
(making it compile in classic mode was a nightmare). Fortunately, my
code was quite simple so that the switch was easy...
