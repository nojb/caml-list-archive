Like Jean-Christophe Filliatre and Josh Guttman, I'm one of the "silent
majority" who are happy with conventional CAML syntax and have no
inclination to use labels. I can well imagine that labels might provide
valuable documentation in certain situations, but I put more value on the
directness and mathematical elegance of the traditional functional style.

I'm all in favour of OCaml being an exciting vehicle for new programming
language research. This may be partly responsible for its present vitality.
But it's important to remember that some of us were attracted to CAML by
its conceptual simplicity and its efficient and economical implementation,
rather than by any exotic experimental features. So I fully support
Xavier's policy of keeping extensions like labels out of the "core"
language.

Cheers,

John.
