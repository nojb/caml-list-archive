I would vote for this one.

The problem with this one is that if you choose to use labels, nothing
(at least for the moment) prevents you to write code in an inconsistent
style (putting labels at some places and forgetting them at some
others).

I can not really assess if this solution is good. However, it sounds to
me like a hack. I am rather suspicious of hack, be they clever as long
as they are not proven harmless (through a metatheoretical study). What
are the chances then that we experience bad behaviours of this hack
because of a lack of good theoretical properties?

Judicaël.
