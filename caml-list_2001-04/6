Hi,



I am in the situation where I would like to write an Ocaml program which
makes use of some C++ classes. It seems to me some people had said there
were some problems doing so, but I can't recall what these problems may
be, and didn't find anything precise in the ML archive.

So, I would like to know what may prevent me to reuse C++ code from
Ocaml, if anything may. I am sure some arrangements can be done, as
there exists an Ocaml implementation on BeOS, which is programmed in
C++. 

Moreover, if it is possible, what do you advise me to do? What are the
limitations? Have you got simple examples of such interfacings?


Thanks in advance,

dc



PS: BTW, I would like to thank these happy volunteers who aim at
packaging a Caml Development Kit. IMO, this is truly a good idea, which
may help Caml spread. Just a question to the Caml team: I would like to
know if you intend to include polymorphic I/O and some kind of
overloading in a forthcoming release of Caml. It seems to me Pierre had
written some mails about this, but is is now a long time ago, how is the
situation today?
