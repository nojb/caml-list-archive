Is there any way to transfer the -I directives from the ocamlmktop command
to the toplevel system that is created?

For example:

  ocamlmktop -I dir1 -I dir2 -o mytoplevel foo.cmo bar.cmo 

Then

  ./mytoplevel

would produce the same behavior as this does currently:

  ./mytoplevel -I dir1 -I dir2

Alternatively, it would be really nice to make stand-alone byte code
interpreters which have the .cmo files builtin.

Any ideas?

Patrick
