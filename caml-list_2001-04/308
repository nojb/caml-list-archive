The easiest thing is to look at Stefan's sml mode and port the code to
Tuareg. If you just want Tuareg to use temporary files, it's pretty
easy. Sml-mode adds some bells and whistles to that (mostly concerning
error handling), which are a bit less trivial to port.

I did that for an enhanced version of the "standard" Caml mode (Leroy,
Zimmerman and Garrigue's one) which is lying, half finished, somewhere
on my harddisk. I'll try to put it in a releasable state soon, if I
can find some time.

Michel.
