You should be warned that that doesn't mix nicely with CamlP4's quotation 
syntax.

Maybe <->? Let's test it

# let ( <-> ) f x = f x;;
val ( <-> ) : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b = <fun>
# (fun x -> x + 1) <-> (5 / 2) + 3;;
- : int = 6
# (fun x -> x + 1) <-> (5 / 2) * 3;;
- : int = 7

I admit I have a little Haskell envy (type classes and the `infix` syntax :), 
but I can probably live with some parentheses ...
