	I believe the other motivations are: to improve on documentation
	(consistent naming policy is often not enough since it's tough to
	enforce it in a consistent and yet readable way) to ease a
	process of learning of a third party code and, first of all, to
	have a tool helping to identify/create some sort of modular
	structures within a given image.

	To elaborate a bit on the last point:
	As far as I know, inheritance is often being overused - resulting
	in some artificial relashionships, which create some delivery
	problems: how does one reduce the image size without removing
	one class or one method too many? This is often a lengthy
	post-mortem exercise - even though Smalltalk has variety of
	excellent tools to help with such tasks.
