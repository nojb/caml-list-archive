Zoltan Somogyi and Thomas Conway, who have been implementing a new
profiler for Mercury, have been using this technique.  The code is not
officially released, and at this point I suspect it is very much a
prototype, and probably not well documented, but it is available from
the Mercury CVS repository (on the `deep2' branch; the code for the CGI
interface is in the `deep' directory).  I saw a public demo that Tom
gave here at the University of Melbourne about a month ago.
