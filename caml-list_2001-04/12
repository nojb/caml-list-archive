I'm not 100% sure, but I think the following suffices for building
OCaml under Cygwin and using it:
  - gcc, gas, ld, the C library, bash
  - fileutils, make, sed, awk.

For running the Cygwin binaries we distribute, I think the components
on the first line suffice.  However, we've been told about potential
problems with these binaries, maybe due to different Cygwin versions
between the build machine and the users' machines.
