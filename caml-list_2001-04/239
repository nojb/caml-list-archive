I support this suggestion. The standard equality/ordering/hashing
functions are often adequate for most of the data structures, and it would
be useful to use them and just place a hook on specific types to provide
specialized implementation. It could almost be done with
the "custom" block tag; the problem is that such blocks are not garbage
collected.  What about "custom Caml blocks" ?
