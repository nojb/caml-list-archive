Curiousity impels me to ask: How does David's system compare with CamlIDL?
Is there a need for an FFI interface at a lower-level than CamlIDL?  I'm
interested because I've worked on FFIs for ML in the past, and we gradually
moved more and more towards IDL-based solutions.  So I'd be interested to
hear what limitations people see with this approach (or with the particular
CamlIDL implementation, as I hope to use that some day).

Dave.

I think that an *easy* FFI (you call it "out of the box") is one of the
most important stuff to do for Ocaml. Most of us know that there aren't
any *impossibilities* (more or less anything *can* be done, but you have
to use exactly the correct macros etc...), but its not .... yes, say
"out of the box".
