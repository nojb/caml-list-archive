No David, please, please put further release information onto this
mailing list.
Be sure that there *are* people who follow this work with *big*
interest. :-)
I think that an *easy* FFI (you call it "out of the box") is one of the
most important stuff to do for Ocaml. Most of us know that there aren't
any *impossibilities* (more or less anything *can* be done, but you have
to use exactly the correct macros etc...), but its not .... yes, say
"out of the box".

You should also, I think, consider a "submission" to Gerd Stolpmann's
OCaml link list.

So again, keep us please informed about *any* new release of your FFI
work.

last but least (no flame here): please don't *force* us to use labels....!
