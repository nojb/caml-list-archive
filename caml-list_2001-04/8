I think cvsweb is a good example.

I'm sitting here in New Zealand on a 56k modem, doing development 
work on Gwydion Dylan, with the cvs server being in Germany.  If I 
want to see, say, the change log for the CREDITS file then I have two 
choices.  I can type [1]...

   cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@berlin.ccc.de:/home/cvsroot log src/CREDITS

... which takes just over five seconds to fetch the results, or I can 
enter into my browser the URL...

   http://www.ccc.de/cgi-bin/cvsweb/gd/src/CREDITS

...which takes about two seconds, is prettier, and is more functional 
in that I am then only a click (and two more seconds) away from 
seeing the source of any version I want, doing diffs between 
versions, getting source annotated with who last changed each line 
etc.

It's just not obvious that HTML is slower than the alternatives.

[1] no, of course I don't type all that -- I'm more likely to hit 
"C-x v l" in emacs (because Eric Raymond taught emacs how to do 
that), and emacs could equally easily be taught how to fire up a 
Netscape window with the cvsweb page. (actually, I taught MPW Shell 
to do that for me, because I know how to customize it better than I 
know how to customize emacs)
