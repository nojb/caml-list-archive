Subject: [Caml-list] New Book: More OCaml - Algorithms, Methods & Diversions

Hi,

I've written another book about OCaml, a little more advanced than the
previous one but still, I hope, approachable.

On Amazon, at $39.99 or less:

http://www.amazon.com/More-OCaml-Algorithms-Methods-Diversions/dp/0957671113/

E-book, at $14.99, and sample chapters:

http://ocaml-book.com/more-ocaml-algorithms-methods-diversions/

Thanks to all those who reviewed and proof-read earlier drafts.

Reviews on Amazon are always very useful - my understanding is that
if you have an Amazon account, you can review the book based on
having read the e-book, without buying a printed copy. Do please
consider adding a review, especially if you like the book!

Here's the blurb:

In "More OCaml" John Whitington takes a meandering tour of functional 
programming with OCaml, introducing various language features and 
describing some classic algorithms. The book ends with a large worked 
example dealing with the production of PDF files. There are questions 
for each chapter together with worked answers and hints.

"More OCaml" will appeal both to existing OCaml programmers who wish to 
brush up their skills, and to experienced programmers eager to explore 
functional languages such as OCaml. It is hoped that each reader will 
find something new, or see an old thing in a new light. For the more 
casual reader, or those who are used to a different functional language, 
a summary of basic OCaml is provided at the front of the book.

With Thanks,

--
