Subject: [Caml-list] TAMC 2015, 18-20 May 2015, National University of
 Singapore - First Call for Papers

First Call for Papers for the 12th Annual Conference on

  Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC 2015)
  18 - 20 May 2015

School of Computing, National University of Singapore

TAMC 2015 aims at bringing together a wide range of researchers with
interests in computational theory and applications. For more than 10
years, the conference series "Theory and Applications of Models of
Computing" has fostered interactions and collaborations between both
theoretical and applied researchers working on all aspects of
computations and the ways to model it.

Conference Chair: Sanjay Jain.
Programme Committee Chairs: Rahul Jain and Frank Stephan.
Programme Committee: Ajith Abraham, Anthony Bonato, Yijia Chen, Rodney
G. Downey, Henning Fernau, Dimitris Fotakis, Gopal T V, Steffen Lempp,
Jiamou Liu, Frexdexric Magniez, Klaus Meer, Mia Minnes, Philippe
Moser, Mitsunori Ogihara, Yota Otachi, Yicheng Pan, Pan Peng, Anil
Seth, Xiaoming Sun, Chaitanya Swamy, Hongan Wang, Wei Wang, Guohua Wu,
Yitong Yin, Mingsheng Ying, Neal Young, Thomas Zeugmann, Shengyu
Zhang, Conghua Zhou.

There will be published proceedings. Submissions should have a length of
12 pages; for details for the submission format and submission-link
and other questions, please consult the conference webpage

  http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~fstephan/tamc2015/tamc2015.html

Papers already published in other conferences or in journals should
not be submitted to TAMC 2015; furthermore, simultaneous submissions
to other conferences are also not permitted. It is permitted to submit
an extended version of the paper to a journal after the conference.

Timeline:
Submission due: Thu 27 November 2014 at 23:59 hrs GMT.
Notification: Tue 20 January 2015.
Final Version due: Tue 3 February 2015.
Conference: Mon 18 - Wed 20 May 2015
