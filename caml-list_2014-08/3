note: for me it "fails" (I kill ocamlopt) before because of a long
forgotten -inline 10000 that makes ocaml generate a large ( >90 MB .s
file on which "as" takes a lot of time, for typing/typer.ml), putting
a saner -inline 100 in Makefile.distribg makes the file compile and I
can stumble on the same camlp4 issue:

The following test cases exhibit the problematic behavior of camlp4 (I
don't know if it's just an intended change in behaviour or a bug, I
don't mind filling a bug report in the latter case):

bug1.ml -----------------------
#load "pa_extend.cmo";;

open A
open B
open C
open D
open E

bug2.ml -----------------------

#load "pa_extend.cmo";;

open A
open B
open C
open D
open E
open F

$ camlp4 -version
4.02.0+dev12-2014-07-30

$ camlp4o bug1.ml
E

$ camlp4o bug2.ml
let _ = E

open F



Note that if I don't go until "open E" the output file is empty

with camlp4 from ocaml 4.01.0, everything works as expected (that is
the #load is absent from the output, and all the open A...F are
present in the output).


Cheers,
