Special issue on Adaptive and reconfigurable software systems and
architectures
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

The focal concerns are Service-oriented and component-based software
systems, applications and architectures addressing adaptation and
reconfiguration issues. Different investigation topics are involved, such
as: CBSE, SOA, Functional and Non Functional (NF) requirements (QoS,
performance, resilience), monitoring, diagnosis, decision and execution of
adaptation and reconfiguration. Different research axes are covered:
concepts, methods, techniques, and tools to design, develop, deploy and
manage adaptive and reconfigurable software systems.

The development of composite services poses very interesting challenges
concerning their functional and NF requirements. On the one hand, a
composite software system depends on the NF requirements of its
constituting components in order to provide a satisfactory service to the
user. On the other hand, the main issues for the fulfilment of QoS and
service level agreements (SLA) are concerned with performance variability.
Indeed, the QoS may evolve frequently, either because of internal changes
or because of workload fluctuations. The performance and the robustness of
the composite software system may be significantly improved by monitoring
the execution of the components and by flexibly reacting to degradation and
anomalies in a timely fashion.

The concept of adaptive and reconfigurable software systems has been
introduced in order to describe architectures, which exhibit such
properties. An adaptive and reconfigurable software system can repair
itself if any execution problems occur, in order to successfully complete
its own execution, while respecting functional and NF agreements. In the
design of an adaptive and reconfigurable software system, several aspects
have to be considered. For instance, the system should be able to predict
or to detect degradations and failures as soon as possible and to enact
suitable recovery actions. Moreover, different NF requirements service
levels might be considered in order to complete the execution in case of
failure.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D TOPICS =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The special issue only solicits and accepts papers whose major
contributions are within the domain of software engineering. Authors should
refer to the highlighted scope of the JSS on the journal homepage for the
precise scope of the JSS
http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software/#scope.

Contributions are devoted to functional and non-functional adaptability and
reconfiguration management in service-oriented and component-based software
systems. Specifically, the relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

Distributed and centralized collaborative solutions for the diagnosis and
repair of software systems
Design for the diagnosability and repairability
Collaborative Management of NF requirements (quality, security, robustness,
availability)
Monitoring simple and composite architectures, components and services
Semantic (or analytic) architectural and behavioral models for monitoring,
planning and deployment of software systems
Dynamic reconfiguration of CB and SO software systems architectures
Software architecture design and validation for complex systems
Scalability management in software systems architectures
Collaborative planning and decision-making
Collaborative technologies for ensuring autonomic properties
Predictive management of adaptability.
Collaborative Management of autonomic properties
Experiences in practical adaptive and reconfigurable CB and SO applications
Tools and prototypes for managing adaptability of CB and SO applications
