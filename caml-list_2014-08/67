Subject: [Caml-list] [fm-announcements] Call for Highlights: Aerospace
 America Intelligent Systems Year In Review

All,

Please consider submitting a highlight about your work! It is only 150 
words and it would really help to call attention to the important role 
of formal methods in the future of aerospace!

Cheers,
Kristin

possible. Each highlight will be integrated within an overall narrative, 
so key organizations/affiliations should be identified within the text 
to enable proper credit to be given; including a URL for further 
information on your work is required. The AIAA Intelligent Systems 
Technical Committee will select, from among all submissions received, 
six that will be highlighted in the year-end issue of Aerospace America 
magazine.

ARTICLE INFORMATION:
--------------------
This article will cover the most important developments this year in 
aerospace intelligent systems. Breakthroughs, setbacks, and industry 
trends that have occurred during the past year, the reasons they are 
important, and their impact on the aerospace community are also relevant.

More information on what types of aerospace systems qualify as 
intelligent is available here: 
https://info.aiaa.org/tac/isg/ISTC/Web%20Pages/What%20Is%20An%20Intelligent%20System.aspx.

Aerospace America reaches 40,000 people in a broad cross section of 
disciplines. highlights should be written so that all of them are able 
to understand the content, without acronyms if possible.

*********************************************************************
BACKGROUND:
-----------
The AIAA Intelligent Systems Technical Committee (ISTC) is concerned 
with the application of Intelligent System (IS) technologies and methods 
to aerospace systems, the verification and validation of these systems, 
and the education of the AIAA membership in the use of IS technologies 
in aerospace and other technical disciplines. See the Intelligent 
Systems Technical Committee website for more information on our 
technology focus: https://info.aiaa.org/tac/ISG/ISTC/default.aspx.

Previous years' print articles are available at 
https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/dev/profile/kyrozier/publications/#MagazineArticles. 


This year there will be two versions: a paper article with authors' 
designated hyperlink text bolded and an online article with the provided 
URL linked. Also, with author permission, all submitted highlights (not 
just the six selected for the article) will be included on the AIAA ISTC 
website and newsletter. Requests for permission and approval of 
camera-ready versions will go out on October 1, 2014.
