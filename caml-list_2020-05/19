## Onward! Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on
everything to do with programming and software: including processes,
methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more
radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas
that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of
thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and
software engineering research.

Submissions due: Sun 17 May, 2020
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-Onward-papers


## Onward! Essays

Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing
about topics important to the software community. An essay can be long
or short.  An essay can be an exploration of the topic and its impact,
or a story about the circumstances of its creation; it can present a
personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader in an
act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep
analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps the one the
author took to reach an understanding of the topic. The subject
area=E2=80=94software, programming, and programming languages=E2=80=94shoul=
d be
interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to
human endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological,
historical, or anthropological underpinnings.

Submissions due: Sat 23 May, 2020
https://2020.splashcon.org/track/splash-2020-Onward-Essays

## Software Language Engineering (SLE)

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the discipline of engineering
languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It
abstracts from the differences between programming languages,
modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasizes the
engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the
establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the
best results. SLE 2020 solicits high quality contributions in areas
ranging from theoretical and conceptual contributions, to tools,
techniques, and frameworks in the domain of software language
engineering.

Abstracts due: Mon 20 July, 2020
Submissions due: Mon 27 July, 2020

## Rebase

Rebase is a series of high-quality talks that highlight the challenges
that are on the forefront of both research and practice across the SPLASH
community's broad spectrum of domains and techniques.

## SPLASH-E

SPLASH-E is a symposium, started in 2013, for software and languages
(SE/PL) researchers with activities and interests around computing
education. Some build pedagogically-oriented languages or tools; some think
about pedagogic challenges around SE/PL courses; some bring computing to
non-CS communities; some pursue human studies and educational research.

At SPLASH-E, we share our educational ideas and challenges centred in
software/languages, as well as our best ideas for advancing such work.
SPLASH-E strives to bring together researchers and those with educational
interests that arise from software ideas or concerns.
