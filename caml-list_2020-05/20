The Communication Technologies group of the University of Vienna is looking=
 for a motivated student interested in pursuing a PhD on developing the fou=
ndations of the next generation of reliable networks: networks which are hi=
ghly automated,  and verify and correct themselves autonomously, relying on=
 formal methods. Communication networks have become a critical infrastructu=
re of our society and hence come with stringent requirements on dependabili=
ty. We believe that automation can improve reliability: many network outage=
s these days are due to human errors.

WHAT WE OFFER
-The research position is at the Faculty of Computer Science at the Univers=
ity of Vienna and is fully funded.(Employment contract)
-The candidate also has the opportunity to collaborate with Aalborg Univers=
ity, Denmark, and engage into longer visits, if she/he is interested: Aalbo=
rg University is a project partner.
-Additionally, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to collab=
orate with the doctoral program Logical Methods in Computer Science (LogiCS=
), run by TU Wien, TU Graz and JKU Linz, and funded by the Austrian Science=
 Fund.
-We offer a productive research environment and excellent contacts to other=
 universities as well as industry interested in this application domain. Wh=
ile our goal is to lay the theoretical foundations of such networks, we als=
o plan to prototype our ideas and ideally make a practical contribution. Fo=
r an idea on the kind of research we are doing in this area, please see the=
 sample publications attached below.


ELIGIBILITY

The candidate should have a strong background in formal methods, model chec=
king and algorithms, and be knowledgeable about communication networks, wit=
h a strong interest in this application domain.


APPLICATION

To apply, please send your:

-Academic curriculum vitae
-motivation letter, and
-reference letters

to Prof. Stefan Schmid by email, or use the online portal at https://univis=
.univie.ac.at/ausschreibungstellensuche/

Please do not hesitate to contact Stefan Schmid for any further information=
: ta.ca.eivinu@dimhcs_nafets

Deadline: June 7, 2020

Starting date: ideally as soon as possible, latest in October 2020.

HIGHEST QUALITY OF LIFE

The Austrian city of Vienna, is located close to the Alps and surrounded by=
 beautiful nature, and provides an exceptionally high quality of life, with=
 a vibrant cultural scene, numerous cultural events, world-famous historica=
l sites, a large international community, varied cuisine and famous coffee =
houses.

If you decide to be located in Vienna, the city features a vibrant and exce=
llence-driven research landscape, with several leading research institutes =
(e.g., TU Wien, University of Vienna, IST, AIT, SBA) and universities conti=
nuously establishing collaborations in various fields. Finally, Vienna has =
been consistently ranked by Mercer over the last years the best city for qu=
ality of life worldwide.
