[ Please distribute, apologies for multiple postings. ]

Due to the multiple requests and since ICFP will be now officially held
online with a significantly reduced fee, we decided to extend the
submission deadline till the end of this month. We are hoping to attract a
larger and more diverse audience this year, given that the new format is
more accessible both travel-wise and financially.

It is my pleasure to invite submissions to the OCaml Users and
Developers Workshop 2020, which is again co-located with ICFP and will
be held on Friday 28th August 2020 in Jersey City, NJ, USA
                https://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2020/

           Talk proposal submission deadline: May 8th, 2020, AoE


The OCaml Users and Developers Workshop brings together the
OCaml community, including users of OCaml in industry, academia,
hobbyists and the free software community. Previous editions
have been co-located with ICFP since 2012 in Copenhagen, Boston,
Gothenburg, Nara, Oxford, St Louis and last year in Berlin, following OCaml
Meetings in Paris in 2010 and 2011.

  https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/ocaml-2020

Scope
-----

Presentations and discussions focus on the OCaml programming language
and its community. We aim to solicit talks on all aspects related to
improving the use or development of the language and its programming
environment, including, for example (but not limited to):

- compiler developments, new backends, runtime and architectures

- practical type system improvements, such as GADTs, first-class
  modules, generic programming, or dependent types

- new library or application releases, and their design rationales

- tools and infrastructure services, and their enhancements

- prominent industrial or experimental uses of OCaml, or deployments
  in unusual situations.

Presentations
-------------

The workshop is an informal meeting with no formal proceedings. The
presentation material will be available online from the workshop
homepage. The presentations may be recorded and made available at a
later date.

Traditionally, the main presentation format was a workshop talk, usually
around 20 minutes in length, plus question time, but we also had a poster
session during the workshop =E2=80=93 to enable more diverse work and time =
for
discussion. The program committee was deciding which presentations should
be delivered as posters or talks. However, ICFP2020 will be held online and
the concrete format is yet to be finalized. Further information will be
provided as it becomes available.

Submission
----------

To submit a presentation, please register a description of the
talk (about 2 pages long) at

  https://ocaml2020.hotcrp.com/

providing a clear statement of what will be provided by the
presentation: the problems that are addressed, the solutions or
methods that are proposed.

LaTeX-produced PDFs are a common and welcome submission
format. For accessibility purposes, we ask PDF submitters to
also provide the sources of their submission in a textual
format, such as .tex sources. Reviewers may read either the
submitted PDF or the text version.

Important dates
---------------

Friday 29th May (extended)     Abstract submission deadline
Friday 17th July                    Author notification
Friday 28th August                  OCaml Workshop

ML family workshop
------------------

The ML family workshop, held on the previous day, deals with
general issues of the ML-style programming and type systems,
focuses on more research-oriented work that is less specific to
a language in particular. There is an overlap between the two
workshops, and we have occasionally transferred presentations from one
to the other in the past. Authors who feel their submission fits both
workshops are encouraged to mention it at submission time and/or
contact the Program Chairs.
