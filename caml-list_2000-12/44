Have a look at wlex:

http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/frisch/info/wlex-20001006.tar.gz


<< This package consists of a lexer generator and the associated runtime
system. The new lexing model adds a "classification" layer between the
lexbuf and the lexer itself. This layer classifies characters from the
lexbuf into a few number of classes, on which the regexps in the lexer
specification are built. 

 This reduces the number of states and transitions in the automaton,
especially when working with large encodings such as UTF-8 (the primary
motivation for wlex).  >>

The development release of pxp may use wlex (same lexer for different
encodings: UTF-8, Latin-1).

wlex is distributed as a patch to ocamllex.
