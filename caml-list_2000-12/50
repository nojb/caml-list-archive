I would appreciate this, too. PCRE regexps have often a simpler notation
because they need fewer backslashes. Furthermore, the reentrant interface of
PCRE has advantages in multi-threaded programs (with Str, you have to throw
with mutexes after the regexps...)

However, the PCRE stubs can be improved in one point: The master lock could be
released while the engine executes the regexp. Several threads could then
use the engine at the same time which would improve the responsiveness of
multi-threaded programs, and the programs would run faster on SMP systems.
(Currently, the so-called "master lock" prevents that more than one thread runs
at the same time (to avoid problems with uninitialized memory). However, when
O'Caml calls a C function which is thread-safe itself, one can release this
lock for the time of the call, because C can cope with uninitialized memory.)
As regexp matching takes some time, there could be an interesting speedup for
programs that massively apply regexps.
