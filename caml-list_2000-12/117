	It's not clear:

	open A (* contains field x *)
	open B (* contains field x *)

	expr.x (* B.x *)
	expr.A.x (* A.x *)
	expr.B.x (* B.x *)

Possibly, it is the _usage_ 'expr.x' which should be flagged
as erroneous, which would suggest:

	open List
	open Array
	..
	map f [] 
	map f [| |]

both applications ought to be in error (rather than just map f []).
This would break a LOT of code I'd imagine, even if it is
'better principled' than the current scheme, which might lead to
confusing messages.
