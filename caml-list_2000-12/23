Well, while doing the c2caml tool, i had to implement a C parser, well it is
not complete, but nicely parses all of the gtk+ header files.

Maybe you can use it.

It will be on c2caml.sourceforge.net, but i hadn't had time to create the
pages for it yet. In the meantime, if you need it, i could send it to you or
put it in my anonymous repository on my work box ?

It is GPLed code though.

Friendly,
