Well, the matching engine is not everything... ;)

To my knowledge, Phil Hazel is working on support for this. Unless the
PCRE-library supports Unicode (and unless OCaml does ;), there is not
much one can do about it...

I am not sure whether it is really necessary to have a Str compatible
interface: the regular expressions are already different so exchanging
the old against the new library would break code anyway.
