Hi,

We are going to rewrite a large bundle of Fortran-3 (!!!) sources to some
"better" language. Sources are the solution of the system of differential
equations in partial derivatives by normal finite differencing methods. 

Two candidats are voted: Pascal and Ocaml. Is Caml convenient tool for such
tasks?
