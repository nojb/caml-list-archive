I'm with Mattias on this one.  I'm practical above theoretical.  All of the workarounds for this problem seem like they generate way more tedious work for the programmer, and they still don't quite accomplish the goal 100%.  This characteristic of doing more work and only asymptotically approaching your goal is a bad taste I associate with C++.

Anyway, my "vote" would be to allow specification, with : if it's possible since it's the obvious syntax, but even with @@ if necessary (even though I think it's really ugly).
