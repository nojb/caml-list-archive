As Markus recommended on comp.lang.functional, the following is worthwhile
reading:

http://perl.plover.com/yak/typing/typing.html

While it was addressed to a "perl" audience, it discusses static typing issues
in Pascal and ML-like languages (and others).  Definately a *must* read.

Hi,

We are going to rewrite a large bundle of Fortran-3 (!!!) sources to some
"better" language. Sources are the solution of the system of differential
equations in partial derivatives by normal finite differencing methods.

Two candidats are voted: Pascal and Ocaml. Is Caml convenient tool for such
tasks?
