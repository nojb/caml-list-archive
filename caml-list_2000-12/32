Funny. Python 1.5.2 used the _same_ C library by Philip Hazel. :-)
Given the fact this library builds DFA's instead of NFA's, Python
ought to be faster than Perl. :-)

Note also, Python 2.0 uses a modified library which does something
PCRE-OCaml cannot: it works with Unicode characters (supposedly).

I do have a question though: is it possible to build a Str compatible
interface to PCRE-Ocaml, and then make them both a standard part
of the distribution? [The idea of a functional language using
non-reentrant libraries seems slightly absurd to me :-]
