Or at least a Master's. And by a fortuitous coincidence, one of our students
Bastiaan Heeren wrote a thesis on this essentially this topic. His type
inferencer uses heuristics to improve the quality of type-error messages; for
example, if x gets assigned type A in 2 places, and type B in only 1 place,
then the inferencer reports the latter as the source of the type conflict.

You can find his page, and the thesis, here:

explanation":
