Yes it does: the extra classification layer may consume more than one
character in the lexbuf. When you parse UTF-8 with ocamllex, you have
"waiting" states in the automaton corresponding to multibyte encoded code
points.

It would have been much easier for me not to distribute wlex as a patch,
but this is incompatible with the license.

The Makefile doesn't touch the source tree in place; it just makes a copy
of the lex/ directory and works on it. Findlib, which is not a patch, is
required only to install the runtime support library of wlex; you can
of course use this library directly.
