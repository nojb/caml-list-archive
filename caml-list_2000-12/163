Right.  Actually I sometimes use findlib and I feel comfortable with
it.  But I am reluctant to use it in a project that I intend to
distribute to others simply because findlib is not part of the
standard distribution.  My proposal is simple and easy to use.  For
instance, building a multithreaded GTk-based GUI application can be
done by:

	ocamlopt -o <executable> -i lablgtk -i threads <source>

which is more pleasant than

	ocamlopt -o <executable> \
		-I /usr/local/lib/ocaml-3.00/lablgtk \
		-I /usr/local/lib/ocaml-3.00/threads <source>

I was very glad that ocaml-3.00 reuses linking information stored in
libraries (.cma and .cmxa).  This feature removed most of the long and
ugly --ccopt and --cclib options from my Makefiles's.  I guess my
proposal is along this spirit and steps little bit further.

The same (and probably more intelligent stuff) can be done by using
findlib.  But I suppose it is easier to convince INRIA people to
include my simple proposal in the standard distribution than findlib.
