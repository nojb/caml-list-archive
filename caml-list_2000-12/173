>Impossible in Camlp4, it is a typing problem.

Oh, I thought camlp4 had the types available to it.  I must have misunderstood the docs.

Hmm.  So similarly, you couldn't write an introspection thing like this in camlp4:

type foo = {bar:float; baz:int };;
let a = {bar = 1.;baz = 1};;
print_members_camlp4 a;;

Where print_members_camlp4 is hooked by camlp4 to iterate over the members of whatever record was passed to it (or error at compile time if it's not a record)?  That's not possible?
