Camlp4 does not know what a type definition is: for it, it is just a
syntax thing. Therefore, in the line "print_member_camlp4 a", Camlp4
does not know what "a" is: for it, it is just "the identifier a",
that's all. The fact that it is a variable previously defined of type
"foo" is typing. If you want to treat that at Camlp4 time, you have to
write a types inference algorithm. A compiler...
