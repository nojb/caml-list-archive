	It is for code doing extensive matching of long strings
against a single pattern: everything else should be dwarfed
by the match time.

	What? You mean it isn't generic enough to just change
'char' to 'short' and recompile?  [:-)]

	If the expressions were translated?

	BTW: I think some of the features of the regex are
parochial, and should be eliminated: support for case insensitive
matching, and matching 'words' etc should be dropped. Such things
might make sense in English, but are much too hard to build in
to a regexp facility correctly for internationalised text.

	By the way, how big can the DFA tables get?
Does it eliminate duplicate columns? 

	[Ocaml lex cannot support large enough tables for matching
ISO-10646 identifiers, when encoded using UTF-8. This is a real pain,
since all my languages specify UTF-8 encoded ISO-10646: I have to 
cheat, and assume 'almost everything' is a suitable character to
put in an identifier, and then check it afterwards. This makes it
hard to use use special symbols as tokens. I'm not sure why
this is, but I guess it doesn't eliminate duplicate columns?]
