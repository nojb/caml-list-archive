All of these more sophisticated methods are only going to be a win
when you are searching for larger strings. strstr is brutally simple,
has little setup/cleanup time, and hence is hard to beat for short
strings. Additionally gcc, will replace various s* calls with in-line
assembly versions. I'm not sure if this includes strstr (it is a
little more complicated than most).

Cheers,
Julian.
