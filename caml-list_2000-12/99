That is completely correct, and the substrings in my application are
indeed short (3 characters), but:

I expected that 3000 strings for 1 substring, each of which are about
20 characters long as I mentioned before, are enough for paying the
"setup/cleanup" overhead.  (On the other hand, strstr in libc doesn't
benefit from the partial application, of course.)
