Right, one could indeed have private methods. But I am still looking
for a good notation for private method invocation...
The notation `self#toto' is not suitable (How would it be typed and
compiled ? How do one know whether `toto' make reference to a regular
or a private method ?).  And I would not like writing just `toto', as
this expression is somewhat misleading: it would not represent in this
case a variable access, but a function call.
