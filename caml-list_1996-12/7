Subject: elementary stream question
Sender: weis

I was just trying out the following piece of code from "Functional Programming
using Caml-light" using Objective Caml 1.02:

# let next = function [< 'x >] -> x;;
Characters 20-22:
Syntax error

So how do I get functions to operate on streams? Is this part of
the Caml syntax different in OCaml? Thanks for any help.
