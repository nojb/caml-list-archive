I suspect neither of your assumptions is correct. The problem is that
your module type MIXED includes two(!) type variables named t (look
carefully at the output of the compiler) while your implementation
only provides one. Probably the compiler should already flag your
definition of MIXED as an error because the name t is defined twice in
the environment. (BTW try to enter the expande of the compiler into the
compiler and it will happily barf on you :-)
