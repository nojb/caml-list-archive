*** CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS ***

     ICLP 2015

 31st International Conference on Logic Programming

Aug 31 - Sep 4, 2015
 Cork, Ireland

URL: http://booleconferences.ucc.ie/iclp2015

ICLP 2015, the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming,
will be held in Cork, Ireland, from August 31 to September 4, 2015.
The conference is is part of The Year of George Boole, a celebration
of the life and work of George Boole who was born in 1815 and worked
at the University College of Cork. ICLP 2015 will also be collocated
with CP 2015.

Workshops collocated with an international conference are one of the
best venues for the presentation and discussion of preliminary work,
novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide and interested audience.
Collocated workshops also provide an opportunity for presenting
specialized topics and opportunities for intensive discussions and
project collaboration. The topics of the workshops collocated with
ICLP 2015 can cover any areas related to logic programming, (e.g.,
theory, implementation, environments, language issues, alternative
paradigms, applications), including cross-disciplinary areas. However,
any relevant workshop proposal will be considered.

The format of the workshop will be decided by the workshop organizers,
but ample time should be allowed for general discussion. Workshops can
vary in length, but the optimal duration will be half a day or a full
day.

Workshop Proposal:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Those interested in organizing a workshop at ICLP 2015 are invited to
submit a workshop proposal. Proposals should be in English and about
two pages in length. They should contain:

 * The title of the workshop.
 * A brief technical description of the topics covered by the workshop.
 * A discussion of the timeliness and relevance of the workshop.
 * A list of some related workshops held in the last years
 * The requested number of half-days allotted to the workshop
   and an estimate of the number of expected attendees.
 * The names, affiliation and contact details (email, web page,
   phone) of the workshop organizers together with a designated
   contact person.
 * Previous experience of the workshop organizers in
   workshop/conference organization.

Proposals are expected in text or PDF format. All proposals should be
submitted to the Workshop Chair by email by March 1, 2015.

Reviewing Process:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Each submitted proposal will be reviewed by the Workshop, Program and
General Chairs. Proposals that appear well-organized and that fit the
goals and scope of ICLP will be selected.  The decision will be
notified by email to the responsible organizer by March 15, 2015.

The definitive length of the workshop will be planned according to the
number of submissions received by the different workshops. For every
accepted workshop, the ICLP local organizers will prepare a meeting
room. The proceedings should be produced and distributed (usually via
web pages) by each workshop organizer.

Workshop Organizers' Tasks:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

   program.
