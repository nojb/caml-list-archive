Paper submission 		March 25, 2015

SCOPE

The Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web
Systems (WWV) is a yearly interdisciplinary forum for researchers
originating from the following areas: declarative, rule-based
programming, formal methods, software engineering and web-based
systems. WWV fosters the cross-fertilisation and advancement of
hybrid methods from such areas. During its ten earlier editions,
the WWV workshop series has established itself as a lively,
friendly event with many interactions and discussions.

Companies, organisations and institutions offer most of their
electronic services as sophisticated web-based applications.
Prominent examples include e-business, e-learning, e-government,
and e-health services. The increased complexity and the explosive
growth of such applications has made their design and
implementation a challenging task, not in the least because at
the same time quality, accessibility, security, and privacy
issues need to be considered. Systematic, formal approaches to
their specification and verification are needed to address the
problems those systems by means of automated and effective
techniques and tools.

WWV welcomes papers of either theoretical or applied interest,
including case studies or experience reports, in all areas of
web-based systems (web services, cloud platforms,
Internet-of-Things, social networks, big data), including but
not limited to:
- Formal methods and rigorous software and system engineering
- Declarative, rule-based approaches
- Product line and feature-oriented engineering
- Programming and design languages and models
- Specification, certification, transformation, and synthesis
- Analysis, verification, model checking, and debugging
- Semi-structured data, linked data, and semantic web
- Security, trust, privacy, reputation, confidentiality, and
   integrity
- Quality, metrics, usability, and accessibility
- Testing, evaluation, and optimisation
- Middleware, platforms, and frameworks


INVITED SPEAKERS

Dino Distefano         Queen Mary University, London, UK
Jose Meseguer          University of Illinois, USA


SUBMISSION

We solicit the submission of original, unpublished contributions
not under review for publication elsewhere. Contributions are
expected to comprise research papers (with novel, previously
unpublished results), experience reports of real-world
applications, tool descriptions, and short papers (e.g. describing
work-in-progress or exploratory ideas). All papers must be
prepared in LaTeX using the EPTCS style

   - Full papers should not exceed 16 pages (typeset 11 points).
   - Short papers should not exceed 8 pages.

Additional details omitted due to space limitations may be
included in a clearly marked appendix. Submissions must describe
work unpublished in refereed venues, not submitted elsewhere.
Contributions should be submitted in PDF format through the
EasyChair online submission system.
Submission of a paper involves a firm commitment that at least
one of the authors will attend and participate in the workshop
in case the paper is accepted.


PUBLICATION

All contributions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers,
chosen by the Program Committee. The PC will select the best
papers based on their quality, relevance to the workshop, and
potential to instigate discussion.
All accepted papers will be included in the post-proceedings,
which will be published as a volume of the EPTCS series (WWV
publication is indexed in DBLP and Microsoft Academic Research,
among other important repositories).
An open call for a special issue in a highly-reputed journal on
the topic of the WWV workshop is envisaged. This has been common
practice for WWV since 2009.

The previous 10 editions of WWV attracted high-quality papers that
were published in ENTCS (WWV'05, WWV'07 and WWV'08), by IEEE (WWV'06)
and in EPTCS (WWV'11, WWV'12, WWV'13 and WWV'14).
After WWV'09, a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation
on the topics of the WWV was organized. Similarly, a special issue
of the Journal of Applied Logic was organized after WWV'10 and
special issues of the Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming were
organized after WWV'11, WWV'12 and WWV'13. A special issue of the
Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming dedicated to
WWV'14 and the CAV workshop VPT'14 is forthcoming.
