POSTDOC POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT

National Institute of Aerospace

Software Assurance and Formal Methods

The National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) has an opening for a
postdoctoral Research Scholar to work in the research area of software
assurance and formal methods in support of NASA's sponsored
programs. The successful candidate will work with NASA and NIA
researchers on one or more research topics centered on techniques and
methods for preserving and improving the integrity of software and
safety-critical systems of interest to NASA. Examples of these systems
include separation assurance algorithms for air traffic management,
concepts of operations for Next Generation Air Transportation
(NextGen), fault-tolerant avionics systems, etc.

The areas of interest within the research team include:
* Formal verification of software intensive safety-critical systems.
* Development of techniques and tools for formal verification.
* Integration of formal verification tools into software development
practice. 
* Design and analysis of operational procedures, algorithms and enabling
  technologies for air traffic control.

Requirements:
* PhD degree or equivalent in Computer Science, Mathematics, Electrical or
  Aerospace Engineering or closely related fields
* Demonstrated research experience within the stated areas of interest.
* Knowledge of at least one formal verification technique, e.g., theorem
proving, 
  model-checking, abstract interpretation, symbolic execution, etc.
* Excellent oral and writing communication skills.	
	
Desired skills: 	
* Familiarity with current challenges in formal specification and
verification of 
  cyber-physical systems, such as modeling of hybrid systems, numerical
issues
  due to machine numbers, etc.
* Familiarity with current challenges in application fields related to
aerospace 
  engineering, such as autonomy and authority, modeling and simulation,
etc.
