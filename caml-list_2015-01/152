I want to make an ocaml cross-compiler actually available in win-builds
for people to use. There is already one in win-builds but it's not built
by default as it has too many (potential) quirks.

In the near future I'll work again on making cross-compilation upstream
for the ocaml compiler. Working on win-builds has also convinced me that
being able to cross-compile a compiler would be useful too. That would
make it possible to have a package that provides an ocaml compiler that
runs on Windows and targets Windows.

As far as opam is concerned, I currently don't intend to do anything
specific for it. The reason is that there's already a lot to do on
things that are not specific to opam and it's not sensible to expand my
TODO list. :) 
Another thing to note is that win-builds provides binary packages and
that doesn't match the usual opam usage. In any case, packages for ocaml
libraries and tools is planned and wished but a realistic schedule would
be in 6 months or more (time to get better ocaml cross-compiler, to test
it and to make more packages).
