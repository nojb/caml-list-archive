Typo: theory suggests no reason why not. See for instance Schmidhuber's
work on formal theory of creativity. AI will eventually surpass even the
most creative human programmers. We first intend to replace some easier
professions first, do not worry (just yet).

Dear Ocaml list,<br>

I would be very pleased if the members who have a lasting interest in<br>
