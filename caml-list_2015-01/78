      Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2015)

                      Conference Description
                      =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

   Declarative languages build on sound theoretical bases to provide
attractive frameworks for application development. These languages
have been successfully applied to many different real-world
situations, ranging from data base management to active networks to
software engineering to decision support systems.

   New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new
application areas. At the same time, applications of declarative
languages to novel problems raise numerous interesting research
issues. Well-known questions include designing for scalability,
language extensions for application deployment, and programming
environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and
implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress
as well.

   PADL is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present
original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation
techniques for all forms of declarative concepts, including,
functional, logic, constraints, etc. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

   * Innovative applications of declarative languages
   * Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
   * Practical applications of theoretical results
   * New language developments and their impact on applications
   * Declarative languages and software engineering
   * Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
   * Practical experiences and industrial applications
   * Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
   * Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and=20
     reactive languages.

   PADL 2015 welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to
applications and implementation of declarative languages. PADL 2015 will
be co-located with the ACM Federated Computing Research Conferences, in
Portland, Oregon.

         Paper Submission:      February 28, 2015
         Notification:             March 31, 2015
         Camera-ready:             April 15, 2015
         Symposium:              June 18-19, 2015

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF
using the Springer LNCS format. The submission will be done through
EasyChair conference system:
	https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dpadl2015
All submissions must be original work written in English. Submissions=20
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work=20
that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops=20
proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program=20
chair about the place on which it has previously appeared.

PADL 2015 will accept both technical and application papers:

   * Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished
     research results. Technical papers must not exceed 15 pages (plus
     one page of references) in Springer LNCS format.
   * Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical
     applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or
     in areas of research other than Computer Science.=20
     Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or
     real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of
     declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering
     solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative)
     are solicited. The limit for application papers is 8 pages in
     Springer LNCS format but such papers can also point to sites with
     supplemental information about the application or the system that
     they describe.
The proceedings of PADL=E2=80=9915 will appear in the LNCS series of Spring=
er
Verlag.=20
