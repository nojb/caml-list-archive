Well, I have merlin installed and strangely enough it seems to detect
more errors than the OCaml compiler. Perhaps because it's not reading
all the modules it should. The errors are missing type constructors
andother values...

Well, as a blind user, the highlighting is not very convenient. Perhaps
there could be an option which, whenenabled, would mark the expression
as an emacs region.
