Haha! I am still using that OCaml Makefile that I got from somewhere. So I
suppose that would mean it would have to be a better programmer than
I am. We do fully intend to achieve that one day. Can an AI be as creative
as a human? That was one of the popular objections that Turing evaluated
in his 1950 paper. Theory suggests there is no reason why. Also, it is
already
conceivable as a (quite high tech) extension of automatic programming
methods. If you can specify the programming problem logically, yes, a
general-purpose AI system (universal problem solver kind) should be able
to solve it. Can it do better than all programmers? Such solutions have not
been yet demonstrated, but why not? AI could be better at chip design than
we are, but also could be better at algorithm design. We just haven't done
it
at a very large scale yet. We're waiting for a Chicago Pile moment ;)

Having said that, I do have an awesome makefile library that I once released
called justmake. Let me extend that to include ocaml code and maybe we'll
use that in-house. Thanks for reminding that to me. I should also upload a
lot
of nice bits and pieces to github for easy access.

Best Regards,
