Subject: [Caml-list] Merlin reporting false erors?

Hi,

As a follow-up of the discussion on sseing which expression is involved
in an error message.

In a project, the OCaml compiler reports an error at line 733 of
amodule.
When the module is opened in emacs with merlin enabled, at saving, the
status line says:
(34 pending errors, use C-c C-x to jump)

The first error reported by merlinis at line 155. Ir complains about an
unbound type constructor, but that type constructor is defined in the
very same module at line 101, so even before it is used.

So it seems it's not a problem of not reading the right .cmi or .cmo
files,here.

Is this problem already known?

Thanks,
SÃ©bastien.
