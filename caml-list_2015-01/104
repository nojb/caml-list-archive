CRV 2015
The 2nd International Competition on Runtime Verification,=20
held with RV 2015, September 22 =E2=80=93 25, 2015 Vienna, Austria


CRV-2015 is the 2nd International Competition on Runtime Verification and i=
s part of the 15th International Conference on Runtime Verification. The ev=
ent will be held in September 2015, in Vienna, Austria. CRV-2015 will draw =
attention to the invaluable effort of software developers and researchers w=
ho contribute in this field by providing the community with new or updated =
tools, libraries and frameworks for the instrumentation and runtime verific=
ation of software.

Runtime Verification is a verification technique for the analysis of softwa=
re at execution-time based on extracting information from a running system =
and checking if the observed behaviors satisfy or violate the properties of=
 interest. During the last decade, many important tools and techniques have=
 been developed and successfully employed. However, there is a pressing nee=
d to compare such tools and techniques, since we currently lack a common be=
nchmark suite as well as scientific evaluation methods to validate and test=
 new prototype runtime verification tools.=20

The main aims of CRV-2015 are to:

	=E2=80=A2 Stimulate the development of new efficient and practical runtime=
 verification tools and the maintenance and improvement of the already deve=
loped ones.
	=E2=80=A2 Produce a benchmark suite for runtime verification tools, by sha=
ring case studies and programs that researchers and developers can use in t=
he future to test and to validate their prototypes.
	=E2=80=A2 Discuss the metrics employed for comparing the tools.
	=E2=80=A2 Provide a comparison of the tools on different benchmarks and ev=
aluate them using different criteria.
	=E2=80=A2 Enhance the visibility of presented tools among the different co=
mmunities (verification, software engineering, cloud computing and security=
) involved in software monitoring.

Please direct any enquiries to the competition co-organizers (crv15.chairs@=
imag.fr <mailto:crv15.chairs@imag.fr>)

	=E2=80=A2 Yli=C3=A8s Falcone (Universit=C3=A9 Joseph Fourier, France).
	=E2=80=A2 Dejan Nickovic (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Austr=
ia).
	=E2=80=A2 Giles Reger (University of Manchester, UK).
	=E2=80=A2 Daniel Thoma (University of Luebeck, Germany).

CRV-2015 Jury

The CSRV Jury will include a representative for each participating team and=
 the competition chairs. The Jury will be consulted at each stage of the co=
mpetition to ensure that the rules set by the competition chairs are fair a=
nd reasonable.

Call for Participation

The main goal of CRV 2015 is to compare tools for runtime verification. We =
invite and encourage the participation with benchmarks and tools for the co=
mpetition.The competition will consist of three main tracks based on the in=
put language used:

	=E2=80=A2 Track on monitoring Java programs (online monitoring).
	=E2=80=A2 Track on monitoring C programs (online monitoring).
	=E2=80=A2 Track on monitoring of traces (offline monitoring).

The competition will follow three phases:

	=E2=80=A2 Benchmarks/Specification collection phase - the participants are=
 invited to submit their benchmarks (C or Java programs and/or traces). The=
 organizers will collect them in a common repository (publicly available). =
The participants will then train their tools using the shared benchmarks.
	=E2=80=A2 Monitor collection phase - the participants are invited to submi=
t their monitors. The participants with the tools/monitors that meet the qu=
alification requirements will be qualified for the evaluation phase.
	=E2=80=A2 Evaluation phase - the qualified tools will be evaluated on the =
submitted benchmarks and they will be ranked using different criteria (i.e.=
, memory utilization, CPU utilization, ...). The final results will be pres=
ented at the RV 2015 conference.

The detailed description of each phase will be available on the RV 2015 web=
site at http://rv2015.conf.tuwien.ac.at <http://rv2015.conf.tuwien.ac.at/>.
