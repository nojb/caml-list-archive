Subject: [Caml-list] Post-Doctoral position for the security of binary code

The Inria Celtique group in Rennes has open post-doctoral positions. The po=
sitions are funded by the
national ANR projects Binsec[1] and Anastasec[2]. Both projects share the o=
bjective of
improving the security of software, especially at the binary level.

- The Anastasec project aims at the formal verification of security propert=
ies of large-scale
software-intensive embedded systems using static analysis techniques. The p=
roject is driven by
industrial case studies.  One of these case study is a hosting platform whi=
ch has to ensure
security properties (e.g., task isolation) in the presence of arbitrary bin=
ary code (vulnerable
and/or malicious). The research will consist in designing static analyses t=
echniques to ensure at
load-time that a binary code complies with the security requirements of the=
 hosting platform.

- The Binsec project aims at providing tools (grounded on formal methods) f=
or the security analysis
 of binary code. The main application domains are vulnerability analysis an=
d virus detection.=20
 The research will consist in designing novel static analysis techniques to=
 compensate for the absence
 of high-level abstractions and tackle specific challenges of binary code s=
uch as auto-modifying code.

Positions are for one year (with a possible 1 year extension) and the start=
ing date is flexible =E2=80=94 to some extent.=20
 Applicants must have a PhD in Computer Science with a strong background in=
  one of the following fields:
 formal methods, static analysis, compilers.

For further information and applications, potential applicant should contac=
t Sandrine Blazy sandrine.blazy@irisa.fr
and Fr=C3=A9d=C3=A9ric Besson frederic.besson@inria.fr. The application dea=
dline is the 28 February 2015.
