CALL FOR PAPERS
PSI: 10th Ershov Informatics Conference
25 - 27 August 2015, Innopolis, Kazan, Russia
http://easychair.org/smart-program/PSI2015/

The Ershov Informatics Conference (the PSI Conference Series, 10th edition) 
is the premier international forum in Russia for research and applications 
in computer, software and information sciences. The conference brings together 
academic and industrial researchers, developers and users to discuss the most 
recent topics in the field. PSI provides an ideal venue for setting up research 
collaborations between the rapidly growing Russian informatics community and 
its international counterparts, as well as between established scientists and 
younger researchers.

Submissions

There are three categories of submissions:
* Regular  papers  describing  fully  developed  work  and complete results 
  (15 pages / 30 minute talks).
* Short papers reporting on interesting work in progress and/or preliminary 
  results (9 pages / 15 minute talks).
* System and experimental papers describing implementation or evaluation of 
  experimental systems and containing a link to a working system 
  (7 pages / 10 minute presentations). 

Submissions should:
* Present original contributions that have not been previously published and 
  are not being submitted to another publication. 
* Clearly state the problem being addressed, the goal of the work, the results 
  achieved, and the relation to other work.
* Be in good-quality English, in a form that can be immediately published 
  without revision.
* Be sent electronically, as a PDF file formatted according to Springer LNCS 
  Instructions for Authors: http://www.springeronline.com) through the 
  submissions link to the conference website 
       https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=psi2015
  no later than April 23, 2015.

It is permissible to include or link to an appendix listing detailed results 
or supporting data that do not fit within the page limits, as long as the 
paper can be evaluated without reading this appendix.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register, attend the conference 
and present the paper.

Conference Proceedings

Preliminary proceedings will be available at the conference. Final versions of 
invited and accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag after the 
conference in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Proceedings of 
previous PSIs are volumes 1181, 1755, 2244, 2890, 4378, 5947 and 7162 of LNCS.

Location

PSI 2015 will take place in the Korston conference hall in Kazan, one of the 
oldest, largest and most beautiful cities in Russia, with a rich multicultural
