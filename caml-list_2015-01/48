What's wrong with oasis and it's build system? I like that, it does a good
job if you take the time to learn it and put effort in your package details.

The only thing I think the ocaml environment is missing is a static check
of the surrounding environment for the tools that will be used, for use in
opam. That way, when stuff builds, you get told all the dependencies
instead of doing iterations of finding each missing thing by hand.

Dear Ocaml list,<br>
<br>
I would be very pleased if the members who have a lasting interest in<br>
the subject of human-level AI would network with me. We have a startup<br>
working on that subject. Our code base is mainly in ocaml, and our<br>
team might need some extra programmers in the near future. Although<br>
this is not a formal job advertisement (yet), those who would like to<br>
