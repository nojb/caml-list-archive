Subject: [Caml-list] Ocaml programmers interested in human-level AI

--047d7bfcf2f6c3e8d8050c4ec61f
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Dear Ocaml list,

I would be very pleased if the members who have a lasting interest in the
subject of human-level AI would network with me. We have a startup working
on that subject. Our code base is mainly in ocaml, and our team might need
some extra programmers in the near future. Although this is not a formal
job advertisement (yet), those who would like to get in touch may just send
me a mail for meeting and briefly introduce themselves. I would very much
welcome such personal networking and getting to know fellow functional
programming hackers who are also interested in advancing the
state-of-the-art in machine learning.

Kind Regards,

--
