8th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud
Computing (UCC 2015)

December 07-10, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/ucc2015


CONTEXT AND SCOPE

Cloud Computing delivers computational resources on-demand as services
that are commoditized and delivered analogous to traditional utilities such=
 as
electricity, gas, water and telephony. Cloud service offerings for compute,
storage and communication resources as well as for hosted software and data
are growing at a tremendous rate, and it is essential to understand how to
effectively transform these services into Utilities that provide value to b=
oth
users and providers. There is also increasing interest from commercial
providers to offer business and revenue models around the services they
offer. Understanding how these models could be used to provide utility for
users, intermediary brokers (aggregators) and providers is also an area of
active research. UCC is the premier IEEE/ACM conference covering all areas
related to Cloud Computing as a Utility and provides an international forum
for leading researchers and practitioners in this important and growing fie=
ld.
UCC 2015, to be held in Cyprus, will happen as Cloud providers worldwide
add new services and increase Cloud utility at an accelerated pace, and Clo=
ud
service users explore new usage modes.

This will be the 8th UCC in a successful conference series. Previous events
were held in Shanghai, China (Cloud 2009), Melbourne, Australia (Cloud 2010
& UCC 2011), Chennai, India (UCC 2010), Chicago, USA (UCC 2012), Dresden,
Germany (UCC2013), and London, UK (UCC 2014).

accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper
that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.


SPECIAL ISSUES

Selected papers from the conference will be invited to submit an extended
version to the a number of top quality journals. Papers will be selected ba=
sed
on their reviewers' scores and appropriateness to a journal's theme. All
extended versions will undergo reviews and must represent original
unpublished research work. Further details will be made available at the
conference webpage.


TUTORIAL PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

Each tutorial proposal must contain the following:

=B7 Title.

=B7 Name and Affiliation of the Speaker(s).

=B7 Abstract (one paragraph, 200 words max., including previous experience
   with such tutorials).

=B7 Intended Audience (one paragraph) and prerequisites: Describe the
   background assumed of tutorial attendees (i.e. beginner, intermediate,
   advanced), and any requirements needed (e.g. bring own laptop).

=B7 Learning Outcome (one paragraph): Describe the benefit, knowledge or
   skill that will be gained by attendees.

=B7 Description (no more than 2 pages): A statement giving clear motivation
   /justification for the topic to be presented at UCC 2015 and a

 the
   dates should be the same). All other details can be up to workshop
   organizers to set.

=B7 Advertising the workshop beyond the conference web page.

=B7 Assistance in producing a camera-ready version of the workshop
   proceedings.


IMPORTANT NOTE

If the workshop is too small (i.e. does not attract enough submissions) the
UCC 2015 Organizing Committee may decide to merge that workshop with
another. So we encourage workshop organizers to attract a large community.
In extreme situations we may also cancel workshops if there are not enough
submissions.

Workshop organizers must ensure that suitable quality measures have been
taken to ensure that the accepted papers are of high quality. All papers mu=
st
be reviewed by an International Technical Program Committee with a
minimum of 3 reviews per paper. The workshop organizers should also try
to observe an acceptance rate that is no higher than 50%.

Unless indicated on the UCC website, there will be no travel support and
no registration discounts for authors and organizers.

Workshops are not automatically endorsed by IEEE or ACM and should not
use the names of these organisations in their titles.

The UCC 2015 Conference Organizing Committee will be responsible for the
following:

=B7 Providing a link to a workshop's local page.

=B7 Providing logistics support and a meeting place for the workshop.

=B7 In conjunction with the organizers, determining the workshop date and
   time.

=B7 Providing copies of the workshop proceedings to attendees.

st ensure that suitable quality measures have been<br>taken to ensure that =
the accepted papers are of high quality. All papers must<br>be reviewed by =

ance rate that is no higher than 50%.<br><br>Unless indicated on the UCC we=
