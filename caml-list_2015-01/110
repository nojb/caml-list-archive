			  CALL FOR PAPERS -- SETS 2015

********************************************************************************
	  2nd International Workshop about Sets and Tools (SETS 2015)
			  June 23, 2015, Oslo, Norway
			     Affiliated to FM 2015
			    http://sets2015.cnam.fr/
********************************************************************************

AIM

Sets and constructs built upon them like relations, functions, sequences are
the main modeling ingredients of formalisms such as VDM, Z, B, or Event-B.
Sets also occur in the formalization of mathematics, as evidenced by the large
library of the Mizar proof system for example. In addition, still in the
domain of verification, there is an increasing interest to automate set theory
(which is known to be a difficult problem), with some concrete realizations,
such as mp (the "main prover" of Atelier B) or Muscadet (an automated theorem
prover for natural deduction, which gives some good performances in set
theory). Sets are also the main features of some programming languages like
the former SetL language or the more recent {log} language (pronounced as
setlog).

The workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in set theory,
especially to design tools for dealing with set theory, such as interactive or
automated theorem provers, proof checkers, theories for general purpose proof
tools, constraint solvers, programming languages etc. These tools may be
dedicated or general purpose tools. Contributions by theoreticians working on
set theories or fragments of set theories in the aim of designing concrete
tools, and by practitioners using set-based tools are both welcome. We are
also interested by contributions providing some comparisons between set
modeling techniques and other formalisms, such as type theory (and variants)
for instance. Finally, regarding the domains of application, we mainly expect
contributions in the framework of formal methods, but not exhaustively, and
contributions reporting formalizations of mathematics using set theory for
example could be of interest for this workshop as well.

TOPICS

Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of set theory and
corresponding tools. More specifically, some suggested topics are:

 * Proof tools for sets
 * Constraint solvers for sets
 * Set-based programming languages
 * Automated verification in set theory
 * Encoding of sets in provers
 * Set theories for SMT solvers
 * Use of set-based tools in formal methods
 * Use of set-based tools in mathematics
 * Comparison of set-based tools
 * Comparison between set and type theories
 * Experience reports

CONTRIBUTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Submitted papers must be 6-15 pages in length, following the Springer LNCS
format. These submissions may be:

 * Research papers providing new concepts and results
 * Position papers and research perspectives
 * Experience reports
 * Tool presentations

Proceedings, including all the papers selected for the workshop, will be
available electronically at the workshop. No copyright transfer agreement will
be required from the authors. For this first edition of this workshop, we
would like to put the emphasis on discussions rather than on conventional
publications.
