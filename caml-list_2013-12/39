*** Second Call for Papers and Workshop Proposals ***

Fifth International Conference on Software Business (ICSOB 2014)

Azia Resort and Spa, Paphos Cyprus
June 15-18, 2014

http://www.icsob.org

Online submission: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dicsob2014

Conference Theme
Shortening the time-to-market: from short cycle times to continuous value d=
elivery

Advancements in the software industry have had a substantial impact not onl=
y on productivity and on GDP growth globally, but also on our daily work an=
d lives. Moreover there is a noticeable spillover within other industries (=
e.g. manufacturing, entertainment industry) enabling new business models: c=
ompanies bundle their physical products and software services into solution=
s (e.g. using subscription models or in-app purchases) and start to sell in=
dependent software products in addition to physical products. Software busi=
ness refers to commercial activities in and around the software industry, a=
imed at generating income from the delivery of software products and softwa=
re services. Although the software business shares common features with oth=
er international knowledge-intensive businesses, it carries many inherent f=
eatures making it a challenging domain for research. In particular software=
 companies have to depend on one another to deliver a unique value proposit=
ion to their customers or a unique experience to their users. Moreover rece=
nt developments like the emerging app economy offer a variety of opportunit=
ies for entrepreneurs or start-up companies. The recent acquisition of the =
three-year old Finnish mobile game startup Supercell with the total value o=
f 2.2 billion Euros shows that the future of software is not only in utilit=
y and but also in entertainment and increasing freetime of people globally.=
 This will have a profound effect on software business and requires novel b=
usiness models and new approaches to software product development as well.

ICSOB 2014 addresses researchers and practitioners, who are concerned with =
software business in different ways as well as the start-up community, whic=
h is increasingly focusing on mobile and social software. The main theme of=
 2014 focuses on speeding up the time from idea to value delivery, towards =
continuous delivery of added value.

Conference Topics
You are invited to submit papers addressing contemporary issues emerging at=
 the intersection of the software and business domains, broadly defined. Bo=
