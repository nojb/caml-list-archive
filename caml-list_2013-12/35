Subject: [Caml-list] Looking for some "junior" OCaml dev opportunity

HI all,

I discovered OCaml at the university (Caml Light to be precise) and 
really liked it.
Unfortunately, the most jobs I found are not related to OCaml.
I'm half Linux & network sysadmin, half other development langages (PHP, 
Javascript, a bit of Java, a bit of Python...)

I'm looking for my next job and would like to make it nearer to OCaml 
and the related ecosystem.
I was almost done, because when I applied for a position at JaneStreet, 
I passed the first level of interview and was invited to their HQ for 
the next level. The US embassy made it difficult and I had to give up. 
So sad.
On the "papers" side, I'm not EU nor US citizen: I'm Malagasy and I 
currently live in Madagascar.

Technically, I'm fluent with web related technologies but very 
scientific concept (high level algorithms and deep mathematical 
concepts) are a bit far from me. I left them to school about 12 years 
ago and will need serious refresh if I have to dive in them. So PhD 
related positions are out of target for me ;-).
I'm fluent in french and my english is not so bad (quickly improved if 
I'm in a 100% english speaking environment).

These are my profiles:
http://www.linkedin.com/in/mihaminarakotomandimby
http://mg.viadeo.com/en/profile/rakotomandimby.mihamina

I can either remote work or relocate (1 wife + 2 children with me).

The query:
If you ever hear for a connection looking for a geek interested in 
OCaml, please let me know, I'll apply! :-)


Thank you in advance.
