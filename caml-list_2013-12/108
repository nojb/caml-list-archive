As long as tsdl is not released I plan to follow the latest 2.0.X, since SD=
L bugs get fixed in the process.

I'm not fond of diluting APIs into various incarnations, it augments the ov=
erall bureaucracy and I like to have a single way of doing things. Getting =
rid of handling these `Error cases seems an `ignore` or monad away so I ten=
d to lean on keeping it the way it is now.

If you take a function like Sdl.render_draw_lines [1] a lot of copying is i=
nvolved for transforming that point list into a pointer on an array of poin=
ts. Hence I also provide the function Sld.render_draw_lines_ba [2] which ta=
kes the point list as a bigarray and allows to perform the call without any=
 copying, depending on where your data comes from this can be much more eff=
icient. Since I didn't use the binding yet, I may have missed less obvious =
opportunities.=20=20

1/3 (~1 week) of the code was sneaked during my stay at OCaml Labs when I w=
as bored working on vg. The remaining 2/3 are self-funded but I need part o=
f it for a paid project.=20=20
