Subject: [Caml-list] UTP-2014 Unifying Theories of Programming - call for
 papers

**********************************************************************
     5th International Symposium on Unifying Theories of Programming
                       co-located with FM2014
                          May 12 - 13, 2014
                              Singapore
          http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/UTP2014/index.html
**********************************************************************

CALL FOR PAPERS

Interest in the fundamental problem of the combination of formal notations and 
theories of programming has grown consistently in recent years.  The theories 
define, in various different ways, many common notions, such as abstraction, 
refinement, choice, termination, feasibility, locality, concurrency and 
communication.  Despite these differences, such theories may be unified in a 
way which greatly facilitates their study and comparison.  Moreover, such a 
unification offers a means of combining different languages describing various 
facets and artifacts of software development in a seamless, logically 
consistent way.

Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) is widely acknowledged as 
one of the most significant such unification approaches. Based on their 
pioneering work, the aims of the UTP Symposium series are to reaffirm the 
significance of the ongoing UTP project and to stimulate efforts to advance. 
The Symposium provides a focus for the sharing of results by those already 
actively contributing, and raises awareness of the benefits of such 
unifying theoretical frameworks among the wider computer science and software 
engineering communities.

To this end the Symposium welcomes contributions on all the themes that can be 
related to the Unifying Theories of Programming.

SUBMISSIONS

Papers may be up to 20 pages in length and should be prepared using LaTeX in 
Springer LNCS paper format.  Submissions should be made through the UTP 2014
