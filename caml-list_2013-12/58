You seem to forget all the system package managers (dpkg, rpm, ...).
While opam does have its advantages, it does not really compete with them.

The standard generic interface for package-manager-agnostic upstream
packages is:

  ./configure && make && sudo make install PREFIX=3D/foo

If people cannot agree on a standard implementation, at least they could
agree on the interface.
