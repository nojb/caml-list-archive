FUNDING and AWARDS:

CiE 2014 has received funding for student participation from the European
Association for Theoretical Computer Science EATCS.  Please contact the PC
chairs if you are interested.

The best student paper will receive an award sponsored by Springer.


CiE 2014 is the tenth conference organized by CiE (Computability in Europe), 
a European association of mathematicians, logicians, computer scientists,
philosophers, physicists and others interested in new developments in
computability and their underlying significance for the real world. Previous
meetings have taken place in Amsterdam (2005), Swansea (2006), Siena (2007),
Athens (2008), Heidelberg (2009), Ponta Delgada (2010), Sofia (2011),
Cambridge (2012), and Milan (2013).

The motto of CiE 2014 "Language, Life, Limits" intends to put a special focus
on relations between computational linguistics, natural and biological
computing, and more traditional fields of computability theory.  This is to 
be understood in its broadest sense including computational aspects of 
problems in linguistics, studying models of computation and algorithms 
inspired by physical and biological approaches as well as exhibiting limits 
(and non-limits) of computability when considering different models of 
computation arising from such approaches.

As with previous CiE conferences the allover glueing perspective is to
strengthen the mutual benefits of analyzing traditional and new computational
paradigms in their corresponding frameworks both with respect to practical
applications and a deeper theoretical understanding.  We particularly invite
papers that build bridges between different parts of the research community.

For topics covered by the conference, please visit
       http://cie2014.inf.elte.hu/?Topics
We particularly welcome submissions in emergent areas, such as bioinformatics
and natural computation, where they have a basic connection with
computability.
