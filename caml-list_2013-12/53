So, if everybody else have to implement them, opam's install files become a
new standard for the OCaml cummunity? Do most of us agree? (I'm not against
it, I just don't want to rely on 50 different standards).

(BTW, since you generate those .install files you could have generated
install.sh files doing the 'cp's as easily ;) )

yes but in practice `ocamlfind install` is enough to make most dependencies
of a given package work (a few times a `cp exec $BIN` is also needed
indeed).

(A while ago, before opam, a new version of GODI broke on our main platform
because of some ocamlnet configuration bug, but I was able to reinstall
ocaml and about 25 third-party libraries and syntax extensions from scratch
without too much pain =E2=86=92 we see great value in that package-manageme=
nt
independence)
