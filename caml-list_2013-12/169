Eight times as much memory, uniformly packed in three dimensions, is at 
most twice as long in any one dimension.

However, IIRC, Gene Amdahl observed that the limiting characteristic of 
memory size versus speed is actually the surface area of the sphere 
containing the memory, because that controls heat dissipation.  This 
gives an asymptotic square root law.  Various assumptions could 
challenge that, but not as long as memory consumes power in proportion 
to its size.
