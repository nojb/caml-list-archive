There is also another project that took the base radical name SDL2
concatenated with OCaml. The upstream of this draft just took this
name because of a lack of imagination, and also because at the
beginning he was willing to write something that would be painless to
migrate from the origine OCamlSDL. This upstream really don't mind to
rename it into something else if someone suggests a nice name.

Maybe "rsdl2" standing for "relays to SDL2" :o)

This is an interesting point. Since several months, I made the test to
use a localised translation which is not an acronym for talking about
"OSM" to some people in the street and in local shops, and it really
makes it easier to talk about this project then. But such a trick is
maybe not needed for a project targetting people who like cryptic
computer stuff :o)
