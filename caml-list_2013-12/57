Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Library installation procedure (for use with OPAM)?

Le lundi, 9 d=C3=A9cembre 2013 =C3=A0 17:39, Sebastien Mondet a =C3=A9crit :

Frankly besides maybe wodi on windows I'm not so sure I see something reaso=
nably competing with opam at that point, so that "everybody" may not includ=
e a lot of persons. Personally I don't have time to care for alternatives a=
nd I do what minimizes my admin/maintenance time at most.

 different standards).

I don't think it's a question of agreeing, usage will tell. Besides I don't=
 see another standard, maybe `ocamlfind install` but it's limited in what i=
t can install (and I hope that eventually the annoying two-headed structure=
 ocamlfind/opam will disapear, e.g. the notion of ocamlfind package could b=
e merged in the compiler).

stall.sh (http://install.sh) files doing the 'cp's as easily ;) )

Sure but that's one more thing to maintain across all my packages. Besides =
I hope that eventually a good build tool will emerge for OCaml and can gene=
rate these .install files for me, I'm still not fond of having to maintain =
and copy this pkg-builder script across all my packages.=20=20
=20=20
> (a few times a `cp exec $BIN` is also needed indeed).

About half of my packages do that. Besides since with package managers we n=
o longer see the tarballs I think it's a good practice to at least install =
the CHANGES, README and the sample code in the doc directory of a package.

> (A while ago, before opam, a new version of GODI broke on our main platfo=
rm because of some ocamlnet configuration bug, but I was able to reinstall =
ocaml and about 25 third-party libraries and syntax extensions from scratch=
 without too much pain =E2=86=92 we see great value in that package-managem=
ent independence)
Why not. I guess you can see the value of having each of these libraries ge=
nerating a .install file that you can process with a simple command line to=
ol rather than have to deal with the idiosyncrasies of each custom (usually=
 semi-broken) install procedure.

Best,

Daniel
