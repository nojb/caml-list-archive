Subject: [Caml-list] Mismatch between Gc.full_major() documentation and
 behaviour

According to the documentation, the sequence 
"Gc.major();Gc.full_major()" should be equivalent to "Gc.full_major()", 
as Gc.full_major() is told to terminate the current major gc and perform 
a complete new cycle.

In my case it is not the case: "Gc.major(); Gc.full_major()" performs 
more calls to finalisation functions than "Gc.full_major()".

My context: I use a weak hashtables containing finalised value (with 
Gc.finalise).

The documentation of Weak module specifies that the finalization 
function is called after the weak hashtbl/array has been set to none.

Does someone know the explanation of this ?
