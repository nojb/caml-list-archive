                           Call For Papers
                           ===============

 Twelfth International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming
                             (FLOPS 2014)
                            June 4-6, 2014
                           Kanazawa, Japan
                  http://www.jaist.ac.jp/flops2014/

----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Journal publications in JFP (Jounral of Functional Programming) and
TPLP (Theory and Practice of Logic Programming) are planned (see below).

- Hyakumangoku Matsuri
( https://www.google.com/search?q=hyakumangoku%20matsuri&tbm=isch )
is scheduled *just* after FLOPS 2014.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

FLOPS is a forum for research on all issues concerning declarative
programming, including functional programming and logic programming,
and aims to promote cross-fertilization and integration between the
two paradigms.  Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono
(1995), Shonan Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo
(2001), Aizu (2002), Nara (2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008),
Sendai (2010), and Kobe (2012).

Topics
======
FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of functional and logic
programming, including (but not limited to):
- Language issues: language design and constructs, programming
  methodology, integration of paradigms, interfacing with other
  languages, type systems, constraints, concurrency and distributed
  computing.
- Foundations: logic and semantics, rewrite systems and narrowing,
  type theory, proof systems.
- Implementation issues: compilation techniques, memory management,
  program analysis and transformation, partial evaluation,
  parallelism.
- Applications: case studies, real-world applications, graphical user
  interfaces, Internet applications, XML, databases, formal methods
  and model checking.

The proceedings will be published as an LNCS volume.  The proceedings
of the previous meetings (FLOPS 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008,
2010, and 2012) were published as LNCS 1722, 2024, 2441, 2998, 3945,
4989, 6009, and 7294.

Submission
==========
Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere.  Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.  See also ACM
SIGPLAN Republication Policy:
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:
- Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will
  be judged on originality, correctness, and significance.
- System descriptions: they should contain a link to a working system
  and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.
- Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or
  theories with illustrative applications.
System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked
as such in the title.

Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages long
including references, though pearls are typically shorter.  Authors
are required to use LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class file,
available at: http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or
experimental results.  In case of lack of space, this supporting
information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to a Web
page, or an appendix).  Papers should be submitted electronically at:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2014

Important Dates
===============

Submission deadline (EXTENDED):
- Title, abstract, and draft paper by December 13, 2013
- Full paper by December 15, 2013 (23:59 anywhere in the world)

Author notification: February 10, 2014

Camera-ready copy: March 7, 2014

Journal Publication
===================
- Journal of Functional Programming
and
- Theory and Practice of Logic Programming

2-4 of the best papers in each of the two areas: Functional
Programming and Logic Programming, will be invited for inclusion in a
designated FLOPS section within each of the two journals.  The Theory
and Practice of Logic Programming papers will appear as "Rapid
Publications".  All of the these submissions are expected to represent
high-quality revisions and extensions of the selected FLOPS papers and
will be reviewed under the standard criteria of each journal.

Venue
=====
Main Hall, Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art,
2-1 Dewa-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-0963 JAPAN.
