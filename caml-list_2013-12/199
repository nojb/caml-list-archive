Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] final release of OPAM 1.1.0

It probably should have been 2.0.0, but it was too late in the release
cycle before we gave up on 1.0 compatibility.  Upgrades never work for
the first release anyway :-)

Thanks for the Nix package, I'm looking forward to trying it out!
(and a belated thank you to Mehdi Dogguy for upload OPAM 1.1 to Debian
testing as well).
