I think people generally underestimate by how much lower contribution
hurdles or "better user experience" can improve adoption rates.  The
OPAM vs Godi story should act as a reminder for that.  It's not that
Godi couldn't do what OPAM does, in fact, I think it could do pretty
much all of what users and developers needed.  It's just that it
required developers and users to jump through a few more hoops to
achieve the intended results, enough to prevent it from gaining such
quick and wide adoption.

Some of the issues may be more perceived than real.  E.g. a
contributor might fear that their patch is more likely to be ignored
in a bug tracker, maybe because it clashes with newer changes due to
the lack of revision control.  But at the end of the day the only
thing that matters is whether a developer is willing to make a
contribution.  Your milage on larger, more complex projects may vary,
but when I translated/switched my projects from CVS to Mercurial on
Bitbucket (Github surely would be similar), the effort was so
laughably small, literally a few minutes per project, I'd find it hard
to believe that workarounds or improved documentation for better
interaction through SVN could possibly be worth it.

Regards,
Markus
