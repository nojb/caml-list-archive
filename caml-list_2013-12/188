Subject: [Caml-list]  [ANN] Win-builds 1.3 RC1 - Package manager on/for
 Windows with cross-compilers

Hi,

I've released version 1.3 RC1 of my Win-builds project, formerly known
as "yypkg mingw-builds".

Win-builds is a software distribution which targets Windows with both
native and cross toolchains from Linux and provides around 60 packages
of libraries and applications. It is supported by the yypkg package
manager both on Windows and Linux.

Why you shouldn't use this project:
- it works and is therefore going to be fairly boring
- it makes things too easy when dealing with Windows
- it has up-to-date components and is even going to feature security
  update
- but it's not going to be bleeding-edge, which makes it even more
  boring
- binary packages mean you don't get to pass -fomg-optimize and
  -funroll-loops to GCC
- there is too litle Javascript and CSS on its website
- you might find bugs in your own software and build guilt about not
  fixing them
- 1.3 is a bit cumbersome to setup on Linux (although it will work on every
  distribution) and that will only be fixed during January or February
- you might have built your own system or want to do so in the future
- it's not on github
- I still haven't finished pushing my new 10-minutes introduction to
  lablgtk and you resent me from not doing so

PS: the cross-compilation aspect is in my first reply to this message to
make things a bit clearer/cleaner.
