Subject: [Caml-list] FORTE 2014 Call for Papers

===========================================================
                      CALL FOR PAPERS

                        FORTE 2014
                A DisCoTec Member Conference

34th IFIP International Conference on Formal Techniques for
Distributed Objects, Components and Systems

http://www.discotec.org/calls/forte-2014-call-for-papers

Abstract Submission: February 1, 2014
Paper Submission: February 7, 2014
Author Notification: March 10, 2014
=============================================================

FORTE 2014 is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models,
tools, and applications for distributed systems. FORTE 2014 is the
heir to the original FORTE series, FMOODS series and joint
FMOODS/FORTE conference series as part of the DisCoTec 2014 event and
will take place June 3-6, 2014, in Berlin, Germany.

=== Scope ===

The conference solicits original contributions that advance the
science and technologies for distributed systems, with special
interest in the areas of:

- component- and model-based design;
- object technology, modularity, software adaptation;
- service-oriented, ubiquitous, pervasive, grid, cloud, and mobile
   computing systems;
- software quality, reliability, availability, and safety;
- security, privacy, and trust in distributed systems;
- adaptive distributed systems, self-stabilization;
   self-healing/organizing;
- verification, validation, formal analysis, and testing of the above.

Contributions that combine theory and practice and that exploit formal
methods and theoretical foundations to present novel solutions to
problems arising from the development of distributed systems are
encouraged. FORTE covers distributed computing models and formal
specification, testing and verification methods. The application
domains include all kinds of application-level distributed systems,
telecommunication services, Internet, embedded and real-time systems,
cyber-physical systems and sensor networks, as well as networking and
communication security and reliability. Topics of interest include but
are not limited to:

- Languages and semantic foundations:
   new modeling and language concepts for distribution and concurrency,
   semantics for different types of languages, including programming
   languages, modeling languages, and domain-specific languages;
   real-time and probability aspects; type systems and behavioral
   typing;
- Formal methods and techniques:
   design, specification, analysis, verification, validation, testing
   and runtime verification of various types of distributed systems
   including communications and network protocols, service-oriented
   systems, adaptive distributed systems;
- Foundations of security:
   new principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of
   distributed systems, including formal models based on probabilistic
   concepts;
- Applications of formal methods:
   applying formal methods and techniques for studying quality,
   reliability, availability, and safety of distributed systems;
- Practical experience with formal methods:
   industrial applications, case studies and software tools for
   applying formal methods and description techniques to the
   development and analysis of real distributed systems.

=== Submission and publication ===

Contributions must be written in English and report on original,
unpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP's
codes of conduct). The submissions must not exceed 15 pages in length,
including figures and references, prepared using Springer's LNCS style
(cf. http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).

Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may be
rejected immediately, without review.

Papers can be submitted electronically in pdf via the
EasyChair system at the following address:

https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=forte14

The time of all deadlines is 24:00 SST (UTC-11, Samoa Standard Time).

Each paper will undergo a peer review of at least 3 anonymous
reviewers.

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS
Series.
