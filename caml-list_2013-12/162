I think "which control version software to use" should be strictly the
choice of the developers. I've talked repeatedly with some of the major
OCaml developers about that, and my impression is that, so far, they are
happy to use SVN and see no major reason to change. I respect this choice
and don't believe we should put any pressure on their choice of everyday
tools.

I hear the argument that putting a project on github automagically
increases the amount of external contributions. This might be true, but has
yet to be demonstrated. The major entry-point for OCaml development
discussion (besides this list) is the bugtracker:
  http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/
I believe it is rather clear and easy-to-use (not as powerful as bugzilla,
but not as scary either). If you think more visible documentation of where
to go and how to contribute is needed, I'm ready to help make that happen
(for example a page on ocaml.org). On mantis we accept bugreport, which
sometimes turn into development discussion, frown upon feature requests,
and welcome patches, either uploaded as a diff, or as a link to
whatever-web-mirror-for-wichever-dcvs-you-like ( for example feel free to
fork the de-facto-official github mirror, https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/ ,
and send a link to a commit there ).

My understanding of the "if we did X (which requires some not-fascinating
work), we would have more contributions" kind of suggestions is that there
are often cheap to propose and of doubtful effectfulness (some have been
tried in the past, with not-always-convincing results). Some things have
been done which are really nice, such as the "compiler hacking sessions"
organized in the Cambridge area by Jeremy Yallop and Leo White at
OCamllabs, and I hope we have even more of that in the future.

Push ! Push ! This is a push !

I agree that the compiler code could be better commented, and have asked
and obtained agreement to encourage and review patches commenting the code.
Please send anything you've got in that direction, and tell the folks on
this list to do the same.

Well, I would be happy to help discuss and review patches in that
direction. OCaml developers tend to be conservative in things they accept
upstream (anyone would be after 20 years of continuous development of the
same thing, with mistakes of the past bugging you endlessly), but there are
a few notable "external" contributions at each release, do not hesitate to
provide one of them.

I made a talk at an early OCaml User Paris Meeting about (my perception of)
the distribution development, which may be of interest:
