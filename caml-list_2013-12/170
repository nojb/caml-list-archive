git is so superior to svn in every respect that I wish the OCaml
developers would use it.  But as you say it is their choice, and we
have git mirrors.

I can add some (negative) anec-data:

(1) Putting a project on github increases the number of people
submitting bug reports and pull requests using github's proprietary
interface.  This is annoying because you need some way to tell them
not to do this, and to deal with people who do it anyway.  (libguestfs
-- hosted on github -- has an all-caps notice on the front page:
http://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs)

(2) It's easy to run your own git repository with a web interface.
There is nothing magical that github provides here except free
bandwidth and someone who looks after security errata.

Having said that, I truly hate mantis with a passion ...
