What I meant is that annotate the C headers, or similar approaches are
limited if it's about to make a generic way that could be used in most
(or maybe almost all) cases.

A proper description of the APIs would make it possible to divert to
different languages (and maybe even other kind of applications).

XcbProto is designed for our best friend Python, but its upstream
immediatly proposed to complete it with additional elements that we
would need for our programming language of choice.

Sorry it was just ironic :)
Sam already does quite a lot enough. We should not ask too much, or if
we do we should just do ourself what we request from someone else.

Then please try!
