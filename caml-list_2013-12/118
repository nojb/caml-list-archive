When you devise a map data structure you should have both Map.get : 'a t -> key -> 'a, that raises *Invalid_argument* if the key is unbound (that's for code paths were you know the value is in there) and Map.find : 'a t -> key -> 'a option, that returns None if the key is unbound (that's for code paths were you don't know if the value is there).

Here is what I learned some time ago on this very same mailing-list;
at the top of some .ml file:

module Vg = Vector_graphics

I _love_ it.
