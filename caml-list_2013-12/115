There are multiple sdl and opengl bindings. I think there was another
ocamlsdl aside from the current OCamlSDL, and there's sdlcaml which is
packed with glcaml. For OpenGL, there's LablGL, glMLite, and glcaml. And
these are the package names, rather than the module names. It's ripe
territory for naming clashes. :) I've taken an initial stab at my own SDL2
bindings and I've been using Sdl2 as the module name (sdlcaml uses Sdl as
it's module name), but expected that I might change that to something more
distinct if I were to share it.

This does raise a question though... should we be concerned about
module-name clashes for libraries which should be used "one or the other"?
I don't know if some build tool might find libraries by module name now or
in future -- if so, unique module names are important. If not, then I guess
using the same module name is fine, but with a distinct package name.

Sdl, Glut, Qt, Gtk, Xml... it's only cryptic at first, and what would you
really use which is less cryptic? I can understand the desire to have a
library name which at least gives a hint of it's utility, but this isn't
possible in the general case without getting some cumbersome names!
