Since Callback.register has type: string -> 'a -> unit
you are not limited by the ocaml type system.
So you can reset your value with
  Callback.register "foo" 0
and check for equality with Val_int(0) on the C side.
(Note that you must initialize the value to 0 at program startup,
because the default for an unitialized value is 0 which is not
Val_int(0))
