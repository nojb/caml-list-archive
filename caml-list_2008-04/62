The hard bit has almost nothing to do with programming language
and almost everything to do with WAVE (and AIFF and all the other
formats) being extremely poorly and/or loosely specified, with
over 100 data encoding variants and dozens of broken implementations
in the field.

Very early in the libsndfile development process I came up with
a good way of packing and unpacking the headers (ie effectively 
the same  functionality as bitmatch) and everything has been 
built on top of that.
