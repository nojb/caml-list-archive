I found the camlp4 wiki to be somewhat useful, and Martin Jambon /
Nicolas Pouillard's example of the differences between a 3.09 and a
3.10 extension to be a little useful too:

  http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Camlp4
  http://martin.jambon.free.fr/examples/pa_json_static_3100beta.html

AFAIK the list of predefined quotations is the same as for 3.09, but
maybe this page will help:

Use the ordinary syntax instead?
