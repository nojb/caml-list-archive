You've missed lots of even bigger applications of OCaml, like FFTW. You may 
find some of our related blog articles of interest:

http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/functional-programming-in-industry.html
http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/most-popular-functional-languages-on.html
http://ocamlnews.blogspot.com/2007/12/top-10-most-popular-ocaml-programs.html
http://ocamlnews.blogspot.com/2007/09/xensource-sell-for-500m.html

I also forgot to mention that we are following FFTW's lead and using OCaml to 
generate source code in more mainstream languages that we can sell. This is 
technically known as "geometric money in linear time". :-)
