AFAIK it is not possible in general being "just" a forge user and via
the web interface. However, it is (of course) possible if you can make
the admins do that for you.

Migrating from svn to svn (possibly filtering in between) for example is
trivial: dump on one side / filter / restore in the other.

We can of course do that for you if you want (and for anyone else of
course, though remember we are not that much :-)), but while we are at
it please consider migrating from CSV to svn (if you really don't want
to migrate to $DISTRIBUTED_VCS). I did that in the past using cvs2svn
and it worked perfectly starting from a CVS repository sized on the
order of 10'000 commit.

Cheers.
