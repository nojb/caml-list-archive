***********************************************************************

Decidability, and especially complexity and tractability of logical
theories is extremely important for a large number of applications.
Although general logical formalisms are undecidable, decidable theories
- or fragments thereof - (sometimes even with low complexity) often occur
in mathematics, in program  verification, in the verification of reactive,
real time or hybrid systems, as well as in databases and ontologies.
It is therefore important to identify such decidable fragments and design
efficient decision procedures for them. It is equally important to have
uniform methods (e.g. resolution, rewriting, tableaux, sequent calculi,...)
which can be tuned to provide algorithms with optimal complexity.

The goal of CEDAR is to bring together researchers interested in problems
at the interface between automated reasoning and computational complexity,
in particular in:

 - identifying (fragments of) logical theories which are decidable,
   resp. have low complexity, and analyzing possibilities of obtaining
   optimal complexity results with uniform tools;
 - analyzing decidability in combinations of theories and
   possibilities of combining decision procedures;
 - efficient implementations for decidable fragments;
 - application domains where decidability resp. tractability are crucial.

Topics
======
Topics of interest for CEDAR 2008 include (but are not restricted to):

 - Complexity:
   - complexity analysis for fragments of first- (or higher) order logic
   - complexity analysis for combinations of logical theories
     (including parameterized complexity results)

 - Expressibility
   - in logic, automated reasoning, algebra, ...

 - Decidability:
   - decision procedures based on logical calculi such as:
     resolution, rewriting, tableaux, sequent calculi, or natural deduction
   - decidability in combinations of logical theories
   - specialized decision procedures

 - Application domains for which complexity issues are essential
   (verification, security, databases, ontologies, ...)

The goal of CEDAR is to bring together researchers interested in exploring
the topics above, both at a theoretical level and motivated by applications,
and to enhance the interaction between automated reasoning and computational
complexity through invited and contributed talks.

Submission and selection procedure:
===================================
We plan to accept three types of papers:

 - Original papers (up to 15 pages, LNCS style, including bibliography);
   should describe original research and contain sufficient detail to
   assess the merits and relevance of the contribution.

 - Work in progress (up to 6 pages, LNCS style, without bibliography).

 - Presentation-only papers (please submit an abstract of up to 3 pages,
   LNCS style + a link to the already published paper): may describe work
   previously published. The abstracts of accepted presentation-only papers
   will appear in the informal proceedings to be distributed at the workshop
   (full papers in this category will not be inserted in the proceedings).

Given   the informal style of  the  workshop, the submission of papers
presenting student's work and work in progress is encouraged. The purpose
of the presentation-only papers  is to allow researchers to communicate
good ideas that the attendees may not be aware of.


Submission of papers is via Easychair
            http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cedar2008

Publication:
============
The final versions of the selected  contributions will be collected in
a volume to be distributed at the workshop. These informal proceedings
will also be made accessible on the web.
