Hello,

Ocsigen seems to have sparked an emerging interest for web frameworks written in functional languages.
I'd like to compile an exhaustive list of pages or sites using Ocaml as frontends or backends, with the
technologies they use.  Please do not hesitate to add any past or present running Ocaml site or page,
even if its a personal site.

Public sites:
* Gerd's Camlcity: http://www.camlcity.org/
* The Ocsigen site itself: http://ocsigen.org/
* The Merjis site and Cocanwiki: http://merjis.com/
* The ara and anla servers, part of the EDOS project : http://brion.inria.fr/ara http://brion.inria.fr/anla
Runs using a small multithreaded HTTP module, with gzip compression, and a simple sum type for documents.
* I'll insert a shameless plug for a comic strip in french, Massacre Ã  la Ronchonneuse (http://ronchonneuse.com/),
which runs under my pet Ocaml framework thru lighttpd + SCGI; thanks to Sexplib for the persistance!

Many other people rolled their own HTTP servers (for instance Stefano Zacchiroli's ocaml-http).  Please tell
if they are or were running somewhere.

* Does ocamlcore.org run under Ocaml?

Off-line generation:
* Alain Frisch's personal site: http://alain.frisch.fr/ generated using Cduce, of course

CGIs:
* The Caml Humps, which I assume run as Ocaml CGI scripts: http://caml.inria.fr//cgi-bin/hump.en.cgi
* Aurochs parser demo: http://aurochs.fr/cgi/demo.cgi (mine)

Backends:
* I have been told Wink uses Ocaml as a backend.

Intranet:
* Impala at INRIA
* From my Paris 7 days I recall a webapp to allocate teachers and assistants to courses.  I seem to remember
that it was written in Ocaml?  I'm sure there are other internal apps at Paris 7 in Ocaml.

Possible candidates:
* Lexify
* Jane Street
* Haxe and Motion Twin
