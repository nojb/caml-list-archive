I think what Arthur meant by "provably correct" was "has well-defined semantics,
aiding proofs of correctness."

You have a point, from a prescriptive point of view. But in the common usage
"provable" and "proved" are sometimes interchanged. Most computer scientists
aren't Platonists: "provable" means "I could describe the proof for you, step by
step, if you like, but let's save some time by skipping it." Saying a claim is
"provable" without working out the proof begs the question.
