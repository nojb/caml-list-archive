Sure, but it is very helpful to get some feedback!

I've been able to reproduce the problem in byte-code only, when the main 
program is linked in -custom mode. The reason is that the -Wl,-E was not 
passed to the linker. This is now fixed in the CVS. (For a quick test, 
you can try to pass "-ccopt -Wl,-E" explicitly to ocamlc when linking.)

For the native-code, I don't know. Can you show me the command line 
passed to the linker (ocamlopt -verbose)? You should see -Wl,-E.
If you compile with -noautolink, you must add "-ccopt -Wl,-E" manually.


Cheers,

Alain
