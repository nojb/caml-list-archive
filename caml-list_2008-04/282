Thanks for raising this up again.

I'm not going to make my nominations with this post, but rather a
methodological suggestion. Mailing lists are good to discuss things, but
not for deciding; they usually work for that when one solutions can be
arguably proven better than the others. In our case I fear that the
thread can diverge.

What about the following 2 phases:
1) prepare a list of nominations, maybe as a page on cocanwiki
2) vote on them using a Doodle poll

Of course, since we are a do-ocracy and you are doing the work, the vote
will be by no mean constraining; but I assume you are interested in
collecting the desire of the community, otherwise you wouldn't have
started this thread in the first place.

I think that a wiki page + a vote can give us they same feedback you
could have got on the list, and we will avoid tons of AOL messages :-)

Just my 0.02â‚¬
Cheers.
