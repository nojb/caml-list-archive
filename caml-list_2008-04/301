But you'll also kill OCaml compiler development.  The *.cm* files
contain representations of the type system, and research on the type
system is the main point of OCaml which is why it changes so much.

Anyway we already have (safe) meta-tools.  We don't need ones which
hack away at internal representations, even if that is a common
development model for Java class files.
