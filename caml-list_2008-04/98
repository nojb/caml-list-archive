Hi,

It's not silly if you intend to make clear what comes from upstream
and what has been modified.  Debian packages are organised like this:
unmodified upstream tarball + Debian patches.  In a different domain,
the American constitution works the same way: there's the original
text + patches (that go by the name "amendments").

Cheers,
Dario
