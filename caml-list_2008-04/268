Of course we'll just add an extra Int module and leave Pervasives alone, or at
least make it trigger a warning.

I agree, and someone might write an optimized version for ints or floats.

But Xset & Xmap also provide opportunities to add some missing functions.
In particular, I often use Sets or Maps as a good priority queue/heap substitute, and
reverse_fold / reverse_iter come in handy.

The only problem is that I have an allergy to CamlCaseIdentifiers but I'll
just swallow some antiHistaminics.
