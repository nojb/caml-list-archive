[Sorry for the noise on this list, but]

I have some question about dypgen, but my attempts to 1) subscribe to 
the mailing list and 2) send mails to it, seem to have fallen into a 
black hole.  Does anyone know if it is still 'active'?  While I 
currently need dypgen's full power, I was hoping to be able to use a 
full GLR parser in my current work.

Jacques C.
