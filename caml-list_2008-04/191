Thanks.
I'll look at the code for a better understanding.

I think that the 2 following cases are pretty common:

a. inserting some constant code once at the beginning of the file (or
    module), such as "open Foo"
b. replacing a str_item by other str_items

Both were problematic in camlp4 3.09, requiring some fragile or 
undocumented hacks. It would be extremely useful to have a clean solution 
to these problems.

It seems to me that both (a) and (b) could be implemented and 
made available in the toplevel without theoretical difficulties.

I can imagine a third situation consisting in performing a full 
file/module analysis and inserting something at the beginning or at the 
end. That also could be implemented, although it would clearly not be 
available in the toplevel.
