The current plans are to have two sets of extensions inside Batteries
Included:
* a few will be opened by default
* some others will just be part of the distribution, with instructions
in a common format, regarding how to activate & use them

In either case, we will probably have a slightly customized ocamlbuild
which doesn't need special plug-ins for these extensions (that's part of
Edgar's side of the work).

Cheers,
 David
