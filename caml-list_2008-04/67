LPAR 2008

15th International Conference on
Logic for
Programming,
Artificial Intelligence and
Reasoning

Doha, Qatar
November 22-27, 2008

http://www.qatar.cmu.edu/lpar08/

The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, 
Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year 
after year, some of the most renowned researchers in the areas of 
automated reasoning, computational logic, programming languages and 
their applications come to present cutting-edge results, to discuss 
advances in these fields, and to exchange ideas in a scientifically 
emerging part of the world. The 2008 edition will be held in Doha, 
Qatar, on the premises of the Qatar campus of Carnegie Mellon 
University.

Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in 
Computer Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational 
to the applied. At one extreme, it underlies computability and 
complexity theory and the formal semantics of programming languages. 
At the other, it drives billions of gates every day in the digital 
circuits of processors of all kinds. Logic is in itself a powerful 
programming paradigm but it is also the quintessential specification 
language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems to 
networked infrastructures. It is logical techniques that link 
implementation and specification through formal methods such as 
automated theorem proving and model checking. Logic is also the stuff 
of knowledge representation and artificial intelligence. Because of 
its ubiquity, logic has acquired a central role in Computer Science 
education.

New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are 
welcome. Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may 
examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing 
theories and practices. Topics of interest include, but are not 
limited to:

     * Automated reasoning
     * Interactive theorem proving
     * Implementations of logic
     * Proof assistants
     * Program and system verification
     * Model checking
     * Rewriting and unification
     * Logic programming
     * Constraint programming
     * Logic and databases
     * Modal and temporal logics
     * Proof-carrying code
     * Translation validation
     * Logic for the semantic web
     * Foundations of security
     * Description logics
     * Non-monotonic reasoning
     * Specification using logics
     * Logic in artificial intelligence
     * Lambda calculus
     * Constructive logic and type theory
     * Computional interpretations of logic
     * Logical foundations of programming
     * Logical aspects of concurrency
     * Logic and computational complexity
     * Knowledge representation and reasoning
     * Reasoning about actions
     * Proof planning
     * Effectively presented structures
     * Logic of distributed systems

Invited Speakers
----------------
It has been a tradition of LPAR to invite some of the most influential 
researchers in the focus areas to discuss their work and their vision 
for their fields. We are honored that the following members of the 
community have accepted this invitation.

     * Edmund Clarke, Carnegie Mellon University (USA)

Other invited speakers will be announced soon

Submission Instructions
-----------------------
Submissions must not substantially overlap papers that have been 
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a 
conference with proceedings. Papers should be submitted in Portable 
Document Format (PDF); papers submitted in a proprietary word 
processor format such as Microsoft Word cannot be considered. 
Submissions can be of two types:

     * Regular papers are meant to describe solid new research 
results. They can be up to 15 pages long in LNCS style, including 
figures, bibliography and appendices.
     * Short papers are intended to report on interesting work in 
progress. They can be at most 5 pages long in the LNCS style.

Papers can be electronically submitted by visiting 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dlpar2008
. Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract 
a week before the paper submission deadline (see below).

As with the previous editions, the accepted regular papers of LPAR'08 
will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series. They will be available at the conference.

Programme Committe Chairs
-------------------------
     * Iliano Cervesato (Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar)
     * Helmut Veith (Technische Universit=E4t Darmstadt, Germany)
     * Andrei Voronkov (University of Manchester, UK)

Participation
-------------
Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of 
them will be present at the conference. Papers that do not adhere to 
this policy will be removed from the proceedings.
