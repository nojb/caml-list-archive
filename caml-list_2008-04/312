Since I am reading the "Haskell School of expressions" right now (to  =

become better at functional Programming, not to leave my favourite  =

language :)) I am starting to like the way you can turn any function int=
o  =

an infix operator by using quotes. Wouldn't it be possible to have  =

something similar to this in OCaml? I don't think there is an easy way t=
o  =

do this yet, since I didn't find anything on this topic.

I am posting this in this thread, because this would allow us to write t=
he  =

above more elegantly as:
1 `mem` [1;2;3], which is close to what was originally proposed.

What do you think of this?

There once was a man from the sticks
Who liked to compose limericks.
But he failed at the sport,
For he wrote 'em too short.
