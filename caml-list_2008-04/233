Your threaded code is going to look really stupid when you have NUMA
machines with dozens of cores.  Why are we optimizing for a case (SMP)
which will only be around for a few years.  Arguably SMP isn't even
around now ... the AMD machine on which I'm typing this is firmly NUMA
with a good 10% penalty for accessing memory owned by the other
socket.

Why should a concurrent GC be developed?  Threaded code is a nightmare
to write & debug, and it's only convenient for lazy programmers who
can't be bothered to think in advance about how they want to share
data.  OCaml supports fork, event channels & shared memory right now
(and has done for years) so there is no penalty to writing it
properly.

Huh?  OCaml scripts work perfectly well, they're compiled when you run
them.  I use them all the time.

What distro are you using?  Obviously one where you can't just
apt-get / yum install / godi whatever all the libraries and support
software you need.  There is no "package headache" over in Debian /
Fedora / GODI at all.
