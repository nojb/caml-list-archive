I'm interessted in the cleanest way to solve a problem, whether it's 
functional or imperative or oo in the end doesn't matter. And replacing a 
simple thing with myriads of exception code and workarounds is not my 
unterstanding of "easily useable".
But that discussion is academic, nothing will evolve here,
