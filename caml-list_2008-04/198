Hi,

Let me just express my thanks for this initiative -- all of the six
projects you picked are very relevant and address the most pressing
needs of the community!

I have some additional comments on some of these projects:

multicore - I reckon it won't be difficult to find people willing to
  test the new GC;  but should this project be successful, are there
  plans to merge it into mainstream?

menhir - there's another feature that Menhir could benefit from:
  better integration with Ulex;  I believe that Menhir's developers
  have already expressed their intention of doing this -- are there
  any developments on that front?

qtcaml - I realise this project aims to complete only the first stage
  (it is after all a significant effort);  still, it is a huge step
  forward, so cheers for that.  As previously discussed on this list,
  there are many among us who think of Qt as the best toolkit for
  developing graphical apps and have therefore longed for Ocaml
  bindings.

Cheers,
Dario Teixeira
