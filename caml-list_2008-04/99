I think distributing tarball + patches are ok, but a lot of SCM will
interleave changes which leads you to have a really borderline situation
where delta are not patches... This is a very dangerous interpretation.
I won't go this way -- because this thread will finish as a std battle
of what is SCM, how delta are stored et al...
