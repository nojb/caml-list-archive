Hey David,

Would it be difficult to have python-like syntax for List.exists?  Could we
add it to Hashtbl and Array too?  I'm not too fond of python's general
sloppiness, but the (x in mylist) syntax seemed very pretty to me.  At the
least, it correspondes directly to mathematical syntax (x \in blah, for
Latex ppl).

Does this already exist in a syntax extension?

-Arthur Chan
