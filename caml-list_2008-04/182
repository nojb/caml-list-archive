Hello all,

**OCamlCore.org is ready!**

During the last few weeks, the OCamlCore.org Team, with the help of many other
members of the community, worked hard to fix a number of problems on the site.
Now we think it is ready for prime time. Therefore, following from the previous
announcement [1][2] of the availability of an OCaml planet and the OCaml forge
beta testing, we are now ready to allow full public access to OCaml forge.

  [1] http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/msg/6faedd72f77fd0df
  [2] http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/msg/f8342697120413fd

A forge is a set of services for software projects, including version
control systems (CVS, SVN, ...), mailing lists, download areas, bug
tracking systems, ... Well known examples are sourceforge.net, GNA, and
Savannah. The forge for the OCaml community [3] will be specifically
aimed at hosting software projects related to the OCaml programming
language.

  [3] http://forge.ocamlcore.org/

This new forge has been beta tested, but you could still found some bugs.  In
this case, don't hesitate to submit bug to the Site Admin project [4]

 [4] http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/siteadmin/

So if you want to start an ocaml project on forge.ocamlcore.org, sign-up
for an account on: http://forge.ocamlcore.org

We want to limit the use of this forge to OCaml related project. This include
software or library written in OCaml, but also projects around OCaml, using
derived languages (JoCaml, OCamlDuce, ...) or providing service for OCaml
community (tools for conference organization...).

Help needed
-----------

At the moment, we have set up an hosting service for git and darcs
(git.ocamlcore.org and darcs.ocamlcore.org). We are looking for
experienced forge administrator that can allow us to manage this two SCM
through GForge.  Contact us if you are interested.

We are also looking for talented web designer to make the look of
ocamlcore.org nicer. Join the project ocamlcore-theme and read the
README file to know how to proceed...
