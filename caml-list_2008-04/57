Exactly, parsing the most simple example is trivially easy.

However, being robust to malformed files, working around the broken-ness
where possible and supporting even a small subset of things other than
8/16 bit PCM is a huge task. From where you are now you will be tempted
to fix all these issues one by one. Down that path lines insanity.
