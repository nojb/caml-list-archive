Hello,

I am currently porting code which uses camlp4 from 3.09 to 3.10, and I
am quite stuck.

I would like to know if there is a document which describes the
compatibility breaking differences between the two versions. (The wiki
doesn't seem to have it yet).
It would also help me to know of the predefined quotations, (<:expr<
>>, <:str_item< >>, and such) and what they allow.

For now, I am stuck on this error:

File "pa_ocamlconf.ml", line 78, characters 14-21:
While expanding quotation "str_item" in a position of "expr":
  Parse error: illegal begin of quotation of structure item

The mentioned line 78 is:

  <:str_item< declare end >>

It looks like the "declare end" construct is not allowed any more. Is
there any equivalent in 3.10, and is there a specific bit of
documentation about this?

Thanks,
Loup
