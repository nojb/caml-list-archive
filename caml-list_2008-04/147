Yuck.

It adds more imperative baggage to the language, going against its
"mostly functional" style.  And it doesn't add any expressive power,
since you can easily use exceptions, or bool refs as in Pascal, to
achieve the same effect.

The syntax and semantics would become more much complicated and
irregular.  As others have pointed out, it's not even clear what a lot
of cases should mean.

If you want richer control structures, continuations and call/cc would
be much more in the functional spirit.
