Hi,

After more than 3 years of development, we are pleased to announce that=20
Ocsigen has now reached version 1.0.0!

Ocsigen is a research project aimed at developing new programming technique=
s=20
for the Web. It contains:
 - a fully featured Web server, with lots of extensions,
 - a programming framework, called Eliom, providing an innovative way to=20
create dynamic Websites in OCaml.

The Web server has all the features required to be used as a replacement fo=
r=20
Apache (or others). It is very easy to implement extensions to it in OCaml.=
=20
Among the features that come with Ocsigen are:
 - a CGI module to use Web sites written as CGI scripts (for example trac o=
n=20
ocsigen.org, or even PHP pages through CGI),
 - a reverse proxy module (with pipelined requests) to use Ocsigen together=
=20
with another Web server,
 - a powerful, findlib-aware, configuration file with access control and=20
authentication,
 - a content deflation module
 - user configuration files (beta)

Eliom is the most innovative part of the project. It is a programming=20
framework for dynamic Web programming in OCaml which introduces high-level=
=20
concepts that make programming very concise and safe. The goal is to make=20
large pieces of code easy to maintain and evolve. For example:
 - it is possible to check statically the types of html fragments so as to=
=20
guarantee the validity of pages (with respect to W3C recommendations). Type=
=20
checking is done either using polymorphic variants or with OCamlDuce,
 - pages are generated by OCaml functions with an abstract notion=20
of "service". This ensures that there will be no broken links, and no wrong=
=20
parameter names,
 - the full taxonomy of services closely matches the needs of Web developer=
s,
 - it uses continuation-based Web programming for handling the "back button=
",
 - it provides a powerful session mechanism,
 - etc.

Eliom is not a Content Management System, but is intended to be the basis f=
or=20
such higher-level tools. Several projects have already been initiated by th=
e=20
community, like Nurpawiki (by Janne Hellsten), Litiom and Lambdium (by Dari=
o=20
Teixeira), or Ocsimore (by Piero Furiesi and Jaap Boender). We think that t=
he=20
project is now mature enough for wider dissemination and we hope some of yo=
u=20
will be interested in joining the community to develop new sites with Eliom!

Version 1.0.0 is only the beginning of Ocsigen's story. We have many things=
 in=20
mind for the future. We have already been working, for the last few months,=
=20
on a version 2 which will make it very easy to write Web sites that are=20
highly dynamic on both client and server side.

Ocsigen is developed as a collaborative open source project. If you need an=
y=20
features that are not implemented, please feel free to contribute!

Ocsigen is a research project of the PPS laboratory (CNRS, universit=C3=A9=
=20
Paris-Diderot). It is developed by Vincent Balat, J=C3=A9r=C3=B4me Vouillon=
, Gabriel=20
Kerneis, St=C3=A9phane Glondu, Denis Berthod, Jaap Boender, Piero Furiesi,=
=20
Thorsten Ohl, Nataliya Guts, J=C3=A9r=C3=B4me Velleine and Pierre Clairamba=
ult. I=20
really want to thank all of them, and also the whole community of=20
beta-testers for their very interesting contributions.

We hope that you'll enjoy this version, and we wish you happy programming w=
ith=20
Eliom!

Vincent Balat [for the Ocsigen team]
