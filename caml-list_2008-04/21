There's lots of room for optimization in the current code.  It mainly
aims to be working.

At the moment you cannot define and reuse patterns, but it's certainly
something which could be added (as in micmatch).

However it is easy to modify the examples so they match over TCP and
UDP packets, either by adding a second whole case to the top level
bitmatch, or by adding a sub-bitmatch matching the payload.
