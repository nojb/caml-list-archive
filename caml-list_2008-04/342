Hello,

I've come across the following problem with the ocamlbuild.
When it runs myocamlbuild plugin, this plugin seems to try
to remove log file, which in turn fails with "Permission
denied" exception (due to sharing violation). This behavior
seems quite strange; why should it remove log file for the
second time? 

It is really a bug, or I'm missing something?

I use Ocaml built from CVS (snapshot on April, 1) with
MSVC. But 3.10.2 seems to exhibit the same behavior (when
built with MSVC as well).
