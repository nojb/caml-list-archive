I feel very happy to hear this - I could imagine QPL's "separate"
requirement getting enforced even among developers, which would
certainly cause pain for development.

Actually, github has a one-click "download tarball" button, but I've an
issue in their tracker to disable it for this project as to not violate
your license.

I don't mind making releases as original sources + patch, especially if
this makes you happier.

A large part of my problem with patches comes to this - there's often
not enough information in them to know which version of the original
OCaml sources they apply to.  My repository will track your CVS, so yes,
your changes will appear as patches as well.  The commits are still
marked with the CVS id of the INRIA user that committed them, so the
origin of a patch could be determined, but it'd take a bit of time.

If it pleases you, I'll have a repository for developers (and make it
easy to get on the list of developers), and make any official releases
as ocaml-source + patch -- QPL-style.

I'd rather have the development repository public -- the more hoops to
jump through to submit code, the less code submissions.  As to the
letter of the QPL...  we'll stay away from that flamewar.
