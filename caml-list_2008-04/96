I have no legal experience, I am not a lawyer etc ...

But this sounds okay.  You're never actually distributing the changed form.  
You are simply distributing the patches and software to automate the patching 
process.

My opinion is probably biased though.  I've always thought QPL was a silly 
license.  The whole idea that you can release source + patches but not the 
patched sources seems absurd to me.  There is no difference between the two.  
All the necessary bits are there.  It's like saying you can release the 
source code in ASCII format but not UTF-8.
