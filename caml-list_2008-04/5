One  no  longer  have  it. Indeed the representation is no longer a list but a
tree  using  binary  nodes  like  ';;'.  In  expression  one  can use the list
antiquotation  ($list:...$)  but that's a sugar for calling a function, such a
sugar is not really feasible in patterns.

Hum  no  need for str_item*s* since str_item do the job with it's ';;' (or ';'
in revised) binary node.

No because one cannot inject code in patterns.

That's a bug due to an ambiguity in the original grammar since the ';;' is optional.

It  should  be  <:str_item<  $_$ ;; $_$ >>, but perhaps the bug above insert a
useless nil node :(

> 5. What is Register.OCamlPreCastPrinter good for?

Perhaps  not  that useful... It allows to register an existing printer that is
really  tied  to  the  PreCast  world,  it  doesn't  force you to provide some
abstract functor.

Great!

The latter seems better.
