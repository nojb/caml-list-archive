There is just a little CGI script written with ocamlnet(CGI)+sqlite to
manage feed subscription. Most of the website is run through standard
web application that can be found directly in debian (gforge, planet,
mailman...).

But we are open to include more OCaml part, for replacing non-OCaml
part (for now we want something working to know what interest OCaml
community -- then we can choose what should be the bigger/best part to
replace with a great ocaml application).
