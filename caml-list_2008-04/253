                           Haskell 08

               ACM SIGPLAN 2008 Haskell Symposium
               Victoria, British Columbia, Canada
                Thursday, 25th September, 2008

                     FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS

             http://haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2008

   The Haskell Symposium 2008 is part of the 2008 International Conference
   on Functional Programming (ICFP) as an associated ACM SIGPLAN sponsored
   symposium.

   The purpose of the Haskell Symposium is to discuss experience with
   Haskell, and future developments for the language. The scope of the
   symposium includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory,
   application, implementation, and teaching of Haskell. Topics of
   interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
     * Language Design, with a focus on possible extensions and
       modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the
       status quo;
     * Theory, in the form of a formal treatment of the semantics of the
       present language or future extensions, type systems, and
       foundations for program analysis and transformation;
     * Implementations, including program analysis and transformation,
       static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and
       distributed architectures, memory management as well as foreign
       function and component interfaces;
     * Tools, in the form of profilers, tracers, debuggers,
       pre-processors, and so forth;
     * Applications, Practice, and Experience, with Haskell for scientific
       and symbolic computing, database, multimedia and Web applications,
       and so forth as well as general experience with Haskell in
       education and industry;
     * Functional Pearls, being elegant, instructive examples of using
       Haskell.

   Papers in the latter two categories need not necessarily report
   original research results; they may instead, for example, report
   practical experience that will be useful to others, re-usable
   programming idioms, or elegant new ways of approaching a problem. The
   key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from
   which other practitioners can benefit. It is not enough simply to
   describe a program!

   Before 2008, the Haskell Symposium was known as the Haskell
   Workshop.  The name change reflects the steady increase of
   influence of the Haskell Workshop on the wider community, as well
   as an increasing numbers of high quality submissions making the
   acceptance process highly competitive.  Previously, Haskell
   Workshops have been held in La Jolla (1995), Amsterdam (1997),
   Paris (1999), Montreal (2000), Firenze (2001), Pittsburgh (2002),
   Uppsala (2003), Snowbird (2004), Tallinn (2005),
   Portland, Oregon (2006), Freiburg (2007).

Submission Details

     * Submission Deadline: Monday, June 23rd 2008
          (9:00 am, Samoa Standard Time, UTC -11)
     * Author Notification: Friday, July 18th 2008
     * Final Papers Due: Monday, July 28th 2008

   Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
   using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines
   (http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm). The length is
   restricted to 12 pages, and the font size 9pt. Each submission must
   adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as explained on the web.
   Violation risks summary rejection of the offending submission.

   Paper submissions can be made via the easychair webpage
   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=haskell08

   Accepted papers will be published by the ACM and will appear in the ACM
   Digital Library.

   If there is sufficient demand, we will try to organize a time slot for
   system or tool demonstrations. If you are interested in demonstrating a
   Haskell related tool or application, please send a brief demo proposal
   to Andy Gill, andy@galois.com.
