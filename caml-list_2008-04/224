Hi, all--

I am attempting to package Ocamlnet for Arch Linux; in the README, Gerd 
suggests splitting the package into several parts--core and various 
add-ons--to keep dependencies sane. Sounds good to me, and I'm trying to 
do it that way. So I have built and installed the core, and am now 
working on the SSL component. However, even though I use the 
-without-core option as recommended, the entire core still seems to get 
built (and installed). The following is my build function. Arch is a 
rather minimalist distribution so, although the package builder does a 
few things before and after the build, I'm pretty sure it doesn't 
intervene in the build process itself--so my script should be doing 
exactly the same as if I executed the commands manually. The patch is 
just a very simple tweak to add a $(OCAMLFIND_INSTFLAGS) argument to the 
'ocamlfind install' command in Makefile.rules.


build() {
   cd "$srcdir/ocamlnet-$pkgver"

   patch -p1 <../ocamlnet-install.patch

   ./configure -without-core -enable-ssl -bindir /usr/bin -datadir 
/usr/share/ocamlnet

   make all
     INC_NETSYS="-package netsys" \
     INC_NETSTRING="-package netstring" \
     INC_EQUEUE="-package equeue" \
     INC_NETCGI1="-package netcgi1" \
     INC_NETCGI2="-package netcgi2" \
     INC_NETPLEX="-package netplex" \
     INC_RPC="-package rpc" \
     INC_SHELL="-package shell" \
     || return 1
   make opt
     INC_NETSYS="-package netsys" \
     INC_NETSTRING="-package netstring" \
     INC_EQUEUE="-package equeue" \
     INC_NETCGI1="-package netcgi1" \
     INC_NETCGI2="-package netcgi2" \
     INC_NETPLEX="-package netplex" \
     INC_RPC="-package rpc" \
     INC_SHELL="-package shell" \
     || return 1

   mkdir -p $pkgdir/usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/stublibs
   make DESTDIR=$pkgdir \
     OCAMLFIND_INSTFLAGS="-destdir $pkgdir/usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib 
-ldconf ignore" \
     install
}


So, am I doing something wrong?
