Just a small correction, if you will alow me. When we speak of
correctness of a programming language we do not say that "syntax is
provably correct" but rather that the "implementation is correct".

For example, we could say "Ocaml has a correct compiler" in the sense
that type-safe programs don't explode (which is false), or "functional
core of Ocaml has correct operational semantics" with respect to
standard domain-theoretic denotational semantics. But we do not say "the
mem syntax is provably correct".

Actually, the whole phrase "provably correct" is often misused in
computer science, at least the way I understand it. If you prove
something then it is "proved correct", while a thing is "provably
correct" if we _could_ prove it correct. Perhaps a native speaker of
English can clarify this point.

I rather like the Python comprehension syntax, as well as Haskell's. I
also really like Haskell's infix notation x `op` y.

Isn't everything on this list a minor quibble? ;-)
