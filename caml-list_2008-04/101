Yeah, Edgar was also just pointing out that (source + patches) allows one to 
easily recover the source whereas patched sources do not.

(source + patches) is more equivalent to (patched sources + original sources).

In any event, I'm not saying such a format is bad for releasing code.  I 
simply think it is a tad silly for a distribution license to specify, so 
precisely, the format the code is to be released in.  Releasing the code as 
(patched sources + original sources) for example, seems just as reasonable... 
but it is unclear if that is allowed.
