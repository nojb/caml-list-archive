Agreed - then we could also have more sensibly located functions such as
Int.of_string (note that it's the same length as int_of_string!!) and remove
lots of random functions from Pervasives!

All that said, and especially as StdLib changes are reasonably rare, I find
having files IntSet.ml and IntSet.mli containing:

include Set.Make(struct type t = int let compare = Pervasives.compare end)

and

include Set.S with type elt = int

isn't too bad (except that you have to include IntSet.cmo/.cmx when
compiling, obviously)
