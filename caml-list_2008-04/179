Hi Greg,

Not sure if you're aware but there is already a functional programming 
interest group in Seattle, SeaFunc.  We have been meeting approximately 
every 4 weeks since 2004.  For the sake of people deciding which group 
to follow, could you explain the differences of your scope?  (We also 
discuss Haskell, OCaml, and Scala, among other things.)

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/SeaFunc/

Our regularly scheduled meeting is also tomorrow, April 16 (later at 
8pm) at Ralph's Grocery downtown.  Check the list for details.


Jeff Henrikson
