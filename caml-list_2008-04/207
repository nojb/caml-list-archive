I tried to sign up for the Forge, but I never got the verification
email.  I tried logging in anyway, and it told me I was not verified,
and saw the option to resend the verification email, however I still
haven't received it, and it's been over 24 hours. (and yes, I put the
right email! :P)

Any idea what's up?
