For anyone who is interested: we were having a quiet period with regard to our 
OCaml products lately until the OCaml Journal published an article on LLVM 
last month. This seems to have sparked a lot of interest in OCaml from that 
community because this is a great choice of language for many of the people 
trying to write compiler front-ends that use LLVM.

There are other aspects of commonality between OCaml and LLVM interest at the 
moment. I see the topic of C++ parsers arose again here recently 
(Olmar/Elsa). The LLVM guys are struggling to write C and C++ front-ends for 
LLVM but they appear to be doing everything from scratch in C/C++. I have 
been biting my lip trying not to say "Use OCaml!" on their mailing list but 
perhaps someone with relevant OCaml experience could provide them with a 
better starting point like a mini implementation?

Finally, one of our customers can up with a great suggestion: that we list 
OCaml-related projects on our site that we believe would benefit the 
community. One of the first things I would like to list is the creation of a 
library that allows FFIs to be autogenerated at run-time using LLVM, thus 
obviating the need for C stubs. I think this would be tremendously useful.
