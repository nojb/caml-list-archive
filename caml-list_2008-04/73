Dynlink cannot access the X functor, but it can register itself.

You  can  either  reuse  the  current setup, by clearing the PreCast.Syntax in
between but also setup another registration functor.

I think that's doable (not tested), basically you need three primitive functors:

Register : (Syntax -> Syntax) -> Unit
Clear    : Unit -> Unit
Apply    : Syntax -> Syntax
