Thanks for your replies.  I've created a list at the Cocan wiki.  Please correct
any inaccuracies and provide details, if you can, about what you used.

   http://cocan.org/web_sites_using_ocaml

I don't know what the owners of the COCAN wiki would think about it, but IMHO
it would be appropriate for the authors/maintainers of these sites to explain
the techniques they used in a small page.  Some performance metrics could also
make "dynamic fanboys" envious (I'm thinking of Ruby users frustrated by the
excruciating slowness of that language). This could also apply to other
software projects.

Think of prospective new users looking for what they could do in Ocaml.

BTW the COCAN wiki is a great place for centralized information and the wiki
itself is a joy to use.

PS.  I've also added an "Ocaml success stories" page with a list of well-known Ocaml
software (coq, unison, mldonkey, etc.)
