Our OCaml and F#.NET Journal articles are all generated from custom source by 
an OCaml program:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_journal/
  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/fsharp_journal/

We are in the process of converting the entire site to being autogenerated by 
similar OCaml programs. However, we have yet to do anything dynamic 
(including a shopping cart). I'd appreciate any advice on that, BTW.
