You are very optimistic here. I'm a power user of a number of
serializers (JSON, XDR, ICEP), and it is not the problem that one format
is binary, and the other text, but that serialized representations are
usually not self-describing. So even if you could simply read in a cmi
into your program, the problem remains how to interpret it. You cannot
overcome the dependency on a certain O'Caml version by switching to a
text format.

You can do that already for cmi's. Just create a file "dummy.ml" with

include Name_of_cmi

in it and run "ocamlc -c -i dummy.ml" on it which prints the definitions
of the cmi as readable text. Ok, there's more in it than only
definitions, but the ocaml distribution includes a program called
objinfo that allows you to inspect cmi's, cmo's and cma's, e.g. you can
view the MD5 sums.

Which tools for example?
