You cannot coerce to a type that is not yet (fully) defined.
In practice, what happens is that (e :> a) is just interpreted as
(e : a), so that you are unifying a and b, with the above error.

As an exception to the above rule, you can coerce self toward the
currently defined class (i.e. coerce self to a inside a), but only if
self is covariant in itself. Here you coerce b to a inside b, so this
doesn't apply.
