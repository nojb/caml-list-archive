Hello,

I checked the subscription to the list and it works.
I suggest that you try again to subscribe to the list since only
list members can post to the list.
The subscriptions to free.fr mailing lists may have been
down when you attempted to subscribe.
The subscription process is a bit misleading:
To subscribe send an email to dypgen-request@ml.free.fr
with 'subscribe' as subject.
Then you receive an email with object: "Subscription confirmation for
'dypgen'"
This is not a confirmation that you've subscribed.
You have to answer this email to confirm your subscription.
Once you receive an email with object: "Welcome to list 'dypgen'"
the subscription is completed.

You can also send your questions to me at my email adress.

Emmanuel
