Yes.

Yes, the fact to accept an added infix between parentheses is not
automatic and you have to add a grammar rule to parse that. At the
expr level "simple". It should work, but I have not tested.

The lexer Plexer is not extensible. It is possible to create an
extensible lexer with extensible grammars but the time performances
are very bad. I would like to find a solution to be able to extend it
without slowing down the system, but for the moment, I have no idea...
