I'm probably missing something obvious, but how do you store a polymorphic 
variant in a field in a record?  Before, when I just used a normal variant 
type I called "primitive", all I did was
  type my_object = { object_data : primitive; (* etc. *) }

Is there a type that means "any polymorphic variant"?  Trying to set
  type primitive = [ `PTest ]
forces only `PTest to be the value of object_data.  How can I allow anything 
to be stored there?

Thanks,
