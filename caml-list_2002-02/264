Sure, but I think that the installation of any software on a local machine
requires a certain amount of trust: even if the application is easy
to install and uninstall (which is the case of precompiled Caml
distributions), the user cannot be sure of this in advance - and won't be
unless everybody already uses it.

The other advantage (and danger) of a public interactive book is that it
would be really provocative. That could be a good way to promote Caml.
