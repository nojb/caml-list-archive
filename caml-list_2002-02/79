Hello,

I would like to adapt pretty-printing of OCaml-sources with camlp4 to
match my style.  What would be the best way to go about this? Just copy
e.g. camlp4/etc/pr_o.ml and change it to my needs? Or are there more
convenient ways to parameterize the existing pretty-printers (quite
complex stuff)?

People might find a transition between syntaxes easier if they can
parameterize pretty-printers for automatic conversion so that they end
up with sources that match their style very closely.

I have played around a bit with pretty-printing some of my existing
sources and would say that translating them to e.g. revised syntax would
be almost zero effort if I could easily tweak the pretty-printers a
bit here and there. In fact, I have already seen more badly formatted
OCaml-code written by humans, which indicates that feeding external
sources through the pretty-printers might always be a good idea... ;)

Regards,
Markus Mottl
