I'd suggest lowercase 'l' for 32-bit and uppercase 'L' for 64-bit :

	0xffffffffl = -1	32-bit signed
	0xffffffffffffffffL = -1 (64-bit signed)
	1239884378742340923094029042n   bigint

Maybe 'z' instead of 'n' sound better ?

Wonderful, that's a good reason to upgrade.

Granted that Caml doesn't make coding low-level cryptographic
primitives (at least, usual bit-fiddling ones) easier or safer.
However, when you want to implement a new crypto algorithm to do some
empirical cryptanalysis on it (statistical tests etc.) it's painful to
have to implement it in C, then interface C to Caml. I'd rather write
it directly in Caml. Being able to interface to C is an excellent
feature, but I'd also like to be able to do everything reasonably
efficiently in Caml. Further, if I write my algorithms in Caml, one
day if the compiler becomes smart enough it can be as efficient as C.

So, what about the rotate ?
