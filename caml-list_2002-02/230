Hi,

This is the official announcement of the long time delayed new version
of Active-DVI.

      Active-DVI is a presenter and previewer for texts or slides
      written in LaTeX, hence the presentation tool of choice for the
      discriminating hacker.

Although this version has no known bugs at all, it is still for brave
souls, since the installation is not yet fully automatic (see
below). However, we daily use this version of Active-DVI for
presentations: once installed, the software is easy to use and
reliable.

We hope you will adopt Active-DVI and participate to the development
efforts by providing some nice example presentations or templates for
regular slides presentation LaTeX packages, may be some new LaTeX
macro set, or even some fancy effects Caml module of your own, ready
to incorporate into Active-DVI.

Enjoy!

For the Active-DVI development team, 15th february 2002,

Jun Furuse (Jun.Furuse@inria.fr) & Pierre Weis (Pierre.Weis@inria.fr)



                       Active-DVI



Version 1.0 is now available. As the release number shows, this is a
major improvement w.r.t version 0.4 of Active-DVI.

This new version has been developed by Jun Furuse, Didier Rémy and
Pierre Weis with also contributions by Didier Le Botlan, Roberto Di
Cosmo, Xavier Leroy, and Alan Schmitt.

In addition to the regular features of the Active-DVI previewer:

   * Encapsulated Postscript File inclusion
     (using the graphics LaTeX package)

   * Some effects for presentation (pause, delay, text color change) 

this release introduces a lot of new features

   * Interactive demos, via launching of applications from within the slides

   * Background colors and background images for slides

   * Annotations of texts (visible when the mouse is on the annotated text)

   * Hyper references from slide to slide or to other dvi files

   * Animated transitions from slide to slide

   * Text movements within the slide

   * Recording of text and arbitrary playback of recorded elements

   * Superposition effects for included images (alpha channels and blending)

   * A manual

   * A lot of examples, including talks using populat LaTeX packages seminar
     and prosper.

   * New package xprosper.sty, an extended version of the prosper package from
     http://prosper.sourceforge.net/.

   * A new user's interface in the redesigned LaTeX package advi.sty.

Play advi on the demonstration presentation demo.dvi that is in the test
directory of the distribution. Look at source code of various talks in
the directory ``examples''.

The source code, RPM packages, and information are available at

    http://pauillac.inria.fr/advi/

       PLEASE NOTE THAT RPM PACKAGES ARE NOT YET BULLET PROOF.
       PLEASE, DO USE THE SOURCE CODE TO BUILD THE SOFTWARE
                  SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE
