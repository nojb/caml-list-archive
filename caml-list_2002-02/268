Yes, thanks.  That was the problem.  (I had previously installed the "pure
win32" version, and had done "uninstall" -- but those environment variables
were still set to the wrong values.)  

At least, I think all problems are solved.  I tried "make bootstrap" a few
times and it didn't converge to a fixed point.  I'll ignore that for now.

One possibility is that you have the OCAMLLIB or CAMLLIB environment
variable set to something like \Program Files\Objective Caml\lib, e.g.
because of a previous installation of the "pure Win32" version of OCaml.
Try to do

        unset OCAMLLIB
        unset CAMLLIB

in the Bash shell before proceeding with the compilation.

If it still doesn't work, try sticking a "-verbose" option in the offending
command line:

>     ../boot/ocamlrun ../ocamlc -verbose -I ../boot -linkall \
>         -I ../otherlibs/unix -o ocamldebug.exe <object files>

This causes ocamlc to print the exact invocation of gcc -- very useful to
track down problems like this.

The current release of OCaml definitely mis-handles spaces in the path to
the standard library directory, and also fails to ignore completely previous
installations of OCaml while compiling itself. Damien Doligez has fixed the
latter problem recently, and we promise to do something about the former
before the next release.

Keep us (caml@inria.fr) informed.
