It is not a syntax change (the grammar didn't change), but a
typechecker change, which only concerns people who use labels.
(We hoped they were flexible enough to accept this integrating change.)
Labels are required in some cases, but there are no labels in the
standard library.

Indeed this is a misunderstanding: ocaml 3.04 is fully compatible with
ocaml 2.04. Non-labeled programs do not require any change.
(Actually, there is one change in the grammar for stream parsers, and
you have to use camlp4 for them, but this is really all.)

Keep with us,
