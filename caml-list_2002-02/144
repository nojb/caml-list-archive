I agree with this.  Better to give absolute bit lengths in the syntax than=
 to make more abbreviations.  But yes, 1234i32 is unreadable.  1234n32 is=
 better.  1234N32 is okay as well.

>Just my =800.02 worth of suggestions... I can live with L and LL.

Same here about L and LL (worth $0.0173425 at today's rate).
