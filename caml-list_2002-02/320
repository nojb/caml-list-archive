Yes, there seems to be a bug in the actual powerpc version of the native code
compilers. Xavier and the ocaml team are aware of that and actively working on
it (i don't know if there is a solution yet though).

That said, previous versions of ocaml did work fine on ppc, and i have great
hopes that this will happen again as soon as this bug is corrected.

In the meantime, i will disable native code build on ppc, just to be on the
safe side.
