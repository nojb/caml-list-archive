I don't think there is much point to argue: "standard" is what the
OCaml-reference manual says on the language definition and what the
compilers accept as default. Quite unsurprisingly, this is what >99%
of all OCaml-developers are using...

Sure. But programming is also a social activity (well, at least sometimes
I'd hope this were the case ;).

This means that it is out of the question to let everybody write in
whatever style he thinks is right just because some preprocessor does
conversions automagically. Just think of teaching OCaml: would you
really want to have every teacher use his favourite style? - That's an
easy way to drive off prospective users.

Nobody changes production code to a new language syntax just for the
fun of it. In any case, I am not sure that this is really a problem:
unless you use new, possibly broken semantic features, you'd only have
to fix potential bugs in the preprocessor to make your sources work with
the old compiler again, wouldn't you?

This is, I fear, not the way the "masses" behave.

The current OCaml-syntax is definitely not as broken as the ones of most
(if not all) mainstream languages. In fact, one may get to like its
quirks :-)

This is not a contradiction, IMHO. Semantics is not only more interesting
(= potentially more rewarding), it is also much more difficult to improve
(= higher costs). If you perform a cost/benefit analysis, there may be
a point where the ratio is better for syntactic improvements. I am not
sure whether we are already there. AFAIK, there are still somewhat large
semantic extensions in the development pipeline.

Just to make this clear: being a "normal syntax" user, I am not
pushing for any specific syntactic changes. I am just asking whether
the OCaml-team considers major syntax improvements in their development
strategy at all. It's not a problem for me directly if things stay as
they are. It may, however, benefit the growth of OCaml if there is such
a strategy.
