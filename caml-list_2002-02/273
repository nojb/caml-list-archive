For a start, how about writing a Caml interface to an existing audio file
library such as sndlib or audiofile, and a sound device library such as OSS?
I had been toying with this as a way to learn the CAML C interface but
haven't done much. But I might have more time now that the company I was
working for folded. (I don't know whether to :-) or :-()

I am looking for audio as well as image signal processing
code in OCAML and I can't find them anywhere on the web.
If anyone has any of them and is willing to share that would be great.
