Parsing is easy, even for "hard" to parse languages like Haskell. I
haven't written more than trivial programs in Haskell or Clean, but I
find it a lot harder to get used to the semantic differences than the
syntactic ones. In fact, I've never found syntax the hard part of learning
any programming language.
