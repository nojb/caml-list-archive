I finally found the trick : by default, a drawing area doesn't treat
button events. All I had to do was to add 

    self#fenetre#area#event#add [`BUTTON_PRESS];

somewhere to let it accept button events. I found it not in Gtk doc, but
in a serie of articles about Gtk in a french revue called GNU/Linux Mag.
Great revue, I can assure you.

See you later for other stupid questions... and usefull answers ;-)
