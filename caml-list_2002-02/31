I am thinking of it. In the first beginning, I considered that it was
not really a part of the compiler (XML is not OCaml), but this
morning, I used it to trace my data, and I saw that it could be useful
for debugging: in this case, it may have its place in Camlp4
distribution.

But I am still hesitating...

I am also thinking of Markus Mottl's request (print and parse in OCaml
syntax), as an option of IoXML or another program, it depends on how
the things can be shared. I am looking at it.
