Hi all.

I just released XML Light, a very light XML parser based on ocamllex /
ocamlyacc. It compiles under Unix and Win32.

It can be use by people who only needs a minimalist XML description
( comments and <? ... ?> are discarded,  TEXT nodes are invalid, read
README for more informations ) and also as a good sample for people
who wants tolearn usage of lex & yacc.
