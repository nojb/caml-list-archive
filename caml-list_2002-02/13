Hello to everybody

I'm studying the book of Chailloux, Manoury and Pagano and I' m now taking 
into considerations the streams.
Using a plain ocaml prompt with Ocaml 3.04 on a RedHat box (coming from a 
rpm), I get

# let foo = [< >];;
               ^^
Syntax error

I get the same error on a MacOS 9 box, using the standard Ocaml distribution.

I have plenty of expressions parenthesized with [< >] in the source 
distribution, and I learnt that I could optionally use [: :] if I say so to 
Camlp4. But neither [< >] nor [: :], that gives 
# let foo = [: :];;
                ^
Syntax error
is accepted by the copies of the interpreter that I'm using, and I feel stuck.

Should I make a different toplevel giving special indications and links?

Sorry for bothering you. Think that you've (likely) been a beginner also... 
once upon a time. By the way, I think that ocaml would be more widespread 
than C if it only had 20% of its documentation and ease of consulting; I'd 
have never started with it without the book of Chailloux, Manoury and Pagano 
(that I thank).

Thanks
Ernesto
