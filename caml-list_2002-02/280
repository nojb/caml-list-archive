There are plenty of small examples in the (strangely named) examples
directory of the distribution. For instance, you can see menus in
editor.ml, mouse clicks in fixed_editor.ml, and drawing in drawing.ml.

We have also some small applications, but they were not released until
now out of laziness to package them.

That would be interesting. If people can send me such information, I
will add it to the lablgtk page.
Currently the reference application is Unison, but it doesn't do any
fancy graphical stuff.
