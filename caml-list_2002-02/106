  I agree with all what you said. The current syntax is the one that was
  adopted in the very beginning of Caml. Its syntax is the one which
  make Caml different from other languages and it has been adopted by
  people all over the years. Changing it would make the 'OCaml touch'
  go away.
  
  People who want a Haskell-like syntax will have to go for Haskell or
  use camlp4 which seem to do the job pretty well regarding what people
  say about it.

  So, please stop pestering OCaml authors with syntactic considerations,
  I have no doubt that there are higher priority improvements.
  (it's up to them to decide or not on this though).

  Cheers,
