[Wearing my computer-science-educator hat...]

I *do* think the OCaml team should be terrified of syntax changes.  At
this stage, one of the things that is most hampering the spread of OCaml,
particularly in educational settings, is the dearth of books.  If
incompatible changes are not kept to a minimum, no one will want to write
any, and the few that do get written will quickly go out of date.
