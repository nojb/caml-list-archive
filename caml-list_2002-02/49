Hello,

I was attempting to implement some block ciphers, and I missed the following :

1) An Int32.rotate function that generates data-dependent
hardware rotates whenever possible (i.e. things like rol.l d0,d1)

2) A syntax extension (or extension to the standard syntax) for
entering Int32 and Int64 constants. 

3) A hack into Printf to remove the need to use Int32.format

I.e. better support for int32's. I understand that the Caml team does
not want people to use int32's (or int64's) by default. However a lot
of coding/crypto stuff, deserving to be ported to Caml, works with
32-bit ints and it would be good to be able to use them at full speed.

For example, the MD5 routine used in Digest.string could be efficiently
rewritten in Caml.
