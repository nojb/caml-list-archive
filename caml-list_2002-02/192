Hi all,
I'm cleaning up some old code of mine that uses regexps quite heavily...
Since those days where we only had Str, it seems that I now have the
choice between at least Pcre and Libre. Would anyone care to give their
opinion on those ? I'd like to get rid of Str because of the threads
issues (and bugs with large input). I've used Pcre a bit, but would like
to go to an all-Ocaml solution because of Win2k porting requirements.
However, the Libre documentation is inexistant (the .mli files contains
barely more than the types).
Would somebody on the list, that has knowledge of the library (Jerome
?), be willing to enhance the Libre docs a tiny bit ?
