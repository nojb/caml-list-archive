Subject: [Caml-list] Trouble building ocaml3.04
Date: Tue, 19 Feb 2002 15:44:03 -0500
MIME-Version: 1.0
X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2653.19)
Content-Type: text/plain

Precedence: bulk

I am trying to build ocaml3.04 under cygwin.  Step 1, invoking "configure",
finishes without complaint.  Step 2, "make world", fails while trying to
compile the debugger.  Within the debugger subdirectory, it is executing (in
the local Makefile) the command to make ocamldebug.exe (having successfully
compiled everything on which it depends), namely 

	../boot/ocamlrun ../ocamlc -I ../boot -linkall -I ../otherlibs/unix
-o                      ocamldebug.exe  <long list of .cmo files omitted >

and this fails with the error message

	gcc: FilesObjective: No such file or directory
	gcc: Camllib: No such file or directory
	gcc: FilesObjective: No such file or directory
	gcc: Camllib: No such file or directory
	Error while building custom runtime system
	make[1]: *** [ocamldebug.exe] Error 2
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/Program
Files/ocaml-3.04/debugger'
	make: *** [ocamldebugger] Error 2

Can anyone help?  (I have succeeded in building ocaml on another PC that is
configured almost identically.)
