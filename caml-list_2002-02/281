Yes. I know this. What I am looking for is REAL documentation. For
example, I was not able to find out how to send a signal (just to let my
drawing area know that it has to redraw itself, for example).

I noticed some sarcasm in your "(strangely named)". Beware, Klingons don't
share Human's sense of humour. Grrr.

NOthing about signals in the apps dir, I already checked this.

Really, you can't imagine the number of lines of code I read before
asking. And I intensively used OCamlBrowser on LablGtk installation, but
this is simply too much for me. I know GUI programming in Qt (and some
others), I hate Gtk for overfeeding casting, so I thought LablGtk would be
the solution. But I failed. Bouhou !

Thanks anyway.
