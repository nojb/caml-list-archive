Which opportunity? I don't see any opportunity now.

It has always been too late: it was too late 8 years ago when Zinc was
created, which was supposed to be "Zinc Is Not Caml" in the
beginning...  but Zinc became "Caml" Light, because of a lot of
reasons, the same reasons that people continue to use now: it is not
standard, it is complicated because of teaching... The same reasons
continue and I don't see any specific opportunity now.

I don't think that you, users, must wait for us, the caml team, to
change the syntax. The standard syntax will never change in our side,
you can be sure of that.
