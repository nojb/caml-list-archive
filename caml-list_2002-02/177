What's a waste of bandwidth is you taking issue with it and starting this thread.  The signature you quoted was 348 bytes.  Your reply, not counting headers, was 1147 bytes, and if you count my reply and Julian's jumping to his defense publicly, which is somewhat necessary in these situations, it was 2813 or so.

I'm about the most athiestic person I know, but commenting on somebody's signature is pretty lame.

It was 6 lines, and he usually uses only 2 lines.  Who cares?  Leave him alone.
