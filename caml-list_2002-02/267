One possibility is that you have the OCAMLLIB or CAMLLIB environment
variable set to something like \Program Files\Objective Caml\lib,
e.g. because of a previous installation of the "pure Win32" version of
OCaml.  Try to do

        unset OCAMLLIB
        unset CAMLLIB

in the Bash shell before proceeding with the compilation.

If it still doesn't work, try sticking a "-verbose" option in the
offending command line:

>     ../boot/ocamlrun ../ocamlc -verbose -I ../boot -linkall \
>         -I ../otherlibs/unix -o ocamldebug.exe <object files>

This causes ocamlc to print the exact invocation of gcc -- very useful
to track down problems like this.

The current release of OCaml definitely mis-handles spaces in
the path to the standard library directory, and also fails to ignore
completely previous installations of OCaml while compiling itself.
Damien Doligez has fixed the latter problem recently, and we promise
to do something about the former before the next release.

Keep us (caml@inria.fr) informed.
