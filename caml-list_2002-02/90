The merging of camlp4 into the standard distribution and its integration
with the toplevel was definitely an important step. I also don't think
that there should be a "big concerted effort", but it might be a good
idea to provide for a "travel plan". Maybe something in the spirit of
the introduction of the Euro, e.g. "We are considering making revised
(or whatever) syntax the default on 01.01.2004." ;)

This would give people an incentive to start new projects in the new
syntax. Surely, it may be necessary to clean up revised syntax before,
too, to make it really shine.

I agree that this is an absolutely necessary prerequisite. Pushing people
into the cold water without previous preperation will not make them happy.

Definitely. I somehow had the impression that the topic of discussion was
being pushed into the direction of "Let's change syntax now (or not).",
which was never my intention. I was merely asking for a plan concerning
future and possibly major syntax changes. The language maintainers would
be surely well-advised to consider this in the long-term.
