Hi
I need an XML parser for OCaml.
I tried both "Tony" and "PXP" but the first failed to compile and the second
one is quite heavy and needs FindLib which is not ported under Windows.

Any lightweight parser will be enough if it can compile under Windows. If
you got such one but you don't know about Windows, I can do the tests and
then provide you a valid Win32 Makefile if it works.

Thanks
Nicolas Cannasse
