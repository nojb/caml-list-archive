   This is a problem of lexing, not parsing. I could add a flag to set
   or unset the lexing of quotations.
   
I would like to have this flag.

   Remark: but to be _exactly_ ocaml, the only solution is to use
   _exactly_ the same technology, i.e. ocamlyacc. There will be
   always differences in the behaviour of the two systems.
   
Well, what I meant is that 
- camlp4o parses a file if and only if ocamlc parses it, and 
- the resulting ast's are semantically equivalent. 

I think this should be possible. And I would suggest to add an
operation mode to camlp4o that makes it equivalent with ocamlc
(in the above sense). 


[Sorry for starting this discussion about syntax. I don't use the
 revised syntax because it not fully documented (e.g., revised
 syntax of objects). Further there is no grammar for the revised
 syntax. ]


Bye,

Hendrik
