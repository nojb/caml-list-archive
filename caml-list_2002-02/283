I have the same problem: I want to see how thing are handled in
LablGtk.  I recently searched for an example of a notebook in LablGtk
but could not find one. 

I know it is not practical to rewrite the libgtk-manual, but it would
be nice to see what the ocaml-equivalent is for the c examples.

There is in my opinion a good example on how this can be done: the
wxPython manual which illustrates the python-specific way of handling
things without duplicating the rest of the wxWindows manual.

Unfortunately I don't have the necessary knowledge to write such a
lablgtk-manual :(

Regards.

Johann
