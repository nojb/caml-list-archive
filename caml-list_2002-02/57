Hi all

I am very new to ocaml and have to write a program
with it.  I think it has significant possibilities.

a few questions.
1.  a good reference book?
2.  I have to parse a long string inputted from the
command line into tokens and then manipulate the
tokens.  Is there a package already written to assist
me in this.


Thanks

Davide
