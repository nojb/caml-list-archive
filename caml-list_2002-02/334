I agree there are cases where root registration is required only on
rarely-executed paths, and in this case Begin_roots/End_roots allow
avoiding the cost of root registration on other paths.  I haven't
measured how much speed is gained this way.  Probably not much, since
GC root registration is relatively simple.

Begin_roots/End_roots will remain defined for a long time, if only
because I still have some old code that use these macros, and (as
regulars on this list know) I don't like gratuitous breaking of old
code.

The only problem with documenting them as a low-level alternative to
CAMLparam is that the chapter "Interfacing Caml with C" of the
documentation is already huge and quite hard to read!  Perhaps a
different organization of this chapter (e.g. a separate chapter for
"Advanced topics in interfacing Caml with C") is in order.
