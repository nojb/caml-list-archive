> How well-supported is OCaml under LinuxPPC?

Fairly well.  This is one of the platforms that we have easy access
to, so every release is tested under LinuxPPC.  One of the OCaml
developers regularly works under LinuxPPC; another recently fell in
love with MacOSX and defected :-)  

The only known problem with OCaml for the PowerPC (Linux and MacOSX)
is that ocamlopt can generate assembly code that fails to assemble
on programs that contain very large functions.  The assembler issues
an error, so it's not a case of bad code being silently generated.
This affects native-code compilation of certain applications, such as
Coq and (ironically) one component of the OCaml compiler (camlp4.opt,
generated during "make opt.opt").  This was fixed recently in the
working sources.

No other problems have been reported to us.  If you encounter one,
please file bug reports.
