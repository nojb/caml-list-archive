Hi Johann,

It seems that I am bad at explaining myself: there is no example with
notebooks in the distribution. This will change in a near future :-)

You have to add extra paths when calling ocamlbrowser:

    ocamlbrowser -I +lablgtk

Well, you also have to look at GTK's documentation.
But once used to reading types, you will often find them informative
enough to avoid refering too often to the documentation. Or at least
to let you find a usable function before looking it up.

Cheers,
