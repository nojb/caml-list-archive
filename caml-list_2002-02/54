Hi,
Reading this thread I don't understand why Camlp4 
and Daniel revised syntax would be a sort of evil.
I have ported all my projects to revised syntax 
without any trouble. Where is the problem coding in
different syntaxs? as I understand anyone can use
both either. Learning OCaml is not related to syntax,
it is much harder for a programer to understand FP
when he(she) has several years of C/C++/Java. If the
OCaml team decides a change it is better to do this
earlier as the language is still used by a reduced
comunity. All things evolves why OCaml not?. The fact
that OCaml isn't widely spread is more realted to the
ignorance, 'lambd effect', hype, FUD or whatever promoted by the big power of companies who dominates the industry (M$ SUN IBM) today. OCaml has enough
merits to become a mainstream language (as Haskell)
but it isn't yet, so why not explore meanwhile?
