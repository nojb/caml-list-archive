Subject: [Caml-list] at_exit functions not called during exit

Hi,

I noticed that functions registered with Pervasives.at_exit are
not called when a C-library function calls exit. Is this a bug or
a feature?

Assuming it is a feature I experimented with atexit and callbacks
to ocaml. Now I have the following question:

When a ocaml program is going down, is there a point of time
after which I should not callback from C to Ocaml (because
libraries/the garbage collector are deinitialised)?

If yes, how can I check for this condition?

Bye,

Hendrik
