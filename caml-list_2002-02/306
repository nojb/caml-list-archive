If you want to use pcre as a dll, you have to build it as a dll. So you
have to investigate why the Makefile failed to build the dll ...

What is your platform / C compiler ?  OCamlMakefile uses by default cc as
the C compiler, and passes -fPIC to it. On Solaris, cc does not recognizes
this option, and I had to tell OCamlMakefile to use gcc instead. Maybe you
can try to do the same ...

Usually, I use ocamlc as a front-end to the C compiler; it seems natural
to compile C files (that have to be interfaced with OCaml) with the
compiler ocamlrun was built from. Is there any reason not to do it ?
