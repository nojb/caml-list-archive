may be. But camlp4 is written in revised syntax, and there are a lot
of people using it (at least I believe). So the fact that a library or a
tool is written in revised or standard library doesn't change anything
for those who use it. The only problem is for those who want to change
the source, but it's not so hard to learn this syntax if you want to
use it.

By the way, is there any caml-mode for Emacs and the revised syntax ?
