I am a student in Computer Science in the University of Evry (France),
and I tried to compile a simple ocaml program :

let rec fact = function
0 -> 1 | n-> n*(fact(n-1));;


Unfortunately, the "ocamlopt 1fact.ml" command gave me the following
answer :
/tmp/camlasm29.s: Assembler messages:

Assembler error, input left in file /tmp/camlasm29.s


I think this is due to the name of the program, 1fact.ml, which should
not begin with a number, because when I renamed the file fact1.ml it
worked perfectly.
Is it normal?


Thank you.
Sarah Djebali.
