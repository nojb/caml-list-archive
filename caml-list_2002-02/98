I think the Caml team should impose a new syntax with the next big change
in Ocaml. Further, that new syntax should have been really well thought.
Plus if it's dissimilar both to the standard and revised syntaxes, there
will be no major opposition. And invoking a preprocessor significantly
slows my compilation process. Not that I'm against, but it should be
built-in. So :

1) You can't change syntax just for the sake of changing syntax.
2) Find a new, useful feature with appealing buzzname (new Ocaml 4.00 with
automatic sigma-homomorphisms) -- sell it. Oh, by the way, it uses a new
syntax (But there's a very smart Ocaml 3.0x -> Ocaml 4.00 converter bundled).
3) Merge camlp4 into the compiler.

No syntax changes until that.
