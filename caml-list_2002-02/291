OK.  I tried to look for an example of the use of notebook by using
rgrep *.ml on /usr/share/doc/lablgtk and could not find anything.  It
was also not in testgtk.ml.

After your message I tried to search with Ocamlbrowser (which I do not
use regularly - maybe because I don't know it well). So I typed in
"notebook", clicked on "type" and pressed enter.  And nothing
happened.

I then selecte "name" and nothing happened.  There is no lablgtk
module listed by Ocamlbrowser.  But lablgtk is on my system in
/usr/lib/ocaml/lablgtk.

I did try and read the source of GPack but although that helped me a
little bit, I do not know enough of functional programming to always
understand the practical use of a function by looking at it's type.

I learn mostly through examples illustrating a principle.

No I could find an url.  On my system it is part of the
wxPython/wxWindows-docmentation:

file:///usr/share/doc/wxwin2.2-doc/wxWindows-manual.html/wxwin471.htm#wxPython

I might try and do that.  I have a lot more questions than answers.
