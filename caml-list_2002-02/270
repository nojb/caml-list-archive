Hi All,

I've recompiled (on Linux) a new version of CDK from the CVS, but try to
use it with a stock distribution of OCaml 3.04, because it does not
compile fully on the platform I'm interested in: Solaris 2.7. I try just
to consider it as a set of binary modules (disregarding those which fail
to recompile). I copied all of them into the main Caml library directory
and try to make a new toplevel, which would have access to a module I'm
interested in: Unix2. I started from 

ocamlmktop unix2.cmo -o unix2top

and subsequently added more and more modules to the absence of which it
complained. It took not less than one hour of trials. Resulting in this:

ocamlmktop string2.cmo file.cmo str.cma netstring_str.cmo
netencoding.cmo base64.cmo debug.cmo unix.cma timeout.cmo log.cmo
unix.cma concur.cmo bufrw.cmo activebuffer.cmo str.cma unix.cma 
/usr/lib/ocaml/select.o /usr/lib/ocaml/libunix2_c.a string2.cmo
filename2.cmo printexc2.cmo sys2.cmo unix2.cmo netstring_str.cmo
netencoding.cmo network.cma unix2.cmo -o unix2top

What did I do wrong? It is possible to get a transivite closure of all
these dependencies in one shot? BTW the last step were purely gcc/ld
dependecies on select.o and libunix2_c.a and there is now way to
indicate libraries in the Unix style via -lLIB.

Thank you

Alexander
