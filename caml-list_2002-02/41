The first step towards a "new" syntax for O'Caml is already taken.
Now, when Camlp4 is included in the standard distribution it
is much easier to try Camlp4 syntax. I think more people 
will make more people try the new syntax.

I am using Markus Mottl's Ocamlmakefile, and having some
files in the new syntax and some in the old in the same project
is very easy and doesn't require any tweaking in the Makefile.

So, I think we should encourage people to try the Camlp4-syntax
and let people have their comments. If people comment into this
mailing list, more people will look into it and maybe have their
own opinion.

Personally, I haven't written any own code using the revised
syntax. However, some of my source files are in the revised 
syntax. 

I agree that the current syntax is error-prone and should be
changed. Emacs solves most of the problems, but not if " 
(or is it \") occurs.
