Could a patch be extracted of the current working source that i could apply to
the debian package ?

This is rather urgent for me, as woody freeze time is RSN, and i would rather
disable ppc native code before the freeze rather than shiping a package with
problems.

Also, did you also solve the problem on ia64, or do you not have access to
such a machine ?
