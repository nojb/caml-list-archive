A reasonable suggestion, but eliminating the space in the path name didn't
help. 
I get the same error message at same spot, except that the next-to-last line
now becomes:

	make[1]: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/ocaml-3.04/debugger'

(And, now that I think of it, if that space had been the problem, the make
would presumably have failed earlier.)

I have successfully run "make world" on two of my colleagues' PCs.  I copied
onto my PC the directories created on one of those machines by "make world"
and tested the result with "make bootstrap."  It failed at precisely the
same point

    ../boot/ocamlrun ../ocamlc -I ../boot -linkall -I ../otherlibs/unix -o 
        ocamldebug.exe <object files>

with precisely the same error message:

	gcc: FilesObjective: No such file or directory
	gcc: Camllib: No such file or directory
	gcc: FilesObjective: No such file or directory
	gcc: Camllib: No such file or directory
	Error while building custom runtime system

The machines on which "make world" succeeded do not (at least not now)
contain files or directories called FilesObjective or Camllib.

Any other ideas?

You have unpacked Ocaml to the directory whose name contains spaces
("c:\Program Files\ocaml-3.04"). Don't do that!

Hope to hear from you soon,
Dmitry
