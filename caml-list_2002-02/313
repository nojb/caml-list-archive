Yes. Maybe I misinterprete "supersede" in the documentation.

That's what I mean. Thank you for expressing it in a few words.

I should have written "the price for registering is only paid if ...". Yes,
the Ocaml interface for Numerix allocates on the Ocaml heap. Yes, the
overhead would be small. But in some cases (lots of operations on "small"
big integers) this makes a difference.
