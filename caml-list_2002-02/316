As i understood it, the main problem is that it is more difficult to interface
with C++ than with C. I don't know the details, but that is the answer you
will get if reading the previous thread on this mailing list.

The second hindrance is naturally, as you said, it is really heavy work, and
there need to be someone working on it. I always thought some kind of semi
automatism would help a lot here though.
