I like Gerd's suggestion.  Two others:

- Please support both signed and unsigned (or "int" and "card")
  literals of each width, perhaps using _s32 and _u32 etc.
  We would also need the unsigned analogs of Int32 and Int64 modules.

- Slightly off-topic: add hexadecimal character literals '\0xNN' At
  least once a year, I assume that '\010' should be *octal* 10, like
  in C.  Since you can't fix that without breaking old code, it would
  be nice to have the option of using hex char literals in new code.

Of course the meta-solution would be for Daniel to give us an
extensible lexer. :-)
