Nobody is saying that such changes should be done right now or in the
near future, but that there should be a plan about them. I am sure that
nobody would say that keeping the current syntax like a rigid corset
forever would benefit long-term evolution of the language. Note that it
becomes even more difficult to change things if the number of users grows.
