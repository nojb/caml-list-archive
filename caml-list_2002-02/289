Which ocaml debian package are your using ? if you are using 3.04-9
(from unstable, only in incoming the last time I check)

the you have to make (as root)
ocaml-ldconf -a /usr/local/lib/ocaml/pcre/

to add the dll support for pcre. (this will work only in there is
a *.so file in the /usr/local/lib/ocaml/pcre/ directory.)

if there is no *.so, you will have to make a custom toplevel (with
ocamlmktop, I believe that findlib have some support for it).
