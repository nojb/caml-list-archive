"Opportunity" is a relative thing.  Selling Enron at $30 seemed dumb relative to $90, but it sure seems like a missed opportunity now.  :)

Similarly, Caml is still relatively small.  I think it will get much bigger.  This will seem like a missed opportunity in the future (assuming anybody actually wants to change the syntax in the future).

Well, then that's that.  ;)
