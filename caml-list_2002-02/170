  Recently, I've been playing with writing my own language.  With some good 
books, and inspiration from existing languages, it's not that hard, really, 
even for a beginner  :)  The only problem I've found is setting the possible 
data types, the so-called "primitives" of the language.  Currently, I have 
something like this:

type Primitive =
| PInt of int
| PString of string
| PFloat of float
   ...

  The problem is, I know that I will need new types in the future besides 
these.  It's an object-oriented language, and I would like to add classes 
that manage things like Tk.  Every object has a variable of type Primitive 
that it stores its value in.  Is it possible to somehow allow other types, 
like Tk's widgets, without changing the definition of Primitive to include 
them and recompiling everything?

Thanks in advance,
