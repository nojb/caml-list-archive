"How about a new OCaml-syntax-list?"

I don't know whether this would be interesting for you. 
But I 'm here since a few days, I am not interested in revisions yet,  and 
I'm quite astonished when you say "Yes it's CLEARLY written look here and 
here and here".

Well, do you expect people to start with Ocaml which such a documentation?
Either my Google is broken or you're cheating or you took advantage of some 
school time or you're not newcomers in any way.

So, I ask to beginners here 
	would you subscribe to a Ocaml Beginners' mailing list?
and to the seniors 
	can we the beginners set up a list on our own?
	can we use the name "Ocaml"?
	could we advertise for our list in this mailing list?

Anything else?
