I'm pleased to announce the publication of a new graduate-level textbook
on type systems and foundations of programming languages:

    Types and Programming Languages
    by Benjamin C. Pierce
    8x9", 624 pp., 60 illus., cloth
    ISBN 0-262-16209-1

A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence 
of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to 
the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems--and of 
programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective--has important 
applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance 
compilers, and security.

This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in 
computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The 
approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by 
programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the 
needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises 
and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. 
Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers 
to choose a variety of paths through the material.

The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, 
type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, 
bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. 
Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the 
features of object-oriented languages.

Enjoy,

        -- Benjamin
