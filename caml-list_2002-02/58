Why? The ocaml syntax has changed before - there is no technical reason
that prevents identical behavior between the two systems.  I just don't
see camlp4 as being practical until it can correctly parse standard ocaml
syntax.

language than are necessary to fit into camlp4 parsing technology.  If the
revised syntax only changed the syntax as necessary to support camlp4, and
the standard compiler would be modified to reject anything not accepted by
this new syntax, then the following proposal seems perfectly reasonable.
