I also do not understand many of the discussions on the list, but I
found the people on this list very friendly and helpful when I had
asked questions - sometimes very stupid questions.

If a newbie list can render the same kind of service as the
perl-beginners list It will be a very good thing, but then it will ask
a lot of the more experienced members of this list to answer all the
newbie questions on a separate list.

I would certainly subscribe to such a list.

      us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is 
      high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward 
      them that fear him. As far as the east is from the 
      west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from 
      us."                  Psalms 103:10-12
