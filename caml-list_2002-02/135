OCAML BEGINNERS' LIST ocaml_beginners@yahoogroups.com IS SET.

Here is the public description so far:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This list is a place for the mutual aid of those who recognize that they're 
not ocaml gurus yet... everything you wanted to ask about Ocaml, but were 
afraid to ask in the very official caml-list@inria.fr, can be asked, answered 
and discussed here. 
Satisfaction is NOT guaranteed and if you are teaching more than you're 
learning... please think that you've probably learnt more than you're 
teaching! :-)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The list is 
	listed in yahoogroups directory
	accessible through http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ocaml_beginners
	unmoderated
	open
	with no attachments
	with member posting and public archives

To subscribe:
	yahoogroups suggests to send a message to
 		ocaml_beginners-subscribe@yahoogroups.com
	but
	in case this fails (well, they're not using ocaml apparently)
	the second way is to go and visit http://www.yahoogroups.com 
	and create an account (well, euh, personal infos are collected) , 
	then subscribe
	OR 
	mail the list-owner (at present, me) at stalkern2@tin.it 
	and ask for subscribing.

To unsubscribe:
	your e-mail address is supposed to have subscribed (see above and wait for 
your confirmation message)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regards
	Ernesto T. Succu

PS please tell me who should I tell to put what on the caml site -thanks!
