Many thanks for the advice on polymorphic variants; they seemed to be just 
what I needed.  But I've run into one small problem:  I can't define 
exceptions with arguments of polymorphic types.

In the language I'm trying to implement, to raise an exception, the user 
needs to create an instance of an exception class.  So, in my 
implementation, I wanted to define an exception whose sole argument would be 
an instance of a class.  But, I designed instances to be records containing 
a polymorphic variant, which makes the record type itself polymorphic.  Is 
there some way to raise exceptions with polymorphic arguments, or some other 
possible way of implementing this?

Thanks in advance,
