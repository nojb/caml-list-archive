I've been trying to do something similar with something i'm writing, and
the only thing i could come up with is to store data in an object, and
then subclass it. The problem here is that once the object has been
coerced to the general type, it cannot be coerced back again. ie: if you
subclass the object to say, impliment integers, then it's not possible
for it to be coerced back to the integer type so you can retreive / act
on the value. (withoug using Obj.magic, that is)

If anyone has any good ideas, I'd be happy to hear about them too.
