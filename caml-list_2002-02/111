There is no notion of shift-reduce in recursive descent parsing: the
system tries to shift until it cannot do it any more.

To decide to "reduce", you must know which non-terminal called you,
but you don't have this information, exactly like in a function, you
don't know which function called you.

To know if there are shift-reduce or reduce-reduce conflicts in the
revised syntax, one should rewrite it under yacc.
