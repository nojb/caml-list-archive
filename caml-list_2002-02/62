I had the distinct impression that the latest release of OCaml already
imposes a (minor) syntax change in that tags on library function arguments
are now mandatory. Is this not the case?

My (mis?)understanding has already prevented my adoption of the latest
version simply because of the effort required to port 20 KLOC of OCaml to
this new imposition. If this is not the case, then I will gladly incorporate
the newest version in my system.

But this greater discussion has me wondering about whether you are talking
of more egregious changes to the language syntax.... If so, it will
certainly push me as a user to consider other alternatives. I don't wish to
spend my time rewriting old code to keep up with a moving target language...
