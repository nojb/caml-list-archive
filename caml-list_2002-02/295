This is my experience as well. The "value" keyword and the ";"
instead of ";;" seems to be the only big differences. I looked
at the tuareg code, there are a few occurences of "val" that probably
needs to be changed into "value" together with some regular expressions.
The same goes for ";" vs. ";;". But I don't have the guts to start
messing with tuareg.el :) So I just sit around and wait for Christian
Gillot's version.

Thanks all,
