You can have the best of both worlds by writing it like this:

	match p with
	| A -> ...; ()
	| B -> ...; ()
	| _ -> assert (not true); ()


As for "assert false" with -noassert, you're not really supposed to
catch the Assert_failure exception (unless you really know what
you're doing), so it should result in the immediate termination of
your program anyway.
