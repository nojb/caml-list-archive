Here is a list of disavantages and advantages of RE compared to Pcre.

Disavantages
- The pattern compilation is more costly
- Not fully thread safe (you cannot simultaneously use the same
  pattern in different threads)
- Slower than Pcre when compiled to bytecode
- Lot of missing features : back-references, look-ahead and
  look-behind assertions, ...

Avantages
- Choice between different matching semantics
  (first match, longuest match, shortest match)
- Regular expression can be combined using operators such as union or
  concatenation
- Much faster than Pcre once start-up time is amortized
- All regular expression are executed at the same speed once start-up
  time is amortized, so you don't have to do any performance tweaking.

I should really take the time to write a documentation.  But I don't
have the time at the moment...

Patrick Doane has contributed a pretty large test suite (located in
tests/test_*.ml).  This test suite may help you understand the library.
