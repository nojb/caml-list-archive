Does anyone see why the first chunk should type check while the second
should not? The only difference is the explicit type annotation on mAny,
which seems to be clearly correct.

Thanks, Jon


(* type checks *)
let mAny = fun succ0 input -> succ0 in
    let ans0 = true in
    let x = mAny (mAny ans0) in
        x 1 2

(* does not type check *)
let mAny: 'a -> int -> 'a = fun succ0 input -> succ0 in
    let ans0 = true in
    let x = mAny (mAny ans0) in
        x 1 2
