What you describe seems to be overkill for the purpose. You could simply
build a toplevel with a restricted standard library (without interaction
with the OS and without unsafe operations like Obj), disabled directives,
and use a wrapper to kill the toplevel when some timeout expires.

What's wrong with this ?
