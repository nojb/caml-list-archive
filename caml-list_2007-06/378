The shell is responsible to expand ~ before calling the program. If you
quote it, it won't be expanded; this is normal. When you put ~ on
ocamlbuild's command line, as in "-I,~/multi-oc/lib" it is not expanded
either (~ is interpreted only at the beginning of a word on the command
line).

Maybe ocamlbuild should support natively options like "-I xxx" (without
quotes), so that xxx will be processed by the shell.
