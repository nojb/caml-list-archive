Oliver,

Many thanks for the links to polycontextural logics. My feeling is it will
take me quite some investment to get a feeling for the framework. In the
meantime, there are fairly simple accounts of concurrency with reflection
offering natural logics (without apparent liar's paradox issues, as i
understand them).

At ETAPS 05 i presented two papers on such systems. You can find preprints
here (
http://svn.biosimilarity.com/src/open/papers/trunk/concurrency/rho/ex_nihil=
o_entcs/ex_nihilo_finco.pdf;
http://svn.biosimilarity.com/src/open/papers/trunk/concurrency/rho/tgc%20ln=
cs/ex_nihilo_logic.pdf).


i did a quick and dirty OCaml implementation (as a way to learn OCaml),
which you can find here (
http://svn.biosimilarity.com/src/open/mirrororrim/rho/trunk/ocaml/).

The approach i took was based on my dissatisfaction with the fact that the
\pi-calculus was dependent on a theory of names; and, names had to have an
effective theory of equality (thus, sneaking in a notion of computation --
which the \pi-calculus was supposedly providing the foundations of). If you
formulate the situation as: given a set (resp. theory) of names, X, the
\pi-calculus generates a set (resp. theory) of processes \Pi(X), then you
can ask if the following domain equation has a solution

   - X =3D \Pi(X)

It does (lots of them). In the first paper cited i presented a minimal
solution (least fixed point). The basic idea is to introduce a notion of
quotation and dequotation. Quotation happens at communication (output
appears higher-order, in that it has a process in subject position, but wha=
t
is sent is the code or quote of the process). Likewise, dequotation is
really only interesting at communction time, when it is bound by an input.
(See the paper for the full story.)

In the second paper, i show that the (spatial logic version of the) standar=
d
Hennessy-Milner construction pushes through -- but with a pleasant surprise=
.
In addition to formulae describing sets of processes, we find formulae
describing sets of names. You get a whole logic of namespaces. One way to
look at it is this: the algebraic operations on names inherited from the
process algebraic combinators give you a pointer arithmetic. Fortunately,
the programmer of such a system is also equipped with a logic that gives
very potent means of reasoning about this pointer arithmetic. (Again, see
the paper for the full story.)

The reflection doesn't just stop at structural reflection. You can provide =
a
reflective comm rule in which even synchronization -- which is normally
given via name-equality -- is determined by an upper-level reduction of the
processes whose codes are the names being used to synchronize. Amazingly,
this can be shown to be well-founded.

As a final point of interest, the first paper presents an encoding of the
\pi-calculus into the reflective setting, demonstrating that both
replication and the new-operator are syntactic sugar. There is a process
algebraic form of the Y-combinator in the reflective setting that gives you
replication. My co-author and i came up with two different encodings of the
new-operator. His was 'centralized' but more elegant; mine was distributed,
but with more machinery to make it work. But, i also found a 3rd encoding i=
n
which the well-founded recursion of quotation is replaced by
non-well-founded forms. In this case, you obtain an interpretation of new
that is strongly analogous to Galois extensions of a field.

Best wishes,

--greg

*******<br><br>The aim of the IFL symposium is to bring together researcher=
s actively<br>engaged in the implementation and application of functional a=
nd
<br>function-based programming languages. The symposium provides an open<br=
>forum for researchers who wish to present and discuss new ideas and<br>con=
cepts, work in progress, preliminary results, etc. related<br>primarily but=
 not exclusively to the implementation and application of
<br>functional languages.<br><br>Topics of interest include (but are not li=
mited to):<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * language concepts<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * type c=
hecking<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * compilation techniques<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * (abstrac=
t) interpretation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * generic programming techniques
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * automatic program generation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * array pro=
cessing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * concurrent/parallel programming<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; *=
 concurrent/parallel program execution<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * heap management<br=
>&nbsp;&nbsp; * runtime profiling<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * performance measurement=
s
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * debugging and tracing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * (abstract) machi=
ne architectures<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * verification<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * formal as=
pects<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; * tools and programming techniques<br><br>Papers on a=
pplications or tools demonstrating the suitability of novel
<br>ideas in any of the above areas and contributions on related<br>theoret=
ical work are also welcome. The change of the symposium name<br>adding the =
term &quot;application&quot;, introduced in 2004, reflects the<br>broader s=
cope IFL has gained over the years.
<br><br><br>Contributions<br><br>Prospective authors are encouraged to subm=
it papers to be published in<br>the draft proceedings and present them at t=

r>proceedings will appear as a technical report.<br><br>Every attendee of I=
FL 2007 will have the opportunity to submit a<br>revised version of their p=
