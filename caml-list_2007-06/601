You're right.

Yes but, for now I was more concentrated on explaining differences and
improvements, and that's about advanced features.

That's a good point, that I am aware of.

You can start by checking that the user don't use that variable.

Using the generated fold it's easy.

$ cat foo.ml
open Camlp4.PreCast;;
let filter = object (o) inherit Ast.fold as super

  (* capture most of cases *)
  method ident i =
     let o = super#ident i in
     match i with
     | <:ident< msg >> -> failwith "msg forbidden"
     | _ -> o

  (* there is perhaps some more... *)
  method expr e =
     let o = super#expr e in
     match e with
     | <:expr< for msg = $_$ $to:_$ $_$ do $_$ done >> -> failwith
"msg forbidden"
     | _ -> o
end;;
AstFilters.register_str_item_filter (fun st -> let _ = filter#str_item st in st)

$ ocamlc -c -I +camlp4 -pp camlp4of foo.ml

$ cat bar.ml
let msg = 42

$ camlp4o ./foo.cmo bar.ml
