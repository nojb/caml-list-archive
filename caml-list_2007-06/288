A native toplevel can be (very) useful when using ocaml as a scripting 
language.

I like to write (web) scripts with ocaml when I don't want to spend a 
lot of time on searching for trivial security holes (i.e. code 
injection) with languages such as bash or perl.
And compiling a file and using the binaries is a risk of loosing the 
source...
I know, this may sound weird...
