We are happy to annouce the release of JoCaml.

  JoCaml is an extension of Objective Caml for concurrent
  and distributed programming based upon the join calculus.
  More details (including a tutorial) are available on
  the jocaml web site:
  <http://jocaml.inria.fr/>.




  The new JoCaml (born again jocaml) is a total re-implementation of
  the new defunct JoCaml by F. Le Fessant. With respect to this previous
  version, changes are important.

    * New syntax. Believe it or not, the new syntax is better.

    * More convenient command set (bytecode compiler jocamlc,
      toplevel jocaml, native code compiler jocamlopt).

    * Disparition of mobility features. More reasearch is needed
      for those, besides they break OCaml compatibility.

    * Full compatibility with OCaml. For that reason, we adopt
      OCaml releasing scheme: initial version of JoCaml is 3.10.0.
