                           Accepted Papers
    ICFP 2007: International Conference on Functional Programming
         http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/icfp07.html
                 Freiburg, Germany, 1-3 October 2007

The ICFP 2007 Program Chair and Committee are pleased to announce that
the following papers have been accepted for the conference.

Additional information regarding the final program, invited speakers,
and registration will be forthcoming.  However, the Local Arrangements
Chair offers the following advice regarding hotel reservations:

 * As September and October is Freiburg's main tourist season, it is
   important that participants book hotel rooms early.  The blocks of
   hotel rooms reserved for ICFP participants will be held until
   August 1.  It is expected that many downtown hotels will be fully
   booked at the time of the conference.  [However, there should be
   little to no penalty for cancelling a hotel room reservation after
   August 1.]

More details regarding accommodation and travel may be obtained from
the ICFP 2007 Local Information webpage:
         http://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ICFP2007/
