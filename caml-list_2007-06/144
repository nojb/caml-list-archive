**********************************************************************

               Announcement and Call for Papers for the

                   19th International Symposium on
          Implementation and Application of Functional Languages
                               IFL 2007

             27th-29th September 2007, Freiburg, Germany
                      co-located with ICFP 2007

         http://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IFL2007/

**********************************************************************

The aim of the IFL symposium is to bring together researchers actively
engaged in the implementation and application of functional and
function-based programming languages. The symposium provides an open
forum for researchers who wish to present and discuss new ideas and
concepts, work in progress, preliminary results, etc. related
primarily but not exclusively to the implementation and application of
functional languages.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    * language concepts
    * type checking
    * compilation techniques
    * (abstract) interpretation
    * generic programming techniques
    * automatic program generation
    * array processing
    * concurrent/parallel programming
    * concurrent/parallel program execution
    * heap management
    * runtime profiling
    * performance measurements
    * debugging and tracing
    * (abstract) machine architectures
    * verification
    * formal aspects
    * tools and programming techniques

Papers on applications or tools demonstrating the suitability of novel
ideas in any of the above areas and contributions on related
theoretical work are also welcome. The change of the symposium name
adding the term "application", introduced in 2004, reflects the
broader scope IFL has gained over the years.


Contributions

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in
the draft proceedings and present them at the symposium. All
contributions must be written in English, conform to the
Springer-Verlag LNCS series format and not exceed 16 pages. The draft
proceedings will appear as a technical report.

Every attendee of IFL 2007 will have the opportunity to submit a
revised version of their paper for post-symposium reviewing. As in
previous years, selected papers will be published by Springer Verlag
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series.
