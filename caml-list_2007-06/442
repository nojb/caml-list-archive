Hi Scott,
Why write yet another incomplete C++ parser? You can already get a very 
nice OCaml representation of a C++ program through olmar( 
http://www.cs.ru.nl/~tews/olmar/ ).
If that doesn't suit your needs, why not point out the problems and 
maybe work together to solve them? Parsing C++ is hard enough that there 
isn't a single complete open source C++ parser other than g++. 
Olmar/elsa represent the second best C++ parser and everybody else isn't 
even close. Unlike g++, elsa is designed to support more than just 
compilers (ie has a much nicer API) and has a more liberal license.

My understanding is that there are Cil people interested in making elsa 
work better with OCaml.

If the above doesn't suit you, your best bet would be to convert the 
elsa grammar into OCaml (elkhound already has some ml support), but that 
will mean redoing a serious amount of type resolution work.
