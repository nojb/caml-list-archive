I'd like to announe the New York Functional Programmers Meetup, which is 
Wednesday, June 27th, 7PM, at the offices of Jane Street Capital.

The NYFP meetup is for people using or interested in strongly typed 
functional languages, such as Ocaml, Haskell, SML, etc.

Meeting details are here:

(sorry about the Lisp category- it's the closest thing Meetup has to 
"Functional Programmers").

Brian
