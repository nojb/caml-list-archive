Copy this into TextMate:

type t = {
x : int;
y : float
}

let _ =
   let r = { x = 1; y = 1.0 } in
   let r' = { r with x = 2 } in
   (* ... Syntax highlighting has stopped working here ... *)

That's where it fails because of the "with".  It's the only obvious  
bug I've run across, but if you have something like that early in the  
code, the rest of your code is not highlighted.  Maybe I have an old  
version of the bundle if you don't see this problem.
