I think OCaml would benefit from being more cross-platform and bundling 
essential libraries. I'm wondering if this can be addressed by distributing 
compiled OCaml run-times for the three major platforms that include OpenGL 
support and allow OCaml programs to be run out of the box.

What is the easiest way to achieve this? Can you use ocamlmktop to create 
custom top-levels for each platform and just compile-in the necessary 
libraries?
