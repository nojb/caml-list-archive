vfork was introduced in BSD Unix when support for page-based virtual
memory was added for the DEC VAX.  There was an earlier Bell Labs
port of Unix to the VAX that just mimicked the PDP-11's segment
registers.  In that scheme, I believe text segments were shared, so
that only the data segment had to be copied on fork, but copy-on-write
is the way to go on any architecture with page tables.
