I have this book in my TOREAD list (for a long time now, my bad)
I must admit I don't use very often pure functional datastructures in =20=

OCaml.
My main concern with functional programing has always been the =20
runtime hit
you get due to the extra memory allocations (which can be significant).

But yes, I should definitely read this book, thanks for reminding me :p
