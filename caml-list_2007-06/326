Sorry for the semi-offtopic admin stuff, but I've posted a few messages to the list via google group 'fa.caml' over the past months.  Or at least I thought I did.  They show up just fine when I look at google groups.  But they don't show up on the mailman archives at caml.inria.fr.

This makes me suspect that anyone subscribing to the list properly isn't seeing emails from people who post via Google groups.  Which might explain why the usually responsive Nicholas never answered this ocamlbuild question:

http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/592e166c1890f034/17890ce5f139a813?lnk=gst&q=ocamlbuild&rnum=7#17890ce5f139a813

Can this behavior be confirmed? Is there anything that can be done about it, or are we at the mercy of the mighty people at google?

I wouldn't mind it if google groups was read-only (or even non-existent for this list), but having a 'forked' version of the list seems like about the worst possible way for things to work.
