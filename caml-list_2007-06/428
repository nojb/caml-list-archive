It seems you forgot either -c or -linkpkg.
The following should work.

ocamlfind ocamlc -c -syntax camlp4o -package micmatch_pcre toto.ml
ocamlfind ocamlc -o toto -syntax camlp4o -package micmatch_pcre -linkpkg toto.ml

Note that the current version of micmatch does not work under ocaml/camlp4 
3.10.0. I recommend using 3.09.3 until the new camlp4 is more mature.
