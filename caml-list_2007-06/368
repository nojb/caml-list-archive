Thanks for the suggestions, everyone.  I've uploaded a new version of 
deriving with the name changes you suggested.  There are a few other 
changes: the interfaces of Dump and Pickle are now compatible, deriving 
should now work on 64-bit platforms, and there's a fix for a quotation 
that was causing compilation problems.

I've only had one report of unsuccessful compilation.  I'd be very 
interested to hear if anyone else had problems building deriving or 
running the tests.  Reports of success are welcome too, of course.

Jeremy.
