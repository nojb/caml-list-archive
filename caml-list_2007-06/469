I was just expecting it to work like the printf from the glibc:

s      If  no  l  modifier  is  present:  The  const char * argument is
	      expected to be a pointer to an array of character type  =
(pointer
	      to  a string).  Characters from the array are written up =
to (but
	      not including) a terminating NUL character; if  a  =
precision  is
	      specified,  no more than the number specified are written. =
 If a
	      precision is given, no null character need be  present;  =
if  the
	      precision  is  not specified, or is greater than the size =
of the
	      array, the array must contain a terminating NUL character.

As said above, this is not how printf is working in the glibc (at =20
least on linux and Mac OS X). Any clue why the same convention has =20
not been followed?

--=20
