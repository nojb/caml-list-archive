Yeah... unfortunately, the regex matching that the syntax hilighting is 
based on hakes it hard to get certain constructs right.  I believe this is 
supposed to be overhauled in v2.0 (which is dependant on Tiger).  BTW: 
what's wrong with the with record syntax?  It seems to work fine for me.

Well, it is scriptable, so you could write a script that tould take care 
of that for you.  Ocamlbuild should help make this a bit less painless as 
well.

Actually, my biggest annoyance is that you can't easily do something like 
jump to the ith character of a selection (though I could prabably write a 
script for that too), which is needed for working with large exressions in 
the toplevel where it identifies errors by location and not highlighting.
