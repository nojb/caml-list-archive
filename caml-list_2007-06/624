All,

In tuareg-mode, is there a simple way to add support for indentation
for a new syntactic construct that behaves exactly like "let ... in
..."?  I'd like "def ... in ..." to behave the same way.  I'm thinking
of some code I can stuff in my .emacs, hopefuly, as opposed to a
modification of tuareg.el.

I'd like to be able to write:

    let foo a b = a + b in
    def hi(x) = print_int x; 0 in
    let bar x = x in
      <some body where foo and hi are in scope>

i.e. I'd like to interleave let .. in ... and def ... in ..., and have
them cooperate.

I looked around tuareg.el and found a bunch of places where "let" is
mentioned in a regexp, and even found `tuareg-make-find-kwop-regexp',
whose doc string says "Make a custom indentation regexp".  That doc
string seems like it's what I want, but that function has no side
effects, so clearly it's not the whole story.

What I'm eventually shooting for is a tuareg mode that "knows" about
Jocaml syntax, since I'm fiddling around with that for the moment.
There are more new pieces of syntax on Jocaml (new keywords "spawn"
and "reply to") which seem pretty simple to support, but I haven't
thought about them very much.

Thanks in advance.
