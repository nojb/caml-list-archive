Ledit compiles perfectly with Camlp4s that you can download on my site.

I am sorry, I am not going to port my softwares (GeneWeb, ledit,
mlrogue, olibrt) into the new Camlp4, because I don't agree with the
fundamental choices of that camlp4 (in particular, changes in the
syntax tree, and I disagree the use of some libraries, programs,
programming and compilation technics, interfaces, tools, source
tree).

These choices are too different to be compatible with my point of
view. I would like to cooperate with the OCaml team to improve their
Camlp4, they are nice people but they are taking to what I call
wrong directions. (They know my point of view, I told them.)

I need Camlp4 for GeneWeb, but I did not manage to port it to the new
Camlp4, and it is the main reason why I resurected the version of
Camlp4 I had. These days, I have been preparing a new version with a
new pretty printing system used and documentation pages.

If it is a question of naming, I can rename my Camlp4 into Camlp5 or
whatever, but ledit will not be translated into the Camlp4 distributed
with OCaml.
