Same place? It's less well-defined under Windows because it's not a compiler
oriented OS... all the Microsoft Dev. Tools have their own special build
environments that set the relevant variables for where the libs are. AFAIK
there's no "correct" place for them.

dir /x returns short names but, alas, it doesn't combine with /b to produce
what you're after. However, cygpath --dos does exactly what you need.
Incidentally, using %OCAMLLIB% is unreliable - 'ocamlc -where' is better as
that will return an answer even for an environment that hasn't defined
OCAMLLIB (which isn't mentioned as being necessary in INSTALL in the source
distribution...)

So, for me, the whole command becomes:
for /f "delims=" %F in ('ocamlc -where') do @c:\cygwin\bin\cygpath -d "%F"
