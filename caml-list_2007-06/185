Hi everyone,

The new version of ODT has been released this morning. This version replaces
the broken ODT 1.1 release. 
The 1.1 UI plugin was built incomplete because I forgot to update the plugin 
build script: the UI plugin did not contain the indentation configuration files.

Now, ODT works as expected. It supports execution via the Java 1.5 JVM and, 
most of all, automatic indentation.

Everything is available on the ODT website: http://ocamldt.free.fr.
The "overview" page explains its current main features, and the 
"install notes" page details some requirements and incompatibilities
with older versions of OCaml.
Some screenshots are also available to show the GUI.

Please, don't hesitate to try ODT (for personal or professional use)
and forward this mail to anyone which could be interested in.

Thanks !

Manu
