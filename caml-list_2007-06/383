The quotes are necessary to consider that the block is a single argument.
If you want to remove those quotes, then you have to "guess" what the 
user meant (i.e. guessing where the quotes would have been if they were 
there).
In some cases, it's impossible to guess with a 100% accuracy...

Well, I suggest you to use $HOME instead of ~.
(then you have to use double quotes instead of quotes, so that the shell 
expands $HOME, as the variables inside simple quotes don't expand -- 
well I hope you are not using a too weird shell ;-)
