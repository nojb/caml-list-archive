I think it's quite too hard to explain, and it leads you to make 
mistakes too easily.

By the way, I wonder how you could explain that to students learning the 
language...

What I think is that :
- whether they know nothing about programming : then they end up 
thinking it's quite too ugly...
- whether they already know something about programming : they would 
think that the language is ugly and stick to those they already know...

Anyways, I really wouldn't want that.
One should not have to spend ten years to learn a programming language, 
just because of such tricks.
