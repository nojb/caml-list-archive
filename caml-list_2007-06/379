I would be extremely interested in a C++ parser for OCaml, especially
if it was largely compatible with CIL. The conventional wisdom is that
this is a lost cause, it's just too much work. E.g., in order to
handle real code, you'd need to support almost 30 years' worth of
language variants and historical compiler bugs that have become de
facto "features", etc.

Another approach would be to modify GCC so that it's intermediate
representation can be fed to outside tools. As a bonus, this would
provide support for Java, Fortran, and all the other languages
front-endsd in the GCC suite. Unfortunately, unless the GCC
maintainers have changed their position, this would require forking
the front end, though I suspect the changes required to implement this
are fairly minor. (See, e.g., this old discussion from the GCC list:
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-10/msg00103.html)
