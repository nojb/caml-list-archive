I wrote a parser generator for a tick data file.
The generated OCaml file is ~1Mb and contains ~120 variant type
definitions (each with 2 to ~100 variants) plus one polymorphic variant
type.
When I compiled it with ocamlopt (3.09.3), it took almost 10 minutes and
consumed ~500MB RAM (Firefox and Thunderbird were killed by the kernel
to make space for ocamlopt).
I run Linux 2.6.18.8 on a dual CPU Pentium D 2.80GHz with 1GB of RAM.
(in 32-bit mode)

So, is this something to be expected? 10 min / 500MB seems like a little
bit excessive to me, given that the file is really very simple conceptually.

Thanks!
Sam.
