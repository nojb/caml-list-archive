It's OCaml mode usually works fine, but there are a few places it  
messes up: the "with" record syntax is the most notable.  Mainly, I  
like (a) the drawer with the file tree, (b) tabbed editing, (c) code  
folding, (d) Cmd-whatever and menus instead of Ctrl-X Ctrl-S, Meta- 
this, Alt-that, etc.  I was always a VIM guy instead of emacs, so I  
never got the hang of emacs control sequences.  Downsides are that  
(a) not programmable, and (b) you have to keep a terminal open to  
build, etc.

You have to admit, when you buy a Mac, you're (at least partly)  
paying for aesthetics.  TextMate takes advantage of those.  Now if I  
could just find a terminal that did the same...
