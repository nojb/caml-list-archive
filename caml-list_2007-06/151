update: the main problem is a polymorphic variant type with 3050
variants and a function that returns its instances.
chunking the type, i.e., replacing
type foo=[|`A|`B|`C|`D]
with
type foo_1=[|`A|`B]
type foo_2=[|`C|`D]
type foo=[|foo_1|foo_2]
(but with ~55 variants in ~55 types) did not help.
Removing the type definition did solve the RAM problem - according to
top(1), ocamlopt.opt was taking ~80MB, and it compiled the file in about
10 minutes.

Any chance there is some quadratic code in polymorphic variant type
processing?!

Sam.
