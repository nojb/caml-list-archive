Hello friends:

We intend to pass our work from Caml to Caml-light but in the
documentation about the compiler we have ( version 0.5 ), there is
no mention about the pretty-printing nor other feature similar to
the Caml one. I would like to know if that tool exists or if you have
thought to implement it in future versions.

Best regards.

                                                         Alberto Gil.
