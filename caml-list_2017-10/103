Call for papers

CAV 2018: The 30th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification

July 14-17 2018, Oxford, UK, Part of the Federated Logic Conference, FLoC 2018

http://cavconference.org/2018/

http://floc2018.org

Important dates:

Paper submission deadline: January 31, 2018 (firm)
Rebuttal period: March 15-17, 2018
Author notification: March 31st, 2018

CAV 2018 is the 30th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the
theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for
hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum from
theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on
practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that
are needed for their implementation. CAV considers it vital to
continue spurring advances in hardware and software verification while
expanding to new domains such as machine learning, autonomous systems,
and computer security. The proceedings of the conference will be
published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science
series. A selection of papers is expected to be invited to a special
issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.

CAV'18 will take place in Oxford, UK, and is a part of the Federated
Logic Conference (FLoC) 2018.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

+ Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations
+ Algorithms and tools for system synthesis
+ Algorithms and tools that combine verification and learning
+ Mathematical and logical foundations of verification and synthesis
+ Specifications and correctness criteria for programs and systems
+ Deductive verification using proof assistants
+ Hardware verification techniques
+ Program analysis and software verification
+ Software synthesis
+ Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification
+ Formal methods for cyber-physical systems
+ Compositional and abstraction-based techniques for verification
+ Probabilistic and statistical approaches to verification
+ Verification methods for parallel and concurrent systems
+ Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology
+ Decision procedures and solvers for verification and synthesis
+ Applications and case studies in verification and synthesis
+ Verification in industrial practice
+ New application areas for algorithmic verification and synthesis
+ Formal models and methods for security
+ Formal models and methods for biological systems

Submissions on a wide range of topics are sought, particularly ones
that identify new research directions. CAV 2018 is not limited to
topics discussed in previous instances of the conference.  Authors
concerned about the appropriateness of a topic may communicate with
the conference chairs prior to submission.

Paper Submission

- Full papers should be uploaded by the submission deadline.
- Tool papers require the submission of an artifact together with
the paper submission.

As in 2017, CAV will follow a lightweight double-blind review process.
Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or
submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is
not allowed.  The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal
period where authors will have the option to respond to reviewer
comments.  The PC chairs may solicit further reviews after the
rebuttal period.

Submissions will be in two categories: Regular Papers and Tool Papers.

Regular Papers

Regular Papers should not exceed 16 pages in LNCS format, not counting
references and appendices.  Authors can include a clearly marked
appendix at the end of their submissions that is exempt from the page
limit restrictions. However, the reviewers are not obliged to read the
contents of these appendices.  These papers should contain original
research and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of
the contribution.  Papers will be evaluated on basis of a combination
of correctness, technical depth, significance, novelty, clarity, and
elegance. We welcome papers on theory, case studies, and comparisons
with existing experimental research, as well as combinations of new
theory with experimental evaluation.  A strong theoretical paper is
not required to have an experimental component.  On the other hand,
strong papers reproducing and comparing existing results
experimentally do not require new theoretical insights.

Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are
not required) to submit the relevant artifact for evaluation by the
artifact evaluation committee.

Tool Papers:

Tool Papers should not exceed 6 pages, not counting references.  These
papers should describe system and implementation aspects of a tool
with a large (potential) user base (experiments not required, rehash
of theory strongly discouraged).  Papers describing tools that have
already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if
significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and
implemented.  Note that tool papers require the submission of an
artifact for evaluation by the submission deadline. Artifacts will be
evaluated concurrently with the review process and the program
committee will have access to the artifact evaluation while making
their decision.  In special cases, where an artifact cannot be
submitted, the authors should contact the program chairs to find
alternate modes of artifact evaluation.
