Subject: Re: [Caml-list] use cc instead of gcc as default C compiler?

If gcc is not found, then the current configure does fall back to `cc`,
which I suppose would work fine on a Clang-only OpenBSD system. (Currently
the configure fails if gcc is not found and we are in a cross-compiling
scenario (host <> target), and this could be improved, but the support for
cross-compilation is due to be overhauled anyway.)

As far as I know, the autoconf work has not started yet, but it is still
planned for a reasonably close future.

I guess it would also be possible for the ./configure to use clang by
default under OpenBSD -- but I'm not sure where to cleanly integrate this
in the configure script. Currently the major clang-using system that OCaml
users maintain in OSX, and there gcc is just an alias for clang (or maybe
they still use the GCC frontend and LLVM backend?), so we never had to
adapt configure to explicitly invoke clang to support it -- or really
implement much in the form of system-dependent compiler choice.
