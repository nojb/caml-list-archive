The latest (and hopefully last) beta release of Caml Light 0.7 is now
available from the usual place:

        host:      ftp.inria.fr
        directory: lang/caml-light/Release7beta

In addition to the Unix and MSDOS versions, the Macintosh version is
now available as well. It's a "fat binary" that runs in native mode on
PowerMacs (and delivers respectable performance).

Other changes since release 0.7 beta 4:

* "for" loop index now correctly captured in closures.
* Syntactic sugar: optional `;' at end of sequences now supported more
  consistently; `:=' is no longer synonymous for `<-' in record, array
  and string assignments (too ambiguous).
* Bug with #open and redefinition of identifiers fixed.
* library: new functions set__choose, hashtbl__new_table_rev.
* Bug in printing abstract types in camllight -g and in the debugger fixed.
* camlyacc: more syntax checks on the input grammar.
* camltk GUI: more efficient communication between Caml and TCL.
* German and italian translations of the error messages.
* Examples and documentation cleaned up.

As usual, please address bug reports to caml-light@pauillac.inria.fr.
