Hi Sylvain,

I am sorry you feel that way.

For me, it's actually the opposite: OCamlPro tries to improve the whole
OCaml development infrastructure, adding features and optimizations to the
compiler, writing new generic libraries and development tools, and taking
the burden of maintaining them on the long term, so that all of us, OCaml
developers and companies, can focus on hacking our favorite application in
OCaml, without having first to rewrite all the tools you usually find with
other languages.

Also, as a service-provider, we mostly only work on tools and libraries
that are funded by our customers, because they think that these tools are
important to their business. Our current workforce on this topic is not so
big, we could do much more to improve the environment, but for that, we
need to find more customers (hint :-) ) so that we can design the best
solutions tailored to their needs.

--Fabrice
Scientific advisor for OCamlPro
