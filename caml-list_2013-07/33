Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] OCamlOScope: a new OCaml API search


--e89a8f3bb04f10f06f04e0ba38fe
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Hi list,

I have launched a new OCaml API search, OCaml=E2=97=8EScope at
http://ocamloscope.herokuapp.com .

OCaml=E2=97=8EScope is a type directed library search, derived work from OC=
aml API
Search by Mizuno and its ancestor OCamlBrowser by Garrigue. It is also
inspired from Hoogle, the same API search engine for Haskell by MItchell,
which I regularly use in my Haskell :-) job.

* Fast and Portable. It loads everything in memory, unlike OCaml API Search
and OCamlBrowser which load compiled interface files (*.cmi) dynamically.
The data file is extracted from compiled files but self-contained, so the
search engine does not require to compile the libraries locally.
* No use of unification but edit distance of types like Hoogle. Unification
does not provide good results in type directed search, and is costy.
* OCamlFind and OPAM friendly. OCaml=E2=97=8EScope knows which items are fr=
om which
OCamlFind and OPAM packages.
* OCamlDoc: it also extracts OCamlDoc comments, if possible.
* Small: it can even run as a heroku app. Currently it carries 245k entries
from 76 OCamlFind packages including Core and Batteries, but the data file
(as a marshalled OCaml value) is still 20Mb.

There are lots of todos but I think the search results look well sane so
far. If you find something strange please drop by
https://bitbucket.org/camlspotter/ocamloscope-server/issues?status=3Dnew&st=
atus=3Dopen
and
leave some comments. Thanks!

Jun Furuse
