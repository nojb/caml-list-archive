Subject: Re: [Caml-list] GODI is shutting down

Hi,

I've been told on IRC that I had completely failed at explaining my
thoughts so I'll skip answering to your objections and try again.
Sorry for that, it was still a bit early and I didn't plan well the time
needed to proofread properly.

Oasis is completely independant of the package manager. It helps build
something that can be easily packaged but it doesn't go further, except
maybe by providing some helpers but that's a very small part of oasis.

It also setups the build system and opam doesn't do that. Opam only
works in your case because you've written a working build script but
that's not something easy and that's something that most usually failed.

It helps with the more complex builds, including C bindings. There were
mentions of it being an issue for bigger projects, I'm (geniously)
curious about them: what and how?

There's some overlap between oasis and your-build-scripts+opam but oasis
and opam simply aren't the same.

By the way, you should expect additional complexity soon as
cross-compilation becomes possible without additional patches to the
compiler. That's something a system like oasis could take care of.
I've cross-compiled libraries relying on oasis without issue by changing
ocamlfind's configuration. I'm under the impression oasis doesn't
differentiate yet between tools that need to run on the build and on the
host system (autotools parlance) but that would be easy even without
changing _oasis files with simple heuristics.
