Is there a recommended example of a good OCaml binding to a C library? 

I see that openbabel has python bindings, so I will support the same set 
than what is available for python. 



The python bindings were generated using swig and swig supports OCaml 
apparently. 
That looks interesting.

Hello, I don't know much about C bindings. 
I used cairo-ocaml which had quite simple bindings, and which also has python bindings : 
http://oandrieu.nerim.net/ocaml/ 

A more complicated example but I am pretty sure implemetation was good is lablgtk2 

I don't know if there are some general recognised tools to generate C bindings. 

Best regards, 
Romain
