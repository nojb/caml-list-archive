Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Error: Unbound value abs_num

Hi,

thanks a lot for your helping and clearing up my understanding!

@David: The idea to search for a potential bug was just due to that it's a
freshly installed system and, e.g.; scala currently cannot be installed from
the repositories due to some missing dependencies...so I just thought about it
being something similar (in terms of a bug due to a new release...).

But anyway, thanks a lot!

Cheers,

Phil
