I vote for oasis. Its kind of a meta build system in that it then
generates you a Makefile, configure, setup.ml, myocamlbuild.ml (in my
case) and _tags to do the actual building.

It can build libraries, packed and not packed, binaries and test
suites with verry little input. It generates META files for libs and
handles build dependencies on other libs or libs from part of the same
source. The generated files can also be extended in case you need
something oasis doesn't know about. Never had the need for that yet.
