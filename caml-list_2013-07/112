Subject: [Caml-list] LPAR-19 in South Africa - Paper Deadline

                      ===========================
                                LPAR-19
                            CALL FOR PAPERS
                      ===========================

        ============================================================
                  The 19th International Conference on
        Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning
        ============================================================

               Stellenbosch, South Africa, 14-19 December 2013
                            www.LPAR-19.info

The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of 
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning,
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 19th LPAR
will be held in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

Logic is a fundamental organizing principle in nearly all areas in Computer
Science. It runs a multifaceted gamut from the foundational to the applied.  
At one extreme, it underlies computability and complexity theory and the formal
semantics of programming languages. At the other extreme, it drives billions of
gates every day in the digital circuits of processors of all kinds. Logic is in
itself a powerful programming paradigm, but it is also the quintessential
specification language for anything ranging from real-time critical systems to
networked infrastructures. Logical techniques link implementation and
specification through formal methods such as automated theorem proving and model
checking. Logic is also the stuff of knowledge representation and artificial
intelligence. Because of its ubiquity, logic has acquired a central role in
Computer Science education.

Topics
------
New results in the fields of computational logic and applications are welcome.
Also welcome are more exploratory presentations, which may examine open
questions and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories and practices.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  * Abduction and interpolation methods
  * Automated reasoning
  * Constraint programming
  * Decision procedures
  * Description logics
  * Foundations of security
  * Hardware verification
  * Implementations of logic
  * Interactive theorem proving
  * Knowledge representation and reasoning
  * Logic and computational complexity
  * Logic and databases
  * Logic and games
  * Logic and machine learning
  * Logic and the web
  * Logic and types
  * Logic in artificial intelligence
  * Logic of distributed systems
  * Logic programming
  * Logical aspects of concurrency
  * Logical foundations of programming
  * Modal and temporal logics
  * Model checking
  * Non-monotonic reasoning
  * Ontologies and large knowledge bases
  * Probabilistic and fuzzy reasoning
  * Program analysis
  * Rewriting
  * Satisfiability checking
  * Satisfiability modulo theories
  * Software verification
  * Specification using logic
  * Unification theory

Programme Chairs
----------------
  * Ken McMillan
  * Aart Middeldorp
  * Andrei Voronkov

Conference Chairs
----------------
  * Bernd Fischer
  * Geoff Sutcliffe

Workshop Chair
--------------
  * Laura Kovacs

Submission Details
------------------
Submissions of two kinds are welcome:

  * Regular papers that describe solid new research results. They can be
    up to 15 pages long in LNCS style, including figures and references,
    but excluding appendices (that reviewers are not required to read).
  * Experimental and tool papers that describe implementations of systems,
    report experiments with implemented systems, or compare implemented
    systems. They can be up to 8 pages long in the LNCS style.

Both types of papers can be electronically submitted in PDF via EasyChar:
    http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar19.
Prospective authors are required to register a title and an abstract a week
before the paper submission deadline (see below).

Participation
-------------
Authors of accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them
will be present at the conference.

Important Dates
---------------
  * Abstract submission: 22nd July
  * Paper submission: 2nd August
  * Notification of acceptance: 27th September
  * Camera-ready papers: 9th October
  * Conference: 14th-19th December


                      ===========================
                                LPAR-19
                               WORKSHOPS      
                      ===========================

LPAR-19 will be preceded by four workshops in specialised areas of logic:

  * The 10th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics - IWIL
    http://www.eprover.org/EVENTS/IWIL-2013.html

  * The 7th International Workshop on Analytic Proof Systems - APS
    http://www.logic.at/staff/chrisf/ws/LPAR-APS-7.html

  * The 1st International Workshop on Algebraic Logic in Computer Science -
    ALCS
    http://www2.cs.cas.cz/~cintula/lpar-workshop-ALCS.html

  * The 1st International Workshop on Logics and Reasoning for Conceptual
    Models - LRCM

See their individual web pages (linked from the LPAR-19.info page too) for
further details.
