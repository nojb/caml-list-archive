Subject: [Caml-list] DBPL 2013: call for participation

                    The 14th International Symposium
                   on Database Programming Languages
                        http://dbpl2013.inria.fr
                     Riva del Garda, Trento, Italy
                            August 30, 2013
                       co-located with VLDB 2013
                                    
                        Call for Participation
                                   
For over 25 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue
for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of
databases and programming languages. Many key contributions in query
languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested
relational data, and semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas
in types for query languages, were first announced at DBPL. Today, the
emergence of new data management applications such as cloud computing
and “big data,” social network analysis, bidirectional programming,
and data privacy has lead to a new flurry of creative research in this
area, as well as a tremendous amount of activity in industry. DBPL is
an established destination for such new ideas.
