Subject: Re: [Caml-list] opam and godi

Sad to read such FUD here. The truth is that the company Yaron is working
for never managed to create good Core packages. I don't know what the
reason is, but I guess so it is within this company, since other people
with fewer resources mastered similar tasks well. This is something I was
always puzzled about, since initially there was good cooperation with this
company.

So far I've removed Core from GODI because it misses QA standards, and
have no plans to add it again.
