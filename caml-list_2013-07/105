Hello, 

I was using ocaml + lablgtk2 + glade. 
Glade is a tool to graphically design user interfaces. It used to generate glade 2 files (designed for gtk2) until version 3.8. Then I used "lablgladecc2" to convert them in ocaml. 

Now "lablgladecc2" is not appropriate anymore starting with glade 3.10 that generates glade 3 files (designed for gtk3). I was using as a workaround "glade-gtk2" in ubuntu that still generated glade 2 files. But glade-gtk2 is not available anymore in debian, and is not supposed to be available forever in ubuntu. 

Also, lablgtk3 is still in development. 

What do you think is the most sensible thing to do (max benefits, less efforts) ? 

- pray for ocaml glade 3 support 
- forget glade dependency, and hardcode all graphical windows (30 windows to convert maybe ?) in lablgtk2 
- forget glade dependency, and hardcode all graphical windows (30 windows to convert maybe ?) in lablgtk3 
- user standard labltk library (ah ah) 
- other ? 

I whish qtcaml worked, but it is still in dev, I don't think c++ dependencies may be one day overcome, and my project, which is quite big, is under gtk and gtk2. 

Thanks, 
William
