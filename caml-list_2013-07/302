Me neither.
And, I'm not even competent enough to write one, unlike the many others
who felt they have to do so.

However, I do think (as a programmer) that the build system must
_NEVER_ get in front of my way.
It must be simple and observable (so that any problem
with the build configuration is easily fixed by anyone)
and parallelize the build to the maximum (this one should be a 
requirement from day 0 of the project).

At some point, I feel that some things have to be redesigned from
scratch rather than being patched endlessly.
Or, just switch to a better tool if it already exists.

You know, especially you Gabriel, that I can do that
(send patches with code, bug reports, etc.).
However, I do this only for projects that I admire.
Projects with a simple, crystal clear and sound design and a plain
UNIX taste.

I'm not sure there will be any pain for me to switch to another
build system (I think I will go for obuild).
I've stayed too long with ocamlbuild obviously.

Francois.
