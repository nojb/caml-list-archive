Hi,

both are independent projects. OPAM is a younger project, and I don't
really know what the motivation behind it is (in addition to the generic
motication to hack something). There were initially claims to make it is
easier to package software up, but what I've seen is actually not much
different from GODI (actually even worse now that GODI allows it to fully
automate package releases).

The feature sets are not the same, and some stuff works better in OPAM and
some in GODI. As I'm advocating the latter, let me point out some features
where I think GODI is better:

 - It supports binary packages as well as source packages. E.g.
   a dedicated build host can distribute binary packages to a
   network.
 - You can force to install archived versions of packages
   (i.e. not only "pin" them but build them from scratch).
   Groups of developers can define the package versions they
   want to work with.
 - Automatic search of system libraries without any need to
   configure these with paths etc.
 - GODI can upgrade itself to a newer version.
 - It has a comprehensive user's manual, also explaining things like
   how to create your own repository.

Gerd
