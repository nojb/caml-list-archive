Subject: [Caml-list] 10th IWIL Workshop, in South Africa


  10th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics

        http://www.eprover.org/EVENTS/IWIL-2013.html


The 10th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics will
be held on December 14th, 2013, colocated with the 19th International
Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and
Reasoning in Stellenbosch, South Africa.

We are looking for contributions describing implementation techniques
for and implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem
provers for various logics, logic programming systems, and related
technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

  + Propositional logic and decision procedures, including SMT
  + First-order and higher order logics
  + Non-classical logics, including modal, temporal, description, and
    non-monotonic logics
  + Formal foundations for efficient implementation of logics
  + Data structures and algorithms for the efficient representation and
    processing of logical concepts
  + Proof/model search organization and heuristics for logical reasoning
    systems
  + Data analysis and machine learning approaches to search control
  + Techniques for proof/model search visualization and analysis
  + Practical constraint handling
  + Reasoning with ontologies and other large theories
  + Implementation of efficient theorem provers and model finders for
    different logics
  + System descriptions of logical reasoning systems
  + Issues of reliability, witness generation, and  witness verification
  + Evaluation and benchmarking of provers and other logic-based systems
  + I/O standards and communication between reasoning systems

We are particularly interested in contributions that help the
community to understand how to build useful and powerful reasoning
systems, and how to apply them in practice.

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a
position statement (2 pages), a short paper (up to 5 pages), or a full
papers (up to 15 pages). Submissions should be made via EasyChair at
  
  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwil2012

Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will
select a balanced program of high-quality contributions.

Submissions should be in standard-conforming PDF. Final versions will
be required to be submitted in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class
file. Proceedings will be published as EasyChair Proceedings.

If number and quality of the submissions warrant it, we plan to
produce a special issue of a recognized journal on the topic of the
workshop.

Important Dates:

  Submission of papers/abstracts:  October 14th, 2013
  Notification of acceptance:      November 11th, 2013
  Camera ready versions due:       December 2nd, 2013
  Workshop:                        December 14th, 2013
