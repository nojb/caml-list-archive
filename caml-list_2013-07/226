OPAM uses git. git is distributed. Github is a tool that you can (and
they do) use with git.

There is no required dictator with OPAM. You may create your own
git-based opam repository and use it with your own package
descriptions in your own namespace. It is very flexible.

You can do this, today. Simply send an email patch from your local
opam repository to your friends.

Hope this helps,

David
