I was not aware of this when the descriptions got integrated in the repository, and I've removed them as soon as the issue has been raised on the GODI mailing list [1, 8 oct 2012] and [2, 8 oct 2012]. To avoid such issue in the future we are planning to clarify the licensing scheme on all the metadata published on the "official repository" (we would like to make it public domain if possible, but it's maybe too late).

We have some experimental features to scan the filesystem before and after the installation, and update the corresponding `<name>.install` file with the difference but it's quite slow (because of the filesystem scanning) and this does not work when the number of jobs is greater than 1. But I would prefer to let that task to the packagers (or to their build-system, see for instance that nice omake extension[3])

Now we are starting to focus on the QA side, as Anil already have already told you in a previous email, as we slowly replace our old private Jenkins setup by a more advanced, fully written in OCaml -- but still experimental -- testing platform. Look at the the 4.00.1 on linux results they are the more meaningful for now on, more than 90% of the packages are working fine (and yes, that's definitely needs to be improved, but I would say that's not so bad).

The platform itself will either be a separate repository, or a separate branch or simply a virtual package in the main repository -- as explained in [4] (and on other threads of the platform list) the contents of the platform will be driven by QA criteria.

However, things are getting better as we are improving the support for windows (we have a private version which compiles and run OK on cygwin for basic packages) and we have an experimental binary support that we are still prototyping [6]. GODI and WODI are clearly in advance in this domain (but I recall that WODI is a relatively new project).

The above argument, in general, is invalid.

A large proportion of pull request in the the package metadata's repository is about fixing such dependency constraints (which are discovered by our testing tools). I don't have a yet a good story to bring that information back into the package, but I'd say that I'm not very fond of mixing everything together: let's keep the dependency constraints part of the package system and the build instruction part of the build system -- that's much simpler that way.
