So when you describe the virtues of GODI, you call it 'advocating', and when
Fabrice describes the virtues of OPAM, it's 'dumb campaigning'. This is
splendidly reminiscent of US politics!

I don't find any of this source-based package management particularly novel.
I've worked in the OpenBSD ports tree since the late 90s, and it's way ahead
of either OPAM or GODI. I think where OPAM contributes most over any other
source manager are the three points on the front page that I iterated earli=
er
in this thread:

- multiple simultaneous compiler installations.
- flexible package constraints.
- a Git-friendly development workflow.

The first is very useful, but PATH munging is certainly not novel. The Git
workflow is heavily inspired by Homebrew.

The constraint solver has seen a tremendous amount of work though:
there's one version built into OPAM (tweaked relentlessly by Thomas with
heuristics), and the external CUDF solvers from the Mancoosi project which
are magically accurate (but not yet integrated by default until they are
packaged on different repositories).

Anyway, I'm not a GODI user, but I think you're doing a disservice to your
loyal GODI users if you shut it down in a huff. There are features (notably
Windows support) where it'll take OPAM some time to catch up.  I think that
the real reason that you're shutting it is nothing to do with "respect", but
is good old-fashioned burnt-out:

Instead of doing such a heroic solo job (which I'm not being funny about --
it really is a lot of work), why not spend the time to open up GODI as well?

Most of the OPAM package descriptions come from *other people*. We just rev=

them, give feedback if necessary, click the merge button and fix errors that
creep through.  And even that takes up a surprising amount of time...
