Unfortunately, it is no longer possible for me to run the GODI<br>
distribution. GODI will not upgrade to OCaml 4.01 once it is out, and it<br>
will shut down the public service in the course of September 2013. The<br>
website, <a href=3D"http://camlcity.org" target=3D"_blank">camlcity.org</a>=

GODI installations can be continued to be used, but upgrades or bugfixes<br>
will not be available when GODI is off.<br>
<br>
Although there are still a lot of GODI users, it is unavoidable to shut<br>
GODI down due to lack of supporters, especially package developers. I was<b=

more or less alone in the past months, and my time contingent will not<br>
allow it to do the upgrade to OCaml 4.01 alone (when it is released).<br>
<br>
Also, there was a lot of noise about a competing packaging system for<br>
OCaml in the past weeks: OPAM. Apparently, it got a lot of attention both<b=

from individuals and from organizations. As I see it, the OCaml community<b=
r>
is too small to support two systems, and so in some sense GODI is<br>
displaced by OPAM.<br>
<br>
The sad part is that OPAM is only clearly better in one point, namely in<br>
interacting with the community (via Github). In times where social<br>
networks are worth billions this is probably the striking point. It<br>
doesn&#39;t matter that OPAM lacks core functions like deleting all files w=

<br>
If somebody wants to take over GODI, please do so. The source code is<br>
still available as well as the package directories. Maybe it is sufficient<=
br>
to move the repository to a public place and to redesign the package<br>
release process to give GODI a restart.<br>
<br>
There is also another point that was driving me mad in the past weeks,<br>
namely missing respect from the OPAM guys. Given the fact that OPAM is<br>
only a thin layer around ocamlfind (and guess who wrote it), and given the<=
br>
