Well, I feel like there is still something that is not answered.
Agreed, this is a technical question, but it is probably the bulk of
the issue. Namely, this is the beginning of Gerd's email:

Presented as above, it can be summarized as "opam developers
arbitrarily refused a cooperation offer". As a potential package
maintainer, hearing this has an impact on my motivation to devote too
much time to it. I would thus be quite interested to see the other side
of this coin.

Best regards,

E tutto per oggi, a la prossima volta.
