That is a bug in package B, and should be addressed before making v1.1 available in the main repository:
 1) either update version constraints of A as you suggest directly in opam
 2) fix package B to be backwards compatible (or at least report a bug upstream about it)
 3) do as in #1, i.e. use opam file as authoritative source, but report a bug against package A with a patch to _oasis, and a request to regenerate the files. The bugreport could even be automated (I assume package maintainers are automatically notified of bugs in their packages as well?)

There is also the possibility to automatically run 'oasis setup' for usual packages (that don't need special OASIS plugins and so on), and include the generated files as patches ... automatically.
