Please don't mix everything:
1. oasis-db wasn't meant to replace GODI (maybe the Hump if you really
want to compare)
2. as a matter of fact you were using odb and seems to be happy -- never
forget that part of odb rely on oasis-db (which was a short but fruitful
collaboration with thelema)

There was plan to indeed have a oasis-db do something similar to GODI,
but I was not convinced that it should be done (and actually spend
almost no time on it).

Please, this thread is about GODI/opam, I really don't want to be
involved.
