Hello William,

I very much appreciate your effort to create more documetation for the
ocaml.org site!

I suppose this advice used to be good, but today maybe not as much
anymore.

Also, OASIS can directly create a _tags file, which makes it probably
the easiest system to deploy.

In my opinion, this works pretty decent even when extending OCaml with
C modules.

Omake has a pretty nice feature to recompile the files automatically on
changes, thus you have a workflow that does not feature explicit
compilation. Very useful, since the OCaml compiler is reasonably fast.
I wish other systems would adopt this. I often write shellscripts that
do similar things with inotifywait, but an integrated solution would be
great.

I also agree that the Omake language is=E2=80=A6 odd. Maybe not more odd th=
an
Makefiles, but Makefiles are common and well understood, whereas Omake
is kinda obscure.

regards,
Marek
