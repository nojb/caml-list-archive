There was a time when some MinGW-compiled applications depended on mingw10.dll that had to setup/cleanup something related to exceptions. 
According to [1] in mingw-w64 this is no longer required because their runtime includes the required support:

I haven't used MinGW (or in fact Windows) since quite a long time so I don't know what the situation is today, but since mingw-w64 can build both 32 and 64-bit applications this is probably not an issue anymore.
