It is, if people could confirm to me that the existing ones work first on R=
aring.  There's a certain manual effort in supporting the older versions th=
at I'll script up if the existing packages do the job.

And please do note that these PPA packages are really intended to be all yo=
u need to bootstrap OPAM and do source-based development.  They're really n=
ot intended to supplant the full range of binary packages that the Debian O=
Caml team develops, nor be held to the same quality standard as their packa=
ges.
