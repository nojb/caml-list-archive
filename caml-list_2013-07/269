Subject: Re: [Caml-list] GODI is shutting down

Dear all,

I don't think this thread is particularly productive and I don't see it get=
ting any better.

The initial message said GODI is being shut down, unless someone is willing=
 to take it over.  Since then we seem to have entered an OPAM vs GODI debat=
e, which I find odd because unless someone has agreed to take over GODI (or=
 Gerd changes his mind), the entire discussion is moot.  If it's about feat=
ures the OCaml community feels it needs, there are also other channels wher=
e those can be discussed.=20

Overall, it feels as though this thread has become more about venting frust=
rations and I'd question whether this list is an appropriate place for that=
 (please realise that there are over 1300 subscribers).

Best wishes,
Amir
