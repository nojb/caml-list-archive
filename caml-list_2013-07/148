Subject: [Caml-list] Error: Unbound value abs_num

Hi,

I'm new to OCaml and already struggling around with the seemingly easiest
things.
Following some introductory texts I wanted to play around a little with the
toplevel and its various features, among others, using provided modules. For
this, I thought about loading nums.cma and try some of its defined functions,
but it just does not work. See below for what I do in the toplevel and the
respective output.

> ocaml
        OCaml version 4.00.1
# #load "nums.cma";;
# abs_num 4;;
Error: Unbound value abs_num
# abs 4;;
- : int = 4

From my point it looks like I do not miss anything, yet, I just can't call
abs_num. And I don't know why. I'm working on a Fedora 19 x64. I checked
Bugzilla, but couldn't find any Fedora related issues (at least for this
behavior).

Thanks for any help,

Phil

PS: I know about the beginner's list at yahoo, however, I chose this one as I
don't like their style of forced social integration using different
services...I hope this is ok...
