Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OCaml installer on Windows no longer installs
 MinGW?

Hi Jonathan,

it's good to know that the installer is still maintained.

The main issue, in my opinion, is the outdated version of FlexDLL; this
actually prevents compiling some packages. So it's good that you plan to
fix this.

Regarding ActiveTCL, is it actually used by anything else than
Ocamlbrowser? And, is Ocamlbrowser actually used? :p Anyway, I don't
think it is really an issue, except that the failure to download might
look scary to new users.

Regarding the install.nsi file: I don't think there is actually anything
to patch. The package mingw64-i686-gcc seems to be requested by your
installer. It was not installed on my machine, but it is probably a bug
in the Cygwin installer. Maybe one could try to add a test, after the
installation of Cygwin, to check that all packages have been installed,
and print an error like: "Cygwin setup did not install all necessary
packages, do you want to try again?".

Cheers,
