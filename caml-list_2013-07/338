What makes you think so?

A quick look seems to indicate the opposite. There is no specific thread
support provided by mingw*.
There are pthreads-win32 and winpthreads but I don't see the build
system use them on Windows; I see calls to CreateThead() (typical win32
stuff) however for instance.

And you've opened the file as read-write too?
If so, you should maybe try Process Monitor to make sure everything was
done as expected:
