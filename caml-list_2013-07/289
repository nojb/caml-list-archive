Don't miss my point. I think OCamlPro is achieving a technical
challenge (although I wish OCamlPro will improve parallelism in OCaml
rather than something else). I just wish you make it with a good
leadership: making people talk together and collaborating. It will
probably just cost you a few emails to do it and it is not like you
are not aware of other people existing in the OCaml community.

Dev. behind closed door is a way to manage a company, but when it came
to OSS community it quickly makes member of the community feel weird.

OCamlPro should just improve its leadership and I'll be fine.

Regards
Sylvain
