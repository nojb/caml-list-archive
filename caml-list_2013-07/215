I do not live in the US, so I have no idea what you are talking about.

If you mean that I'm alone not louder than the crowd, maybe call it=20=20
burnout. At a certain point I noticed that arguments do not count=20=20
anymore, and it doesn't matter what I do. So it doesn't make sense to=20=20
put more energy into this project.

That's again campaign - you have absolutely no idea, but the reader of=20=
=20
your lines will have the impression that GODI is a closed system only=20=20
created by a single guy. Actually, most GODI packages were done by=20=20
other people (well, initially at least, but many packages got orphaned=20=
=20
over time). GODI is an open system, only that it's not as radically=20=20
transparent as people are nowadays used to (i.e. there is no web site=20=20
with user statistics, no public commit logs, no easy way to pull=20=20
commits from other systems, no whatever other bells and whistles, and=20=20
you needed to send me an email to register, old style). But the users=20=20
had all freedom, including doing releases completely on their own (no=20=20
pull request bureaucracy).
