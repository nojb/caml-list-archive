> This is not totally true. ocamlfind also install all the C stubs in `DEST=
DIR/stublibs/dllPKG.so` and this is not removed automatically by OPAM (as i=
t currently has no good way to know the library name used by ocamlfind). So=
, in this case, `ocamlfind remove PKG` does a bit more than removing DESTDI=
R/PKG.

Aha ok, spoke too fast.=20=20

> Indeed, no build system currently supports this. At one point, we've star=
ted to discuss the integration with oasis, obuild and ocp-build (with Sylva=
in, Vincent and Fabrice), but currenlty none of these systems has implement=
ed that feature yet.=20=20
For myself, I do have simple requirements, my packages being mostly pure OC=
aml. However I do need to scale horizontally, I have many packages develope=
d, documented, maintained and formally released and I have an absolute *hat=
e* for administrative duties.

I now decided to eschew each of these solutions (tested all of them) as non=
e in the current state is able to fullfill my needs in a satisfying way -- =
both technically and from a usability point of view. For the curious see he=
re [1] for how I plan to proceed from now on, at least until something *rea=
lly* good emerges.

However now that I decided to go the ocamlbuild only + install file route f=
or pure ocaml packages it would be nice if there was a way for ocamlbuild t=
o tell us, given an .mllib (or .itarget) file, all the installable artefact=
s it *might* generate as it does actually have that knowledge and I'd prefe=
r not to reencode it my scripts. I do it purely manually for now (see the l=
inks from the message [1]) it's not too bad, but I'd prefer having a simple=
r way so that I'm sure I don't miss anything (also if new build artefacts m=
ay appear in the future like cmxs did).=20=20
=20=20
> The `.install` mechanics is not perfect yet (the file needs to be at the =
root of the directory, and needs to be called PKG.install, where PKG is the=
 OPAM package name) but I've waited for feedback before improving this.

As I said on opam-devel I don't think these requirements are that bad.

Best,

Daniel
