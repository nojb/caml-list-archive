Personnally, I'd rather have a single human-readable file containing all 
the build information.

With the current setup in oasis used by a developper, you get:
a _tags file, a myocamlbuild.ml and you need a Makefile
on top of that (with some parts automatically generated) to pass more 
options to ocamlbuild.
Amazing!
But at least I see a clear culprit (ocamlbuild).
