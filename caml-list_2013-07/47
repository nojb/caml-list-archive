Hello,

Incidentally I learned more about all this today.

> After reading the opam documentation, I'm not sure anything specific has =
been done about the extra resources of packages (man and doc files for exam=
ple).
Some things have been done, read section 1.2.5 of the developer manual. An =
install file allow you to specify exactly what to install and where in `bin=
`, `doc` and `lib`.=20=20

In fact this it can completely replace an `ocamlfind install` or `ocaml set=
up.ml -install`. Just make sure you add the `META` in `lib`, and `ocamlfind=
` will find your package.

I also discovered that the `remove:` section with the usual `ocamlfind remo=
ve PKG` is not needed. This is all due to the fact the IIUC  `ocamlfind` us=
es the file system as the database so there's no worry to bypass it in thes=
e circumstances, opam will just remove the lib/PKG directory et voil=C3=A0.
=20=20
> The only things, I found in the documentation is build-doc switch to indi=
cate how to build the doc. For example, utop.1.5.opam contains
> build-doc: [ "ocaml" "setup.ml" "-doc" ]
>=20=20
> I was expecting to find the doc of utop but on my .opam repository, the d=
oc directory of utop is empty. Furthermore, in the utop.install file there =
is no doc command.
The problem is that apparently the utop package has a static .install file =
in the package description and that this file doesn't list the things gener=
ated by build-doc in the `doc:` section. As written in the manual section m=
entioned above it's much better if the .install file is actually generated =
by the underlying build system according to the artefacts it has built. But=
 to the best of my knowledge none of the current build systems in use suppo=
rt the generation of such a file (you can easily do it yourself though).

So the idea is that the `build:` section has commands that eventually gener=
ate a file PKG.install in the root directory of your distribution and opam =
then uses that file to install the files associated to the package. (Unfort=
unately the example of the online documentation uses an static .install fil=
e added to the package description *itself* which makes it believe that thi=
s was the only way to use them).

> More generally, my question also apply to man pages not found anywhere in=
 the opam documentation.
I have created an issue about this a few hours ago: https://github.com/OCam=
lPro/opam/issues/673

I think the support is mostly right, the only thing that is missing is inst=
all in man folders and a way to easily get to the doc directory of a partic=
ular package, instead of having to hunt in the .opam directory. This means =
that we can put the README and CHANGES in there aswell for people to read.

The conclusion of this is that the problem seems more to be that the instal=
l file of most packages is crap rather than a lack of support from opam its=
elf. Though the documentation about all this could be improved on the opam =
side aswell.

Best,

Daniel
