Subject: Re: [Caml-list] GODI is shutting down

Le mercredi, 24 juillet 2013 =C3=A0 09:42, Jun Furuse a =C3=A9crit :
> Have you discussed your idea of OPAM with Gerd or GODI community before s=
tarting the project? Was there no way of working together, to improve GODI,=
 or invite Gerd to OPAM development?

I'm sorry but these questions are pointless.=20=20

Since when do we have to ask for permissions to start new projects ? Since =
when do we have to cooperate with other people making a similar system if w=
e have divergent vision of what we want ? I think that Francois Berenger ma=
de a few good points on why you may want to start a new project.=20=20

Sure, what happens most of the time when an individual says I'm not happy w=
ith your system I'm going to implement my own, he fails badly because he do=
esn't actually understand the work/complexity involved. People tend to see =
that as a wasted time, wasted time for the "community" bla bla, but I don't=
, that's the way you learn.

In that case it wasn't a failure and, at least for me, I'm now given a syst=
em I actually enjoy working with from a *technical* and *usability* perspec=
tive both as a package user and as a package developer. It has nothing to d=
o with a supposed marketing campaign that I never saw. I tried the damn thi=
ng, liked it, considered the efforts that are being put in it and decided t=
o use it.

I find it strange that for quite sometime we had other individuals working =
on a similar concurrent project (oasis-db) and nobody every screamed at the=
m. That project never delivered and now that we have people actually delive=
ring we should scream at them ?

I tried godi a very long time ago and was not happy about the centralized w=
orkflow, maybe that changed I don't know. I then used odb for sometime beca=
use it was working for the simple things I did and it was easy to hack with=
 or provide your own package sources but I still saw it as a quick hack ---=
 albeit a very useful one for the time it served me, thanks to Edgar Friend=
ly.

Now I use opam and while there are still a few things that needs to be iron=
ed out for my development practice. I think that for myself it will eventua=
lly be of great help to manage the growing collection of packages I provide=
 and streamline my release process and admin time.=20=20

Best,

Daniel
