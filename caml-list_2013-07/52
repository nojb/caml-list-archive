First of all, thanks Daniel for the precise answer. It seems that writing t=
his damn developer manual was not so much of a waste of time after all :-)

>> After reading the opam documentation, I'm not sure anything specific has=
 been done about the extra resources of packages (man and doc files for exa=
mple).
> Some things have been done, read section 1.2.5 of the developer manual. A=
n install file allow you to specify exactly what to install and where in `b=
in`, `doc` and `lib`.=20=20
>=20
> In fact this it can completely replace an `ocamlfind install` or `ocaml s=
etup.ml -install`. Just make sure you add the `META` in `lib`, and `ocamlfi=
nd` will find your package.
>=20
> I also discovered that the `remove:` section with the usual `ocamlfind re=
move PKG` is not needed. This is all due to the fact the IIUC  `ocamlfind` =
uses the file system as the database so there's no worry to bypass it in th=
ese circumstances, opam will just remove the lib/PKG directory et voil=E0.

This is not totally true. ocamlfind also install all the C stubs in `DESTDI=
R/stublibs/dllPKG.so` and this is not removed automatically by OPAM (as it =
currently has no good way to know the library name used by ocamlfind). So, =
in this case, `ocamlfind remove PKG` does a bit more than removing DESTDIR/=
PKG.

OPAM has some mechanics to define internal libraries name (the field `libra=
ry`) -- this was an early experiment to simulate basic functionalities of o=
camlfind, so I guess we could reuse that field to declare which ocamlfind l=
ibraries a given OPAM package contains.
>=20
>> The only things, I found in the documentation is build-doc switch to ind=
icate how to build the doc. For example, utop.1.5.opam contains
>> build-doc: [ "ocaml" "setup.ml" "-doc" ]
>>=20
>> I was expecting to find the doc of utop but on my .opam repository, the =
doc directory of utop is empty. Furthermore, in the utop.install file there=
 is no doc command.
> The problem is that apparently the utop package has a static .install fil=
e in the package description and that this file doesn't list the things gen=
erated by build-doc in the `doc:` section. As written in the manual section=
 mentioned above it's much better if the .install file is actually generate=
d by the underlying build system according to the artefacts it has built. B=
ut to the best of my knowledge none of the current build systems in use sup=
port the generation of such a file (you can easily do it yourself though).

Indeed, no build system currently supports this. At one point, we've starte=
d to discuss the integration with oasis, obuild and ocp-build (with Sylvain=
, Vincent and Fabrice), but currenlty none of these systems has implemented=
 that feature yet. The `.install` mechanics is not perfect yet (the file ne=
eds to be at the root of the directory, and needs to be called PKG.install,=
 where PKG is the OPAM package name) but I've waited for feedback before im=
proving this.

> So the idea is that the `build:` section has commands that eventually gen=
erate a file PKG.install in the root directory of your distribution and opa=
m then uses that file to install the files associated to the package. (Unfo=
rtunately the example of the online documentation uses an static .install f=
ile added to the package description *itself* which makes it believe that t=
his was the only way to use them).

Indeed, the documentation is a bit misleading there, but to my defense, thi=
s was supposed to be an advance usage of OPAM :-)

>> More generally, my question also apply to man pages not found anywhere i=
n the opam documentation.
> I think the support is mostly right, the only thing that is missing is in=
stall in man folders and a way to easily get to the doc directory of a part=
icular package, instead of having to hunt in the .opam directory. This mean=
s that we can put the README and CHANGES in there aswell for people to read.

Indeed, this is clearly missing. I've created https://github.com/OCamlPro/o=
pam/issues/674 to track this.
>=20
> The conclusion of this is that the problem seems more to be that the inst=
all file of most packages is crap rather than a lack of support from opam i=
tself. Though the documentation about all this could be improved on the opa=
m side aswell.

Ack. We'll try to improve that before the next release (which unfortunately=
 has already been postponed too much). I've created https://github.com/OCam=
lPro/opam/issues/675 to track this.

Thanks for the feedback!
