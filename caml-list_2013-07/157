Subject: Re: [Caml-list] opam and godi

While I appreciate the work that Gerd has done on GODI, I do think
that OPAM is a significant improvement over GODI.

From an end-user-experience perspective, I've found OPAM to be
considerably smoother than GODI.  In addition to having what I
consider to be a better user interface, upgrading of packages in OPAM
has been very smooth overall.  I found upgrades in GODI to be pretty
tricky, with many upgrades ending in failure for one reason or
another.  I suspect this has something to do with the system for
handling of dependencies in OPAM, which has taken quite a bit of work
to get right from what I understand.

In addition, the ability to easily handle multiple compilers in OPAM
is also a big win, from my perspective.  I think it makes it much
easier to try out and give feedback on upcoming compiler versions,
which is good for the community as a whole.  (Plus, trying out
bleeding-edge compiler patches is fun...)

With the arrival of OPAM, for the first time I feel good about
recommending that new users try out libraries with significant
dependencies like Core, since installing such libraries is now really
quite simple.
