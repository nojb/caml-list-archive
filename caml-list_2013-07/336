mingw's additional lib has to be used if we're using thread for
example if I have understood correctly.

I get EBADF

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dk925tyb%28v=VS.80%29.aspx

EBADF is if the specified file is read-only or the descriptor is invalid

the file has write access for everyone.
And the file descriptor is converted the same way than everywhere else.

Then I noticed that I copied the stub from otherlibs/unix/ not from
otherlibs/win32unix/
so the file descr is converted by Int_val() instead of Handle_val().

But now I still get : EBADF

Interesting, thanks a lot.

Thanks, it made me discovered about the Handle_val() convertion that
only exists in win32unix.

Thanks a lot Adrien,
your answers are very interesting!
