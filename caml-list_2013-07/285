Subject: [Caml-list] Re: GODI is shutting down

Hello all,

This whole discussion has drifted into various technical topics but I
would like to give my POV on the general topic of OCamlPro vs some
members of the community.

I think OPAM is a great piece of work and I wished we can have two
package manager, including GODI for which I have contributed a little.

OCamlPro has the worforce to do things that most of the individuals
cannot do: have a team of engineers working on an OCaml topic. That's
great expect that when you know your software is on the list of topics.
When you are a team of 1 and OCamlPro has decided to work on something
close to what you are doing, you know that you should stop working on it
because you cannot compete (lack of time, lack of workforce).

This kind of feeling makes me extremly uncomfortable about the future of
all the libraries I maintain. This kind of FUD is extremly
counter-productive for any OCaml dev.

To give you a quick taste of that, you can read:
http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/66/59/62/PDF/paper_10.pdf (fr)

where you can see that ocp-build is supposed to replace OASIS
(explanation about why OASIS doesn't fit, p2 at the beginning) and that
it should replace findlib's META file (p12, Conclusion).

Some people will see a good news in this document and some people will
feel uncomfortable (like me).

I don't think making some people feel uncomfortable is great.

Given OCamlPro position, I would love to see them achieve great things
and solve long standing issue like:
https://github.com/lucasaiu/ocaml (a reentrant runtime which should be
the stepping stone for parallelism in OCaml)

I think it would be a lot more productive than to replace every OCaml
tools by something starting with ocp-...

My 0.02 cents
Sylvain
