It depends a lot. If you use
$> oasis setup -setup-update dynamic

You generate a very small set of files (no _tags and no myocamlbuild if
they are not here). I use that for certain project.

I think your problem is that OASIS try to generate standalone
installation (i.e. a package that doesn't depend on OASIS to build),
which means I have to pre-generate files for ocamlbuild, just as
automake...

Now, if the community as a whole say that we don't need a standalone
generation and can rely on OASIS to build, it would make my life 10x
easier (getting rid of super-complex 2-stage setup, ocaml-data-notation,
ocamlmod, ocamlify...)
