                           VMCAI 2014 CALL FOR PAPERS

                        15th International Conference on
       Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation (VMCAI)

                      January 19-21, 2014, San Diego, USA
                Co-located with POPL 2014 (January 22-24, 2014)
    41th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages


SCOPE

VMCAI provides a forum for researchers from the communities of
Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating
interaction, cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that
combine these and related areas.

The program of VMCAI'14 will consist of refereed research papers and tool
demonstrations, as well as invited lectures and tutorials. Research
contributions can report new results as well as experimental evaluations
and comparisons of existing techniques. Topics include, but are not
limited to: program verification, model checking, abstract interpretation
and abstract domains, program synthesis, static analysis, type systems,
deductive methods, program certification, error diagnosis, program
transformation, hybrid and cyberphysical systems. Submissions can address
any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional,
imperative, logic and object-oriented programming.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in English,
and must not overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed
proceedings. Proceedings are published by Springer-Verlag as volumes in
the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


IMPORTANT DATES

Abstract Submission:              September 6, 2013
Paper Submission:                 September 13, 2013
Acceptance Notification:          October 25, 2013
Conference:                       January 19-21, 2014 (right before POPL)

The deadlines are strict and will not be changed.


SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

The VMCAI 2014 proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer's
Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The page limit for submissions
is:

      18 pages in Springer's LNCS format.

Additional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the
discretion of the reviewers and to be omitted in the final version.
Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found
at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html.  Submissions deviating
from these guidelines risk summary rejection. Please prepare your
submission in accordance with the rules described.
