Contracted development, I guess.

Really?
So, when you start to dive in a large codebase, you think you have:
- full control
- deep understanding
- can do dramatic changes easily (like using state of the art
   dependency resolution technology)

I personally think it is good to start from scratch, sometimes.
In the long run, it can be a winning strategy.

Some people also started another package manager before OPAM
went public, if you want to know. It was called odb.ml.

cf. https://github.com/thelema/odb

Maybe it was just a hack, but for some people it was already filling
the bill better than GODI.

PS: I do like and use many stuffs released by Gerd: ocamlnet, ocamfind,
     etc.
