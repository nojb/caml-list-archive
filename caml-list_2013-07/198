Subject: Re: [Caml-list] opam and godi

Sigh.  I don't mean to get into a fight.  And the problems I've run
into with GODI, though, had nothing to do with the Core packages, so
that seems a bit off topic.

GODI surely has its uses, and in particular the Windows support is a
nice thing that OPAM still lacks.  That said, I very much prefer OPAM
(for the reasons echoed by others), and there's little doubt in my
mind as to which package manager I recommend to people who are working
on a UNIX or Mac platform.
