			   CONFERENCE VENUE

Istanbul is a city of unparalleled social and cultural richness.  It
is as fascinating and historical as it is dynamic and modern.  Serving
as the capital of two mighty empires for sixteen centuries, Eastern
Roman (or Byzantine) and Ottoman, and set squarely between two
continents, Istanbul has cultures and traditions that blend East with
West and Mediterranean with Anatolian. Each civilization that has made
Istanbul its home has left its mark in sublime and splendid ways, and
the result a city that gives one the feeling of universal history at
every step.

Istanbul has always been a meeting place, a crosspoint and a
destination. With the Ataturk Istanbul International Airport, getting
to and from Istanbul has never been easier. With a capacity of far
over 25 million travelers per year Istanbul is less than a three-hour
flight from most European cities. Istanbul has a second airport
located on the Asian side of the city, Sabiha Gokcen International
Airport, which is an important arrival point especially for low-cost
airlines.  Overall, Istanbul is served by more than 50 major airlines
to hundreds of cities around the world.
