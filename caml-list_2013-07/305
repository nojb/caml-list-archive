In all fairness, I should point out that this is not a good argument
in favor of OCamlbuild. While it is currently part of the official
distribution, it may be phased out in the future (the core maintainers
are eager to reduce the surface of code they have to maintain); as
some have mentioned it has seen disappointing levels of maintenance in
the past (since Nicolas Pouillard moved out to a post-doc, Xavier
Clerc did some work on ocamlbuild but has been very busy with other
things as well; only relatively recently did Wojciech put a fair
amount of effort into handling some of the users bugreports).

As I said above, I plan to keep using ocamlbuild and incrementally fix
some of its shortcomings (parallelization, documentation, plugin
composability...). I hope that some other users will also make a
contribution and help to solve some of the issues that have been
reported on the bugtracker (most of them are not very hard to tackle).
Wojciech and I eager to welcome patches and review them.

But I think you should pick your build system based on which one you
prefer (and you think can and will improve again in the long run),
rather than "political" aspects such as which one is blessed by this
or that organization. If you find out that some other build system
fits your needs better, by all means, use it.

Yes, that's something I like with ocamlbuild. One corresponding
downside is that currently, the way things go wrong, when they go
wrong, is not very clear to users, so it may appear like a magic box
that works very well for simple projects, but does not degrade
carefully. I'm confident we can improve on that aspect in the future
-- and in practice I've found the _log file reasonably easy to
understand. But other people have made the choice to favor systems
that do less auto-detection, to make it easier to have a good
understanding of the build process.

> I'm more encouraged now that a section has appeared in the OCaml manual.

It's easy to improve the manual, so if you see something in this
section that can be improved, please provide a patch! (Or a bugreport,
possibly with a replacement/change suggestion; that's already very
helpful.)

Besides the ocamlbuild manual, the OCamlbuild wiki that I mentioned
before in this thread has helpful content:
  http://brion.inria.fr/gallium/index.php/Ocamlbuild
OCamlbuild also has some auto-documenting features that I mentioned in
this blog post:
  http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/quick-tip-the-ocamlbuild-documentation-optio=
n/

Besides that, I learned what I know about ocamlbuild by looking at
existing plugins, the _log, possibly with some level of verbosity, and
finally looking at the sources (admittedly not the preferred way to
documentation, but still better than "trial and error"), in particular
the ocaml_specific.ml file that encodes most of the build rules used
for OCaml programs.
