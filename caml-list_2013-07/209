To be fair, I never felt GODI to be a closed system. There are in fact
a reasonable number that were packaged by someone else than Gerd (see
http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/packages.html , the "released by" field
on packages; several were packaged by Virgile Prevosto, for example).
It's more that the packaging for GODI is a bit more difficult, and
probably just as importantly as there never was a strong community
dynamics to contribute to GODI packaging. It is now the norm that
everyone should write a META file for ocamlfind, and it is becoming
the norm to package for OPAM, but GODI probably came too early at a
time where developers expected distributions to do the packaging work
(which Debian and Fedora still do superbly), and there never was much
of a community dynamics for GODI packaging.

And implementation-wise, I have had the pleasure of interacting with
Gerd a couple of time to discuss possible changes to ocamlfind, and I
did not get the impression that the project was "closed"; I'm quite
sure anyone could contribute (or have contributed) to GODI with a
well-justified, good-looking patch.
