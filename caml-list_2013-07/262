Yes. I have always done that during development since oasis was getting in =
my way. I don't want that indirection. I know how to use my build system, I=
 don't want it to be generated by someone else.

But then I would use oasis to make releases which meant expressing these bu=
ild rules in oasis which is not always obvious and/or possible without stil=
l needing to have to patch your _tags file (e.g. syntax extensions) and whe=
n things were not working you were left with that 350 loc myocamlbuild.ml f=
ile and an obnoxious _tags file that you didn't write.

At a certain point I realized that oasis was actually making very few thing=
s for me: basically generating the META and being able to express condition=
al dependencies. When I understood a little bit more about opam, its build:=
 section and its .install files and read about META files I realized that c=
ost/benefit of using oasis was too high.=20=20

Personally I'm moving away from oasis for new packages and will gradually p=
hase out its usage during maintenance release of my old packages. The path =
I'm taking from now on until something better emerges is described here [1].

Best,

Daniel
