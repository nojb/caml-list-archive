Subject: [Caml-list] PADL 2014: Call for Papers

                          Call for Papers
                          ===============

                  16th International Symposium on 
      Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2014)

            http://www.ist.unomaha.edu/padl2014

         San Diego, California, USA, January 20-21, 2014
                    Co-located with ACM POPL'14



                      Conference Description
                      ======================

   Declarative languages build on sound theoretical bases to provide 
attractive frameworks for application development. These languages 
have been successfully applied to many different real-world situations, 
ranging from data base management to active networks to software engineering 
to decision support systems.

   New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new 
application areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages 
to novel problems raise numerous interesting research issues. Well-known 
questions include designing for scalability, language extensions for 
application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications 
drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative 
systems, and benefit from this progress as well.

   PADL is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present original 
work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques 
for all forms of declarative concepts, including, functional, logic, 
constraints, etc. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

   * Innovative applications of declarative languages
   * Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
   * Practical applications of theoretical results
   * New language developments and their impact on applications
   * Declarative languages and Software Engineering
   * Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
   * Practical experiences and industrial applications
   * Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
   * Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and
     reactive languages.

   PADL'14 welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to applications 
and implementation of declarative languages. In this occasion 
PADL is co-located, as traditionally, with ACM POPL, which will be held 
immediately following PADL. The symposium will be held in San Diego, 
California, USA.



              Important Dates and Submission Guidelines
              =========================================

              Abstract Submission:    September  6, 2013
              Paper Submission:       September 13, 2013
              Notification:             October 21, 2013
              Camera-ready:            November 10, 2013
              Symposium:             January 20-21, 2014

   Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF
using the Springer LNCS format. The submission will be done through
EasyChair conference system. If electronic submission is impossible,
please contact the program chairs for information on how to submit
hard copies. All submissions must be original work written in
English. Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or
informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. PADL'14
will accept both technical and application papers:

   * Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished
     research results. Technical papers must not exceed 16 pages in
     Springer LNCS format.
   * Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical
     applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or
     in areas of research other than Computer Science. Application
     papers will be published in the Springer-Verlag conference
     proceedings, and will be presented in a separate session.
     Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or
     real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of
     declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering
     solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative)
     are solicited. The limit for application papers is 6 pages in
     Springer LNCS format.
