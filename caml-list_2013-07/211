Subject: Re: [Caml-list] GODI is shutting down

Just to through in my 2 cents. I didn't understand what GODI did, when I fi=
rst tried it. Therefore, I sticked with my OS package manage for a long tim=
e (home-brew on Mac OS X). The reason I now use OPAM, it worked straight ou=
t of the box, and I know exactly what is happening. The biggest benefit: th=
ere is a clean and easy way to uninstall everything (rm -rf ~/.opam), which=
 is the killer argument for me.

This is not intended to heat up the discussion, but to explain, from a regu=
lar user perspective, why I chose opam over godi.

Cheers,
Keyan
