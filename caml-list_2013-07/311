Please point out a single thing you would like to "redesign" in 
ocamlbuild.

Here is one: 
build configuration information scattered in several files of different syntax (myocamlbuild.ml and _tags).

If I am not mistaken, you can gather all information in myocamlbuild.ml. If not, that could be a bug report I guess, which seems possible to be solved. 

Personally, my projects are simple enough (as they only link to other ocaml packages using ocamlfind, without c dependencies), and I put everything in _tags file, no myocamlbuild.ml. On the contrary of gathering everything, for my purposes, I appreciate having a _tag file on each directory, adding up meta data to files located in the same place.
