Subject: AW: [Caml-list] GODI is shutting down

Let me answer to this message, because it is again fact-based, and not=20=
=20
full of unproven or poor-quality claims.

I hope the reader can now understand that OPAM is set up as competing=20=20
project from the beginning. Basically, three organizations joined to=20=20
create a new software. The discussion about the design wasn't public. I=20=
=20
was excluded from the beginning - and don't understand why, since I=20=20
made an offer for cooperation when I first heard from Ocamlpro's plans=20=
=20
(not about OPAM in particular, but other stuff, but I suggested to=20=20
cooperate in package manager questions). I never got a response to my=20=20
initiative. Instead, there was later questionable behavior from=20=20
Ocamlpro, namely that they copied (at least parts of) GODI packages,=20=20
without having asked for permission. (In particular, there was evidence=20=
=20
that they copied the package description texts.) This might be legal,=20=20
but the reader will understand that this is unfriendly, and=20=20
unneccessarily aggressive. At that point it was clear that they are=20=20
trying to push GODI aside, even with questionable means.

In the past days I made the experience that OPAM advocates never answer=20=
=20
to any of my objections. When I said "GODI has feature xy, why doesn't=20=
=20
OPAM has this too?" the only response is something like "OPAM has this=20=
=20
great Github-based workflow" (the most harmless variant). Discussion=20=20
impossible.

Fabrice claims that OPAM has GODI's strengths and tries to avoid its=20=20
weaknesses. I'd say this is just a personal view, because there was=20=20
never a public discussion (and Fabrice would probably be surprised what=20=
=20
I consider as GODI's strengths). I know very well where GODI's=20=20
weaknesses are, but I'm sure a public discussion would reveal that=20=20
there are a number of useful features that are currently missing in=20=20
OPAM, and where "we use Github" is no excuse. It would be very helpful=20=
=20
if the OPAM developers would a bit more self-critical, and did not=20=20
continuously claim that their software is superior (well, you know=20=20
Github, and dose3).

Let me only add one fundamental point where I think OPAM just takes=20=20
just one direction, and that it is worth a discussion never done. One=20=20
of the principles seems to be to make it as easy and comfortable as=20=20
possible to package up libraries. At the first glance a good thing, but=20=
=20
if you look deeper you'll see that this principle collides with other=20=20
ideas, and at least a modification of the principle is worth a thought.=20=
=20
There is the QA question, at least for the main repository (NB. as the=20=
=20
bad word of "dictator" was mentioned - yes, for the main repository=20=20
there is a dictator, both in OPAM and GODI, but belive me there is=20=20
enough anti-power). There are features in package management that are a=20=
=20
hassle for the packager, like clean deinstallation, or how well a=20=20
library is integrated into the OS. So far I've the impression OPAM just=20=
=20
ignores this, in the hope to attract as many packagers as possible. It=20=
=20
would be a bad deal if packager's interests always won over user's=20=20
interests.

A final remark to Fabrice's side story. Of course, it is normal that=20=20
software is suddenly no popular anymore, and users switch to a=20=20
different product. The user decides, after all, and developers=20=20
shouldn't take this personally. The software market is a jungle.=20=20
Nevertheless, this doesn't mean we shouldn't try to be civilized.=20=20
Often, there is an alternative (e.g. cooperation), and most often the=20=20
civilized way leads to better results (e.g. imagine mplayer would use=20=20
your assembly routines).
