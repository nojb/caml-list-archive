I have already understood that MinGW will produce a resulting binary
that equivalently makes use of MS' OS libs. But as far as I have
understood it also provide an additional layer which goal is to make
easier to compile something that comes from the Unix world. As a
result I expected to get a fully functional ocaml Unix module.

- truncate()  DOES work on my computer
- ftruncate() / _chsize()  DOESN'T

I see,
I expected that a mingw variant would use "otherlibs/unix/"
So it seems I was wrong again on that point too.

Don't you think that "win32unix/" should remain as is for the MS
compiler, and that mingw variant should just switch to
"otherlibs/unix/" ?

I do have only one test machine with Windows Seven Starter to make
tests. And I do not have the MS' compiler.

Are there other people arround living in Rennes (the town where I
live) that would accept to provide me access to other test machines
under MS/Windows ? Like for example Windows 8 ?
(So that I could do more serious tests.)

I would be interested to access Mac OS X too, also for portability works.
(Someone from the lug gave me a Mac in the past to make some
portability work, but this machine is too old now for this kind of
tasks.)
