Both is possible - there are two VMs, one with the repository and the=20=20
release infrastructure, one with the autobuilder, and it would be easy=20=
=20
to migrate it somewhere else. It's also possible to leave it where it=20=20
is if only someone else takes over the leadership of the project, and=20=20
invests time to renew it. (My problem is only that I don't have the=20=20
energy anymore to run it, but if I can help with computing resources it=20=
=20
would be a pleasure.)

Well, there is in deed one good use: imagine you have a group of people=20=
=20
needing to use exactly the same versions. So you basically freeze the=20=20
versions at one point in time, knowing that they work well together. If=20=
=20
you need newer versions, you move the "pin" together (or update the=20=20
same set of local patches). Ideally, you can also create fresh=20=20
installation with the pinned versions. GODI supports this for some time=20=
=20
now (although by editing files only, but I guess this is ok for a=20=20
group, say a team in a company).

Yes, you can emulate this with git.
