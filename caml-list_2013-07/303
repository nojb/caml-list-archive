I have a codebase that currently depends on an old version of OMake, and I
would rather use ocamlbuild instead. As an end user, I see two key
advantages: ocamlbuild is part of INRIA's official OCaml distribution,
which implies a certain level of commitment to continued support, and
ocamlbuild knows all about how to build OCaml projects (even using
ocamlfind), so for simple applications it "just works".

However, I was reluctant to look into ocamlbuild when it first appeared,
since the only documentation was a set of presentation slides. It seemed
powerful, but like you, I am not really interested in build systems. I'm
more encouraged now that a section has appeared in the OCaml manual. Aside
from that, are there any other resources I should look into? I'm wondering
if there are some documents, or even mailing list threads, that would help
me learn how to customize the building of a complex codebase like you just
did in the "which ocaml build system" thread? I'm hoping there is a way to
acquire this knowledge that doesn't involve trial and error with the build
system. :)
