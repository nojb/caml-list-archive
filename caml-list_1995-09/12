Rather than mess around with the mangled names, you might be better off trying
to compile caml-light with your C++ compiler so that the name (de)mangling
is all done by your compiler. Since C++ is an approximate superset of ANSI C,
it might work.
(but don't ask me how to interface caml-light with C++ objects and methods.
I have no idea how easy it can be to add custom-made types)
