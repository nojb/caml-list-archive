This is a bug-fix release that corrects the main problems
reported with 1.06:

* syntax: optional ;; allowed in compilation units and structures
  (back by popular demand)
* cslopt:
    generic handling of float arrays fixed
    direct function application when the function expr is not a path fixed
    compilation of "let rec" over values fixed
    multiple definitions of a value name in a module correctly handled
    no calls to ranlib in Solaris
* csltop: #trace now working
* standard library: added List.memq; documentation of Array fixed.

The complete sources and diffs from 1.06 are available by anonymous
