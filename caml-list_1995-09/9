Hi.

Please help me answer a question. Is the 'camlc -custom' link
command able to work with C++ objects? I would guess it is not,
but would appreciate any ideas for linking with C++. The startup
code would have to run the extra initializer functions, so it's
mostly a factor of what compiler is used I think. Again, thank
you for any help.

Thanks, Chris

P.S. Thanks for making caml available. It's a great alternative
to SMLNJ. Nice job.
