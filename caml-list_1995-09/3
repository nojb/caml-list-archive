Announcing Caml Special Light 1.06, the first public release of the
Caml Special Light system.

Caml Special Light is a complete reimplementation of Caml Light that
adds a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML. The module
system is based on the notion of manifest types / translucent sums; it
supports Modula-style separate compilation, and fully transparent
higher-order functors (see the papers in the POPL 94 and 95
proceedings).

Caml Special Light comprises two compilers: a bytecode compiler in the
style of Caml Light (but up to twice as fast), and a high-performance
native code compiler for the following platforms:

        Alpha processors: DecStation 3000 under OSF1
        Sparc processors: Sun Sparcstation under SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2
        Intel 386 / 486 / Pentium processors: PCs under Linux
        Mips processors: DecStation 3100 and 5000 under Ultrix 4

The native-code compiler delivers excellent performance (better than
Standard ML of New Jersey 1.08 on our tests), while retaining the
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler.

Caml Special Light is still in the experimental state: the base
language has changed and will change again in significant ways,
source-level compatibility is not ensured, the implementation is
alpha-release quality, and many Caml Light tools and libraries have
not yet been ported to Caml Special Light. The present release is
targeted towards testers, adventurous souls, and users with strong
interest in modules and high-performance compilation; other users are
encouraged to stay with Caml Light 0.7 for a while.

The source distribution (for Unix machines only) is available by
anonymous FTP on ftp.inria.fr, directory lang/caml-light.

More information on Caml Special Light is available on the World Wide
Web, at http://pauillac.inria.fr/csl/.
