Oh, this is very interesting. Let's try to narrow down the problem. The 
following don't work reliably for you:

OCaml -> LablGL -> Lablglut -> OpenGL
OCaml -> LablGL -> LablGTKGL -> OpenGL
OCaml -> LablGL -> OCamlSDL -> OpenGL

but the following do work:

OCaml -> GLCaml -> SDL + OpenGL
C -> GLX + OpenGL

Looks like the problem is with LablGL then?

Smoke actually makes relatively few OpenGL calls (most are done by GLU) so I 
can easily port it to GLCaml. Maybe I should try that next...
