X-Spam: no; 0.00; twiddling:01 high-level:01 jocaml:01 jocaml:01 frog:98 rewrite:01 compile:01 seems:03 languages:03 concurrent:04 quake:05 mean:08 i'm:09 core:09 core:09 


When I'm not cuddling my dual core, I enjoy using tools such as POVRay, 
pbzip2, quake4-smp and ocamlbuild.

Unfortunately, ocamlbuild only seems to spawn a single compile at a time, 
leaving my other core twiddling its thumbs.

Call me crazy, but I was thinking of forking ocamlbuild and doing a complete 
rewrite in a high-level language like JoCaml. However, I fear my boss will 
object on the grounds that finding me a successor versed in fringe languages 
like JoCaml would be prohibitively difficult. I'll ask her when she's 
finished making lunch but, in the mean time, what do you guys think?
