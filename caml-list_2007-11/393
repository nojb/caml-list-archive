I guess it depends what you mean by "forking", but it's standard
practice, in all areas not just OCaml, for a single source package
(eg. ocaml-3.10.0.tar.gz) to generate many different binary packages
(eg. ocamlc, ocamlopt, ocamldoc, camlp4, labltk, etc.)

This means that you can install just the bits you need, and
furthermore that another package only needs to depend upon the parts
it actually uses -- this saves disk space & network bandwidth!

The camlp5 package installs in $OCAMLLIBDIR/camlp5 so it doesn't
conflict with camlp4 from the base OCaml package, with an appropriate
findlib META file.  You need to make some adjustments to your Makefile
but those are usually very minor compared to rejigging your source to
be compatible with the new camlp4.
