if it is *primarily* this or that might be end in endless discussions.

But it also is a commercial thing.
I earn my money with programming too.

But I doubt this list is the right area to
post advertising-only posts.

Yes, it's fine, if he makes money with OCaml.

But nevrtheless I doubt, this list is the forum to
make avertising-posts.

We could end up in "Buy this new Vi**gra-stuff; our website is OCaml-driven!".
