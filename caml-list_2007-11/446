                     CMS Winter Meeting, London Ontario

                             December 8-10, 2007


The Canadian Mathematical Society Winter 2007 Meeting will be held  Dec 8-10
in London, Ontario.  This is a scientifically rich meeting with seven plenary
speakers, seventeen scientific sessions and student workshops.    

Within the meeting is a computer algebra stream, comprising a conference 
plenary talk 

    E. Kaltofen: "Expressing a Fraction of Two Determinants as a Determinant"

and a scientific session with 15 speakers:

   "Algorithmic Challenges in Polynomial and Linear Algebra"
