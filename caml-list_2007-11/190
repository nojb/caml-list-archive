I owe you a public apology: this was a very childish behavior.

My aim was not to discredit the language nor  the implementation. I
feel blessed being able to use it in my day to day job and I think we
all agree it is miles ahead of other "professional" languages and more
practical than most pure research language.

Triggering segfaults without resorting to unsafe techniques is very
hard otherwise my previous post would have been pointless so I guess
you could see this as a praise in disguise.
