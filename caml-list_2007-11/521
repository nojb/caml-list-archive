				 MKM 2008

		  The Seventh International Conference on
		     MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

		 http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/cicm08/mkm08/

		      28-30 July 2008 Birmingham, UK

		    FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOPS


Mathematical   Knowledge   Management  is   an    innovative field  at  the
intersection of  mathematics,  computer   science,   library science,   and
scientific publishing.  Its  development is driven by  on the  one hand new
technological   possibilities which  computer   science, the  Internet, and
intelligent  knowledge  processing  offer, and   on   the other  hand   the
increasing  demand   by engineers and scientists    for new  techniques for
producing, transmitting, consuming, and managing sophisticated mathematical
knowledge.

The  conference  is concerned with   all  aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. Topics covered include, but are not limited to:

 Representations of mathematical knowledge
 Repositories of formalized mathematics
 Mathematical digital libraries
 Diagrammatic representations
 Multi-modal representations
 Mathematical OCR
 Mathematical search and retrieval
 Deduction systems
 Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
 Authoring languages and tools
 MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
 Web presentation of mathematics
 Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
 Computer Algebra Systems
 Collaboration tools for mathematics
 Challenges and Solutions for Mathematical workflows


PAPER SUBMISSIONS 

 All papers  submitted to the Conference will  be  reviewed.  Submission is
 electronic  in Postscript  or     PDF  format via  the   EasyChair  system
 (http://www.easychair.org/MKM08).   Submitted  papers must  conform to the
 Springer LNCS style, preferably using LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class
 files available at  http://www.springer.com/lncs.  Submitted papers should
 not exceed 15 pages, must be original and not submitted for publication.
 
 Submission website: http://www.easychair.org/MKM08


PROCEEDINGS

The conference proceedings will  be published in the Springer-Verlag series
Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).


WORKSHOPS 

The following workshops take place in conjunction with MKM 2008: 

 * The  "Mathematical User-Interfaces" Workshop 2008  (MathUI08),  which is
   organized by Paul Libbrecht.

 * A  Workshop  "Towards  Future Digital Mathematics Libraries",  which  is 
  organized by Petr Sojka.

If you are interested  in   organizing one,  contact the co-chairs    Serge
Autexier and Masakazu Suzuki at mkm08@ags.uni-sb.de as soon as possible.
