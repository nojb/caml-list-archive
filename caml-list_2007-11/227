The main cost of using "let rec" instead of "let" out of laziness or
"convenience" is time spent debugging the resulting bugs and the extra
time needed for software maintainance ("WTF did this Ralph guy write let
rec everywhere? My god he's totally incompetent and I have to clean
up."). This typically costs far, far more than any processor time you
might gain.

Source code is for humans.
