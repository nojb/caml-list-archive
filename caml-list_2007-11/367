I have recently compiled OCaml 3.10 for the PS3 running Yellow Dog Linux.=
=20
Seems to work fine, but I haven't tested it rigorously (and at this point, =
I
wouldn't even know how to test it ... um ...what's the opposite of
"rigorously"? ... non-rigorously?)

At any rate, I would be interested in learning a little more about how to
build an open source item like this for a particular platform and then
contribute back to the community (i.e. how to test to standards for this
community, how to create RPMs and where to post them etc.). =20

I'd also be interested in any ideas for starting to explore whether/how the
Cell BE's power can be exploited using OCaml (hopefully simple ideas at the
outset, I'm a newb on several fronts here).

Thanks,
mike hogan
