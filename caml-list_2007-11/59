X-Miltered: at concorde with ID 472DB6BD.000 by Joe's j-chkmail (http://j-chkmail . ensmp . fr)!
X-Spam: no; 0.00; bytecode:01 ocaml:01 smoke:98 smoke:98 frog:98 graphics:02 graphics:02 debian:04 vector:05 vector:05 sale:92 seem:08 3.09:08 3.09:08 releasing:08 


We are releasing our high-performance hardware-accelerated vector graphics 
software under a commercial source code license alongside the existing free 
edition:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/smoke_vector_graphics/?ol

Until the license is put on the site, e-mail me if you'd like to read a copy.

As an aside, several users asked us to provide bytecode versions for use with 
the latest OCaml 3.10 as well as 3.09 (still the latest in Debian testing). 
Our download statistics for last month show 94 hits for the 3.09 version and 
56 hits for the 3.10 version, so many people seem to be pushing ahead with 
the latest technology!

All the best,
