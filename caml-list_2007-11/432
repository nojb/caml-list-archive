=====================================================
PAPP 2008
Fifth International Workshop on
aPpplications of declArative and
object-oriented Parallel Programming
part of
The International Conference on Computational Science
June 23-25, 2008, Krakow, Poland
http://f.loulergue.free.fr/PAPP2008
=====================================================

AIMS AND SCOPE

Computational Science applications are more and more complex to
develop and require more and more computing power. Parallel and grid
computing are solutions to the increasing need for computing
power. High level languages offer a high degree of abstraction which
ease the development of complex systems. Moreover, being based on
formal semantics, it is possible to certify the correctness of
critical parts of the applications.

Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages
such as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming,
parallel execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries,
genericity and meta-programming in object-oriented languages,
etc. have produced methods and tools that improve the
price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of
target applications.

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level
programming languages, libraries, middlewares and tools (performance
predictors working on high-level parallel/grid source code,
visualisations of abstract behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors,
high-level GRID resource managers, compilers, automatic generators,
etc.), applications in all fields of computational science, benchmarks
and experiments. Research on high-level grid programming is
particularly relevant as well as domain specific parallel software.

The aim of all these languages and tools is to improve and ease the
development of applications. Thus the Fifth PAPP workshop focuses on
applications.

The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the
development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing
and computational science researchers who are potential users of these
languages and tools.  Topics

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

     * applications in all fields of high-performance computing and
       visualisation (using high-level tools)
     * high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for
       parallel and grid computing
     * high-level parallel language design, implementation and
       optimisation
     * modular, object-oriented, functional, logic, constraint
       programming for parallel, distributed and grid computing systems
     * algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel
       libraries
     * generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic
       skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries
     * benchmarks and experiments using such languages and tools

All the contributions should illustrate the proposed techniques on a
significant application.

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as
part of the ICCS proceedings.

Submission must be done through the ICCS website:
http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2008/papers/upload.php.

We invite you to submit a full paper of 8 pages formatted according to
the rules of LNCS, describing new and original results, no later than
January 3, 2008. Submission implies the willingness of at least one
of the authors to register and present the paper. An early email to
papp at free.fr with your intention to submit a paper would be greatly
appreciated (especially if you have doubts about the relevance of your
paper).  Accepted papers

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop. Authors will be
invited to submit extended and revised versions of their
papers. Accepted manuscripts will be published in a special issue of
Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience.  Important Dates

     * January 3, 2008 - Full paper due
     * March 1, 2008 - Notification
     * March 15, 2008 - Camera-ready paper due
     * September 15, 2008 - Journal version due
