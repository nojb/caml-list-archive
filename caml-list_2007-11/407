Are you going to release a modified (and fixed!) version of PyCaml as a
standalone library? Given that you found several issues in PyCaml I bet
the whole community would be very happy to see something like that! If
you claim that the original maintainer of PyCaml is no longer active
maybe you can take over maintenance or something like that, how about
it?

Cheers.
