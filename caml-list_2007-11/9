Ridiculous - they could have done a friendly fork of the code.  Code
could have been shared both ways between the OCaml-on-dot-Net and the
OCaml-native compilers.  They chose _not_ to do that.

Anyway, I hope that people considering F# keep in mind what happens
should Microsoft lose interest in it and decide not to continue
supplying or supporting it.  It's crazy to choose a language for any
non-trivial program unless that language is either standardised with
multiple independent vendors, or (better still) open source so you
have options if your supplier stops supporting it.

Rich.
