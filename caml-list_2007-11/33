I'm curious as to what methods you've used.

While Google Trends only puts Sweden 7th for OCaml and 3rd
on F#, Sweden places 2nd for Haskell and (not surprisingly)
1st for Erlang. (And, FWIW, 7th for LISP.)

Keep in mind that Sweden's population is roughly the same size
as that of London or Tokyo.

Given the quality of Haskell research at Chalmers, the work
on Mozart at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, and
the number of commercial ventures using Erlang in Sweden,
I'd say that the Swedes have shown some pioneering spirit too.

BR,
