The compatibility has made it easy for us to port our software in OCaml on=

Linux to F# on Windows. That is (literally) valuable to us.

Much of the F# stdlib is both compatible and improved (e.g. tail recursive)=
=20
and extended (e.g. Array.map2). Some other aspects such as web services and=
=20
complex numbers are better in F#. For many other things, such as FFTW, I=20
write my own shim anyway and there are then no compatibility issues. Writin=
g=20
bindings is easier with F# and there are no silly Bigarrays (woohoo!) or=20
anything.

As Skaller has said, we cannot contribute to the OCaml code base. Even if y=
ou=20
fork the codebase you are still bound by its license and you are not allowe=
d=20
to redistribute your own modified OCaml distribution.

That is simply not viable for a corporation developing a product. We have=20
considered paying to join the CAML Consortium in order to get a more libera=
l=20
license with a view to developing a graphical top-level for OCaml like=20
Mathematica's notebook front-end but licensing complications and the=20
reliability of binary distributions under Linux deterred us.

I'm hoping the few remaining incompatibilities between the obvious core=20
language (e.g. being unable to supercede module-level definitions in F#) ar=
e=20
ironed out before the first product release. The remaining differences=20
(labelled and optional arguments are different, no structural subtyping=20
including polymorphic variants) are sufficiently small that you can already=
=20
port a lot of useful OCaml code to Windows quite easily and then sell it.

=46rom a commercial perspective, it is very nice that you can sell F# DLLs=
=20
easily. I've been wanting to sell Smoke for some time and this is the easie=
st=20
route.

Overall, anyone interested in earning a living from programming in OCaml=20
should definitely consider F#. We are already earning a significant amount =
of=20
money from it and I only see that improving...
