I wouldn't bet on this. I can reproduce the same bug with both the sdl-gl 
(ocamlsdl)  interface, and the gtk-gl (liblablgtk2-gl-ocaml) interface.

However, as I said, I couldn't with glxgears, and more interestingly I 
couldn't either with the demos shipped with glcaml. They use SDL. I just 
modified the source code in order to allow resizing windows.
