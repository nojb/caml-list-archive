Don't you think the worst problem for the industry is the lack of=20
retro-compatibility ?=20

Between 3.09 and 3.10 (a *minor* version number change), a lot of program=20
using camlp4 stopped compiling. If a company has a 100 000 lines code (or=20
more) to revise just for that, it could be kind of a problem.

And so many things are just unspecified. I know it's a bad idea, whatever=20
language you use, to rely on the order of evaluation of the argument of a=20
function, but to say "this order may change one day" is to tell=20
industrialists : "if you have some "not so good" programmers, even if you=20
make all the test you want on your program to check it works, one day it ma=
y=20
just stop working because we changed the order or evaluation, or worst, a l=
ot=20
of silent bugs can appear".=20
Do you imagine that a car constructor with nice screw-down-robots would acc=
ept=20
if a provider says "I have very nice and efficient screws, but it is possib=
le=20
that one day, you have to turn them anticlockwise if I realize it's more=20
efficient." ?

IMO it is the real show-stopper for an industrial use of OCaml
