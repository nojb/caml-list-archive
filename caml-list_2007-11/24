This is not history.. it's the current affairs of my life.
I watched it happen, I even helped a bit :)

That's just silliness. C++ is a much better language than C for
application development.

I prefer Ocaml .. but hardly anyone here in Australia has even
heard of it (even companies using *nix).

Lack of solid implementation was *always* the biggest problem. 
GNU wasn't even a player. It was only recently (last year?) 
that GNU finally released a  C++ compiler (4.X series) that 
could even parse C++ properly.

Don't forget the ISO C++ Standard wasn't ratified until this
millenium .. it's barely 7 years old. I think that is younger
than Linux kernel :)
