Whew, really trying not to be bated on the Microsoft discussion here,
but that is a _very_ odd view of history.

Open source developers use crap languages, I agree, but switching to
C++ would hardly have improved the situation :-)

compiled as C++ (though still of course written in C) so it's not like
people were unaware of the language or lacked solid implementations at
that point.
