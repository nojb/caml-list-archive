Hi,

I compiled an OCaml program in native code on
my new Linux machine. It runs without problem on
this machine, but crashes as soon as it is executed
with "Floating exception" on another Linux machine.
The 2 machines have a similar processors (Intel Core Duo
and Intel Xeon).

What puzzles me is that it was working properly
with my previous machine, which was very similar
to the new one (Dell D400 -> D420).
Another change is that I shifted from OCaml 3.08
to OCaml 3.09.

Does anybody have an idea of the cause of such an
obscure error ? and how to solve it ? :-)

Sebastien
