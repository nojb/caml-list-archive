I am not convinced it is possible or makes sense. More precisely, your 
foreign -coded in C, called by Ocaml code- function probably allocates 
some result, and this allocation can trigger the Ocaml garbage collector

In addition, AFAIK, the Ocaml minor garbage collector is only running 
when called,
either implicitly from some allocation routines, or explicitly.

So if you don't allocate things either directly or indirectly (e.g. by 
calling some callback coded in Ocaml) the Ocaml GC is not running.

You definitely may need to hack the C code inside byterun/minor_gc.c 
(for example), but I don't understand what you want exactly.

However, I do know that mixing GCs, like Ocaml & Python, is a nightmare.
Did you consider having two separate Unix processes, one for the Ocaml 
code and one for the Python code, and having them communicate thru 
standard stuff like pipes, memory mapped files, ...
