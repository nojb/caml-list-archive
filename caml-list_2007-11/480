Subject: Disabling the OCaml garbage collector

Dear all

I am writing a foreign function interface between OCaml and another  
language (Python) which works via C. Since I have some memory issues  
currently, I would like to be able to disable the OCaml Garbage  
collector before jumping into C/Python, and re-enable it when I  
return to OCaml.

I am using the OCaml/C interface and the macros that it provides to  
manage values (CAMLlocal and CAMLparam), but I would like to be able  
to disable the GC entirely for short periods.

What facilities does OCaml provide to disable/enable the garbage  
collector? I looked at the GC module and didn't see anything obvious.  
It's fine if it is something at the C level rather than the OCaml level.

Thanks for your help!
Raj
