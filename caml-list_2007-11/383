Yes, my tests shows this.

What do you mean "can't be built"? I assume you can always generate a
*.mli given *.ml, correct? Are you referring to other types of sources
such as *.mly?

Can the behaviour be changed? If I am not mistaken ocamldoc can merge
*.ml and *.mli files so I think it may be easy enough to allow this.

Ok.

Ok. Understood.

Thank you for such prompt replies.
