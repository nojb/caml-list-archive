I don't think you can say they are "forking" the OCaml distribution.

Debian generates a number of packages from the inria tarball:
- ocaml-nox
- ocaml-libs
- ocaml-interp
- ocaml-base
- ocaml-base-nox
- camlp4
- camlp4-extra
- ...

and of top of these packages they are also shipping camlp5 from a
different source file that is independent from the ocaml inria
distribution.

I guess RH is doing something similar...
