We have a complete typesetting engine using TeX fonts with Mathematica's 
layout and hardware-accelerated rendering using OpenGL via Smoke. This is not 
yet in the free bytecode edition of Smoke but if anyone is interested I'll 
gladly ship it.

Smoke includes picking (selection of objects with the mouse) so you can easily 
write a GUI front-end with typesetting using it (we already did this for 
Presenta). Smoke is also cross platform, so the result would run out of the 
box on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. We also now have OCaml compilation 
environments on all of these platforms, so I'll get binaries for everything 
up on our site ASAP.

I am interested in the idea of writing a cross platform typeset IDE building 
upon OCaml using exactly this technology. We should collaborate!
