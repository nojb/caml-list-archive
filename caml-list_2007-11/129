This is a chicken and egg problem. Without tutorial information on these 
subjects I cannot learn about them in order to write a book on them.

Perhaps it would be best if everyone collaborated in writing wiki pages:

  http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/introduction_to_gtk
  http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/camlp4_3.10
  http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/ocaml_and_the_web
  http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/compiling_ocaml_projects

Another subject that I have discovered from my work on F# is the usefulness of 
interoperability, specifically being able to manipulate Excel spreadsheets 
from F#. I'm writing web analytics software for our company in OCaml and I'd 
like to inject the results into OpenOffice's spreadsheet. Any idea how to do 
that?

As an aside, although I am very tempted by the idea of writing a mainstream 
book on OCaml I am concerned that I might undercut our sales of OCaml for 
Scientists. This is particularly worrying because that book still accounts 
for 50% of our revenue from sales...
