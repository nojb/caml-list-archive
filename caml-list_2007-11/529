Well in fact, there is a lot of way to grep this kind of data in
debian...

I just give you one, and let you find the other:
http://www.edos-project.org/ara/search?q=tag%3A%22implemented%2Din%3A%3Aocaml%22++%26+not+tag%3A%22role%3A%3Ashared%2Dlibrary%22+%26+not+tag%3A%22devel%3A%3Alibrary%22+%26+not+tag%3A%22devel%3A%3Alang%3Aocaml%22+%26+not+tag%3A%22role%3A%3Adevel%2Dlib%22+%26+not+tag%3A%22role%3A%3Ashared%2Dlib%22%0D%0A%0D%0A&i=0&m=25&n=true&b=false&s=popularity&x=false&p=false

The url is quiet long, and is only the submission of the following
request into ARA (package search engine, written in OCaml):
tag:"implemented-in::ocaml"  & not tag:"role::shared-library" & not
tag:"devel::library" & not tag:"devel::lang:ocaml" & not
tag:"role::devel-lib" & not tag:"role::shared-lib"

This gives you the list of all package which are OCaml application. The
most popular is: unison, mldonkey, bibtex2html, ledit, hevea,
unison2.9.1, advi, polygen, coq, ara, wyrd, geneweb, hlins, orpie,
spamoracle, approx, mtasc, whitelister...

Unison is the most installed ocaml package.
