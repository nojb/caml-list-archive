[...]

I doubt one or some programmers that offer their programming service is,
what industry is looking for, when it's looking for commercial support.

Commercial support means, that big companies offer that service, because
industry mistrusts single individuals.

So, I doubt Jon can provide this.

And: is this really a show-stopper for Ocaml, that there is no
"commercial support"?

I think, there are companies that already using Ocaml,
but do not mention it. They see the advantages and use it.

I don't miss any commercial support in OCaml, and
the industry, which not knew anything about OCaml
also does not miss support for a language that they don't know.


The need for such support may come,
when more people are interested in OCaml.


Ciao,
   Oliver
