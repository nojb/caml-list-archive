I join to the crowd of people who would very much like to have a
toplevel on steroids, with line editing, graphics, facilities for
pretty-printing everything (including polymorphic types, right now there
is no way to install a pretty printer for a polymorphic type). Even
better, there should be a library that allows one to construct custom
toplevels. I would be willing to join the effort.

It's just silly that people are writing wrappers around the current
toplevel.
