Do you mean Perl's use in industry has declined or that it has lost market 
share even among free software languages?

We had an interesting discussion about the choice of GL library that underpins 
LablGTKGL on the LablGTK mailing list a while back. According to the Debian 
package popularity contest, Perl (and OCaml) programmers use the 
arguably-deprecated GLArea library but other (primarily Ruby) programmers use 
the newer but arguably-worse GLExt library. I concluded that Perl's 
popularity is keeping GLArea alive so there isn't too much to worry about 
LablGTKGL growing out of date.

If Perl is in decline then maybe LablGTK should move on to GLExt. Looking at 
the Ubuntu package popularity contest now, GLExt is 5x more popular than 
GLArea (33k vs 6.4k installations).
