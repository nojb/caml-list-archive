Hi,

I've got the same problem with the simplest program,
the "hello world" :

let _ = print_string "Hello world!\n"


* Machine where compiled (in native code):

Linux version 2.6.20-1.2952.fc6 
(brewbuilder@ls20-bc1-14.build.redhat.com) (gcc
version 4.1.1 20070105 (Red Hat 4.1.1-51)) #1 SMP Wed May 16 18:59:18 
EDT 2007
Intel(R) Core(TM) Duo CPU      U2500  @ 1.20GHz


* Machine where execution produces "Floating exception"

Linux version 2.6.15-1.1833_FC4smp 
(bhcompile@hs20-bc1-1.build.redhat.com) (gcc
version 4.0.2 20051125 (Red Hat 4.0.2-8)) #1 SMP Wed Mar 1 23:56:51 EST 2006
Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.40GHz

I know I cannot assume that a native binary is portable,
but I'd like to understand what makes it fail.
gcc version, redhat version, FC version ?
