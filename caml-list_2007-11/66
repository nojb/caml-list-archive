The Caml Mailing List
... The purpose of this list is to share experience, exchange ideas and
code, and report on applications of the Caml language.

...

Caml Announcements 
This is a low-traffic, moderated list for announcements of Caml releases and
new Caml-related software, libraries, documents, etc. Please note that all
messages sent to caml-announce@inria.fr are also automatically forwarded to
caml-list@inria.fr.

So perhaps Jon should post to caml-announce@inria.fr for moderation, but
it's safe to say from the above that O'Caml related software announcements
have a place on this list - indeed, they're reasonably common. Is your
problem just that Smoke costs money?

and...

... is just puerile. Can you pay attention to the results your post
