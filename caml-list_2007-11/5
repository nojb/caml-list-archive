This is hardly a cause to cheer.  The two languages aren't compatible
in any way which is relevant to the real world, and the libraries are
completely different.  Microsoft could have contributed valuable
changes back to OCaml, but instead decided to produce their own
incompatible clone.

The apparent decision to "cover Windows while OCaml covers Linux and
Mac OS X" reminds my suspicious mind of the deal which Microsoft
proposed to Netscape, to divide the browser market with Internet
Explorer on Windows and Netscape on everything else.

Thanks, but no thanks.

Rich.
