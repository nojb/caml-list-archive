There is at least one partial plplot (http://plplot.sourceforge.net/)
binding already in existence
(http://vityok.org.ua/cgi-bin/odd.cgi/Ocaml-plplot), and I'm working
on another one using camlidl rather than Swig.

I haven't put my code out yet because I'd like to finish up some of
the 3D plotting function wrappers first, but if you're interested in
having something sooner I could put out what I have currently.  There
is enough there to do 2D plots, and the naming follows the C-library
quite closely.

The already-mentioned gnuplot binding seems to work reasonably as
well, though I've only made very basic 2D plots with it.

PsiLab (http://psilab.sourceforge.net/) is older, and based on OCaml
3.01 or 3.02 I think.  But I've been able to get it to build on recent
Linux distributions.  It has a fairly high-level binding to the plplot
libraries which is quite easy to use.  I have dreams of some day
updating it to work with recent OCaml releases.  It might also be a
decent start for a Mathematica-like toplevel with inline plots and so
on if the toplevel customizations could be tied in to labltk or
lablgtk.  I don't know how possible this is though.
