My mistake. This was definitely a bad example. I never realized that the sa=
me=20
problem existed in other languages, probably because we use so much more=20
function evaluations in OCaml (and also probably because I program almost=20
only in OCaml :-) ). Sorry for the noise :-\

Do you think it may be possible one day for OCaml to have a normalisation,=
=20
like Haskell had in 1998, and if it's allready the case, where can I find=20
it ?
