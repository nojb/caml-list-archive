We considered using memcached. However, there is no client for OCaml,
and especially no asynchronous client, so we would have had to write
one. I looked at the protocol, and it turned out to be weird, ad-hoc,
and not very extensible. It would have been no fun developing such a
client.

In contrast, for developing our own caching server, it was not necessary
to write any new networking code: By using the SunRPC library of
Ocamlnet we got the whole communication stuff for free, and the protocol
is now well-structured and easily extensible. Furthermore, we could
tailor the features to our requirements, and have the guarantee that we
can adapt the server to any changes.

Actually, we needed only 1 day for developing the library, and another
day for integrating it. This is what other companies spend for
evaluating external software they might want to use. So the costs were
justified, and we now have exactly the software we wanted.

So the essence is: By using good tools (OCaml, Ocamlnet, etc.) we can
develop the software ourselves with the same costs as the integration of
an external component would have taken. Plus, we have perfectly adapted
software, and are on the safe side for the future. Sounds like a good
deal, right?
