If  I well remember in OCaml-3.10.0 only mli files are took in account. In the
CVS version ml files are used when no mli can be built.

No it must works nicely without any pre-compilation.

No it's not related.

Packing  subdirectories  is  about  using  -pack  to nest modules into one big
module.  The  "subdirectories"  here  is perhaps misleading but that's because
most  of  the  time  packages are used to reflect the directory hierarchy into
modules.
