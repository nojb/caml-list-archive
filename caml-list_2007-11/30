heheh, I met some developers, that talked this way for a long time,
but now told me, that they would prefer C over C++.

For me it was funny, because I never were a friend of C++
and instead looked for Perl, and later FPLs.

And the Java-advocating people, first making a hype out of Java,
after a while of development experience, had also talked less
advocating to this language. For me, this was also a fun, because
they needed some years of Programming Java until they had learned,
what I saw after some days/weeks of exploring.

Heheh.


One thing, that I like in OCaml-programming is,
that I don't have to type so much verbose stuff,
which other languages need.

Java for example: endless typing of class declerations
means a lot of finger-gymnastics.

But maybe this helps to avoid stiffness of the fingers,
when you are 70 ;-)

Even freshly studied computer science-people seldom know OCaml.
But I've spread the word on the Berlin's Linux-Mailinglist for a while,
and infected some of the developers with OCaml (at least that
they know there is a programming language that is called OCaml). :)

At least one of them now uses OCaml for his current project. :)


Ciao,
