You gain the ability to take your existing OCaml code, make minor changes and 
sell it to earn money. If you so wish, you can also leverage the skills you 
have learned with OCaml in writing commercial software for the Windows 
platform. These are enormous practical benefits for many OCaml programmers.

Selling general OCaml code is very difficult. There is no reasonable DLL form 
for OCaml. Consequently, after four years we are only now considering selling 
Smoke under source code license.

That is not "contributing valuable changes back to OCaml" in any meaningful 
sense.

Do you really expect Microsoft to adopt the Red Hat Package Manager?

Transparency to developers is not the issue.

Surely you would not expect Microsoft to contribute to gcc or Mono rather than 
starting their own projects?
