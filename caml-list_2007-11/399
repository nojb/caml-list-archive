They could do this but I'm not sure they would do this.  There are a
few reasons I can think why Fedora wouldn't do it anyway:

(a) No program I know of can be compiled without stdlib, so splitting
compiler and stdlib is almost never a saving (from a pure packaging
point of view, ignoring, for now, possible enhancements).

(b) Fedora policy is not to diverge from upstream.  For example we
don't carry any patches in our packages except where those patches are
about to go upstream.  So making Fedora-specific enhancements to
OCaml's stdlib is against policy, and wouldn't be productive because
it would "lock in" to Fedora (in as much as open source can ever lock
you in).

(c) I tend to think that the Extlib project has been successful
enhancing OCaml's stdlib without intruding on the stdlib.  Extlib
replaces stdlib modules and functions, but in a way which can be
carefully controlled and opted out from by the programmer.
