I am afraid I don't understand *precisely* what you want to do.

If you want one to use an OCaml toplevel embedded in a Java applet, =20
it is
quite easy to do using Cadmium (http://cadmium.x9c.fr). Cadmium is then
used as a bare replacement for ocamlrun to run the ocaml executable.
You should nevertheless be aware of the fact that the applet must be =20
signed
(and trusted) because Cadmium needs "privileged" permissions.

If fou want one to submit OCaml code snippets to a server for =20
execution, there
are several solutions. Of course, I will advertise another of my =20
projects :-)
Cadmium-Servlet provides bindings for servlet programming. You can then
send OCaml code to the servlet for evaluation by a server-side toplevel.

PS: If you run into troubles while trying to build ocamljava, don't =20
hesitate to
contact me off-list.
