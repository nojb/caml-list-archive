Thanks, now it builds fine. And I really thought the problem was gone; Afte=
r=20
resizing the window madly, I was just trying to anwser that everything was =
ok=20
when it suddenly froze exactly as before. :-(

It's maybe a bug of my video driver (xorg-intel). However, I tried to =20
reproduce it with glxgears and I couldn't.

Btw: I don't know if it is useful or not, but your 'clicking and zooming' i=
n=20
the tiger demo is quite nice
