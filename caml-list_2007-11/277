=46ollowing Sam's answer on similar issue with our application, here are tw=
o=20
compared outputs for the same informations:

=2D- On i386:
5:13 toots@selassie ~% OCAMLRUNPARAM=3D"v=3D12" liquidsoap 'output.dummy(bl=
ank())'
Growing heap to 480k bytes
Growing page table to 2648 entries
Growing heap to 720k bytes
Growing page table to 2710 entries
Growing heap to 960k bytes
Growing page table to 2815 entries

=2D- On amd64:
5:12 toots@ras-macintosh ~/sources/svn/savonet/trunk/liquidsoap/src%=20
OCAMLRUNPARAM=3D"v=3D12" ./liquidsoap 'output.dummy(blank())'
Growing heap to 960k bytes
Growing page table to 104640820 entries
Growing heap to 1440k bytes
Growing heap to 1920k bytes

It seems that the "Growing page table to 104640820 entries" in amd64's log =
is=20
quite enourmeous, compared to similar values for i386.

Sorry, I can't debug more, I'm not expert at all on this topic.
However, I'll be glad to dig more if indicated what to do..
