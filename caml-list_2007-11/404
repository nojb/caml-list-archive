Yes, they can, but as a Debian OCaml maintainer I wouldn't do that. Part
of the reason is shared with Richard's. Patches applied by distributors
are of two kinds: distribution-specific, bug fixes/improvements. The
latter kind of patches are reasonable only if there is some hope to have
them integrated "upstream" (i.e. in the official OCaml distribution),
otherwise they are only additional work to be maintained in the future
and can create serious issues for our users. Since we know that OCaml
upstream does not welcome changes to the standard library we simply are
not encouraged to make changes there.

The only way to go IMO is extlib, which should strive to merge with
other extended standard libraries project, and hope to reach a big user
base to "negotiate" something with OCaml upstream.

Cheers.
