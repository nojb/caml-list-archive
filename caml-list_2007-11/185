Guys,

Before posting this kind of messages, I'd like you to stop for a
second and think about what you're doing.  The answer is: a disservice
to the Caml community.  (This also applies to most of Skaller's rants
and some of Harrop's marketing, by the way.)

Yes, OCaml has bugs, like all software of this complexity -- and
probably a lot less than your own software.  Be supportive and
cooperative: post bug reports with repro cases where they belong, on
the bug tracking system, and let us developers handle them the way we
see fit.

That kind of snickering posts is neither helpful nor supportive.  What
benefits do you expect from trashing Caml in public?  Especially since
most of you never paid any cent for it, and some of you make a living
out of it.

You've just demonstrated out that this practice is very effective at
pissing me off.  Are you satisfied?
