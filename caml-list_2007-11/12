The main objective of the workshop is to be a meeting place, in two
ways.
It is intended to be a forum to exchange ideas and experiences with
different methods for the study of concurrent and distributed systems.
In addition, it will also be a meeting place for researchers from China
and neighbouring countries with the participants of the PETRI NETS and
ACSD conferences.

The scope of the workshop is broad. Its goal is to discuss models of
concurrency with an emphasis on issues relevant to certain application
domains which have led or could lead to the addition of structural
enhancements.
The focus of the workshop will be on qualitative rather than
quantitative aspects of concurrent systems. For the (enhanced) models
under discussion, also analysis techniques, extended or even completely
new, are to be considered. The meeting is deliberately not focussed on
any particular model of concurrency, issue or application. Fundamental
approaches as well as interdisciplinary applications may be discussed.

Aspects which are of interest to the workshop (in combination with
techniques for analysis, verification and synthesis) include:

(i) Concurrency models: Petri nets, process algebras, cooperating
automata, coordination languages, rewriting systems, discrete event
systems, message sequence charts, temporal logics

(ii) Issues: synchrony / asynchrony, mobility and security, locality and
components, supervisory control, dynamic reconfiguration, resource
access / testing, collaboration schemes, behavioural equivalence

(iii) Application areas: asynchronous circuits, GALS systems, biological
systems, membrane systems, mobile process networks, architecture,
component based software, workflow systems, communication protocols

Two types of submissions are solicited:

(i) Original contributions: full papers or extended abstracts describing
new and ongoing work which have not been submitted elsewhere or already
published.

(ii) Informal contributions: posters presenting initial ideas, or
presentations significantly based on already published work (possibly in
a language other than English)  for which the authors seek feedback.
(The latter under the condition that the prior work is adequately
referenced, and there are no publisher's restrictions.)

Prospective participants are asked to submit by email (to
China-Chairs@liacs.nl) an extended abstract of at most 15 pages as PDF
or PS and using the Springer LNCS-format
(http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). Submissions will be
reviewed by the Programme Committee, and they should include a title,
the authors' contact addresses and email, and an abstract. Moreover, in
the covering mail, it should be clearly stated whether the submission
should be considered as an original paper.

At least one of the authors of each accepted contribution should
register and take part in the workshop to give the presentation.

Extended abstracts of accepted contributions will be included in the
workshop proceedings and available at the meeting.

Some of the best, original contributions from the workshop will be
invited to be submitted to a volume of the journal sub-series of Lecture
Notes in Computer Science entitled "Transactions on Petri Nets and Other
Models of Concurrency" (ToPNoC). These papers, revised according to the
workshop reviewers' comments and the feedback received at the workshop,
will go through a totally new round of reviewing as is standard practice
for journal papers.
