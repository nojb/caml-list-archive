Is it native compilation, byte-code compilation?

The  byte-code  one  offer  more opportunities for parallelism than the native
one  if  we  respect  dependencies  to  allow cross module inlining. Since the
compiler  does not complain about not found ".cmx" you can do more parallelism
in  your  Makefile.  However  that's risky and can leads to worst performances
(less inlining).

Sometimes  using  libraries  (.mllib)  can  give  more  parallelism  than  the
traditional ocamlbuild discovery of sources.

So you can try...

$ cat mylib.mllib
# Put here all modules needed by your main program
# You can gather them by looking at the link command produced by ocamlbuild
A B C D E

$ cat myocamlbuild.ml
open Ocamlbuild_plugin;;
open Ocamlbuild_pack;;
dispatch begin function
| After_rules ->
    ocaml_lib "mylib"
| _ -> ()
end;;

$ cat _tags
<myprog.{byte,native}>: use_mylib

$ ocamlbuild mylib.cma mylib.cmxa myprog.byte myprog.native
