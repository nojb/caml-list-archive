Dear All,

CamlPDF is a library for reading, writing and manipulating PDF files
and data. It is released under a BSD-style licence.

http://www.coherentgraphics.co.uk/camlpdf.html

New/updated Modules:

Pdftext/Glyphlist/Fonttables: fonts and Unicode text extraction
Pdfcrypt: Encryption and Decryption (40bit, 128bit and AES)
Pdfimages: Preliminary support for image extraction
Pdfwrite: Updated to support encryption and linearization

Also, many bug fixes and new functions. PDF files it can't read
are now very few and far between. There are small API differences,
though most are limited to the addition of extra optional arguments.

CamlPDF forms the basis of the cPDF Command Line Toolkit
http://www.coherentpdf.com

Thanks go to Haoyang Wang for a bug fix to string parsing in Pdfread.

Cheers,
