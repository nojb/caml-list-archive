Hi,

this inspired me to dig a bit in $install_path/lib/camlp4. Several  
file names sound pretty interesting (mostly the reloaded syntax but  
also stuff with sexy names like CamlP4ExceptionTracer, CamlP4Profiler  
etc.). I had a look in the manual and the camlp4 wiki at [1] but  
could not found too much documentation about them. Neither could I  
figure out how to convert a regular syntax file into reloaded syntax  
using camlp4, there appears to be no printer for it.

So am I stuck to dig into the sources? Is there any documentation  
available for the reloaded syntax and the other stuff in the camlp4  
directory?

greetings,
Jan
