Why is that? This list is for Ocaml stuff. No one said
any particular licence. No one said free, pretend free,
or downright encumbered by a stupid licence.

In case you didn't realise .. programming is *primarily* a 
commercial (for money) activity which is *primarily* intended
to support commercial or governmental activity (including
academic and semi-academic institutions).

Lack of commercial support -- the kind Jon is offering --
is one of the impediments to industry taking Ocaml seriously.

It seems around 100 readers agree, if you can believe Jon's stats:

"Our download statistics for last month show 94 hits for the 3.09
version and 56 hits for the 3.10 version"

Lets hope Jon gets some sales .. he's one of the few commercial
support providers around.
