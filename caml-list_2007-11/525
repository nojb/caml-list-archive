I did a little study of the package popularity contest results recently and 
discovered lots of interesting things.

One thing that puzzles me though, is why there are ~13,000 installs of 
ocaml-base-nox (runtime system for ocaml bytecode executables) but only 
~5,500 installs of ocaml-nox (everything needed to develop non-graphical 
ocaml applications).

Presumably there are packages with ~7,500 installs that use only the runtime 
to run but I can't think what it is and would be interested to know because 
these are presumably quite notable pieces of software written in OCaml.

Any ideas?
