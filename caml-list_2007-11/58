I think this is an excellent idea!

I have heard of similar work (research) but I've never seen one working. The 
nearest I've seen was GeoGebra. If such a thing existed in OCaml then I would 
certainly try it out.

You might like to use the free edition of our Smoke Vector Graphics library 
for the rendering back-end:

Then you just have to compose purely functional scenegraphs, which is much 
easier than using OpenGL directly.
