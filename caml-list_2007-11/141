Here's one run, cut off after allocation seems to settle down:

OCAMLRUNPARAM="v=12" ./program_name.exe
Growing heap to 960k bytes
Growing page table to 204151332 entries
Growing heap to 1440k bytes
Growing heap to 1920k bytes

That would definitely cause trouble.  Thanks for the suggestion; I'll 
look into it.
