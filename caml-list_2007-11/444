I ran your tiger demo on my linux machine (d630/kubuntu).
It worked very well for a couple of minutes. But then, as I was playing with 
resizing the window, my xserver crashed badly (black screen, trying to start 
X every 2 secs without success. Had to restart with Alt+Syst combination).

I must say I had the same problem with an application of my own using opengl. 
I thought it was due to a buggy gtkgl library... but since you don't use 
it... now I don't know.
