Ruby's wide-scale adoption has been driven by Rails, which is backed
first by 37Signals, and now by any army of freelance converts from
PHP.&nbsp; And now JRuby is being backed by Sun, too.<br>
<br>
The announcement of Perl's death has been widely exaggerated: go ask
your local Unix admin if Perl is dead.&nbsp; Now, it's not generally
considered a language appropriate for application development anymore,
which is one of the great "No duh, Sherlock!" realizations that our
industry has gone through.<br>
<br>
Perl's popularity came because it was basically the first-of-breed.&nbsp; It
came out of Larry Wall's collection of shell scripts, converted a bunch
of sysadmins from straight shell scripting, and leveraged that toehold
to become a "real" language.&nbsp; For years, it dominated as a system
administration language that could be cranked out quickly, at least
partially because it had an expansive and easy-to-use library system
(CPAN).&nbsp; Even if you could come up with a better language for system
scripting, you would have to port large swaths of CPAN before you would
practically edge out Perl.&nbsp; So nothing really made it to the surface to
compete against Perl for a long time.&nbsp; And O'Reilly had a big hand in
evangelizing Perl, although it didn't offer "commercial support" in the
form of consulting.<br>
<br>
Python is the interesting case, because it came out after Perl, but
still managed to gain a fairly significant following.&nbsp; It's still not
terribly widely adopted and particularly not widely adopted in
industry, so it doesn't manage to be a counterpoint to the basic
argument.<br>

What's with C, C++, Perl?

C++ was developed by AT&amp;T. HP pushed it into ANSI Standardisation
so they could us it in certain contracts. It went up to a joint
ANSI/ISO process later. There are many many commercial supporters
of C and C++ software.

Perl is dead... maybe *because* it lacked commercial support
as a language. 

There are certainly popular Open Source languages without
commercial support for the language development though: 
Python and Ruby for example.
