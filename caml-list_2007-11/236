  I think these 'yields' are only desperate attempts to hint the scheduler to do its job - that it doesn't as we could expected -.

  Yes, it perfectly works.

So I compared it with my hanging example to try to understood what was responsible for blocking.

  If you uncomment the lines I inserted in code1, things begins to go more or less wrong.
On my computer, from time to time, when you alternatively focus console output and graphical window, some characters can be suddenly spat. Or keyboard input is completely ignored...

   Thanks to have make things progress ! I think we aren't far to understand.
