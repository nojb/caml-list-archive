It's a little stronger than "doesn't exists".

Yes and no, "ocamlc -i" try to do this but there's no correction guarantee.
In  ocamlbuild  we've  not  put  a rule ".ml->.mli" because it will use it too
often. However we have a ".ml->.inferred.mli" rule.

Yes for instance.

Yes  you can look at ocamlbuild/ocaml_{specific,tools}.ml and then add rule to
your myocamlbuild.ml that will depend on both the ml and the mli.
Don't forget to give ~insert:`top to your rule to give it the highest priority.
