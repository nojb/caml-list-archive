ACSD 2008 will be co-located with

  29th International Conference on Application and
  Theory of Petri Nets and Other Models of Concurrency

and the two conferences will share invited speakers as well as the
satellite workshops and tutorials:

Conference Focus

The International Conference on Application of Concurrency to System =
Design
(ACSD) serves as a forum for disseminating theoretical results with
application potential and advanced methods and tools for the design of
complex concurrent systems. While there are already quite a few success
stories in the field, there is still a strong need to bring theory and
practice closer together. The conference aims at cross-fertilising both
theoretical and applied research on topics including, but not limited =
to,
the following:

  * Design methods, tools and techniques based on models of computation =
and
    concurrency (data-flow models, communicating automata, Petri nets,
    process algebras, state charts, MSCs, etc.), (performance) analysis,
    verification, testing and synthesis.

  * Hardware / software co-design, platform-based design, =
component-based
    design, refinement techniques, hardware / software abstractions,
    co-simulation and verification.

  * Synchronous and asynchronous design, asynchronous circuits, globally
    asynchronous locally synchronous systems, interface design, =
multi-clock
    systems, functional and timing verification.

  * Concurrency issues in systems-on-a chip, massively parallel =
architectures,
    networks-on-a-chip, task and communication scheduling, resource, =
memory and
    power management, fault-tolerance and quality of service issues.

  * (Industrial) case studies of general interest, gaming applications,
    consumer electronics and multimedia, automotive systems, =
(bio-)medical
    applications, Internet and grid computing, etc.

  * Concurrency issues in ad-hoc, mobile and wireless networking, sensor
    networks, communication protocols, cross-layer optimization, =
resource and
    power management, fault-tolerance, concurrency-related security =
issues.

  * Business process modelling, simulation and verification, =
(distributed)
    workflow execution, business process (de-)composition, =
interorganisational
    and heterogeneous workflow systems, computer-supported collaborative =
work
    systems, web services.

  * Synthesis and control of concurrent systems, (compositional) =
modelling
    and design, (modular) synthesis and analysis, distributed simulation
    and implementation, (distributed) controller synthesis, adaptive =
systems,
    supervisory control.
