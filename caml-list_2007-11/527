Yes indeed! And ledit.

I get:

Package     Debian Ubuntu Total
hevea          526  1,483 2,009
ledit          822    800 1,622
bibtex2html    481    441   922
hlins           83     35   118

I'm just grepping the by_inst files and looking at the number of installs f=
or=20
each package. Also for Ubuntu at:

  http://popcon.ubuntu.com

What's the best way for me to automate this? I'd like to find all packages=
=20
that depend upon ocaml-base-nox and how many installs they have on Debian a=
nd=20
Ubuntu. Good for OCaml evangelism. :-)
