  But I wonder why I didn't see any word about these necessary
"precaution" in doc. (Maybe have missed something ?)

The code is'nt yet very clean but I seize the opportunity to show
it you offer to me :

Press '?' or 'H' for help page ( directed to console ).

  It features an "infinite" board, a zoom, mouse dragging of the
view, history and customizable colours. Many things can be changed
"on the fly" - when automaton is running - but maybe it remains
some bugs about this.
  ( Nothing to do with the powerful top speed "xlife". )
However, 'll try to improve and the TODO list is long...

  I tried to use Mutex again this way for changing autoplay speed.
Seems to work.
