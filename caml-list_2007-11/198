It seems there are so many wishes to OCaml,
which are similar to wishes that long-time Word-users
that tried LaTeX the first time had for LaTeX.

Things like "how to change the layout freely, as I can do with Word?"
and they are looking for so many things of freedom that result
in ugly layouts, ugly typography, ...

The don't know about microtypography, kerning, grey-value of the
page, the number of characters per line that are easily readable,
the peace for the eye (and mind), when there are not too many fonts and colors,
and the many other typographic details, that are built-in in TeX/LaTeX.

And: no, TeX/LaTeX is/are not perfect. But they are always a good choice. :)

And the discussions on this list often remind me on those discussions about
LaTeX ;-)

I don't want to say, feature-wishes are nonsense... I only saw a
similarity in the kind of feature-wishes. :)
