Hello,

With the maximum respect to the excelent job done by ocaml developers 
and community, can I suggest to write, in an easy to find place, an 
small clarification about what is camlp4, camlp5 and their main 
"variants" (pre 3.10, post 3.10, PreCast, ...)? . Even in the 
"Documentation" page at Inria's main web. A few lines could be enough.

Lots of persons, first, tries to decides what to use or the alternatives 
more preferable, and after learns it.

I've not found a short way. With the current situation it is a few 
dificult to known that camlp4 is a "newer syntax" version than camlp5, 
the main "variants" of the camlp4, the main variants in its usage, ... . 
It is necessary to read the camlp4 (pre 3.10) manual from Documentation, 
the info at wiki for camlp4 (post 3.10) and the www of the camlp5 ... 
only to known what is what.

Agains, just a sugestion.

Thanks.
