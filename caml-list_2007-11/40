The Corporate VP for the Microsoft Developer Division, S. Somasegar, announced 
the formation of a team to take F# forward on October 17th:

Don Syme named the first two members, Jomo Fisher and Luke Hoban, of 
Microsoft's Visual C# product group who are now working on the productization 
of F#:

Microsoft subsequently posted two Redmond job advertisements:

http://members.microsoft.com/careers/search/details.aspx?JobID=B36FFEB2-4C11-4B9C-9B3F-5B23CC604A7B

So the team will have tripled and should increase to 5x its original size 
soon, moving away from Microsoft Research Cambridge UK and to Microsoft 
headquarters in Redmond, USA.

I believe this will place F# alongside Microsoft technologies like XNA, which 
are separate downloads but fully supported products.
