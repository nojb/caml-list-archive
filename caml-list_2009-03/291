I know about Cilk, but I'll go back and look at it again.  Thanks for the
suggestion.

Interesting.  I haven't done a ton of F# hacking, so I don't know the
details, but several people who work at Jane Street have stubbed their toe
on this.  It's quite possible that it mostly just doesn't come up, if you
code in the appropriate style.

And as I tried to say in the talk, F# definitely has a lot to recommend it.
It's just not a good match for us.
