Note that we _only_ support Fedora Rawhide (the development version of
OCaml) and future Fedora 11 and above.  To find out about Rawhide, see:

http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/Rawhide

If you have F-10, I believe that you can upgrade it to Rawhide simply
by editing a file in /etc/yum.repos.d.  But ask about that on the main
Fedora mailing lists since I'm not sure.

Anyway, to install the cross-compiler, create a new file
/etc/yum.repos.d/mingw.repo which contains:

[mingw]
name=Fedora Windows cross-compiler, libraries and tools
baseurl=http://homes.merjis.com/~rich/mingw/fedora-10/x86_64/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

Note that you will need to adjust the baseurl to match your version of
Fedora and architecture.

Then do:

# yum install mingw32-ocaml

Actually there are several packages you can install.  Poke around
http://homes.merjis.com/~rich/mingw/ to see which ones.

To cross-compile an OCaml program I strongly suggest that you start
off with the example package that I created / used for the OCaml Users
Conference talk last month:

http://www.annexia.org/tmp/ocaml-mingw-gtk/

Please join the mailing list and ask questions there so we can share
the knowledge:

https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/fedora-mingw

Any OCaml + lablgtk2 program should be straightforward to
cross-compile for Windows.  Mostly difficulties will arise only if the
program uses some weird libraries.
