Hello,

I am looking at what options there are to rewrite camlgrenouille, a  
small client for www.grenouille.com that I wrote a while ago, to make  
it more modular (to allow an external UI to the core program) and  
cross-platform (Unix and Windows).

In a nutshell, this program periodically runs some tests. Right now  
its interaction with the outside is fairly limited: the only thing one  
can do is ask it to quit (by doing a ctrl-c which is caught so as to  
clean up before actually quitting). I would like to be able to send it  
more complex commands, which would be driven by a UI separate from the  
program.

The simplest approach seems to be using a socket and a select call  
(with a timeout corresponding to the delay until the next test), but I  
was wondering if there were other options based on threads. For  
instance, could I use lwt under Windows?

Thanks for any suggestion,

Alan
