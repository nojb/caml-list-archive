Looking more closely, it seems there is Downloads/Wiki and some stats.
Though it remains git-centric and not particularly OCaml related (only 2
repository seems to be related to OCaml). 

Github seems to have evolve since last time I take a look at it...

everywhere just "dilute" OCaml in more mainstream language projects.
