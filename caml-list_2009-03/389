Had OCaml not already been coupled with LLVM, yes. However, there are quite 
decent OCaml bindings to LLVM already available (in the LLVM tree).

Yes and no. LLVM supports many features that Lisp does not (e.g. type checking 
at compile time, tail calls) and its implementation and the resulting 
performance are far better than any of the open source Lisp implementations.

Lisp was one of the foundations I ruled out for implementing new MLs for these 
reasons.
