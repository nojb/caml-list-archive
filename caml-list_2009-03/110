Not to defend Jon too much publicly ;-), but LLVM is a serious piece of 
software that deserves a lot of attention. Trust me, we do keep an eye 
out for exciting emerging technologies.

LLVM has already a surprising amount of language support. You should 
check it out. Another interesting project related to LLVM is Clang.

LLVM is very low-level and perfectly capable of handling these things.

That might not be feasible due to some non-technical concerns, but I 
wouldn't say that it is completely out of the question. During the 
PlayStation 2 era, Naughty Dog used its own proprietary language called 
Goal - an imperative variant of Scheme. We very much understand that 
lack of programmer productivity is a major cost, perhaps /the/ biggest, 
for game production. Therefore, anything that helps in this regard is of 
huge interest.

Thanks,
