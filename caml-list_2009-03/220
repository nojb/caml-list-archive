  will be provided for each presentation. In addition to the =
camera-ready=20
  version of the extended abstract, the authors are also requested to=20
  submit their poster of A1 paper size (594 mm wide and 841 mm high) for
  backup. An A1 poster sample template is available at=20
       http://www.dur.ac.uk/ieee.tase2009/poster.a1.ppt
  for authors to download. The authors can prepare 8 individual slides,=20
  save them in .jpg format and then place them on the above A1 sample.
  The Poster presenter will need to print out their Poster in advance=20
  and bring it to the conference for the Poster session. =20

POSTER CONTENT:=20

 A small selection committee led by the Poster Chair will evaluate the=20
 poster proposals based on their contributions and on how effectively=20
 they communicate those contributions. All posters should include=20
 the following information:=20
   - The purpose and goals of the work.
   - Any background and motivation information needed to understand the =
work.
   - A summary of the contribution and/or results, in sufficient detail =
for a=20
     viewer to understand the work and/or results; especially key =
details,=20
     results and contributions, or the anticipated contributions if the =
work=20
     is at an early stage.
   - The relationship to other related efforts, where appropriate.=20
   - Where to find additional information. This should include=20
     (but is not restricted to): a web site where viewers can go to find =

     additional information about the work, how to contact the authors=20
     (including email addresses), citations for any papers, books, or =
other=20
     materials that provide additional information.=20
=09
POSTER COMPETITION:

 A poster competition will be organised during the poster session. A =
panel of=20
 experts will be formed as referees for the competition. Awards will be =
given
 to the winners of the competition.=20
