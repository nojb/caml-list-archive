                                  CALL FOR PAPERS

                International Workshop on Formal Methods for Aerospace (FMA)

              A satellite workshop of the 16th International Symposium
                               on Formal Methods-FM

                  Eindhoven, The Netherlands,   3rd November 2009

BACKGROUND:
Aerospace systems are not only safety critical, but also mission =20
critical, and often have very high performance requirements. For =20
example, while there is no safety issue regarding a planetary rover, =20
the system performance must justify the great cost of deploying it. =20
Consequently, if we are to tackle to development and analysis of =20
aeronautical systems is a formal way, we must enrich traditional =20
formal methods with new (or, at least, rarely investigated) research =20
issues. This naturally leads to a interdisciplinary approach, which =20
might: underline the importance of some research problems from =20
aeronautics to the formal method community; and promote new formal =20
techniques combining principles from artificial intelligence and =20
control engineering.
The source of new problems comes from the great diversity of =20
aeronautical systems, including satellites, UAVs, terrestrial or other =20
kinds of flying robots. These systems can be involved in complex =20
activities such as space exploration, telecommunications support, fire =20
detection, geo-mapping, weather prognoses, geo-rectification, search & =20
rescue, traffic surveillance, target tracking, etc. From these =20
applications, concepts such as autonomy, collective behaviour, =20
information fusion, cognitive skills, coordination, flocking, are =20
required and new solutions, such as digital pheromones, swarms, system =20
of systems of robots, sensing, physical actuation, are developed. =20
Considering this rich landscape of research problems and potential =20
solutions, interdisciplinarity seems to be the most natural route. =20
Formal methods could benefit from integration with well-developed =20
methods from other disciplines. Many such opportunities are easily at =20
hand, for example the coordination of UAVs or satellites, which have =20
been successfully tackled using various techniques from control =20
engineering and numerical tools from dynamic programming. In addition, =20
there exist an abundance of examples of the use of artificial =20
intelligence techniques in aeronautics (target tracking, rover =20
planning, multi-agent technologies and so on). The implementation of =20
these methods could benefit from formal development. Conversely, from =20
the cross-fertilization of multidisciplinary approaches we can expect =20
more robust, safe and mechanizable development and verification =20
methods for aerospace systems.

AIM AND SCOPE:
The main workshop objective is to promote a holistic view and =20
interdisciplinary methods for design, verification and co-ordination =20
of aeronautical systems, by combining formal methods with techniques =20
from control engineering and artificial intelligence. The very =20
demanding safety, robustness and performance requirements of these =20
systems require unprecedented integration of heterogeneous techniques =20
and models. The aim of FMA is to bring together active researchers =20
from all the above areas to discuss and present their work. Relevant =20
topics include, but are not limited to (all with a focus on potential =20
application in aerospace design or engineering):
  new modeling paradigms
  formal verification of safety and performance properties
  combining formal and analytical techniques in modeling and verification
  heterogeneous and hybrid system models
  probabilistic and stochastic modeling and verification methods
  agent technologies
  multi-agent coordination
  runtime monitoring
  trajectory specification languages
  runtime monitoring

PAPER SUBMISSION:
We invite submissions of high quality, original papers in the above =20
areas. Papers should be written in English, formatted according to the =20
Springer LNCS style, and not exceed 16 pages including figures, =20
references, etc. At least one author of the accepted papers should =20
register at the workshop. Submissions must be made via =20
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dfma09.

The pre-proceedings will be available as an online technical report =20
and disseminated at the workshop. We are in negotiation for a journal =20
special issue for selected (extended and revised) papers.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Deadline for submission:           21st August 2009
Notification of acceptance:        28th September 2009
Camera Ready Copy due:             11th October 2009
