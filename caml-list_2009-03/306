Just to add the bit of our own experience here:

We have a relatively small group of people here (at most 5 working on  
the same project, some in separate locations). We also moved to  
mercurial more than a year ago (we started with subversion), and have  
automated tests before and after each commit using buildbot (http://buildbot.net/trac 
). Each developer can submit his local changes for test before pushing  
to the main repository, to avoid breaking the central repository that  
we all pull from. The tests run in numerous processors and OS'es  
(including parallel machines using MPI, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X).

This setup works fantastic for our group (and is not very different  
from that of Jane Street). The main weakness was the Makefile (no  
wonder). To solve it, few weeks ago I moved all the build scripts to  
ocamlbuild, and it is working like a charm now. Our lives are a little  
bit better (once again), thanks to the french fellows :-).
