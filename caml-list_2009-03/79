Come on, can you stop all those stuff about LLVM. The guy works in a game company
with people knowing C/C++ for decades, with quite a lot of legacy code I guess, and you
arrive with your "hey you should use LLVM" that almost nobody knows about. 

Oh, and by the way, in which programming language is written LLVM ? :) 

Valgrind is written in C (and julien seward, its author knows very well 
Haskell), Qemu is written in C, because I guess indeed C struct and union
and bitfields makes it easy to match directly to the hardware (no marshalling,
there is direct mapping).

So what you propose to his company is to switch from C++ to HLVM ? :) 
Be serious.
