Event Title: Workshop on Logical Aspects of Fault Tolerance (LAFT)=20
(affiliated with LICS 2009)

Date: 08/15/2009

Location: University of California, Los Angeles

URL: www.aero.org/support/laft

Description:=20

We are soliciting papers on logical aspects of fault tolerance. The=20
concept of
?fault? underlies essentially all computational systems that have any=20
goal.
Loosely speaking, a fault is an unintended event that can have an=20
unintended
effect on the attainment of that goal. ?Fault tolerance? is the term given =

to a system?s ability to cope in some way with a fault, either inherently=20
or through design. Fault tolerance has been studied for its application to =

circuits, and then branching out to distributed systems and more recently=20
to quantum computers, where the concern with fault tolerance is almost the =

paramount issue. The relevance to biological computation is also obvious.=20
Papers must be concerned with mathematical logical approaches to fault=20
tolerance, not simply fault tolerance.
Selected papers will appear in Logic Journal of the IGPL (Oxford U.=20
Press).

IMPORTANT DATES:=20
Papers due: April 17, 2009
Notification: May 22, 2009=20
Final papers: July 10, 2009=20
Workshop: August 15, 2009

Please send all workshop correspondence, including submissions, to=20
