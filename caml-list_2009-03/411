You may find the OCaml Beginners mailing list hosted by Yahoo to be more 
productive for simple questions.

I highly recommend ocamlbrowser but it is not CLI.

I use XML-Light whenever it can handle it (it supports only a small part of 
XML but is very easy to use) and PXP otherwise. You might also check out the 
well-reputed Expat bindings but I have not tried them.

For this list, here:

Google indexes it well.

Start at the community OCaml tutorial wiki and search the links therein.

  http://www.ocaml-tutorial.org/

There is some interesting propaganda here:

Two beginners books are my own "OCaml for Scientists" and Tim Rentsch's "The 
Objective CAML Programming Language". Hopefully Jason Hickey's book will be 
published this year.
