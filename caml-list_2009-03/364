I was wrong about that actually. It was only 60Mb because I had compiled LL=
VM=20
with debugging on. Now that I have LLVM 2.5 compiled for release my HLVM=20
executable is under 10Mb. Still large but I'm happy with that.

You mean for the code fed into HLVM? No, not yet. We need more code to feed=
=20
into it before that will become interesting!
