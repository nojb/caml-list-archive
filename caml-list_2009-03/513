There must be some reason why the manual and other materials on the =20
official site are of such poor quality. I've thought a bit about it, =20
and the only reason I see is that the authors do not have a feel for =20
what it takes to learn/understand/use that language. They obviously =20
know it all through, but that's still far removed from being able to =20
explain it to someone else. I don't know, of course, how it is that =20
one understands something "well" yet is not able to explain it to =20
somebody else. To me, that's very fragile knowledge. I always thought =20=

that deep understanding implies an ability to extract what's =20
important, and to lead the other person from some "basics" (whatever =20
they may be) to the conclusion. Some experience in imperative =20
languages can be perhaps expected of the OCaml beginners. But the =20
manual, the official tutorial, and even ocaml-tutorial, fall short of =20=

being really useful - for me. Personally, I found them next to =20
useless, but that perhaps has to do with my own shortcomings.

Books that lag behind the current release's features are not all that =20=

great either -- you find a book that's a good match to your needs, and =20=

then, after a while, find that you miss on a lot of good stuff that's =20=

not mentioned in the book. I have two examples of such books: Jon's =20
book, and Marcelo DiPierro's web2py book. Both are very good books =20
because the authors have a feel for what it takes to understand what =20
they talk about. Yet both miss out on some newer features of OCaml and =20=

web2py, respectively -- features that would be best explained by the =20
very same authors!

Cheers, Kuba=
