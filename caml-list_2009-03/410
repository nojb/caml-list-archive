I'm new to ocaml and coming (most recently) from ruby, so I was wondering if
there are equivalents to some of the things that I find handy in ruby:

1) Is there something comparable to RSpec (i.e., behavior driven
development)?  A recommendation on which testing module to use?

2) Is there something like 'ri' in ocaml?  (commandline access to basic
documentation)

3) Is there consensus on the best/fastest xml parser?

4) What kind of YAML support is there?  I've seen an ad-hoc writeup to read
in JSON in an ocaml program, but I'm much more familiar with YAML.

Where is the message archive located?  Is it searchable?

Can someone point me to the best resource(s) for newbies?  I have been
reading through what's out there, but its always nice to get a
recommendation.

Thanks,
John
