For those who are interested, I just posted a video of a talk I gave at CMU
several weeks ago about Jane Street's use of OCaml.  This is an updated
version of the talk I gave at POPL last year.  Various people have expressed
an interest in showing the talk to their undergraduate classes, so I thought
it worth mentioning on the list.

Here's the link:

I can also provide the original quicktime file from which this is based on
request.
