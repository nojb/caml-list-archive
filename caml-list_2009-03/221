I don't think this is ever necessary (although in the back of my mind
I have a fuzzy recollection that somewhere in the docs / wiki it says
that it is). I can't say why you got a type error one way but not the
other.

For debugging types, you might find it helpful to look at the output
of the preprocessing step, which has various type annotations.

Syntactically it is fine but I don't think this is going to do what
you want. Camlp4 parsers aren't backtracking; you have to distinguish
openStatement from closedStatement by parsing a token. Otherwise
you'll always follow the openStatement branch, then get a parse error
if the stream wasn't actually parseable as an openStatement. (I think
this is correct but it has been a few months since I worked on a
grammar, sorry if I remembered it wrong.)
