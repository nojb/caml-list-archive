Our blog is here:

   http://ocaml.janestreet.com

And I wrote a post about our build system here:

   http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/36

Interestingly, it is the most popular post on the blog.  Turns out, there
are more people who care about version control than people who care about
functional programming.  (It's not that bad, though.  The second most
popular post is on type-indexed values).
