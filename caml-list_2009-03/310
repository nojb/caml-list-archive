Call for Papers
===============

TAP: Tests And Proofs

The Third International Conference on Tests And Proofs (TAP) will be
held at ETH Zurich, Switzerland on 2 and 3 July 2009 as part of the
TOOLS EUROPE week.

The TAP conference is devoted to the convergence of proofs and tests. It
combines ideas from both sides for the advancement of software quality.


Purpose and Scope
-----------------
To prove the correctness of a program is to demonstrate, through
impeccable mathematical techniques, that it has no bugs; to test a
program is to run it with the expectation of discovering bugs. The two
techniques seem contradictory: if you have proved your program, it's
fruitless to comb it for bugs; and if you are testing it, that is surely
a sign that you have given up on any hope to prove its correctness.

Accordingly, proofs and tests have, since the onset of software
engineering research, been pursued by distinct communities using rather
different techniques and tools.

And yet the development of both approaches leads to the discovery of
common issues and to the realization that each may need the other. The
emergence of model checking has been one of the first signs that
contradiction may yield to complementarity, but in the past few years an
increasing number of research efforts have encountered the need for
combining proofs and tests, dropping earlier dogmatic views of
incompatibility and taking instead the best of what each of these
software engineering domains has to offer.

The conference will include a mix of invited and submitted presentation,
and a generous allocation of panels and informal discussions.


Topics
-------
Possible topics include (as an indicative rather than exhaustive list):

- Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive techniques
such as
 * theorem proving,
 * model checking,
 * symbolic execution,
 * constraint logic programming, etc.
- Generation of specifications by deduction
- Verification techniques combining proofs and tests
- Program proving with the aid of testing techniques
- Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage criteria)
- Automatic bug finding
- Formal frameworks
- Tool descriptions and experience reports
- Case studies


Contributions
-------------
Two kinds of contributions are expected:

- Research papers: full papers of not more than 14 pages
in LNCS format, which have to be original, unpublished and
not submitted elsewhere. The research papers proceedings will be
published in Springer's LNCS series.

- Short presentations of work in progress, industrial
experience reports and tool demonstrations.  An extended
abstract of not more than 3 pages is expected and will be
reviewed. The accepted extended abstracts will be
made available in supplementary proceedings. They will be
presented during the conference days.


Important dates
----------------
- Submission deadline: 20 March 2009
- Notification of acceptance: 20 April 2009
- Submission of final camera-ready version: 3 May 2009


Keynote speakers
----------------
- Sriram Rajamani (Microsoft Research)
- Boutheina Chetali (Security Research Group Manager at Gemalto)
