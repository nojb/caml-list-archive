I have built a MacOS-to-Linux cross-compiler last week.
I do confirm that the hard part is getting a cross-[g]cc up and running.
In fact, this is so tedious that I strongly encourage to resort to =20
either
a prepackaged cross-[g]cc (from binaries, from a Linux packaging
system, whatever), or to the excellent "crosstool" available at :
	http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/

On the OCaml side, there are very few things to do and they are
quite straightforward. First, you have to emulate the behaviour of
"./configure" by producing "config/m.h", "config/s.h", and "config/=20
Makefile"
by hand. This is easier than it may sound, just start from "config/m-=20
templ.h",
"config/s-temp.h", and "config/Makefile-templ" (these are =20
comprehensively
commented).
Then, you will have to slightly patch some Makefiles, and you are done.

I will setup a webpage with all the necessary steps and patches as soon
as I get my notes organized. This will allow us to share knowledge on =20=

the subject.
