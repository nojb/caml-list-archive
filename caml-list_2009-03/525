FWIW, I think the OCaml manual is superb and under-appreciated.

My work is driven by profit, of course, and I believe it is substantially more 
profitable to publish new books on related fringe topics where there is 
little or no competition (e.g. F#, Scala, Clojure) rather than write a second 
edition of an existing book like OCaml for Scientists.

I am currently writing another F# book but only because we do not publish one 
yet. After that, I'll probably turn to another language but that may very 
well be HLVM if I can develop it quickly enough...
