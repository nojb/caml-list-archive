That's disappointing since you were quite willing to take the bait in the
first place :) But seriously, I'd suggest that your company could augment
its excellent technical outreach efforts to the
academic/engineering/free-software crowd with some education about why you
are proud of your business. It's good for recruitment! Especially
considering, however unjustified it may or may not be, how much embitterment
there is towards your field right now.
