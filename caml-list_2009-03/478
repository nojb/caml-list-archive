CONFERENCE  OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sixth International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual
Instrumentation (REV 2009) will be held on June 22-25, 2009 at the
University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport, Connecticut, U.S.A.

REV 2009 is the sixth in a series of annual events addressing the area of
remote engineering and virtual instrumentation. Previous editions of REV
were organized in the form of an international symposium, and evolved in
2007 to be the annual conference of the International Association of Online
Engineering. The general objective of this conference is to discuss
fundamentals, applications and experiences within the field of online
engineering, both in industry and academia. REV 2009 offers an exciting
technical program as well as academic networking opportunities during the
social events.


Scope of the conference:

Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation are emerging trends in
engineering and science. Due to:

o The increasing complexity of engineering tasks
o The availability of specialized and expensive equipment as well as
software tools and simulators
o The need for highly qualified staff to control equipment
o The demands of globalization

The general objective of this conference is to discuss fundamentals,
applications and experiences in the field of remote engineering and virtual
instrumentation. It is becoming increasingly necessary to allow the shared
use of equipment and specialized software. The use of virtual and remote
laboratories is one of the future directions for advanced teleworking,
remote services, collaborative research and e-working environments.

Another objective of the conference is to discuss guidelines for education
in university level courses. The organizers encourage industry personnel to
present their experiences and applications of remote engineering and
virtual instruments.

This conference will be organized by the School of Engineering at the
University of Bridgeport.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

o Virtual and remote laboratories
o Remote process visualization and virtual Instrumentation
o Remote control and measurement technologies
o Online engineering
o Networking and grid technologies
o Mixed Reality environments for education and training
o Demands in education and training, e-learning, b-learning, m-learning and
 ODL
o Teleservice and telediagnosis
o Telerobotics and telepresence
o Support of collaborative work in virtual engineering environments
o Teleworking environments
o Telecommunities and their social impact
o Present and future trends including social and educational aspects
o Human computer interfaces, usability, reusability,accessibility
o Applications and experiences
o Standards and standardization proposals
o Innovative organizational and educational concepts for remote 
engineering

The REV 2009 Conference is soliciting manuscripts which address the various
challenges and paradigms in this technological world through research and
instructional programs in Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation.
Suggested conference session topics are listed above. Other innovations in
course and laboratory experiences are also most welcome for submission. To
submit your paper abstract, please visit the conference website at
http://www.rev2009bridgeport.org

If you are interested in submitting a special paper session, panel,
tutorial, or workshop proposal, the contact information are also available
at the conference website at http://www.rev2009bridgeport.org If your
company or institution would like to exhibit at, or co-sponsor, the
conference, the sponsorship and exhibit forms are also available at the
conference website.
