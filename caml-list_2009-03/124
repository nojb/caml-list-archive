CALL FOR PAPERS

***3rd International Workshop on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and
Communication Systems (VeCoS'09) ***
July, 2-3, 2009, Rabat, Morocco 
 http://www.vecos-world.org/

*** Important dates:
   Paper submission: March 30, 2009
   Notification of acceptance/rejection: May 15, 2009
   Final version due: May 31, 2009

*** Aims and scope
The International Workshop on Verification and Evaluation of Computer and
Communication Systems (VECoS) was created by an Euro-Maghrebian network of
researchers in computer science. The first edition tooks place in Algiers
5-6 May 2007 (VECoS'07), the second edition in Leeds 2-3 July 2008
(VECoS'08).
The aim of VECoS workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners,in the areas of Verification, Control, Performance, Quality of
service, Dependability evaluation and Assessment, to discuss the state of
the art for solving the challenges facing us today in various modern
computer and communication systems in which functional and extra functional
properties are strongly interrelated. 

Thus, the main motivation for VECoS is to encourage the cross-fertilization
between formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and
techniques
especially those based on the specification formalisms for concurrent,
distributed and soft/hard systems. Beyond its technical and scientific
goals, another main purpose of VECoS is to promote collaboration between
participants in research and education in the area of computer science and
engineering.
We welcome contributions describing original research, practical experience
reports and tool descriptions/demonstrations in the areas of Verification,
Control, and Performance, Quality of service, Dependability Evaluation.

***  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  - Model-checking
  - Equivalence checking
  - Abstraction techniques
  - Compositional verification
  - Parameterized verification
  - Control synthesis techniques
  - Probabilistic verification
  - Performance and robustness evaluation
  - Simulation techniques of discrete-event and hybrid systems
  - Dependability assessment techniques
  - QoS evaluation, planning and deployment

*** Invited speakers
Mario Bravetti, Universita di Bologna, Italy
Guy Juanole, LAAS, France
Assaf J. Kfoury, Boston University, USA
Joel Ouaknine, Oxford University, UK

***  Submission and Publication
Contributions must have not been published previously, nor already submitted
to other conferences/journals in parallel with this workshop. Papers should
be submitted electronically via the VECoS 2009 web site by uploading a
self-contained PDF file, and should not exceed 12 pages using the Electronic
Workshops in Computing (eWiC) format. 

All selected papers will be included in the workshop proceedings available
at the conference and published in the eWiC series of the British Computer
Society.
