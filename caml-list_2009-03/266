In case of doubt, it's better to refer to Camlp4RevisedParser.ml, as said
before (I don't even remember where the camlp4 manual is, I just open that
file routinely when I'm about to do some camlp4 hacking :). In
Camlp4RevisedParser.ml, expr is defined as:

    expr:
      [ "top" RIGHTA
      ...
      | "+" LEFTA
        [ e1 = SELF; op = infixop2; e2 = SELF -> <:expr< $op$ $e1$ $e2$ >> ]
      | "*" LEFTA
      ...
        | e1 = SELF; op = infixop3; e2 = SELF -> <:expr< $op$ $e1$ $e2$ >> ]
      (infixop3 is *, / or %)
      | "**" RIGHTA
      ...
      | "unary minus" NONA
        [ "-"; e = SELF -> mkumin _loc "-" e
        | "-."; e = SELF -> mkumin _loc "-." e ]

So the levels are indeed listed in increasing order of precedence.

This might be of use, despite being for camlp4 pre-3.10:
