OO is not dirty. Wait until you feel it's the right time and do it safely ;-)


Objects and classes tend to be more appropriate than modules and records in
the following cases:

- self-centric data that can be considered as a "resource", typically for IO
operations.
- frequent need to define and use interfaces before implementations.
- keeping familiar names for functions/methods without requiring
disambiguation prefixes ("input", "output", "print", "flush", "read", "send",
etc.)
