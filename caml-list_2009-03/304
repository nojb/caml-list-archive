The OCaml compilers are remarkably comprehensible. I attribute that to the 
OCaml developers at INRIA discarding implementations of ideas that turned out 
to be rubbish rather than accumulating such cruft. So there is very little 
irrelevant baggage in there compared to many other compilers.

Performance. If you want to do OpenGL-based visualization then you at least 
need a fast route from the high-level data you are visualizing through to a 
low-level representation (e.g. tesselations) down to the C FFI to the OGL 
driver. Javascript is, of course, not up to the task. OCaml is much better 
but there is still room for improvement.
