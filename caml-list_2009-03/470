Probably yes. A few years ago, I had a Powerbook G4 with a 32 bits 
PowerPC running Linux, and Ocaml did compile and run fine, even in 
native mode. Of course, I understand that your ocaml code runs inside an 
application in linux user mode (not inside the kernel!).

I would expect you might have minor issues in configuration or 
whatsover. I suppose you have enough RAM (and I have no idea what that 
means exactly on your system).

Please publish the patches you'll need to implement your solution.

But I never tried all that, so take all my saying with a big grain of salt.

BTW, I'm curious: what kind of embedded application do you want to code 
in Ocaml for what sort of device or system?
