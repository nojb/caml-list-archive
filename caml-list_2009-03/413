I agree this doesn't look like an intuitive semantics.

I just want to say rolling back everything is another 
consistent/intuitive semantics.

You may try the following code snippet. It's not a total solution but an 
ad-hoc workaround. It only deals with recursive "#use" like in your 
example (e.g., "#load" operation inside a "#use" script will still 
behave the same as before), though it's not difficult to adapt the other 
primitives similarly ("#load" is probably the only one wanted, let me 
know if you need any help on that).

The only advantage of this method is that you don't have to modify the 
compiler code. You can just copy&paste the code into your toplevel 
sessions and go, or add it into your .ocamlinit file if you need it all 
the time.
