================================================================

CONCUR 09, the 20th International Conference on Concurrency
Theory, will take place in Bologna, on September 1-4, 2009.
The purpose of the CONCUR conferences is to bring together
researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the
theory of concurrency, and promote its applications.

The list of invited speakers at CONCUR 09 currently includes:
- Martin Abadi, UCSC and Microsoft Research Silicon Valley, USA
- Christel Baier, University of Bonn, Germany
- Robin Milner, University of Cambridge, UK
- Corrado Priami, University of Trento and CoSBi, Italy

Furthermore, there will be the following collocated events:
- 7th Int. Conf. on Computational Methods in Systems Biology
- 6th Int. Workshop on Web Services and Formal Methods

and the following satellite workshops:
Express, FMWS, ICE, Infinity, MecBIC, SecCo, SOS, and Young
Researchers Worshop.

The overall event will take place at the University of Bologna
on August 31-September 5, 2009.

TOPICS OF INTERESTS:

Submissions are solicited in all areas of semantics, logics,
verification and analysis of concurrent systems. The principal
topics include (but are not limited to):
- BASIC MODELS OF CONCURRENCY
such as abstract machines, domain theoretic models, game
theoretic models, process algebras, and Petri nets;
- LOGICS FOR CONCURRENCY
such as modal logics, probabilistic and stochastic logics,
temporal logics, and resource logics;
- MODELS OF SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS
such as biology-inspired systems, circuits, hybrid systems,
mobile and collaborative systems, multi-core processors,
probabilistic systems, real time systems, service oriented
computing, and synchronous systems;
- VERIFICATION AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR CONCURRENT SYSTEMS
such as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking,
model checking, race detection, pre-order and equivalence
checking, run-time verification, state-space exploration,
static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, and
type systems;
- RELATED PROGRAMMING MODELS
such as distributed, component-based, object-oriented, and
web services.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

The CONCUR 2009 conference solicits high quality papers
reporting research results and/or experience reports related
to the topics mentioned above. All papers must be original,
unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
Contributions should be submitted electronically as PDF,
using the Springer LNCS style. Papers should not exceed 15
pages in length. If necessary, the paper may be supplemented
with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the
discretion of the program committee. Each paper will undergo
a thorough process of review and the conference proceedings
will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series.
Proceedings will be made available at the conference.

Selected papers will be invited to a special issue of the
Information and Computation journal.
