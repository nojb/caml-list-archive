I'm pleased to announce the availability of my textbook on logic and
automated theorem proving, in which all the major techniques that are
described are also implemented as concrete OCaml code:

         Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning

                            John Harrison

                   Cambridge University Press 2009

                         ISBN: 9780521899574

     Publisher's Web page: http://www.cambridge.org/9780521899574
     Code and resources:   http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/
