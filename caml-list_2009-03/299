I did watch the video, that's why I asked the question. From the video
it sounds like your are buying and selling things on the market
at the micro-second level. I don't see any value, any wealth created
doing that. The only thing that come to my mind is that there should
be a law that forbid such micro-transactions. I can see the
value of banks, of investors, I don't understand the value
of "arbitrage". To make money flow better ? ...
