Then they should learn about it. LLVM is already capable of generating SSE 
instructions from higher-level code more effectively than GCC and, 
consequently, several of my benchmarks run 2-4x faster than GCC-compiled C.

Sure. That doesn't mean we shouldn't build upon LLVM.

I suggest they consider using LLVM, most likely from their C++ to begin with. 
This is a low barrier to entry: they can just compile their C++ using 
llvm-gcc and write custom passes that perform the optimizations they want. 
That is ideal for applications that are willing to sacrifice numerical 
robustness for performance, for example.
