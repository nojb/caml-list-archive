I would advise against getting conventional publishers involved at all and 
would, instead, strongly advocate self-publishing because of the freedom and 
efficiency that it offers. Indeed, the only reason Jason Hickey's book has 
not been published is because CUP were challenged with the task.

On a related note, why was the English translation of the book "Developing 
applications with Objective Caml" not published by O'Reilly?

I see no reason for a lawsuit. Jason Hickey simply needs to remove Tim 
Rentsch's contributions, remove him from the acknowledgements and publish 
what's left. Given the size of the book, that will only take about a month.

If he already signed copyright over to CUP then he also needs to make minimal 
changes to evade copyright infringement (which they will not attempt to 
enforce in the absence of any profits from sales anyway) and publish it 
elsewhere.

Either way I see no reason why the OCaml community cannot benefit from yet 
another great book on OCaml in the near future.

I agree that this text would also fill a valuable place in the spectrum of 
OCaml books. The contents are clearly ideal for students but would also give 
computer science graduates an extensive theoretical understanding of OCaml.
