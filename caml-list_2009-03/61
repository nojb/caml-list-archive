Java Generics were originally designed by Wadler & Odersky, both of  
which came from functional programming.

Java has overloading.

ML modules, including functors, where invented around 83/84 (by  
MacQueen), more than half a decade before macros evolved into  
templates, and a decade before D&E was published. Interestingly,  
Stroustrup even had his office down the hall from MacQueen at AT&T at  
that time. So he knew _about_ ML, but that's probably as far as it goes.
