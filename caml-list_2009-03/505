I blogged a quick analysis of the performance of HLVM's current shadow stack 
code:

http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/current-shadow-stack-overheads-in-hlvm.html

There is a lot of scope for optimization but these results were enlightening 
to show where the effort should be put. In particular, shadow stack updates 
by the mutator (and not the collector, as I had incorrectly assumed) account 
for the entire performance difference between OCaml and HLVM on the 10-queens 
benchmark.
