Dear Tim, reading your messages I do believe you acted in good faith.

Unfortunately though, under copyright law in most countries, your work
is a derivative of a work started by Jason, no matter how much you
contributed to it afterwords. Hence, at best (that would depend on the
amount of work you contributed in most cases), it can be considered as
a joint-work of which you both are Copyright holders.

Precisely because you two are co-owners (assuming the best-case
scenario above), it doesn't matter that you *proposed* him royalties
and co-authorship. Given that he refused, you are not allowed to go
ahead all alone.

You should have kept only the material for which you were the sole
copyright holder[*], and started from scratch with everything else.

Cheers.

[*] and you should better be able to prove that, in case Tim intends
    to push charges
