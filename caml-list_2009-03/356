I think the problem comes from a recent update in Cygwin. Now, gcc is a 
(Cygwin) symbolic link to gcc3.exe. Cygwin applications (like bash or 
make) are able to follow symlinks, but not native Win32 applications 
(like ocamlrun).

A solution is to copy gcc3.exe to gcc.exe in a directory which is put in 
front of the PATH. Same for cpp.
