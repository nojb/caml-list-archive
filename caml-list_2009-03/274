Dear all, the 10th Intl. Workshop on Termination
welcomes contributions from the functional programming community.
See the general call for papers below, and let me add a few words here.

The typical functional (compiler) programmer needs
- termination of programs
- termination of program transformations (rules)
- termination of program analysis (type checking/inference)
So I'm sure the workshop topic is highly relevant,
and we are looking for *your* contributions.

Also, we have an annual competition for automated termination provers,
http://termination-portal.org/wiki/Termination_Competition
and since 2007 it contains a Haskell category but no OCaml category yet. 
The problems there are taken directly from the Standard Library. So if 
you have some kind of (OCaml) source code analyzer
that knows something about termination (perhaps only internally),
then you're welcome turn it into a termination prover
and submit it to this competition.
(Details will be discussed at the workshop.)

Best regards, Frederic Blanqui.

10th International Workshop on Termination (WST 2009)

Leipzig, Germany, June 3-5, 2009

http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/wst09/

Termination is a fundamental topic in computer science.  Classical
undecidability results show that termination is difficult.  On the
other hand, programs are usually required to terminate.  So methods
are needed that prove termination and non-termination automatically
for a wide range of programs.  Termination proofs are essential not
only for program verification, but also as components of program
transformation systems. The topic is challenging both in theory
(mathematical logic, proof theory) and practice (software development,
formal methods), and many interesting ramifications are yet to be
explored.

The 10th International Workshop on Termination will delve into all
aspects of termination of processes.  It will continue the sequence of
successful workshops held in St. Andrews (1993), La Bresse (1995), Ede
(1997), Dagstuhl (1999), Utrecht (2001), Valencia (2003), Aachen
(2004), Seattle (2006), and Paris (2007).  It will attain the same
friendly atmosphere as those past workshops.  The intent is to bring
together, in an informal setting, researchers interested in all
aspects of termination, whether this interest be practical or
theoretical, primary or derived.  The workshop shall help exchange
ideas from term rewriting and from the various programming language
communities.

Contributions from the imperative, constraint, functional, and logic
programming communities, and papers investigating new applications of
termination are particularly welcome.
