Great talk. I love that some people are doing business
with such a great language, and all the stuff Jane Street is doing
around OCaml is really cool (the open source library, the blog,=20
the summer project).=20

Having said that, about your company, Jane Street,
aren't you part of the people that put the countries in such trouble ?=20
Do you create wealth ? It seems you are just a parasite ... that
exploits some loopholes in the system.

PS: I applied to your company 3 years ago, and got rejected,=20
so I may be biased :)=20
