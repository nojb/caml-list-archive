Call for Papers: LPNMR'09
=========================
10th International Conference on Logic Programming
and Nonmonotonic Reasoning

Potsdam, Germany, 14-18 September, 2009
http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/lpnmr09

LPNMR'09 is the tenth in the series of international meetings on logic
programming and nonmonotonic reasoning. The special theme of LPNMR'09
is Applications of Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning; it
aims at providing a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art of
Applications in the field, with a slight focus on Answer Set
Programming (ASP).

LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming,
nonmonotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the
conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers interested
in the design and implementation of logic based programming languages
and database systems, and researchers who work in the areas of
knowledge representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to
encompass theoretical and experimental studies that led or will lead to
the construction of practical systems for declarative programming and
knowledge representation.

Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and
unpublished research on nonmonotonic aspects of logic programming and
knowledge representation. We particularly encourage papers on LPNMR
techniques which led to the development of significant applications. In
addition to technical and original application papers, we also invite
submissions of short papers, system descriptions, and summaries of of
existing successful applications of LPNMR systems, which will be
presented in dedicated poster sessions.

As in the past, the proceedings of the conference will be published in
the Springer Verlag LNCS series (http://www.springeronline.com/lncs).

As part of the technical program, LPNMR'09 comprises special sessions
devoted to presentations and demonstrations of implemented nonmonotonic
reasoning systems and applications of LPNMR with a focus on
applications of ASP.  Moreover, LPNMR'09 hosts the award ceremony of
the Second Answer Set Programming Competition
(http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/events/ASP-competition).

Workshops
---------
The program of LPNMR'09 will also include several workshops. Workshops
provide a venue for presenting specialized topics and opportunities for
intensive discussions and project collaboration in any areas related to
LPNMR, including cross-disciplinary areas.

Those interested in organizing a workshop at LPNMR'09 are invited to
submit an informal workshop proposal to the program chairs until 
30 April 2009.

Submission
----------
LPNMR'09 welcomes submissions in the following formats.

 * Technical papers (13 pages)
 * Original application papers (13 pages)
 * Short papers (6 pages)
 * System descriptions (6 pages)
 * Summaries of of existing successful applications (6 pages)

All papers must not exceed the alloted number of pages including title
page, references and figures; they must be formatted according to the
Springer LNCS authors instructions. Papers must be written in English
and present original research. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by
an international panel. Paper submission will be electronic through
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpnmr09

Important Dates
---------------
 * Paper registration 	   15 April 2009
 * Paper submission 	   20 April 2009
 * Workshop submission 	   30 April 2009
 * Paper Notification 	    1  June 2009
 * Final conference papers 22  June 2009

Venue
-----
The conference will be held at the University of Potsdam's Institute of
Informatics. Potsdam, once a city of kings and royal residences, is
today the capital of the state of Brandenburg in Germany and at the
same time a European city of culture and science. The heart of Prussia
is famous for its palaces and parks, its gardens and villas, and its
numerous museums. Last but not least it nicely complements the adjacent
capital city of Berlin.
