Alternately, I have found that I could use
MacPorts for everything GTK+ and still get the Quartz
back-end if I follow the instructions for compiling
a native Mac OS X version of Inkscape:

http://www.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/CompilingMacOsX

For distributing binaries, I build my quartz variant of MacPorts
as a subdirectory of the installation path that I wish to use
(/usr/local/Frama-C/lib/macports), and include in the distributed
archive those libraries that are necessary for running Frama-C.
See the contents of one of the Mac OS X distributions
for details: http://frama-c.cea.fr/download.html

This unfortunately means that the
binaries can not be installed anywhere else.
Gimp.app (http://gimp-app.sourceforge.net/) allows
to move the application around by using a shell script
to change, at each launch, the paths in all the configuration
files that have them hard-coded. But some of the libraries
that Frama-C depends on seem to have binaries files
with hard-coded paths, so I didn't succeed in doing the
same thing.

Tangentially, I would be interested in any improvement
suggestions from people more knowledgeable that me
on the subject of gtk-quartz, displaying unicode with
pango on Mac OS X, and their interactions with OCaml.
