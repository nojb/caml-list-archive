The Oregon PL Summer School will run July 23-31, 2009 with the topic 
"Theory and Practice of Language Implementation". We are excited to have 
a great collection of speakers! The school has a long and successful 
tradition and is sponsored by the NSF, ACM SIGPLAN, and industry 
(pending approval). The full "Call for Participation" can be found below.

Thanks,

                      Call for Participation:
Summer School on the Theory and Practice of Language Implementation
                          July 23-31, 2009
               University of Oregon (Eugene, Oregon)
     http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer09/
                    summerschool@cs.uoregon.edu

This Summer School will cover current research focused on the theory
and practice of programming language implementation. Speakers will
present material covering foundational theory, advanced techniques,
and applications.

Material will be presented at a tutorial level that will help graduate
students and researchers from academia or industry understand the
critical issues and open problems confronting the field. The course is
open to anyone interested. Prerequisites are an elementary knowledge
of logic and mathematics that is usually covered in undergraduate
classes on discrete mathematics. Some knowledge of programming
languages at the level provided by an undergraduate survey course will
also be expected. Our primary target group is PhD students. We also
expect attendance by faculty members who would like to conduct
research on this topic or introduce new courses at their universities.

The program consists of more than twenty-five, 80 minute lectures
presented by internationally recognized leaders in programming
languages and formal reasoning research. Topics include:

 Garbage Collection and the Metronome GC
    David Bacon, IBM Research
 Algorithmic Program Synthesis
    Ras Bodik, University of California - Berkeley
 Abstract Interpretation
    Patrick Cousot, Ecole Normale Superieure / New York University
 Continuations to Go
    Olivier Danvy, Aarhus University
 Program Analysis for Computing Symbolic Complexity Bounds
    Sumit Gulwani, Microsoft Research
 Managed Runtime Environments: Implementations and Opportunities
    Chandra Krintz, University of California - Santa Barbara
 Pointer Analysis
    Ondrej Lhotak, University of Waterloo
 Control-flow Analysis of Higher-Order Languages
    Matt Might, University of Utah
 Multi-Threaded Programming and Transactional Memory
    Yannis Smaragdakis, University of Massachusetts, Amherst


Venue
~~~~~
The summer school will be held at the University of Oregon, located in
the southern Willamette Valley city of Eugene, close to some of the
world's most spectacular beaches, mountains, lakes and forests. On
Sunday, July 26, students will have the option of participating in a
group activity in Oregon's countryside.

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cost for registration is $175.00 (USD) for graduate students, and
$275.00 (USD) for other participants. Registration must be paid upon
acceptance to the summer school, and is non-refundable. There are a
limited number of grants available to fund part of the cost of student
participation. If you are a graduate student and want to apply for
grant money to cover your expenses, please also include a statement of
your needs with your registration.
Additional information about the program, registration, venue, and
housing options is available on the web site. Or, you may request more
information by email.
To register for the Summer School, send a CV that includes a short
description of your educational background and one letter of
reference, unless you have already been granted a Ph.D. Please include
your name, address and current academic status.
Send all registration materials to summerschool@cs.uoregon.edu.
All registration materials should be delivered to the program by April
17, 2009. Materials received after the closing date will be evaluated
on a space available basis. Non U.S. citizens should begin immediately
to obtain travel documents.

Housing
~~~~~~~
The school will provide on-campus housing and meals. To share a room
with another student attending the school, the cost is $510 (USD) per
person. Housing rates are based on check-in on Wednesday, July 22 and
check-out before noon on Saturday, August 1. Some single rooms may be
available for an additional fee of $150 (USD). If you'd like a single
room, please indicate your choice and we will try to accommodate you
on a first-come/first-served basis.
