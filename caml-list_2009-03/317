As Feynman once said: if you cannot explain it clearly to an undergrad,
you likely don't really understand it yourself.

Now the deal is that I wish the pro-trading argument was presented by  
someone
who truly understands (in the Feynman sense).

I don't know if there's any single person out there who has as much  
understanding
of trading as Feynman had of physics. There's no "Feynman Lectures on  
Trading" :(

Cheers, Kuba
