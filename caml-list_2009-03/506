You want something called "views" or "active patterns".
You can do that in OCaml with mikmatch, which includes such syntax extension.

See http://martin.jambon.free.fr/mikmatch-manual.html#htoc10

Here is your example:

let view Mod30 = fun x -> x mod 30 = 0
(*
   but not:
     let view Mod m = fun x -> x mod m = 0

   but it could be implemented without difficulty (if really needed).
*)


let test x =
  match x with
     %Mod30 -> ...
   | ... ->


Of course the whole point is to use %Mod30 within arbitrary patterns,
otherwise it wouldn't be useful.

I you want to match regular expressions over anything else than bytes, there's
nothing out-of-the-box. You can define views on lists that would consume any
number of elements, but it is pretty limited.
