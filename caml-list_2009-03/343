Suggestions to have this thread die quickly:
1. be more polite, and don't treat people with different opinions like lazy
ignorants that should read *your* reference textbook before talking.
Hopefully no old-school marxist (and I know there are some on this list ;o)=
)
has bothered us with citations from Castioriadis, Che Guevara and Bob
Marley. Please don't let this happen : reply that you understand the
relevance of the initial question and that you'd be happy to debate on an
appropriate medium.
2. be more aggressive (for instance say that Marx should have taken care of
his beard instead of writing nonsense), create a mailing list
bored-camlist-free-market-argument@yquem.inria and announce a battle royale
on it. Settle it like real men do, but elsewhere ;o).

And then, maybe we could go back to "stuff that matters", like mixins, GADT=
,
ocamlbuild and camlp4 documentation, native opengl GUIs, LLVM compilation,
batteries etc ... all those topics for which this list (and its members) ar=
e
so valuable !
