Thanks for this awesome video! I was unaware that the Caml compiler did not
optimize source code before generating native code. Now I am a little less
afraid to study the actual compiler!

Your point about a lack of  GUI libraries is great - however it seems as
though they are not as important as they once were. The amazing javascript
toolkits [1] that have sprung up over the last year (along with the Ocsigen
and OBrower project [2]) have filled most of that vaccum.

As long as there are libraries that provide an easy way to hook up with a
web client is there still a compelling reason to develop native GUI
toolkits?
