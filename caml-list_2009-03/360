I ran into this problem as well. My solution was basically what you 
described:

cd /usr/bin
mv gcc.exe gcc.exe.cygwin
cp gcc-3.exe gcc.exe
mv cpp.exe cpp.exe.cygwin
cp cpp-3.exe cpp.exe

The symlinks are due to the "alternatives" system. If you look at 
Cygwin's original gcc.exe and cpp.exe, you'll see that they point to 
/etc/alternaines/gcc and cpp, which in turn point back to 
/usr/bin/gcc-3.exe and cpp-3.exe. The goal is to let you install 
multiple versions and use symlinks to set the defaults. Seems like 
overkill in this case.
