I'd also add that OCaml's object system is great when you're developing code 
and don't want to have to keep type definitions up to date as the code 
evolves. For example, I used objects to represent LLVM's state in HLVM.

I also used an object to avoid introducing a huge mutual recursion in Smoke.
