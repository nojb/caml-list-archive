I have been running macports and gtk2 compiled +quartz +no_x11 for
quite a while now. The only snag is that instead of installing pango
you have to install pango-devel, as there is a bug that prevents pango
from compiling w/o x11 support in current MacPorts.

I'm running native gimp and other tools, and it all "just works", so I  
don't
really see why you'd even need the x11 gtk.
