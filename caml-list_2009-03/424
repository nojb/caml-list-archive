In my (off-topic for this list) opinion, this whole licence business
is totally out of control because lawyers have succeeded in scaring
everyone witless about it.  For example, I don't understand why you
would need a detailed review of the code in order to notice that the
licence (which you quoted) is an exact copy of the new BSD licence
(straight from www.opensource.org, IIRC).

Whether you (or the Debian developers, Microsoft management, or
whoever else) choose to call it Free is a matter of political
opinion and debate on this topic is usually a waste of time.

This was my license rant for 2009.  Thanks for your attention.
