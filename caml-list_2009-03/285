Very interesting. I do have a couple of points:

. If you want to see shared-memory parallelism done right look at Cilk. It is 
both painless and incredibly efficient.

. I don't know how F# handles nulls but it has never caused me a problem and 
I've used many .NET libraries from F# including MDX, WPF, XNA and, of course, 
the framework itself.
