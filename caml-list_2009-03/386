Because that would duplicate the code and logic provided by the system's
assembler and linker (esp. linker).  For every platform (and there are
many possible combinations!).

If you use the existing linker, then you can depend on the expertise of
the authors for each system getting all the logic right for loading
libraries (which may be arbitrary libraries, when you're using C
extensions) and producing a binary in the correct format for that
system.

Something like LLVM means that OCaml doesn't even need to duplicate the
knowledge about how to generate code for each architecture -- the
compiler author can focus on writing a really good front end, and the
LLVM people can focus on making an excellent machine code generator.  If
compilers can attract the best front-end authors, and projects like LLVM
attract people with the best grasp of optimization and other back-end
matters, then the entire compiler ecosystem benefits more than if these
experts are split amongst many compiler projects.
