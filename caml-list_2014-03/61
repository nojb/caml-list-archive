Yes, the purpose of Lwt_preemptive.detach is to execute a blocking action
in a separate system thread in order not to block all lwt threads. And from
another system thread you cannot run lwt code directly, you have to use
Lwt_preemptive.run_in_main.

I think that would be very slow, as in involves system thread
synchronization.

You could try to assume  that OpenGL calls are fast and perform them in the
same thread as lwt.
