Subject: [Caml-list] Static linking via Ctypes?

I'm using Ctypes to interface with a dynamic library, but in addition to the
interface provided the library I have some helper functions (written in C,
against the same library) that I'd also like to call via Ctypes.  Is there any
way to achieve this via static linking or am I required to build another
shared object?
