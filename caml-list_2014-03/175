iPrA 2014 - 2ND WORKSHOP ON INTERPOLATION: FROM PROOFS TO APPLICATIONS

CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Date:     July 17-18, 2014
Location: Vienna, Austria (co-located with the Vienna Summer of Logic)
Web:      http://vsl2014.at/meetings/iPRA-index.html

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline: April 30, 2014, AOE
Notification:        May 7, 2014
Workshop:            July 17-18, 2014

ORGANISATION AND COMMITTEE

Laura Kovacs and Georg Weissenbacher

SCOPE 

Craig interpolation enjoys a continuing popularity in computer
science. Historically, Craig's interpolation theorem has received
ample attention in proof theory and mathematical logic as well as in
complexity theory. Recently, interpolants are increasingly used in
automated verification, synthesis, and description logics. The aim of
the workshop is to bring together theoreticians and practitioners from
these different fields.

We solicit submissions in form of an abstract of at most one page in 
PDF format. The authors of accepted abstracts are required to
present their work at the workshop. There will be no published
proceedings.

We encourage submissions presenting work in progress, tools under 
development, as well as research of PhD students, such that the
workshop can become a forum for active dialog between the groups
involved in applications of interpolation. We also encourage 
contributions from outside the verification community.

Presentations of recently published papers are also allowed and
encouraged, but please indicate on your submission where the paper was
published/presented.

Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) applications of
interpolation in: 

- Interpolating decision procedures
- Proof theoretic approaches to interpolation
- Proof systems and calculi for interpolation
- Proof transformation techniques
- Inductive Proofs
- Logical Abduction
- Interpolation techniques based on constraint solving, linear programming...
- Alternative techniques for interpolation
- Interpolation theorems (for theories and extensions, non-classical
  logic, ...)
- Interpolation-based/Inductive invariant generation
- Program analysis and verification
- Tools for interpolation
- Applications of Craig interpolation (verification, synthesis, 
  automated reasoning, ...)
- Forgetting, variable elimination, and uniform interpolation
- Complexity results and limitations
...

FORMAT

The workshop will feature

- invited talks and tutorials by distinguished speakers,
- presentations (selected by a committee based on the submission of
  abstracts) by workshop participants, and
- discussion and panel sessions.

INVITED TALKS

As part of the workshop program we will have invited talks given by
the following distinguished speakers:

- Orna Grumberg (Technion, Israel)
- Pavel Pudl√°k (Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic)
- Frank Wolter (University of Liverpool, UK)

The titles and abstracts of the talks/tutorials will be announced
on the workshop web-page closer to the date.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Abstracts (at most one page in PDF format) have to be submitted until
April 30 via the EasyChair system: 

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipra2014

The authors will be notified on May 7, 2014.
There will be no formal workshop proceedings.

REGISTRATION

Registration for the workshop will be possible via the VSL
registration site http://vsl2014.at/registration/.

CALL FOR PAPERS
=========================

IMPORTANT DATES: 

Submission deadline:deadlineMay 12, 2014
Notification of acceptance: May 19, 2014
Final paper submission: May 23, 2014
Workshop day:dayJuly 23, 2014

WORKSHOP AIM: 
The workshop aims at discussing the development and use of the first-order 
theorem prover Vampire. The workshop will address the newest trends in 
implementing first-order theorem provers, and focus on new challenges and 
application areas.

Workshop participants will include both Vampire developers and users and 
provides a convenient opportunity for interesting discussions between tool 
developers and users. The users can learn more about Vampire and its recent 
developments. The developers can learn more about the use of Vampire, its 
efficiency in various application areas and needs of the users.

The workshop is going to to shed the light on on problems such as

- what is essential for substantial progress in theorem proving tools;
- what are the best implementation principles to be used;
- what are the best heuristics and strategies, depending on application areas;
- both successful and unsuccessful case studies;
- missing features in modern theorem provers.

The workshop will also overview the most recent advances made in Vampire. 

PAPER SUBMISSION: 
We seek submissions reporting on theory, application, case studies, 
experiments and work-in-progress using Vampire and other theorem provers 
in various applications. Submissions can be in any form, ranging from work 
in progress to completed work. For example, the users can submit: 
- extended abstracts or full papers;
- theoretical papers;
- experimental papers and case studies
- or in general any papers that can benefit tool developers and users. 

Papers can be of any length, ranging from 2-page abstracts to full papers 
up to 20 pages in length. The papers should use the EasyChair LaTeX, 
Microsoft Word, or ODT templates, which can be found at ...
    http://www.easychair.org/publications/epic-templates. 

Submissions should be made using EasyChair, via the link ...
   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vampire2014

The workshop proceedings will be published in the EasyChair EPiC series.
