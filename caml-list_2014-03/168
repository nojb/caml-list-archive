	Call For Participation: FormaliSE 2014, Hyderabad, India, 3 June 2014
				www.formalise.org

FormaliSE 2014 received a good number of high-quality submissions this year=
 and
we are proud to announce an excellent programme. The FormaliSE workshop is
co-located with ICSE 2014 (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/). Please join =
us
at FormaliSE 2014!

Introduction
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Formal methods for software developent are still not widely used in industr=
y.
This may be due to the fact that the formal methods community has not enough
focused its attention to software engineering needs, and its specific role =
in
the software process. At the same time, from a software engineering
perspective, there could be a number of fundamental principles that might h=
elp
to guide the design of formal methods in order to make them more easily
applicable in the development of software applications.=20

The main goal of the workshop is to foster integration between the formal
methods and the software engineering communities with the purpose to examine
the link between the two more carefully than is currently the case.

Programme
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
We have an attractive programme with an invited speaker (Aditya V. Nori from
Microsoft Research, India), and presentations of nine high quality papers. =
