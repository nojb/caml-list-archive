These two are definitely useful, although it substantially increases
the amount of incoming email for all developers (especially with 
large, repeated patchsets that are being iterated over).

Only if they're merged via the web interface.  They can be rebased
and pushed directly as usual from the command line.

Certainly a concern.

GitHub has fantastic CI support via Travis -- easily the best of
anything I've used in the past, and particularly so because it's
free and hosted elsewhere.

See: http://anil.recoil.org/2013/09/30/travis-and-ocaml.html
for an overview of getting started with it.

In general, the GitHub API support makes it sufficiently easy to
hook in third-party workflows that the OCaml GitHub mirror will
continue to be useful even if Gabriel's experiment with pull requests
doesn't work out.

I spent a while trying these out for Real World OCaml, and noted
that all of the existing tools only support *patch* review, but not
general *code* review.  Consider, for example, someone reading a
book chapter, or the 4.01.0 x86_64 code generator and wanting to leave
comments on the whole tree, not just on a specific isolated patch.

An odd omission in the space, or I just missed an area of tooling
that deals with this...
