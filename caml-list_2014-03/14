Hi,

First let me insist that this is only my personal view.

Le Wed, 05 Mar 2014, David Allsopp a =C3=A9crit :

oasis is very nice in that it centralizes, in a single _oasis file,
everything about the project. In particular, it deals with the META file,
building cmxa, cma, cmxs, etc. It can generate a "configure" and a
Makefile (if you so wish), points to the documentation, the VCS
repository, deals with several libraries (or sub-libraries, see how lwt
does it for instance) and executables, etc.

Pretty simple indeed, 3 small files in the opam-repository and you're done.
Also the opam team is quite reactive and helpful with packaging
problems.

I think the main advantages of github is that since many people use it,
it's easier to fork/contribute to a project (which is simple because
it's 1/ forking 2/ committing 3/ submitting a "pull request" that can be
discussed online; the patch can be modified as needed, and everyone
commenting the pull request can see it). Also, I prefer the UI, but
some could disagree.

The main issue is lock-in, and it requires an account, but so does the
forge afaik.

My advice, if you already have a github account, is to use it. Otherwise
I can't tell.

Cheers,
