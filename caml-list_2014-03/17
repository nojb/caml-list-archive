Since your build system is make and that you already have findlib support I=
 wouldn't bother with oasis. Rather use an opam file directly for your pack=
age metadata and build instructions and put it at the root of your reposito=
ry. This allows to robustly support opam pinning workflows which are useful=
 for asking people to test fixes and making pre-releases.=20=20

Regarding the choice between github and the forge. I'd say if you want to b=
e nice to potential contributors prefer github which has a decent user inte=
raction. It's not without flaws, the graphs are generally useless, the pull=
 request mechanism is broken (e.g. it completely muddies history with usele=
ss commits) and it's never good to rely on the free as in wine service of a=
 company. If you already have some kind of web space where you can store an=
d push git repos I'd suggest to use github only as a mirror (I can provide =
you with the steps to do so if you are interested) so that you can more eas=
ily switch to something else in case github becomes problematic --- as sour=
ceforge became at one point.

Best,

Daniel
