This is incredible! Now let's get them all compiling and running unit tests
on Travis!

&gt; Dear OCaml community,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think we need more people ready to review patches proposed for<br>
&gt; inclusion in the OCaml compiler/distribution; lack of reviews is<br>
&gt; currently one of the bottleneck in the development process -- among<br>
&gt; others, such as the sheer difficulty to reach consensus on any change<=

&gt; to the language itself. Doing patch reviews is helpful, extremely<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; There was a resurgence of discussions on caml-list (Yotam Barnoy&#39;s=

&gt; [moving to github] and Adrien Nader&#39;s thoughtful proposal of<br>
&gt; a [mailing-list for patch review]). Amir Chaudhry launched a poll to<b=

&gt; I declare open the following experiment: for six months, starting<br>
&gt; today upto late July, patches proposed for the OCaml distribution may<=
br>
&gt; be submitted as a pull request (PR) on the [main github mirror], and<b=

&gt; we warmly encourage anyone to review the proposed patches, and make<br>

&gt; contribution, or discuss potential issues (backward compatibility,<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; [main github mirror]: <a href=3D"https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/" targ=
et=3D"_blank">https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In six months, we will reconsider, the default choice being to stop<br>
&gt; using github and revert to a mantis-only workflow. In the meantime,<br>
&gt; I will mirror the github PRs on the mantis side, so that contributors<=
br>
&gt; that do not wish to use the github interface can continue working as<b=

&gt; before. Patches and reviews are of course still welcome on mantis.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Note that github will *not* be used for issue tracking, only for patch=
<br>
&gt; reviews. If you want to submit a patch against a bug discussed in<br>
&gt; Mantis, or want to re-submit a patch already in Mantis (in the wild<br>
&gt; hope of more eyeballs), feel free to send a github PR and link to it<b=
