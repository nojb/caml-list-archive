And makes it hard to follow or later trace the developement due to the
amount of intermixed mails.

Rebasing a patch set for every change also makes it hard to follow
since rebase destroys history. So far revision control systems lack
that extra dimension needed to track the developement of a patch set
over time.

So overall there is no ideal solution yet. As you say below it is
still an unsolved problem.

That happens when you merge pull requests via the web interface. You
don't have to.

Also does that realy hold true if the pull request is based on the
HEAD of the main branch and only has one commit (only one patch in the
set)? That would create a merge with 2 parents that are both the same.

I don't mind. It is free as in beer, it works and it doesn't poison
your project (no lock in). You can always just use plain git at any
time, which is free.

Maybe once it is solved someone will implement a nice free platform
for it. Till then lets see what other people come up with, free or not.
