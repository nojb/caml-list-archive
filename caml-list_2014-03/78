VENUE:

AISC 2014 will take place in Sevilla, a very attractive city of Spain.
The venue will be the Department of Computer Sciences and Artificial
Intelligence at the University of Sevilla.


HISTORY:

Conferences in this series are held since 1992 on even years.

AISMC-1: Karlsruhe (Germany, 1992)
AISMC-2: Cambridge (United Kingdom, 1994)
AISMC-3: Steyr (Austria, 1996)
AISC'1998: Plattsburgh (USA)
AISC'2000: Madrid (Spain)
AISC'2002: Marseille (France)
AISC'2004: Hagenberg (Austria)
AISC'2006: Beijing (China)
AISC'2008: Birmingham (United Kingdom) (within CICM 2008)
AISC'2010: Paris (France) (within CICM 2010)
AISC'2012: Bremen (Germany) (within CICM 2012)

The goal of this series of conferences was to attract researchers active in
Symbolic Computation and Artificial Intelligence. The first three were named
"Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Mathematical Computing (AISMC)". The
recent conferences were part of the integrated federation of conferences CICM
(Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics).

AISC'2014 will be again independent in order to extend the scope of the
conference.  It will aim at attracting contributions from both classical theory 
fields and application areas. The aims are to offer a forum for young and
advanced researchers and mainly to manage that they have opportunities to
interact.


SCOPE:

Submitted papers should be related with one or more of the main themes proposed
for the Conference.

As usual the conference welcomes papers with a strong AI component that make
use of symbolic computation in a wide sense (not excluding but not restricted
to computer algebra). However, AISC 2014 aims at extending the scope of this
series of conferences to computing in AI thus covering new areas.

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include the following
non-exhaustive list of topics:

- AI in Symbolic Mathematical Computing.
- Mechanization of Mathematics with special emphasis on Algebraic Geometry and 
  Algebraic Topology.
- Computer Algebra Systems and Automated Theorem Provers.
- Integration of Logical Reasoning and Computer Algebra.
- Logic and Symbolic Computing.
- Combining of Logics, including fibring logics, unified logics, logical
  fibering and similar approaches.
- Non-classical logics computation such as non-monotonic reasoning,
  uncertainty, revision and beliefs.
- Causal inferences.
- New approaches to AI such as universal AI, heuristic approaches.
- Computability, Turing machines, probabilistic Turing Machines.
- Symmetries in AI problems,
- Foundations and Complexity of Symbolic Programming Languages for Symbolic
  Computation. 
- Symbolic Computations for Expert Systems and Machine Learning.
- Implementations of Symbolic Computation Systems.
- Implementation, Complexity and Performance Issues.
- Mechanized program verification.
- Mechanical theorem proving in geometry.
- Automated reasoning.
- Automated discovery.
- Machine learning.
- Knowledge extraction and verification.
- Semantic web technologies.
- Mathematical computations and the Internet of Things.
- Multi-agent systems.
- Decision support systems.
- Engineering, Industrial and Operation Research Applications.
- Mathematical machine intelligence.
- Mathematical Knowledge.
- Intelligent interfaces.
- Collective intelligence.
- Relevant educational systems.
- Epistemology and philosophy of Symbolic Mathematical Computing, multiagent
  systems.
- Impact on business models including business plans. Assessment of model
- sustainability. 
- Emerging fields of computational AI such as biocomputing and quantum
  computing.

Volker Sorge (University of Birmingham)
José Luis Ruiz-Reina (University of Sevilla, Spain)

SUBMISSIONS:

Authors are invited to submit non-anonymized papers in English presenting
original and unpublished research, not currently submitted elsewhere. Regular
papers should not exceed 12 single-spaced pages (including eventual appendices)
and should be formatted according to the standard format for Springer Verlag 
LNCS series (see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0).

Works from doctoral students are welcome. A specific chapter of the proceedings
will be devoted to such contributions.



PUBLICATIONS:

As for the previous conferences the proceedings will again be published by
Springer in the LNAI series and will be available by the time of the
conference. The proceedings editors are Gonzalo A. Aranda-Corral , Francisco
J. Martín-Mateos and Jacques Calmet.

As for the previous editions of the conference, selected accepted conference
papers will be invited to submit peer-reviewed extended versions for
publication in special issues of journals. The Annals of Mathematics and
Artificial Intelligence (AMAI) and the International Journal of Computer
Science and Applications (IJCAS) have tentatively agreed to devote special
issues to such papers. Selected extended, improved contributions will be
considered for publication in the AAECC (Applicable Algebra in Engineering,
Communication and Computing) journal. 


REGISTRATION:

Because of the shortage of funding of research and academic institutions,
registration fees will be kept as low as possible.
