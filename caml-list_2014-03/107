We have to stick with the original OCaml compiler on RHEL releases
because of binary compatibility.  Also EPEL policy doesn't allow us to
ship an upgrading OCaml compiler in EPEL, since we can't replace
packages from the original RHEL.

Start with the RPM spec file from Fedora Rawhide:

  http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ocaml.git/tree/

Use fedpkg to build an SRPM from that.

It's very difficult to have a binary RPM that would work on any
distro.  I would say practically impossible.

However you could conceivably have a source RPM that can be rebuilt on
several RPM-based distros, using rpmbuild --rebuild ocaml-XXX.src.rpm.
It would have lots of %-conditionals ...
