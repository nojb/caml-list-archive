The objective of the WBDB workshops is to make progress towards development=
 of industry standard application-level benchmarks=20
for evaluating hardware and software systems for big data applications.

Discussions from previous WBDB workshops have resulted in the formation of =
the TPC-BigData subcommittee, which is currently=20
working on the TPCx-HS benchmark, for Hadoop Systems. There have also been =
presentations on a variety of proposed benchmarks=20
including, BigBench, HiBench, BigDataBenchmark, BigDecision, and the Deep=20
Analytics Pipeline.=09

Meeting Topics:
To continue making progress towards big data benchmarking standards, the wo=
rkshop will explore a range of issues including:
- Data features: New feature sets of data including, high-dimensional data,=
 sparse data,=20
  event-based data, and enormous data sizes.
- System characteristics: System-level issues including, large-scale and ev=
olving system configurations,=20
  shifting loads, and heterogeneous technologies for big data and cloud pla=
tforms.
- Implementation options: Different implementation options such as SQL, NoS=
QL, Hadoop software ecosystem,
 and different implementations of HDFS.
- Workloads: Representative big data business problems and corresponding be=
nchmark implementations. Specification=20
  of benchmark applications that represent the different modalities of big =
data, including graphs, streams,=20
  scientific data, and document collections.
- Hardware options: Evaluation of new options in hardware including differe=
nt types of HDD, SSD, and main memory,=20
  and large-memory systems, and new platform options that include dedicated=
 commodity clusters and cloud platforms.
- Synthetic data generation: Models and procedures for generating large-sca=
le synthetic data with requisite properties.
- Benchmark execution rules: E.g. data scale factors, benchmark versioning =
to account for rapidly evolving workloads=20
  and system configurations, benchmark metrics.
- Metrics for efficiency: Measuring the efficiency of the solution, e.g. ba=
sed on costs of acquisition, ownership,=20
  energy and/or other factors, while encouraging innovation and avoiding be=
nchmark escalations that favor large=20
  inefficient configuration over small efficient configurations.
- Evaluation frameworks: Tool chains, suites and frameworks for evaluating =
big data systems.=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20=20
- Early implementations: E.g. of, say, BigBench, HiBench, BigDataBenchmark,=
 BigDecision, and the Deep Analytics=20
  Pipeline, and lessons learned in benchmarking big data applications.
