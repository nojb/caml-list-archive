Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] Experiment: OCaml patch review on
 github.com/ocaml/ocaml

As a followup to this, I've written a script that syncs all the
open pull requests against the compiler as OPAM compiler switches.
This is now running live on the central OPAM respository.

For instance, if you now `opam update` and look at your switches:

$ opam switch --all
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr10              Add String.{split,rsplit}
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr13              Add String.{cut,rcut}.
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr14              Add absolute directory names to bytec=
ode format for ocamldebug to use
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr15              replace String.blit by String.unsafe_=
blit
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr17              Cmm arithmetic optimisations
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr18              Patch for issue 5584
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr2               Parse -.x**2. (unary -.) as -.(x**2.)=
.  Fix PR#3414
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr20              OCamlbuild: Fix the check of ocamlfind
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr3               Extend record punning to allow destru=
cturing.
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr4               Fix for PR#4832 (Filling bigarrays ma=
y block out runtime)
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr6               Warn user when a type variable in a t=
ype constraint has been instantiated.
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr7               Extend ocamllex with actions before r=
efilling
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr8               Adds a .gitignore to ignore all gener=
ated files during `make world.opt'
--     -- 4.02.0dev+pr9               FreeBSD 10 uses clang by default, wit=
h gcc not available by default
--     -- 4.02.0dev+trunk             latest trunk snapshot

Each switch corresponds to the current development trunk, with the
diff in the PR applied.  If the patch is sane, you can proceed to
install OPAM packages in the experimental tree as usual without
affecting your day-to-day compiler switch.

Hope this is useful!  More details at:
http://anil.recoil.org/2014/03/25/ocaml-github-and-opam.html

It's set to run daily at the moment, and switches will be deleted once
the corresponding pull request is closed.

cheers,
Anil
