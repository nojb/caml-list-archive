mountains: down the Alps, Grenoble is the meeting point of two
important rivers, Drac and Isere. Grenoble has important historical
and gastronomic heritages. Leisure activities in breathtaking nature
are easily organizable and within short-distance. Grenoble is also a
major scientific center in Europe dedicated to high-tech technologies,
e.g., nano, micro, bio, and information technologies.
