Esp. for pure OCaml libraries, OASIS will provide you with all you need
to generate in one step (e.g. .cmxs, .cmxa on the right arch and not on
the other, automatic generation of your META files with the right
dependencies and version and so on and so forth).

Although if you have a working makefile, that you install .cmxa only on
the right architecture (amd64, i386 and no mips) you should be fine and
won't have to use OASIS.

I am biased here, but OASIS helps me to lower the TCO of 24+
libraries/program with an easy workflow for quick releases (but I am an
OASIS poweruser and probably have access to advanced tools that uses
OASIS).

If you plan to have contribution and want to manage them: GitHub.

For big projects, for which I am expecting contributions, I use GitHub
and the OCaml Forge to distribute tarballs and maintain web pages of the
project.

For smaller project, I only use the OCaml Forge.
