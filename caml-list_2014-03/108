Subject: [Caml-list] ocaml toplevel: is it possible to separate what is sent
 on stdout from the answers from the toplevel?

Hello,

I'm looking into extending the OCaml support in org-mode, and to do so
I would like to distinguish what is printed out as replies from the
toplevel from the data printed from the program.

To give a precise example, I would like to split "foo" from "val x : int
= 3" in the following interaction:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
# let x = print_endline "foo"; 3;;
foo
val x : int = 3
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

Is there a way to do it?

Thanks,

Alan
