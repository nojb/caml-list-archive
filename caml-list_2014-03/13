Subject: [Caml-list] Project hosting for new OCaml projects

I've got a bit of code in a library which seems worth putting online. I'm
trying to consolidate the steps that should be taken to accomplish that
(beyond simply putting a tarball online!) and wondering if anyone can
confirm if what I've come up with is the "best/obvious" course of action.
Indeed, are there already "idiot"'s guides for this - I couldn't see
anything like it on ocaml.org et al?

So, this particular library is a pure OCaml library, which simplifies things
somewhat. At present it's built using GNU make and of course it is managed
using findlib.

It seems that the following are worth doing:

* Support OASIS (and in so doing, I believe that will migrate its build
system to ocamlbuild)
* Support OPAM (which looks incredibly straightforward - being primarily a
Windows user, the OPAM typhoon has flowed past me thus far)
* Put the SCM online somewhere; submit a pull request for opam-repository;
announce it

So, apart from any obvious errors/omissions in those steps, I have two
questions:

1. What are the differences, politely, in terms of things you can and can't
do between using GitHub and the OCaml Forge for the project pages? The Forge
seems the obvious choice, even ignoring the offensive name of the other!
2. Given that, is there any benefit/different to hosting the git repository
on the Forge vs hosting it on github and simply linking to it from the
Forge?

Thanks!


David
