                        CALL FOR PAPERS -- ICTAC 2014

**********************************************************************
         11th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing
                     17-20 September 2014, Bucharest, Romania
                          http://fmi.unibuc.ro/ictac2014
**********************************************************************

ICTAC 2014 is the 11th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of
Computing and will bring together practitioners and researchers from
academia, industry and government to present research and to exchange ideas
and experience addressing challenges in both theoretical aspects of
computing and in the exploitation of theory through methods and tools for
system development. Another aim of ICTAC is to bring together researchers
working on theoretical aspects of computing in order to present their recent
results and to discuss new ideas concerning computer science.

THEMES AND TOPICS OF PAPERS
ICTAC 2014 calls for regular research papers on theories of computation and
programming, foundations of software engineering and on formal techniques in
software design and verification, as well as papers about tools that support
formal techniques for software modeling, system design and verification.
The topical areas of the conference include, but not limited to

        * Automata theory and formal languages;
        * Principles and semantics of programming languages;
        * Theories of concurrency, mobility and reconfiguration;
        * Logics and their applications;
        * Software architectures, their models, refinement and verification;
        * Relationship between software requirements, models and code;
        * Program static and dynamic analysis and verification;
        * Software specification, refinement, verification and testing;
        * Model checking and theorem proving;
        * Models of object and component systems;
        * Coordination and feature interaction;
        * Integration of theories, formal methods and tools for
          engineering computing systems;
        * Service-oriented architectures: models and development methods;
        * Models of concurrency, security, and mobility;
        * Theory of distributed, grid and cloud computing;
        * Real-time, embedded, hybrid and cyber-physical systems;
        * Type and category theory in computer science.

PAPER SUBMISSION
As for the past editions, the proceedings of ICTAC 2014 will be published by
Springer in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) and will be
available at the colloquium. Special issue of few journals with extended
version of selected papers from ICTAC 2014 is under negotiation. Submissions
to the colloquium must not have been published or be concurrently considered
for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of
originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality,
as well as their relevance to the conference.

Regular Papers should not exceed 18 pages in LNCS format (see
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html for details). Papers must be
submitted by using www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac2014.

IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract submission: 16 March 2014
Submission deadline: 23 March 2014
Paper notification:  30 May 2014
Revised/final paper: 14 June 2014
