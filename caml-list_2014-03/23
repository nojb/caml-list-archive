GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT SFM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Formal methods are emerging in computer science as a prominent
approach to the rigorous design of computer, communication and
software systems.

The aim of the SFM series is to offer a good spectrum of
current research in foundations as well as applications of
formal methods, which can be of interest for graduate students
and young researchers who intend to approach the field.

This year SFM is devoted to executable software models and covers
topics such as variability models, automated analysis techniques,
deductive verification, and run-time assessment and testing.


COURSES AND LECTURERS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The school features the following lectures:

   "Design and Analysis of Executable Software Models: an Introduction and 
Overview"
     Reiner Haehnle (TU Darmstadt, DE)

   "Variability Models"
     Dave Clarke (KU Leuven, BE)

   "Deadlock Analysis"
     Cosimo Laneve (U Bologna, IT)

   "Probabilistic Modeling and Model Checking"
     Erika Abraham (RWTH Aachen, DE)

   "Model Checking of Fault-Tolerant Distributed Algorithms"
     Helmuth Veith (TU Vienna, AT)

   "Reasoning about Recursive Predicates in Specifications"
     Sophia Drossopoulou (Imperial College London, UK)

   "Verification of Concurrent Systems"
     Marieke Huisman (U Twente, NL)

   "Run-Time Analysis"
     Frank de Boer (CWI Amsterdam, NL)

   "Test-Case Generation"
     Elvira Albert (U Complutense Madrid, ES)

   "Model-Based Testing"
     Ina Schaefer (TU Braunschweig, DE)

All participants will receive a copy of a tutorial book published by
Springer as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.


LOCATION
^^^^^^^^

SFM-14:ESM will be held in the medieval hilltop town of Bertinoro.

This place is in Emilia Romagna, about 70 km south-east of Bologna,
at an elevation of about 230 m. It can be reached in a couple of
hours from the international airport "G. Marconi" of Bologna by
shuttle (from the airport to the railway station) + train (from
Bologna to Forli`) + bus/taxi (from the railway station to Bertinoro).

Bertinoro is close to many splendid locations such as Urbino,
Gradara, San Leo, and the Republic of San Marino, as well as some
less well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme.
Bertinoro can also be a base for visiting some of the better-known
Italian locations such as Bologna, Parma, Rimini, Ravenna, Ferrara,
Padova, Venezia, Verona, Firenze, Pisa, Lucca, and Siena.

Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with its narrow streets and
walkways winding around the central peak. The school will be held
at the Centro Residenziale Universitario (CRU), an ex-episcopal
fortress that has been converted into a modern conference center.
From the fortress, it is possible to enjoy a beautiful vista stretching
from the Apennines to the Adriatic Coast and the Alps over the Po Valley.

APPLICATION
^^^^^^^^^^^

Prospective participants should send by 21 March 2014
the application form, available on the school website,
to the two e-mail addresses below:

   Marco Bernardo
   marco.bernardo AT uniurb.it

   Monica Michelacci
   mmichelacci AT ceub.it

The registration fee is 300 euros and includes the school material.

The accommodation fee is 350 euros and covers the period June 15-21
(6 nights), double room (to share with another participant),
half board (breakfast and lunch, dinner of June 15 included,
lunch of June 21 excluded).

The reduced accommodation fee for the participants who do not
need a room is 100 euros and covers the period June 16-20
