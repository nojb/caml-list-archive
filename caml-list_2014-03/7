Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Bioinformatics Js_of_ocaml GSoC project

This is wicked cool, and I'd like to keep track of this and
potentially help out.  I'm not interested as a GSOC student (I'm a
grad student) but am using js_of_ocaml for visualization right now,
and I'd be interested in having discussions with whoever works on
this.
