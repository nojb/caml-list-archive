(Proceedings will be published by IEEE)


The IEEE WiMob conference is an international forum for the exchange of
experience and knowledge among researchers and developers concerned with
wireless and mobile technology. For nine years, the International IEEE WiMob
conference has provided unique opportunities for researchers to interact,
share new results, show live demonstrations, and discuss emerging directions
in Wireless Communications, Mobile Networking and Ubiquitous Computing.

IEEE WiMob 2014 will take place at Larnaca, Cyprus, between October 8 to
10th, 2014. It will be held at the Golden Bay Beach Hotel, a luxurious 5 st=

the Bay of Larnaca.

IEEE WiMob 2014 is soliciting high quality technical papers addressing
research challenges in the areas of wireless communications, wireless
networking, mobility, nomadicity, ubiquitous computing, services and
applications. Papers should present original work validated via analysis,
simulation or experimentation. Practical experiences and Testbed trials
also are welcome.
