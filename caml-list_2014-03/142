I figured that for the course of Gabriel's experiment, we might as well kee=
p it as simple as possible.  The only churn that casual users will see is a=
 slightly more verbose 'opam update' as the switches come and go.

If it transpires that the full force of Mantis bugs move over to a system l=
ike this in the future, then I agree that we should maintain a separate rem=
ote instead.
