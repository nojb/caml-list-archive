CALL FOR INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS

There is a remarkable difference in conference style between computer
science and mathematics conferences. Mathematics conferences allow for
informal presentations that are prepared very shortly before the conference
and inform the participants about current research and work in progress. The
format of computer science conferences with pre-conference proceedings is
not able to accommodate this form of scientific communication.

Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, also this year's CiE
conference endeavours to get the best of both worlds. In addition to the
formal presentations based on our LNCS proceedings volume, we invite
researchers to present informal presentations. For this, please send us a
brief description of your talk (between one paragraph and one page) by the
DEADLINE:

------------------------------------------------------
APRIL 14, 2014
------------------------------------------------------

Please submit your abstract electronically, via EasyChair
<https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=cie2014>, selecting the category
"Informal Presentation".

You will be notified whether your talk has been accepted for informal
presentation usually within a week or two after your submission.

If you intend to apply for the ASL Student Travel Award, you might need us
to confirm that your are going to give a presentation at CiE 2014
(applications of students who are presenting get higher priority).
Therefore, we would like to ask you to submit your informal presentations by
20 March so that we can send you the notification before the ASL deadline of
23 March 2014.


GRANTS:

Grants for students, members of the ASL:

The Association for Symbolic Logic <http://www.aslonline.org  has decided
to sponsor some students that are ASL members and willing to attend CiE2014.
The eligible students may apply for ASL travel funds that are available for
sponsored meetings, see http://www.aslonline.org/studenttravelawards.html
for detailed instructions on the application process. Applications should be
received at least three months prior to the conference.

Elsevier:

Under the name Elsevier Women in Computability (WiC), the publisher Elsevier
(more precisely, the journals 'Annals of Pure and Applied Logic' and
'Theoretical Computer Science') is continuing the programme 'Increasing
representation of female researchers in the computability community'
originally funded by the Elsevier Foundation (2008-2010).

This programme will fund the WiC workshop at CiE 2014, with the traditional
WiC dinner for workshop participants afterwards, and offer up to four grants
with modest support (up to 200 EUR) for junior female researchers to attend
CiE 2014.  Every registered junior female researcher is eligible to apply.
Preference will be given to researchers who present a paper (contributed
paper or informal talk).

Applications should contain a short CV (max 1 page) and contact information
for an academic reference. The application should be sent to Liesbeth De Mol
<elizabeth.demol@ugent.be> before the deadline of April 1, 2014.

EACTS Students

The European Association for Theoretical Computer Science is providing
limited funds for student participation.  Again, preference is given to
student presenting at the conference. Please contact the PC chairs if 
you are interested before the deadline of April 1, 2014.
