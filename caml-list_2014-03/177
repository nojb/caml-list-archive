I think it depends on how much feedback I get on any particular question.
By default, I would like comments to go in the code. Additionally, there's
the ocaml-internals wiki at
https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-internalswhich will be useful for
any concepts that span multiple files, or that are
too beginner-oriented. I'm guessing that for many things, it will just have
to be decided on a case-by-case basis.

Of course, the most important ingredient for the success of this 'project'
is the willing, patient participation of the core team, as well as the
other experts on this list.
