Submission Details
------------------

All submissions must be made via the EasyChair conference system
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp2017). Submissions of
regular papers (RPs) must follow the condensed TPLP format (template
available from ICLP=92s web page) and not exceed 14 pages including
bibliography. RPs may be supplemented with appendices for proofs and
details of datasets which do not count towards the page limit and
which will be available as appendices to the published paper. Three
kinds of RPs will be accepted:

 * Technical papers for technically sound, innovative ideas that can
   advance the state of logic programming;

 * Application papers that impact interesting application domains;

 * System and tool papers which emphasize novelty, practicality,
   usability, and availability of the systems and tools described.

Application, system, and tool papers need to be clearly marked in
their title.

All submissions must be written in English and describe original,
previously unpublished research, and must not simultaneously be
submitted for publication elsewhere. These restrictions do not apply
to previously accepted workshop papers with a limited audience and/or
without archival proceedings.

Papers of the highest quality will be selected to be published in the
journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge
University Press (CUP). In order to ensure the quality of the final
version, papers may be subject to more than one round of refereeing
(within the decision period).

The program committee may recommend some RPs to be published as
Technical Communications (TCs). TCs will be published by Dagstuhl
Publishing in the OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs). TCs must
follow the OASIcs format (template available from ICLP=92s web page) and
not exceed 14 pages excluding the bibliography and a short appendix
(up to 5 more pages). TC=92s authors can also elect to convert their
submissions into extended abstracts, of 2 or 3 pages, for inclusion in
the OASIcs proceedings. This should allow authors to submit a long
version elsewhere.

There is also a second submission round only for TCs. Submissions to
this extra round must also follow the OASIcs format indicated
above. RPs accepted as TCs do not need to be resubmitted to the TC
extra round. Rejected RPs cannot be resubmitted as TCs.

All RPs and TCs will be presented during the conference. Authors of
accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in the
list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic
Programming Newsletter at no cost.

Program Committee
-----------------

See full program committee at http://iclp17.a4lp.org/program_committee.html


Workshops
---------

The ICLP 2017 program will include several workshops. They are perhaps
the best places for the presentation of preliminary work,
underdeveloped novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide and
interested audience with opportunities for intensive discussions and
project collaboration.

See call for workshop proposals at http://iclp17.a4lp.org/call_for_workshop=
_proposals


Doctoral Consortium
-------------------

The Thirteen Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming [this year
being co-organized and taking place together with CP 2017 and SAT
2017] provides research students with the opportunity to present and
discuss their research directions, and to obtain feedback from both
peers and experts in the field. Accepted participants will receive
partial financial support to attend the event and the main
conference. The best paper from the DC will be given the opportunity
to present in a session of the main ICLP conference. Doctoral
consortium position papers, of between 10 and 14 pages, will also be
published as TCs.


Conference Venue
----------------

The venue will be the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition
Centre. Melbourne is the second most populous city in Australia and
the coastal capital of the south-eastern Australian state of
Victoria. Set on the shores of beautiful Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne
has been named the World=92s Most Liveable City for six years running
and it is widely recognised as the cultural and culinary capital of
Australia. It is a safe, creative and multi-cultural city full of
exciting places to see, delicious foods to eat, and excellent events
to experience; from the Arts precinct to the river bank parks and
gardens to the buzzing city centre and the hidden thrills of
Melbourne=92s laneways. It is also an air-hop away from breathtaking
destinations like The Great Barrier Reef, Sydney and Uluru.

The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC) is located on
the banks of the iconic Yarra River in Melbourne's South Wharf. Given
its central location, it has a huge variety of accommodation close-by,
with more than 6000 rooms within walking distance. MCEC is easily
accessible by public transport, particularly as the Melbourne's city
centre has a free tram zone that makes it easier for tourists to move
around the city.


Related Events
--------------

Several other AI events will be held in Melbourne and other parts of
Australia close to these dates, offering attendees a variety of
choices for an extended itinerary. These events will include the
International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint
Programming (CP 2017) and the International Conference on Theory and
Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2017), both co-located
with ICLP 2017. The International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence (IJCAI 2017), the Australasian Joint Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (AusAI 2017), the Australasian Conference on
Data Mining (AusDM 2017), and the International Conference on
Knowledge Science, Engineering, and Management (KSEM 2017) will all to
be held in Melbourne one week before ICLP. The International
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017) will also be held in Sydney
Australia shortly before ICLP 2017.


Sponsors
--------

The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming
(ALP), the Association for Constraint Programming (ACP), Monash
University, and CSIRO Data61.

See the sponsor information at http://iclp17.a4lp.org/sponsors.html


Financial Assistance
--------------------

The Association for Logic Programming has funds to assist financially
disadvantaged participants and, especially, students to enable them to
attend the conference. Inquiries should be made to the general chairs.

<div>Submission Details</div>
<div>------------------</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>All submissions must be made via the EasyChair conference system</div>
<div>(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Diclp2017). Submissions o=
f</div>
<div>regular papers (RPs) must follow the condensed TPLP format (template</=
div>
<div>available from ICLP=92s web page) and not exceed 14 pages including</d=
iv>
<div>bibliography. RPs may be supplemented with appendices for proofs and</=
div>
<div>details of datasets which do not count towards the page limit and</div>
<div>which will be available as appendices to the published paper. Three</d=
iv>
<div>kinds of RPs will be accepted:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;* Technical papers for technically sound, innovative ideas that =
can</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;advance the state of logic programming;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;* Application papers that impact interesting application domains=
;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;* System and tool papers which emphasize novelty, practicality,<=
/div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;usability, and availability of the systems and tools desc=
ribed.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Application, system, and tool papers need to be clearly marked in</div>
<div>their title.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>All submissions must be written in English and describe original,</div>
<div>previously unpublished research, and must not simultaneously be</div>
<div>submitted for publication elsewhere. These restrictions do not apply</=
div>
<div>to previously accepted workshop papers with a limited audience and/or<=
/div>
<div>without archival proceedings.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Papers of the highest quality will be selected to be published in the<=
/div>
<div>journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge<=
/div>
<div>University Press (CUP). In order to ensure the quality of the final</d=
iv>
<div>version, papers may be subject to more than one round of refereeing</d=
iv>
<div>(within the decision period).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The program committee may recommend some RPs to be published as</div>
<div>Technical Communications (TCs). TCs will be published by Dagstuhl</div>
<div>Publishing in the OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs). TCs must<=
/div>
<div>follow the OASIcs format (template available from ICLP=92s web page) a=
nd</div>
<div>not exceed 14 pages excluding the bibliography and a short appendix</d=
iv>
<div>(up to 5 more pages). TC=92s authors can also elect to convert their</=
div>
<div>submissions into extended abstracts, of 2 or 3 pages, for inclusion in=
</div>
<div>the OASIcs proceedings. This should allow authors to submit a long</di=
v>
<div>version elsewhere.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>There is also a second submission round only for TCs. Submissions to</=
div>
<div>this extra round must also follow the OASIcs format indicated</div>
<div>above. RPs accepted as TCs do not need to be resubmitted to the TC</di=
v>
<div>extra round. Rejected RPs cannot be resubmitted as TCs.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>All RPs and TCs will be presented during the conference. Authors of</d=
iv>
<div>accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in the</di=
v>
<div>list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic=
</div>
<div>Programming Newsletter at no cost.</div>

<div>Workshops</div>
<div>---------</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The ICLP 2017 program will include several workshops. They are perhaps=
</div>
<div>the best places for the presentation of preliminary work,</div>
<div>underdeveloped novel ideas, and new open problems to a wide and</div>
<div>interested audience with opportunities for intensive discussions and</=
div>
<div>project collaboration.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>See call for workshop proposals at http://iclp17.a4lp.org/call_for_wor=

<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Doctoral Consortium</div>
<div>-------------------</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The Thirteen Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming [this year<=
/div>
<div>being co-organized and taking place together with CP 2017 and SAT</div>
<div>2017] provides research students with the opportunity to present and</=
div>
<div>discuss their research directions, and to obtain feedback from both</d=
iv>
<div>peers and experts in the field. Accepted participants will receive</di=
v>
<div>partial financial support to attend the event and the main</div>
<div>conference. The best paper from the DC will be given the opportunity</=
div>
<div>to present in a session of the main ICLP conference. Doctoral</div>
<div>consortium position papers, of between 10 and 14 pages, will also be</=
div>
<div>published as TCs.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Conference Venue</div>
<div>----------------</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The venue will be the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition</div>
<div>Centre. Melbourne is the second most populous city in Australia and</d=
iv>
<div>the coastal capital of the south-eastern Australian state of</div>
<div>Victoria. Set on the shores of beautiful Port Phillip Bay, Melbourne</=
div>
<div>has been named the World=92s Most Liveable City for six years running<=
/div>
<div>and it is widely recognised as the cultural and culinary capital of</d=
iv>
<div>Australia. It is a safe, creative and multi-cultural city full of</div>
<div>exciting places to see, delicious foods to eat, and excellent events</=
div>
<div>to experience; from the Arts precinct to the river bank parks and</div>
<div>gardens to the buzzing city centre and the hidden thrills of</div>
<div>Melbourne=92s laneways. It is also an air-hop away from breathtaking</=
div>
<div>destinations like The Great Barrier Reef, Sydney and Uluru.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC) is located on</d=
iv>
<div>the banks of the iconic Yarra River in Melbourne's South Wharf. Given<=
/div>
<div>its central location, it has a huge variety of accommodation close-by,=
</div>
<div>with more than 6000 rooms within walking distance. MCEC is easily</div>
<div>accessible by public transport, particularly as the Melbourne's city</=
div>
<div>centre has a free tram zone that makes it easier for tourists to move<=
/div>
<div>around the city.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Related Events</div>
<div>--------------</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Several other AI events will be held in Melbourne and other parts of</=
div>
<div>Australia close to these dates, offering attendees a variety of</div>
<div>choices for an extended itinerary. These events will include the</div>
<div>International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint</div>
<div>Programming (CP 2017) and the International Conference on Theory and</=
div>
<div>Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2017), both co-located</di=
v>
<div>with ICLP 2017. The International Joint Conference on Artificial</div>
<div>Intelligence (IJCAI 2017), the Australasian Joint Conference on</div>
<div>Artificial Intelligence (AusAI 2017), the Australasian Conference on</=
div>
<div>Data Mining (AusDM 2017), and the International Conference on</div>
<div>Knowledge Science, Engineering, and Management (KSEM 2017) will all to=
</div>
<div>be held in Melbourne one week before ICLP. The International</div>
<div>Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017) will also be held in Sydney=
</div>
<div>Australia shortly before ICLP 2017.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Sponsors</div>
<div>--------</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming</=
div>
<div>(ALP), the Association for Constraint Programming (ACP), Monash</div>
<div>University, and CSIRO Data61.</div>
