        12th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics
                 http://www.eprover.org/EVENTS/IWIL-2017.html

                                CALL FOR PAPERS
===============>>>>>>>> Extended Deadline: March 27, 2017.

The 12th International Workshop on the Implementation of Logics will be held on
7th May 2017, in conjunction with the 21th International Conference on Logic
for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Reasoning, at Cresta Riley's 
Hotel in Maun, Botswana.

We are looking for contributions describing implementation techniques for and 
implementations of automated reasoning programs, theorem provers for various 
logics, logic programming systems, and related technologies. Topics of interest 
include, but are not limited to:

+ Propositional logic and decision procedures, including SMT
+ First-order and higher order logics
+ Non-classical logics, including modal, temporal, description, non-monotonic 
  reasoning
+ Formal foundations for efficient implementation of logics
+ Data structures and algorithms for the efficient representation and 
  processing of logical concepts
+ Proof/model search organization and heuristics for logical reasoning systems
+ Data analysis and machine learning approaches to search control
+ Techniques for proof/model search visualization and analysis
+ Reasoning with ontologies and other large theories
+ Implementation of efficient theorem provers and model finders for different 
  logics
+ System descriptions of logical reasoning systems
+ Issues of reliability, witness generation, and  witness verification
+ Evaluation and benchmarking of provers and other logic-based systems
+ I/O standards and communication between reasoning systems

We are particularly interested in contributions that help the community to 
understand how to build useful and powerful reasoning systems, and how to apply 
them in practice.

Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit a position 
statement (2 pages), a short paper (up to 5 pages), or a full paper (up to 15 
pages) via the EasyChair page for IWIL-2017.
     https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwil2017

Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which will select a 
balanced program of high-quality contributions.

Submissions should be in standard-conforming PDF. Final versions will be 
required to be submitted in LaTeX using the easychair.cls class file. The
proceedings will be published as a volume of EPiC Computing.

Important Dates:

+ Submission of papers/abstracts:  March 27th, 2017     
+ Notification of acceptance:      April 10th, 2017     
+ Camera ready versions due:       April 21st, 2017     
+ Workshop:                        May    7th, 2017
