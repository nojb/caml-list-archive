Subject: [Caml-list] First call for talk proposals: Higher-Order Programming
 with Effects, HOPE 2017

                            CALL FOR TALK PROPOSALS

                                   HOPE 2017

                        The 6th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on
                     Higher-Order Programming with Effects

                               September 3, 2017
                             Oxford, United Kingdom
                           (the day before ICFP 2017)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HOPE workshop series are intended to bring together researchers 
interested
in the design, semantics, implementation, and verification of higher-order
effectful programs. They are informal, consisting of invited talks,
contributed talks on work in progress, and open-ended discussion sessions.
They are dedicated to John Reynolds, whose work is an inspiration to us all.

The 6th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Higher-Order Programming with Effects will
take place on Sunday, September 3, 2017, that is, the day before ICFP 2017,
in Oxford, United Kingdom.

# Goals of the Workshop

A recurring theme in many papers at ICFP, and in the research of many ICFP
attendees, is the interaction of higher-order programming with various kinds
of effects: storage effects, I/O, control effects, concurrency, etc. While
effects are of critical importance in many applications, they also make code
harder to build, maintain, and reason about. Higher-order languages (both
functional and object-oriented) provide a variety of abstraction 
mechanisms to
help "tame" or "encapsulate" effects (e.g. monads, ADTs, ownership types,
typestate, first-class events, transactions, Hoare Type Theory, session 
types,
substructural and region-based type systems), and a number of different
semantic models and verification technologies have been developed in 
order to
codify and exploit the benefits of this encapsulation (e.g. bisimulations,
step-indexed Kripke logical relations, higher-order separation logic, game
semantics, various modal logics). But there remain many open problems, 
and the
field is highly active.

The goal of the HOPE workshop is to bring researchers from a variety of
different backgrounds and perspectives together to exchange new and exciting
ideas concerning the design, semantics, implementation, and verification of
higher-order effectful programs.

We want HOPE to be as informal and interactive as possible. The program will
thus involve a combination of invited talks, contributed talks about work in
progress, and open-ended discussion sessions. There will be no published
proceedings, but participants will be invited to submit working documents,
talk slides, etc., to be made available online.

# Call for Talk Proposals

We solicit proposals for contributed talks. We recommend preparing proposals
of at most 2 pages, in either plain text or PDF format. However, we will
accept longer proposals or submissions to other conferences, under the
understanding that PC members are only expected to read the first two 
pages of
such longer submissions. When submitting talk proposals, authors should
specify how long a talk the speaker wishes to give. By default, contributed
talks will be 30 minutes long, but proposals for shorter or longer talks 
will
also be considered. Speakers may also submit supplementary material (e.g. a
full paper, talk slides) if they desire, which PC members are free (but not
expected) to read.

We are interested in talks on all topics related to the interaction of
higher-order programming and computational effects. Talks about work in
progress are particularly encouraged. If you have any questions about the
relevance of a particular topic, please contact the PC chairs, François
Pottier (francois.pottier@inria.fr) and Aleks Nanevski
(aleks.nanevski@imdea.org).
