CALL FOR PAPERS:               DEADLINE EXTENSION

                               Special Issue On

                         Automated Reasoning Systems

                        Journal of Automated Reasoning


The past few decades have seen major developments and practical achievements 
in automated reasoning systems. For example, SAT solving has become an inherent 
part of the standard hardware production process; SMT solvers are now the 
backbone of most software verification techniques; first-order theorem provers 
have pushed the productivity of interactive theorem proving to a new level; 
computer algebra systems have solved difficult problems in mathematics and 
biology; knowledge representation systems have become indispensable for 
reasoning in the world wide web; automatic termination checkers routinely prove 
the termination of complex programs.

This special issue is dedicated to automated reasoning systems in their full 
variety along the following dimensions:

1) considered logic: 
propositional (including (D)QBF), first-order modulo theories, modal, 
temporal, decidable fragments of larger logics, FOL, and HOL, ...;

2) considered problem: 
satisfiability, interpolation, quantifier elimination, consequence 
finding, model building, reachability, termination, ...;

3) application area: 
formal methods, artificial intelligence, mathematics, biology, product development, security, ...; 

4) user base: 
academic, educational, or industrial. 

In particular, we welcome papers emphasizing engineering aspects because, 
while often crucial for the success of automated reasoning tools, they are 
typically not given a sufficiently detailed treatment in theory papers or 
system description papers published at conferences or workshops. 

We welcome full-length papers describing past work not previously published in 
a journal as well as papers of any length describing new developments. Revised 
and enhanced versions of papers published in conference proceedings that have 
not appeared in archival journals are also eligible for submission. All 
submissions will be reviewed according to the usual standards of scholarship 
and originality.

We encourage submissions that include most, if not all, of the following: 
(i) theory details 
(ii) implementation details 
(iii) applications, and 
(iv) experiments. 

Papers should be in PDF format, following the JAR guidelines for authors,
http://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/journal/10817
and be submitted using  easy chair:

                https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jars2017

To encourage a speedy review cycle, we will expect authors of submissions to
serve as referees for other submissions as needed.
