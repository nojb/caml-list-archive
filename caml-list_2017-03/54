                                  ITP 2017
8th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving
                             Brasilia, Brazil
                          September 26-29, 2017

SUBMISSION DEADLINES
* April 3, 2017 (abstracts) 
* April 10, 2017 (full papers)

GENERAL INFORMATION
The ITP conference series is concerned with all topics related to
interactive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to
implementation aspects and applications in program verification,
security, and formalization of mathematics. ITP is the evolution of
the TPHOLs conference series to the broad field of interactive theorem
proving. TPHOLs meetings took place every year from 1988 until
2009. The eighth ITP conference, ITP 2017, will be held at
Universidade de Brasilia, September 26-29, 2017.

SCOPE OF CONFERENCE 
ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects
of interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics
include but are not limited to the following: 

*  formal aspects of hardware and software
*  formalizations of mathematics
*  improvements in theorem prover technology
*  user interfaces for interactive theorem provers
*  formalizations of computational models
*  verification of security algorithms
*  use of theorem provers in education
*  industrial applications of interactive theorem provers
*  concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)

PUBLICATION DETAILS
The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the
Springer's LNCS series.

** After the conference the authors of selected papers will be invited to  
submit revised papers for a special issue of the Journal of Automated  
Reasoning.  **
 
PAPER SUBMISSIONS
All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted
concurrently for publication elsewhere. Furthermore, when appropriate,
submissions are expected to be accompanied by verifiable evidence of
a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization 
for the proof assistant used. Submissions should be no more than 
16 pages in length and are to be submitted in PDF via EasyChair at 
the following address:

  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itp2017

Submissions must conform to the LNCS style in LaTeX. Authors of
accepted papers are expected to present their paper at the conference
and will be required to a sign copyright release form.
 
In addition to regular papers, described above, there will be a rough
diamond section. Rough diamond submissions are limited to 6 pages 
and may consist of an extended abstract. They will be refereed and be
expected to present innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an
early form and without supporting evidence. Accepted diamonds will be
published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short
talks.

                      THIRD CALL FOR PAPERS

                            FroCoS 2017
  11th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
                           Brasilia, Brazil
                        September 27-29th, 2017
                      http://frocos2017.cic.unb.br


Submission Deadlines: 24th April 2017 (abstracts) 
                      28th April 2017 (full papers)
		

GENERAL INFORMATION
  The 11th International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
  (FroCoS 2017) will be held in Brasilia, Brazil, between September 27 to
  September 29, 2017. Its main goal is to disseminate and promote
  progress in research areas related to the development of techniques
  for the integration, combination, and modularization of formal
  systems together with their analysis.

  FroCoS 2017 will be co-located with the 26th International
  Conference on Automated Reasoning with Analytic Tableaux and Related
  Methods (TABLEAUX 2017) and the 8th International Conference on
  Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2017). The local organization of 
  all events will be organised  by Claudia Nalon (USB, Brazil), 
  Daniele Nantes (UnB, Brazil), Elaine Pimentel (UFRN, Brazil) and 
  Joao Marcos (UFRN, Brazil). 

SCOPE OF CONFERENCE 
  In various areas of computer science, such as logic, computation,
  program development and verification, artificial intelligence,
  knowledge representation, and automated reasoning, there is an
  obvious need for using specialized formalisms and inference systems
  for selected tasks. To be usable in practice, these specialized
  systems must be combined with each other and integrated into general
  purpose systems. This has led---in many research areas---to the
  development of techniques and methods for the combination and
  integration of dedicated formal systems, as well as for their
  modularization and analysis.

  The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems
  (FroCoS) traditionally focusses on these types of research questions
  and activities. Like its predecessors, FroCoS 2017 seeks to offer a
  common forum for research in the general area of combination,
  modularization, and integration of systems, with emphasis on
  logic-based ones, and of their practical use.

  Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
    * combinations of logics (such as higher-order, first-order,
      temporal, modal, description or other non-classical logics);
    * combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving;
    * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability
      procedures, constraint solving techniques, or logical 
      frameworks;
    * combinations and modularity in ontologies;
    * integration of equational and other theories into deductive
      systems;
    * hybrid methods for deduction, resolution and constraint
      propagation;
    * hybrid systems in knowledge representation and natural
      language semantics;
    * combined logics for distributed and multi-agent systems;
    * logical aspects of combining and modularizing programs and
      specifications;
    * integration of data structures into constraint logic
      programming and deduction;
    * combinations and modularity in term rewriting;
    * applications of methods and techniques to the verification and
      analysis of information systems.

INVITED SPEAKERS
    - Katalin Bimbo (University of Alberta, Canada) (joint with TABLEAUX and ITP)
    - Jasmin Blanchette (Inria and LORIA, Nancy, France) (joint with TABLEAUX and ITP)
    - Cezary Kaliszyk (University of Innsbruck, Austria) (joint with TABLEAUX and ITP)
    - Cesare Tinelli (University of Iowa, USA)
    - Renata Wassermann (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil)

PUBLICATION DETAILS
  The proceedings of the symposium will be published in the
  Springer LNAI/LNCS series.

PAPER SUBMISSIONS
  The program committee seeks high-quality submissions describing
  original work, written in English, not overlapping with published or
  simultaneously submitted work to a journal or conference with
  archival proceedings. Selection criteria include accuracy and
  originality of ideas, clarity and significance of results, and
  quality of presentation. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 16
  pages in total, including references and figures.

  Papers must be edited in LaTeX using the llncs style and must be
  submitted electronically as PDF files via the EasyChair system at
  the following address:
 
        https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=frocos2017

  For each accepted paper, at least one of the authors is required to
  attend the symposium and present the work. Prospective authors must
  register a title and an abstract five days before the paper
  submission deadline. Further information about paper submissions is
  available at the conference website that can be found at the
  beginning of this call for papers.

WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS
  There will be a three-day programme of four workshops and four
  tutorials from 23-25 September. The co-located events are described at
  http://frocos2017.cic.unb.br/#colocated .

  24th April 2017: Abstract submission deadline
  28th April 2017: Full paper submission deadline
