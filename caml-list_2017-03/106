--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LPNMR Doctoral Consortium (DC) is to be held as part of the 14th  International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning (LPNMR 2017) in the Hanasaari Conference Center, Espoo, Finland,July 3-6, 2017. The DC will take place during LPNMR 2017 on a date to be determined. The DC provides a forum for doctoral students working in all areas related to logic programming and non monotonic reasoning. The DC gives students the opportunity to present and discuss their research and to obtain feedback from peers as well as world-renowned experts a supportive environment. 

The 14th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning (LPNMR) is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design, implementation and application of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those who work in the area of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR and its programmatic expression, Answer Set Programming, have roots in the famous special issue of AIJ in 1980, devoted to Nonmonotonic Reasoning.

During the DC, there will be significant time for students to present their work, and meet mentors from their own and closely related fields.

** Target Audience **

The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, though we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a Master's program and interested in doctoral studies). Students at any stage in their doctoral studies are encouraged to apply for participation in the DC, but preference will be given to students who have settled on a research topic or direction but still have some way to go in their studies.

Applicants are expected to conduct research in areas related to logic and constraint programming; topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

    - Theoretical Foundations of LPNMR systems, including semantics of new or existing languages, new language extensions, and computational complexity
    - Implementation of LPNMR systems, including new systems and algorithms
    - Applications of LPNMR

The DC allows participants to interact with established researchers and fellow students, through presentations, a poster session, question-answer sessions and social interactions. The Doctoral Consortium will provide the possibility to reflect - through short activities, information sessions, and discussions - on the process and lessons of research and life in academia. Each participant will give a short, critiqued, research presentation, present a poster at the main event and attend a lunch in small groups with their mentor/senior researcher.

** Application Process **

An application for participation in the LPNMR DC 2017 consists of a cover sheet, an extended abstract  of your (intended) research, a vita, a personal statement and a letter of recommendation (e.g., from your supervisor). All applications must be in English and submitted electronically via EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpnmrdc2017) by 4 April 2017. Detailed submission instructions are provided at the LPNMR DC 2017 website:

                   http://lpnmr-dc.cs.bath.ac.uk/

Applications will be reviewed based on several factors including the quality of the work submitted, stage of research, evidence of research progress, the committee's assessment of the student's contribution to and benefit from participating in the DC, and input from the student's advisor.

Details regarding publication of extended abstracts and financial support will follow at a later date.
