My experience with GSoC is that they look for a combination of breadth and =
preparedness, as well as selecting a few smaller organisations that are dif=
ferent every year.  I prefer mentoring in these internship programs for pro=
jects that use OCaml as a means rather than an end, as the language will im=
prove just by more people using its ecosystem and tools.  It's usually coun=
terproductive to expect interns to dive in and fix core compiler bugs, wher=
eas a larger percentage could very valuably get started on things like OPAM=
, js_of_ocaml or Mirage.

Mirage/Xen will definitely be putting in an application this year again, an=
d anyone interested in doing an OCaml related project is very welcome to ma=
il me a suggestion or add it directly to:
https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects <https://github.=
com/mirage/mirage-www/wiki/Pioneer-Projects>

It would be great to see an OCaml application as well, of course, although =
it might be time better spent organising a page that is maintained on an on=
going basis rather than just for the purposes of GSoC.

best,
Anil
