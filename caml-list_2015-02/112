My apologies -- there were a couple of typos in my original mail.  I meant =
that
we are testing *opam-repository* with the above versions, not OPAM itself (=
which can
be tested on a much bigger set of compiler versions).  Also, we are not cur=
rently
testing 4.02.0 with packages, just 4.02.1, as the slow compilation speed of=
 4.02.0
makes it impractical to do so.

I agree with this assessment, although I'll try to keep 4.00.1 as long
as possible to make it possible to have finer grained constraints and
make bisection tests easier.  Thanks for all the feedback, everyone!
