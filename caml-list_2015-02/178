Subject: [Caml-list] Description Logics 2015 - Call for Papers

DL 2015: the 28th International Workshop on Description Logics, DL 2015
=======================================================================
The DL workshop is the major annual event of the description logic research 
community. It is the forum at which those interested in description logics, 
both from academia and industry, meet to discuss ideas, share information and 
compare experiences.

The workshop will be held in Athens from June 7th to June 10th, 2015.

Submission of papers under review for a conference with a double-blind 
submission policy
======================================================================
Extended abstracts of papers that are currently under revision for a conference 
with a double-blind submission policy (e.g., IJCAI) should be submitted 
anonymously, i.e., without names in the pdf file, to avoid violations of the 
double-blind submission policy.  The names of the authors of such papers will 
not be revealed to the DL 2015 reviewers handling them.  All other papers 
should list the author names in the pdf file, as usual for DL.


Extended deadline
==============
Paper registration deadline: March 9, 2015 (extended from March 2, 2015)
Paper submission deadline: March 16, 2015 (extended from March 9, 2015)
Notification of acceptance: April 17, 2015
Camera-ready copies: May 8, 2015
Workshop: June 7-10, 2015


Workshop Scope
=============
We invite contributions on all aspects of description logics, including but not limited to:
* Foundations of description logics: decidability and complexity of reasoning, 
  expressive power, novel inference problems, inconsistency management, 
  reasoning techniques, and modularity aspects
* Extensions of description logics: closed-world and nonmonotonic reasoning, 
  epistemic reasoning, temporal and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, 
  query answering, reasoning over dynamic information
* Integration of description logics with other formalisms: object-oriented 
  representation languages, database query languages, constraint-based 
  programming, logic programming, and rule-based systems
* Applications and use areas of description logics: ontology engineering, 
  ontology languages, databases, ontology-based data access, semi-structured 
  data, graph structured data, linked data, document management, natural 
  language, learning, planning, Semantic Web, and cloud computing
* Systems and tools around description logics: reasoners, software tools for 
  and using description logic reasoning (e.g. ontology editors, database schema 
  design, query optimisation, and data integration tools), implementation and 
  optimisation techniques, benchmarking, evaluation, modelling


Invited Speakers
=============
* Carsten Lutz (TU Bremen)
* Axel Polleres (TU Wien)
* Maarten de Rijke (University of Amsterdam)


Submissions
==========
* Submissions may be either full papers of up to 11 pages (excluding 
  references) presenting original research or extended abstracts of at most 
  3 pages (excluding references). There is no page limit on the list of 
  references.
* All submissions must be formatted in the Springer LNCS style.
* Extended abstracts of papers under review for a conference with a 
  double-blind submission policy should be submitted anonymously.
* Extended abstracts are designed only for authors who wish to announce results 
  that have been published elsewhere, or which the authors intend to submit or 
  have already submitted to a venue with an incompatible prior / concurrent 
  publication policy. Papers presenting original research should be submitted 
  as regular submissions.
* A clearly marked appendix (e.g., with additional proofs or evaluation data) 
  may optionally be appended. It will be read at the discretion of the 
  reviewers and not included in the proceedings. It does not need to be in 
  LNCS format.
* Authors submitting extended abstracts are encouraged to include such an 
  appendix, with sufficient material (e.g. copy of the already published paper 
  or technical report) to judge the scientific merit of the work described in 
  the extended abstract.
* Submission page: http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dl2015
* Accepted papers and extended abstracts will be made available electronically 
  in the CEUR Workshop Proceedings series (http://www.CEUR-ws.org/).
* Accepted submissions, be they full papers or extended abstracts, will be 
  selected for either oral or poster presentation at the workshop. Submissions 
  will be judged solely based upon their content, and the type of submission 
  will have no bearing on the decision between oral and poster presentation.
