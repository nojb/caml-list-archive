                     Eleventh ICLP Doctoral Student Consortium
                    to be held in Cork, Ireland, 31 August 2015

                     http://dc-iclp15.cs.bath.ac.uk/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----

The ICLP Doctoral Consortium (DC) is the eleventh doctoral consortium to be=
 held as
part of the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015).=
 The
DC will take place during ICLP 2015 in Cork, Ireland. It provides a forum f=
or
doctoral students working in areas related to logic and constraint programm=
ing,
with a particular emphasis to students interested in pursuing a career in
academia. The DC gives students the opportunity to present and discuss their
research and to obtain feedback from peers as well as world-renowned expert=
s.

** Target Audience **

The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, thou=
gh we
are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a Master's program=
 and
interested in doctoral studies). Students at any stage in their doctoral st=
udies
are encouraged to apply for participation in the DC. Applicants are expecte=
d to
conduct research in areas related to logic and constraint programming; topi=
cs of
interest include (but are not limited to):

- Theoretical Foundations of Logic and Constraint Logic Programming
- Sequential and Parallel Implementation Technology
- Static and Dynamic Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Compilation Technol=
ogy,
  Verification
- Logic-based Paradigms (e.g., Answer Set Programming, Concurrent Logic
  Programming, Inductive Logic Programming)
- Innovative Applications of Logic Programming
- Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning
- Logic Programming and Causality
- Logic Programming Systems

Submissions by students who have presented their work at previous ICLP DC
editions are allowed, but should occur only if there are substantial change=
s or
improvements to the student's work.

The DC allows participants to interact with established researchers and fel=
low
students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussion=
s, and
invited presentations. The Doctoral Consortium will provide the possibility=
 to
reflect - through short activities, information sessions, and discussions -=
 on
the process and lessons of research and life in academia. Each participant =
will
give a short, critiqued, research presentation.

** Application Process **

An application for participation in the ICLP DC 2015 consists of a cover le=
tter,
a research summary, and a letter of recommendation (e.g., from your supervi=
sor).
All applications must be in English and submitted electronically via EasyCh=
air,
due to the application submission deadline 16 May 2015. Detailed submission
instructions are provided at the ICLP DC 2015 website:
      http://dc-iclp15.cs.bath.ac.uk/

The DC program committee will select participants based on their anticipated
contribution to the DC objectives. Students will be selected based on clari=
ty and
completeness of their submission package, relevance of their research area =
w.r.t.
the focus of ICLP, stage of research, recommendation letter, and evidence of
promise towards a successful career in research and academia, such as publi=
shed
papers or technical reports.

The works accepted for presentation at the DC will be published in conjunct=
ion
with the ICLP proceedings. Updates follow as soon as we have more informati=
on
regarding this.


** Participant Funding **

The Association for Logic Programming supports ICLP DC 2015 participants.
The registration for the ICLP conference will be covered. We hope to also b=
e able to
provide assistance with accommodation.

** Important Dates **
