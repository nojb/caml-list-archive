Subject: [Caml-list] TABLEAUX/FroCoS Call for Workshops

	    *** Apologies for multiple copies ***
				
                   FIRST CALL FOR WORKSHOPS
                     TABLEAUX/FroCoS 2015 

      The International Conference on Automated Reasoning with
               Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods

                              and

    The International Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems

          Wroclaw, Poland, September 20-25, 2015


GENERAL INFORMATION
   TABLEAUX 2015 and FroCoS 2015 will take place in Wroclaw, Poland, from
   September 20 to September 25, 2015. Workshops and tutorials will be
   held on September 19/20 and/or September 25. In the present call,
   we solicit proposals for workshops that are related to the two main
   conferences. Tutorials will be solicited in a separate call.
   Possible topics of workshops (the list is non-exhaustive) are: 

   * automated reasoning with analytic tableaux and other methods
     (theory and applications)
   * model checking and BDDs
   * light-weight, flexible theorem proving methods  
   * novel calculi for verification of mathematics and programs
   * classical and non-classical logics (modal, description,
     intuitionistic, linear, temporal, many-valued...)
   * combination of logics
   * implementation techniques: Data structures, efficient algorithms,
     performance measurement 
   * combination and integration methods in SAT and SMT solving 
   * combination of decision procedures, satisfiability  procedures,
     constraint solving techniques, or logical frameworks
   * combinations and modularity in ontologies, term rewriting,
     knowledge representation, natural language semantics, and other
     areas
   * application of theorem proving and combination methods
     in teaching, verification, or security analysis 

   The purpose of a workshop is to offer an opportunity for the 
   presentation of novel ideas, ongoing research, and to discuss the 
   state of the art of a given area in a less formal but more focused way 
   than at the main conferences. Workshops are also a good opportunity 
   for young researchers to present their own work in a friendly 
   atmosphere. The format of a workshop is left to the organizers, with 
   possible lengths being half a day, a full day, or two days.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION
   In order to submit a workshop proposal, please send a description 
   of one or two pages in pdf format by email to Hans de Nivelle 
   (nivelle@ii.uni.wroc.pl). 
   The proposal must at least contain the following information: 

   * title of the workshop
   * organizers + contact person 
   * expected number of participants 
   * whether the workshop is by invitation only or open. 
   * planned duration (1/2 day, 1 day, 2 days)
   * are there planned proceedings? 
   * special requirements?

   The deadline for submitting workshop proposals is

              *** MARCH 2 2015 ***.

   Workshop proposals will be reviewed by the TABLEAUX and FroCoS
   chairs Carsten Lutz, Hans de Nivelle, and Silvio Ranise,
   possibly with help of additional reviewers.
   Decisions will be made within three weeks. 

   Additional questions can be directed to any of the PC chairs
   (Carsten Lutz, Hans de Nivelle and Silvio Ranise).
