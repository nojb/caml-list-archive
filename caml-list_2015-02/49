Thanks for pointing me to the previous effort, Gabriel. Some of that
material could probably be reproduced in ocaml.org's wiki, though the
proposed projects obviously need to be updated.

Do we know why we were rejected in 2011? Was the ideas page just not
completed in time, or is it just a case of being rejected without being
told why?

for Summer 2016. (It&#39;s too early to tell but I&#39;m considering<br>

I will try to collect some nice GSoC ideas for OCaml and add them to<br>
the wiki page.<br>
