============================================================

                25th International Symposium on
       Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                         LOPSTR 2015

         Special Issue of Formal Aspects of Computing

            http://alpha.diism.unisi.it/lopstr15/

        University of Siena, Siena, IT, July 13-15, 2015
                (co-located with PPDP 2015)


DEADLINES
Abstract submission: April 6,  2015
Paper/Extended abstract submission: April 13, 2015

============================================================


The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development.  LOPSTR
is  open to  contributions in logic-based  program development in  any
language  paradigm.   LOPSTR  has a  reputation for  being  a  lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors  can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 25th International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis  and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2015) will be held at the University of  Siena, 
Siena,  Italy;   previous symposia were held in  Canterbury,   Madrid, 
Leuven, Odense, Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,  London, 
Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice,  Manchester,  Leuven, 
Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester. 
LOPSTR 2015 will be co-located with PPDP 2015 (International Symposium 
on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Both full
papers and extended abstracts describing applications in these areas
are especially welcome. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

    * synthesis
    * transformation
    * specialization
    * composition
    * optimization
    * inversion
    * specification
    * analysis and verification
    * testing and certification
    * program and model manipulation
    * transformational techniques in SE
    * applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application papers that describe experience with
industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).

 Paper/Extended abstract submission:                        April 13, 2015
 Notification:                                              May 25, 2015
 Camera-ready (for electronic pre-proceedings):   June 15, 2015
 Symposium:                                                 July 13-15,
2015


Submission Guidelines

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in 
English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
style. Each submission must include on its first page  the paper 
title; authors and their  affiliations;  contact author's  email; 
abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist 
the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Page numbers 
should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing 
their report. Submissions cannot exceed 15 pages including references 
but excluding well-marked appendices not intended for publication. 
Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers 
should be intelligible without them. 
Papers should be submitted via the Easychair submission website for 
LOPSTR 2015, which can be accessed through the website of LOPSTR 2015. 


Proceedings

The formal post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer 
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. 
Full papers can be directly accepted for publication in the formal 
proceedings, or accepted only for presentation at the symposium and 
inclusion in informal proceedings. After the symposium, all authors 
of extended abstracts and full papers accepted only for presentation 
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the light 
of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then, after another round 
of reviewing, these revised papers may also be published in the formal 
proceedings. 


Special journal issue

After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to
a  special  issue of  the  'Formal Aspects of Computing'  journal. The 
submissions to the special issue must be substantial extensions of the 
proceedings versions and will  undergo the usual journal reviewing 
process.
