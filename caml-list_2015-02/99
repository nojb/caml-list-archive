That's a good point.  We'll just have to keep 3.12.1 in the matrix until Je=
ssie rotates in and has a settling period.

if compiler_ver <=3D 4.00.0)

It does; just add a constraint on `ocaml-version` to the `patches` field.  =
For example, see:

https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/bitstring/bit=
string.2.0.4/opam#L14

Patches to backport 3.12.1 support to any 4.00+ package from users are welc=
ome.  They are minimally intrusive to users of newer compilers since the pa=
tches aren't applied unless the older compiler is used, so it's easier to m=
erge these into the OPAM-repository.
