Subject: [Caml-list] CADE-25 Final Call for Papers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS

25th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-25)
Berlin, Germany, 1-7 August 2015

http://www.cade-25.info

Key dates:

   16 February 2015 (abstracts)
   23 February 2015 (papers)
    
CADE is the major international forum at which research on all aspects of
automated deduction is presented. The 25th jubilee edition will feature
a special session on the past, present, and future of automated deduction
with 

  Ursula Martin      University of Oxford
  Frank Pfenning     Carnegie Mellon University
  David Plaisted     University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
  Andrei Voronkov    University of Manchester

as invited speakers. In addition, there will be invited presentations by

  Ulrich Furbach     University of Koblenz
  Edward Zalta       Stanford University
  Michael Genesereth Stanford University (joint with RuleML Symposium)


CALL FOR PAPERS

High-quality submissions on the general topic of automated deduction,
including foundations, applications, implementations, and practical
experiences are solicited.

* Logics of interest include propositional, first-order, equational,
  higher-order, classical, description, modal, temporal, many-valued,
  constructive, other non-classical, meta-logics, logical frameworks, type
  theory, set theory, as well as any combination thereof.

* Paradigms of interest include theorem proving, model building, constraint
  solving, computer algebra, model checking, proof checking, and their
  integration.

* Methods of interest include resolution, superposition, completion,
  saturation, term rewriting, decision procedures, model elimination,
  connection methods, tableaux, sequent calculi, natural deduction, as
  well as their supporting algorithms and data structures, including
  matching, unification, orderings, induction, indexing techniques, proof
  presentation and explanation, proof planning.

* Applications of interest include program analysis, verification and
  synthesis of software and hardware, formal methods, computational logic,
  computer mathematics, natural language processing, computational
  linguistics, knowledge representation, ontology reasoning, deductive
  databases, declarative programming, robotics, planning, and other areas
  of AI.

Submissions can be made in the categories regular papers and system
descriptions. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 15 pages for regular
papers and 10 pages for system descriptions. Submissions must be unpublished
and not submitted for publication elsewhere. They will be judged on
relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. System
descriptions should contain a link to a working system and will also be
judged on usefulness and design. Proofs of theoretical results that do not
fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input data of experiments
should be made available, via a reference to a website or in an appendix of
the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to consider this additional
material, but submissions must be self-contained within the respective page
limit; considering the additional material should not be necessary to
assess the merits of a submission. The proceedings of the conference will
be published in the Springer LNCS/LNAI series. Formatting instructions and
the LNCS style files can be obtained at 

http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

At every CADE conference the Program Committee selects one of the
accepted papers to receive the CADE Best Paper Award. The award
recognizes a paper that the Program Committee collegially evaluates as
the best in terms of originality and significance, having substantial
confidence in its correctness. Overall technical quality,
completeness, scholarly accuracy, and readability are also
considered. Characteristics associated with a best paper include, for
instance, introduction of a strong new technique or approach, solution
of a long-standing open problem, introduction and solution of an
interesting and important new problem, highly innovative application
of known ideas or existing techniques, and presentation of a new
system of outstanding power. Under exceptional circumstances, the
Program Committee may give two awards (ex aequo) or give no award.

At CADE-25 we also intend to award the best student paper (details
will follow).
