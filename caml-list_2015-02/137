This is the 77th mail sent from "announce@cs.ucy.ac.cy" that came through
my mailbox, all of them through caml-list@inria.fr, some of them also to
coq-club@inria.fr. As far as I can tell, almost none of the 77 announces
are relevant to the audience of those two lists.

announce@cs.ucy.ac.cy , would it be possible to remove those two
mailing-lists from your lists?
