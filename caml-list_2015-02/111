Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [opam-devel] OPAM: retiring 3.12.1 testing?

Thanks a lot for the detailed overview. I was indeed thinking it wouldn't be worth keeping both 4.02.0 and 4.02.1, but didn't know, for example, about 4.00.1. The first consequence of dropping e.g. support for 3.12.1 would probably be that incompatible packages are either not fixed, or not declared incompatible, which would lead to an error during compilation whenever OPAM tried to install them, instead of a clear message or a solution around that package/version if it exists.

Currently, according to the metadata, 561 of the 837 OPAM packages (67%) can be installed on 3.12.1, around 30 of which not at their latest version. The others either are not compatible or depend on an incompatible package.

OPAM itself (as opposed to the repo) will obviously keep compiling on 3.12.1 for the moment (the tests regularly help pick up an incompatible String.init or likewise)

Best,
Louis Gesbert -- OCamlPro
