   The 17th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods   
 
                        Call for workshops                          

                      http://icfem2015.lri.fr/

The ICFEM 2015 conferences invites workshops as satellite events.

* Program analysis
* Software verification
* Software model checking
* Formal approaches to software testing
* Formal methods for self-adaptive systems, for object and component
systems, concurrent and real-time systems, for cloud computing and
cyber-physical systems, for software safety, security, reliability and
dependability
* Tool development, integration and experiments involving verified systems
* Formal methods used in certifying products under international standards
* Formal model-based development and code generation
* Computer security
* Aeronautics
* Train control systems

The ICFEM 2015 workshops will be held immediately after the conference,
i.e., on Friday 6th of November, 2O15.
(If needed, two-day workshops can take place on Saturday 7th as well.)
