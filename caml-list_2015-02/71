Subject: [Caml-list] First Call for Papers, PxTP 2015

               The Fourth International Workshop on
            Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP)

                      http://pxtp15.lri.fr/

                August 2-3, 2015, Berlin, Germany

                         associated with CADE 2015

Important dates

  * Abstract submission: Thu, May 7, 2015
  * Paper submission: Thu, May 14, 2015
  * Notification: Tue, June 16, 2015
  * Camera ready versions due: Thu, June 25, 2015
  * Workshop: August 2-3, 2015

Background

  The PxTP workshop brings together researchers working on various aspects
  of communication, integration, and cooperation between reasoning systems
  and formalisms.

  The progress in computer-aided reasoning, both automated and interactive,
  during the past decades, made it possible to build deduction tools that
  are increasingly more applicable to a wider range of problems and are
  able to tackle larger problems progressively faster. In recent years,
  cooperation of such tools in larger verification environments has
  demonstrated the potential to reduce the amount of manual intervention.
  Examples include the Sledgehammer tool providing an interface between
  Isabelle and (untrusted) automated provers, and also collaboration of
  the HOL Light and Isabelle systems in the formal proof of the Kepler
  conjecture.

  Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of
  theoretical formalisms and practical tools to exchange problems,
  proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop strives to encourage such
  cooperation by inviting contributions on suitable integration,
  translation and communication methods, standards, protocols,
  and programming interfaces. The workshop welcomes the interested
  developers of automated and interactive theorem proving tools,
  developers of combined systems, developers and users of translation
  tools and interfaces, and producers of standards and protocols.
  We are interested both in success stories and in descriptions
  of the current bottlenecks and proposals for improvement.

Topics

  Topics of interest for this workshop include all aspects of
  cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or
  interactive. More specifically, some suggested topics are:

  * applications that integrate reasoning tools (ideally
    with certification of the result);

  * translations between logics, proof systems, models;

  * distribution of proof obligations among heterogeneous
    reasoning tools;

  * algorithms and tools for checking and importing (replaying,
    reconstructing) proofs;

  * proposed formats for expressing problems and solutions for
    different classes of logic solvers (SAT, SMT, QBF, first-order
    logic, higher-order logic, typed logic, rewriting, etc.);

  * meta-languages, logical frameworks, communication methods,
    standards, protocols, and APIs connected to problems, proofs,
    and models;

  * comparison, refactoring, and optimization of proofs;

  * practical experiences, case studies, feasibility studies;

  * applications relying on importing proofs from automatic theorem
    provers, such as certified static analysis, proof-carrying code,
    or certified compilation;

  * data structures and algorithms for improved proof production in
    solvers (e.g., efficient proof representations).

Submissions

  Researchers interested in participating are invited to submit either
  an extended abstract (up to 8 pages) or a regular paper (up to 15
  pages). Submissions will be refereed by the program committee, which
  will select a balanced program of high-quality contributions. Short
  submissions that could stimulate fruitful discussion at the workshop
  are particularly welcome. We expect that one author of every accepted
  paper will present their work at the workshop.

  Submitted papers should describe previously unpublished work, and must
  be prepared using the LaTeX EPTCS class (http://style.eptcs.org/).
  Papers will be submitted via EasyChair, at the PxTP'2015 workshop page
  (http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dpxtp2015). Accepted full
  papers will appear in an EPTCS volume.
