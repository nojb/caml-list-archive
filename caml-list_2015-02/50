Subject: Re: [Caml-list] GSoC preparedness

The feedback Sylvain got from Google at the time is that the idea page
should be, quote, "more well-organized and more fleshed out for the
students who would be visiting to get ideas".

(Note: Sylvain is now working at Google himself so is prevented by
company policy to work on organizing a new application.)

By the way, google employees may vouch for applications, and their
support may be helpful at the time of the actual application. Other
GSoc communities can also vouch, so we could consider asking eg. the
LLVM project for support. I think those are more like details that can
be discussed at the time of the actual application, say in January
2016.
