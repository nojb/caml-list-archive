What you've written implies that all projects should regard the OCaml
compiler itself. Is that the intention? Or could this support projects
using the OCaml language for other purposes? What other purposes? General
tools of use to the OCaml community, or just anything that happens to be
implemented in OCaml.

Thanks for providing a place to collect these ideas.
