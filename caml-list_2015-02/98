Debian's latest stable (Wheezy) has 3.12.1, and the next release Jessie has 4.01.0 and there is an RC1 installer for it, but AFAIK there is no fixed release date when Jessie becomes stable.
Would be nice to have 3.12.1 tests until Jessie becomes stable, but OTOH there are quite a few packages already that only build with >=4.x
and if one wants to build them on 3.12.1 they require some minor patches already.

Does OPAM support conditionally applying patches? (i.e. only apply patch if compiler_ver <= 4.00.0)

Best regards,
