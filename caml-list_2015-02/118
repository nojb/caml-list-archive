LOCATION


The city of Plzeň (Pilsen) is situated in Western Bohemia at the
confluence of four rivers. With its 170,000 inhabitants it is the fourth
largest city in the Czech Republic and an important industrial,
commercial, and administrative centre. It is also the capital of the
Pilsen Region. In addition, Pilsen won the title of the European Capital 
of Culture for the upcoming year 2015.


Pilsen is well-known for its brewing tradition. The trademark
Pilsner-Urquell has a good reputation all over the world thanks to the
traditional recipe, high quality hops and good groundwater. Beer lovers
will also appreciate a visit to the Brewery Museum or the Brewery itself.


Apart from its delicious beer, Pilsen hides lots of treasures in its core.
The city can boast the second largest synagogue in Europe. The dominant of
the old part of the city center is definitely the 13th-century Gothic
cathedral featuring the highest church tower in Bohemia (102.34 m). It is
possible to go up and admire the view of the city. Not far from the
cathedral is the splendid Renaissance Town Hall from 1558 and plenty of
pleasant cafes and pubs are situated on and around the main square.


There is also the beautiful Pilsen Historical Underground - under the city
center, a complex network of passageways and cellars can be found. They
are about 14 km long and visitors can see the most beautiful part of this
labyrinth during the tour. It is recommended to visit the City Zoological
Garden, having the second largest space for bears in Europe and keeping
several Komodo dragons, large lizards which exist only in a few zoos in
the world.


The University of West Bohemia in Pilsen provides a variety of courses for
both Czech and international students. It is the only institution of
higher education in this part of the country which prepares students for
careers in engineering (electrical and mechanical), science (computer
science, applied mathematics, physics, and mechanics), education (both
primary and secondary), economics, philosophy, politics, archeology,
anthropology, foreign languages, law and public administration, art and
design.
