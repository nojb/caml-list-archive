For yypkg/win-builds I've done a quick survey of what's in Linux
distributions. I was mainly interested in moving past 3.12.1
compatibility for my own code but found it undoable before the end of
this year or maybe early next year.

Ubuntu 12.04 has 3.12.1 and is still supported and widespread. 14.04 has
4.01.0 but isn't very old. Debian has a similar combination for its
versions. I think 4.02.0 wasn't picked by linux distributions with
long-term support (including RH if I'm not mistaken).

3.12.1 is really widespread and I think it has to be kept for a fairly
long time. 4.00.0 is basically never used. 4.01.0 is widespread and will
be widespread for some time. 4.02.0 is nowhere to be seen. I believe
4.02.0/1 and maybe 4.02.2 won't be picked up either (unless 4.03.0 takes
close to two years to be released).

I'd say: keep 3.12.1, 4.01.0, 4.02.whatever-is-the-most-recent (because
that's what ocamlers use) and trunk. Dump the others (i.e. 4.00.1,
4.02.0).
