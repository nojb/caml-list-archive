Subject: [Caml-list] ETAPS 2016 call for satellite events

  19th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
                              ETAPS 2016
             Eindhoven, The Netherlands, April 2-8, 2016
                      http://www.etaps.org/2016/
                    
                      Call for  Satellite Events

-- ABOUT ETAPS --

The European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
(ETAPS) is the primary European forum for academic and industrial
researchers working on topics relating to Software Science. ETAPS is
an annual event which takes place in Europe each spring since 1998.

The nineteenth conference, ETAPS 2016, will take place April 2-8, 2016
in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.

ETAPS main conferences will take place on April 4-7, 2016. They are:

+ ESOP: European Symposium on Programming,
+ FASE: Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,
+ FOSSACS: Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,
+ POST: Principles of Security and Trust,
+ TACAS: Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of 
  Systems.

-- SATELLITE EVENTS --

The ETAPS 2016 organizing committee invites proposals for satellite
events (workshops etc.) that will complement the main
conferences. They should fall within the scope of ETAPS. This
encompasses all aspects of the system development process, including
specification, design, implementation, analysis and improvement, as
well as the languages, methodologies and tools which support these
activities, covering a spectrum from practically-motivated theory to
soundly-based practice. Satellite events provide an opportunity to
discuss and report on emerging research approaches and practical
experience relevant to theory and practice of software.

ETAPS 2016 satellite events will be held immediately before and after
the main conferences, on April 2-3 and April 8, 2016.

-- ARRANGEMENTS FOR SATELLITE EVENTS --

The organizers of an ETAPS 2016 satellite are expected to:

+ create and maintain a website for the event,
+ form a PC, produce a call for papers for the event (if appropriate),
+ advertise the event through specialist mailing lists etc. to
   complement the publicity of ETAPS,
+ review the submissions received and make acceptance decisions,
+ prepare an informal (pre)proceedings for the event (if appropriate),
+ prepare the event's program complying with any scheduling constraints 
  defined by the ETAPS 2016 organizing committee,
+ prepare and organize the publication of a formal (post-)proceedings 
  (if desired).

The ETAPS 2016 organizing committee will:

+ promote the event on the website and in the publicity material of 
  ETAPS 2016,
+ integrate the event's program into the overall program of the 
  conference,
+ arrange registration for the event as a component of registration 
  for ETAPS, collect a participation fee from the registrants,
+ produce a compilation USB memory stick of the informal (pre-)
  proceedings of the satellite events of ETAPS 2016 and distribute 
  this to the registrants,
+ provide the event with a meeting room of an appropriate size, 
  A/V equipment, coffee breaks and possibly lunch(es).

As a rule, ETAPS will not contribute toward the travel or
accommodation costs of invited speakers or organizers of satellite
events.

-- SUBMISSION OF SATELLITE EVENT PROPOSALS --

Researchers and practitioners wishing to organize satellite events are
invited to submit proposals to the workshop co-chairs Julien Schmaltz
and Erik de Vink using this web form.

A proposal should not exceed two pages and should include:

+ the name and acronym of the satellite event,
+ the names and contact information of the organizers,
+ the duration of the event: one or two days,
+ the preferred period: April 2, April 3, April 8 or April 2-3,
+ the expected number of participants,
+ a brief description (120 words approximately) of the event topic for 
  the website and publicity material of ETAPS 2016,
+ a brief explanation of the event topic and its relevance to ETAPS,
+ an explanation of the selection procedure of contributions to the 
  event, the PC chair and members, if known already, information about 
  past editions of the event, if applicable,
+ any other relevant information, like a special event format, invited 
  speakers, demo sessions, special space requirements, etc.,
+ a tentative schedule for paper submission, notification of acceptance 
  and final versions for the (informal pre-)proceedings (the ETAPS 2016 
  organizing committee will need the final files by March 12, 2016),
+ the plans for formal publication (no formal publication, 
  formal proceedings ready by the event, formal post-proceedings, 
  publication venue - EPTCS or elsewhere).

The proposals will be evaluated by the ETAPS 2016 organizing committee
on the basis of their assessed benefit for prospective participants of
ETAPS 2016. Prospective organizers may wish to consult the web pages
of previous satellite events as examples:

ETAPS 2015: http://www.etaps.org/2015/workshops
ETAPS 2014: http://www.etaps.org/2014/workshops
ETAPS 2013: http://www.etaps.org/2013/workshops
ETAPS 2012: http://www.etaps.org/2012/workshops

-- IMPORTANT DATES --

Satellite event proposals deadline: March 29, 2015.

Notification of acceptance: April 2, 2015.

-- VENUE --

ETAPS 2016 will take place at the Campus of the Eindhoven University
of Technology. Eindhoven, located in the south of the Netherlands,
has a small international airport, Eindhoven Airport, with direct
connections to various destinations in Europe. The main airport of the
Netherlands is the Amsterdam Airport, Schiphol. Schiphol has a direct
train connection to Eindhoven.
