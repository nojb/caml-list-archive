Hey everyone

Another year has gone by, and Google Summer of Code is upon us again.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we're ready to participate this year
either (sign up dates for mentoring organizations are Feb 9th to the 20th).
After seeing some comments on reddit, I have taken the liberty of
establishing 2 pages on the ocaml.org wiki:

- GSoC ideas (https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/GSoC-ideas): this is
a list of ideas for projects that students could do. It needs to be filled
up and then maintained, so that by next year at least, we actually have
something to show google.

- GSoC Application (https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/GSoC-application):
a hastily filled out application covering the questions google expects
answered. This should also be maintained so that it's pretty much ready to
go.

Please fill out these pages as much as you can -- particularly the ideas
page. I haven't listed any project ideas myself, but I tried to write some
guidelines for the kinds of things that could be used as projects.

-Yotam
