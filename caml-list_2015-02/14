Subject: [Caml-list] Option to have source code printer also print comments.

--001a11c3c516c99e0c050e27ebbc
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Comments are nicely tracked in `last_comments` within `lexer.ml`. I think
it would be nice to have `compile.ml` pass these comments to the source
code pretty printer. I wouldn't mind if it always printed comments or if
there were another flag to control whether or not comments were printed.
The work to plumb the comments to the pretty printer is pretty trivial and
I'm happy to send a pull request. Actually printing the comments is easy
but requires a ton of tedious changes to the pretty printer. It makes sense
to make the pretty printer more customizable, and just having the comments
accessible at that point seems like a good idea.

Would the pull request to plumb the comments to the pretty printer be
likely to be accepted?
