Subject: [Caml-list] OPAM: retiring 3.12.1 testing?

Dear OCaml list,

We are currently testing the following compiler versions on every pull requ=
est to OPAM;

- OCaml 3.12.1
- OCaml 4.00.1
- OCaml 4.01.0
- OCaml 4.02.0

We will shortly have to test 4.02.1, and would also like to test trunk snap=
shots of the
compiler as an "allowed failure".

Running 6 compiler revisions per package puts quite a bit of stress on our =
Travis CI
resources, and so it's probably time to retire OCaml 3.12.1 from the testin=
g matrix.

Before we do this, I'd like to get a sense for how many people still care a=
bout ensuring
that their packages work well on the 3.12.1 series, or if there are still d=
istributions
for which this support matters.  If there is still sufficient interest, we =
can continue
to support 3.12.1 for some time.

thanks,
Anil=
