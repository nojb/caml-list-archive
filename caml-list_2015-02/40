currently have job openings for four PhD researchers (PhD students) in
Software Technology. Each of these positions involves some degree of
functional programming.

We are looking for PhD students to work on some
of the following topics:

* Version control of structured data
  The theory and practice underlying structure-aware version control
  systems capable of handling more than just text files.

* Intelligent tutoring technologies
  Technologies for tutoring subjects such as functional programming,
  statistics, algebra, etc.

* Serious games
  Domain-specific languages and technologies for specifying strategies
  for serious games.

* iTasks
  iTasks is a formalism for specifying distributed tasks. Specify and
  test properties of iTasks, and give run-time feedback for iTasks.

Besides research, the successful candidate will be expected to help
supervise MSc students and assist teaching courses.  We prefer
candidates to start no later than September 2015.

candidate should be proficient in reporting scientific
findings. Knowledge of and experience with at least some of the
following areas (depending on the topic chosen to work on for your
PhD) is essential:

* functional programming, such as Haskell or ML;
* datatype generic programming;
* intelligent tutoring systems;
* serious games;
* strategies, rewriting, parsing;
* modern version control systems such as git, mercurial, or darcs.
