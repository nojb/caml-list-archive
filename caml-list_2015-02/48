Subject: Re: [Caml-list] GSoC preparedness

Thanks for starting this discussion.

I've been considering the idea of preparing an OCaml GSoC application
for Summer 2016. (It's too early to tell but I'm considering
volunteering as a mentor for 2016, while I already know very well that
this would be impossible for 2015.)

The previous effort led by Sylvain Le Gall and Cristophe Troestler was
in 2011. You can find what they collected here:
  https://forge.ocamlcore.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/gsoc-team/index.php/Main_Page

I will try to collect some nice GSoC ideas for OCaml and add them to
the wiki page.
