hi,

I'm thinking about targeting a compiler to ocaml's runtime system, and
I thought it might be handy to be able to disassemble a compiled
object file to see how the ocaml compiler handles certain constructs,
thereby obtaining a better feel for the machine's instruction
set.  Before I start writing code, I wonder, has anyone else attempted
such a thing?
