Hi,
	Am I right that in Caml/O'Caml, exceptions and open statements
always occur at top-level (by top-level I mean not in a let .. in
block)?  What I mean is: in SML one can say

let open List 
    exception LocalExc of string in
  (* in here List is open and I can use LocalExc *)    

There doesn't seem to be any equivalent in Caml.  Just checking if I'm
missing something.  I realize that the scope of "open" and exception
can be limited to a structure, but I was looking for an even smaller
scope.  Thanks.

Adam
