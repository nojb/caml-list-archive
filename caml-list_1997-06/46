Subject: Problem with linking num libary under VC5.0
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Sender: weis

I have been experimenting with OCaml under Windows NT.
Using Visual C++ 5.0 I have been unable to build a top-level
including the num library.   The prescribed incantation
fails with linker errors:

ocamlmktop -custom -o uncaml.exe nums.cma %CAMLLIB%/libnums.lib
LIBC.lib(crt0dat.obj) : error LNK2005: __cinit already defined in
LIBCMT.lib(crt
Error while building custom runtime system

LIBC.lib(crt0dat.obj) : error LNK2005: _exit already defined in
LIBCMT.lib(crt0d
at.obj)
...

Presumably something has changed in the libraries between
VC4.0 and VC5.0 that breaks libnums.lib. Curiously,
the Unix lib links just fine.  Can anyone suggest
a work-around?

Andrew
