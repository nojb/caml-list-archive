debian package include source dependencies, and you are true, it is the work
of the package maintainer to provide those, aided by the numerous bug reports
we get from the porters if the build dependencies are bad.

That said, normally each package has listed in it's INSTALL/README the
dependencies, though in an informal way.

Maybe a kind of more formal dependency listing would be nice, which would be
shared by all ocaml related sources, and may then be filled in the
corresponding debian/rpm control files.
