I believe your permissions are wrong.  I can't tell you what algorithm to 
use to determine the permissions number, but I know it has to include some 
bits for the file type (plain file, socket, pipe, directory, etc.)

When I want 0644 I use 33188.  That's all I can tell you.  I found that 
number by looking at the ST_MODE return value of the stat(2) call on a 
regular file that i knew was 0644 :)
