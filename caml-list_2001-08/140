Dumb observation. It seems to me that a lot of the simpler 
marshalling problems -- tree-like structures with no closures -- can 
be handled using a tool like the Zephyr project's ASDL (abstract 
syntax description language).

I believe it has a mode to emit Caml, in addition to SML, Haskell
and Java. This ought to be able to handle a lot of cases with no
risk of core dumps. Code generation is a pain, of course, but it 
seems to me to be preferable to core dumps.
