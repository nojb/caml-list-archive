I'm one of those Python/Perl refugees (I knew both before I knew O'Caml,
actually) and I can definitely agree that I would find it ridiculous to
spend any amount of time learning a new (not only new, but *inferior* in
many regards) regexp syntax and interface when Pcre already exists for
O'Caml.  I can't see any reason why it shouldn't be in the stock
distribution; I know that I won't be using O'Caml and regular expressions
together without it.
