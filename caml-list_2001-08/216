What is the current status of dynamic loading? I've seen a lot
of implementations for Unix, and it shouldn't be too difficult to
port them to Win32 (I tried it once), although it requires some design
choices. Are there plans to add it in the near future?

:-).

I'd like to point out that this would make it possible to add lots
functionalities without too much trouble. For example, user ids work
in the Unix implementation, but have no real meaning in the Win32 one.
Turn them into an abstract type and you can simply use Win32 SIDs!
(Of course, you have to provide some more functions to compare them,
...)
Another instance is that of inodes. I'd be possible to use the Win32
file index, but it's a 64 bits value and really doesn't fit in the
int type.
