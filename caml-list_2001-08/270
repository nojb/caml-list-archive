That's exactly what I mean.

Please read my reply to Gerd. I'm not suggesting throwing away anything,
in fact I suggest adding stuff. In case it wasn't clear, I meant to have a 
high level "LCD" module for generic OS stuff (call it GenerOS, or VirtuOS 
for virtual OS :), *and* have Unix, Windows, Mac, BeOS, Amiga (OK,
now I'm just being silly :) modules for those APIs. If you really want to 
get extreme there could be multiple Unix modules for each Unix variation, 
and multiple Windows and Mac modules for each variation of those OSes, but 
I think OS, Posix, Windows, Mac, etc should be sufficient.

Honestly, I haven't spent much time pondering the matter. :-)
