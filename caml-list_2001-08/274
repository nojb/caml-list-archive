Here's what I ended up with.  Works from the command line even, and
functions more or less like "errors to browser" in Perl.  In practice, I'd
probably do some matching on 'value', and Do The Right Thing, i.e. maybe
request user input ala CGI.pm, but this at least works.  :)

open Printf;;
open Cgi;;

let value =
	try
		parse_arguments default_config;
		argument_value("foo")
	with
		Not_found -> "key not found";
		| Failure x -> "Failure: " ^ x;;
	
header "text/html";;

printf "<html><body>foo: %s</body></html>" value;;
