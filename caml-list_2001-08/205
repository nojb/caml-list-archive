I fully second this. Though I wouldn't mind PCRE being integrated
into the standard distribution, I'd strongly prefer a convenient and
safe packaging system. This is actually the top entry on my wish list,
because I consider this the feature that would most likely make OCaml
attractive to the mainstream.

Today there are _plenty_ of OCaml-libraries floating around for the most
varied purposes. Still, each of them comes with a non-standard way of
installation (if at all...!). This is a _severe_ obstacle to exploiting
the merits of free software development.

I agree.

Development of "social tools" would certainly be very beneficial for
industrial use: fewer hassles for employed programmers, more available
software, potentially more OCaml-programmers that can be hired, etc.
I don't think it would be terribly expensive to let somebody do it. The
Consortium should be very interested in funding such efforts.
