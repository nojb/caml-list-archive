Hm, I'm not really fond of the C++ syntax in htmlgen.  ocamlhtml looks more
like something familiar, i.e. more Perlish.

Nice features in both, but what I'm really thinking of is something that
would:

- parse an XML dtd for HTML version X.XX

- provide the usual HTML generating functions for _valid_ tags, attributes

- raise an exception when the dtd was violated (compile time type
  checking?)

- provide higher level functions for higher level structures (might get
  tricky, but something clever enough to work within the dtd ought to be
  possible, no?)

This means I'll probably have to do it myself. :)  So, would PXP be the
place to start for a dtd parser?  Comments, suggestions, warnings, pointers
to existing wheels?
