Subject: [Caml-list] Different types of streams

Is there any deep reason to have two incompatible types of streams in the
same Caml type: those built using [< >] expressions and those built with
Stream.from Stream.of_channel? I can not see anything in the source code,
and I indeed managed to modify it to remove this distinction. It has a
small cost: I had to add an `index' field in the gen structure, because the
global `count' field could not be used anymore, and of_stream streams are
slower by about 5%. But I think the stream type would be really more useful
like that.
