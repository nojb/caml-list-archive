Exception are like others concrete type in OCaml the only difference is
that them are introduced with the keywork "exception".
When you define an exception you may define it with a variable number of
arguments; exception like "Stack_overflow" are exception with no
argument, exception like "Sys_error" are exception with one argument, in
particular "Sys_error" have one string argument (this is because the
same exception is used to report a lot of different errors).

In "try ... with" constructor, the "with" clause use a pattern matching
on the exception returned by the "try" clause that return an "Exception
of string" that is not matched by your pattern of the form "Exception".
You have to use something like:

try
  ...
with Sys_error ->
  print_string ...

Hope this helps ...

Cheers
