Why?

The Perl install routine works just fine alongside the Debian one.
When I'm installing a Perl module from source, the dependencies it is
looking for can come either from other modules I have installed the
same way, or from Debian packages.  It doesn't care, and that's how it
should be.

Once again, the thing to remember is: the dependencies we're talking
about in this thread are _for installation from sources_, when the
modules hasn't yet been packaged in the native OS form.  The initial
packaging is a special case of such source installation.
