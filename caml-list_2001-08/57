The current MIPS code generator is for the newer version of the MIPS
architecture as found on the R4000 and later processor, i.e. the one
that has 32 64-bit float registers and some 64-bit integer operations.
The R3000 in your Decstation implements an older version of the MIPS
instruction set, hence the errors you got.

Up to OCaml version 2.00, the MIPS back-end supported both the R4000
under IRIX and the R3000 under Ultrix.  The latter was removed in 2.01
because we didn't know of anyone still using an R3000 machine.
You could try to resurrect the R3000/Ultrix port as a R3000/NetBSD port,
but I'm not quite sure this is worth the effort...
