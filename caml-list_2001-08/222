As far as I know, RPM/DEP focus on binary installations, and source packages
exist only to conveniently make binary packages. This means: Someone already
has reviewed the package and decided which versions to take.

For a CPAN-like system, the primary goal is to simplify installations from
source. This is far more complicated because typically nobody has checked which
package versions (reliably) work together. As pointed out in my last mail,
there is no definite algorithm, and at most it would be possible to find some
heuristics working in many cases.

But this doesn't mean that CPAN isn't possible for Caml. It only means: Don't
begin with a fully automatic installation routine, and lower your goals. It
would be already great if we had a standard package format and a standard
procedure to install packages, even if we would have to call it manually (at the
beginning).
