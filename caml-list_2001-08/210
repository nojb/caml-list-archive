I agree, from a pragmatic point of view a better regexp matcher would make OCaml 
significantly sexier to all of those poor deluded Python and Perl programmers. 
The other stuff can come later. I think Markus has a very good point about 
some distutils (Python) like facility being even more important. Once such
a framework is in place we can have an OCaml CPAN. Last time I looked findlib 
ran only on Unix, which is a big problem. 

On the subject of "social tools", the program Neel is looking for is this one 

http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ocamlweb/index.en.html

and Hevea of course. There is also OCamlDoc, which seems quite nice too,
but ocamlweb is used in a few more libraries I think.

A better apporach might be to ape Python and the SML Basis Library by providing a 
generic "OS" module which abstracts at least Unix/Win/Mac away. I would
prefer this, since I feel silly using Unix.<blah> on a Windows box :-).
