Just to complement the detailed replies already made on this list:
OCaml would happily grow the stack until all the available memory
(physical and virtual) is exhausted.  However, excessive stack
consumption is often the sign of a programming error (recursion that
misses the base case), and exhausting all the memory before reporting
it is not nice, so OCaml implements a soft limit on the size of the
stack.  By default, it's 1 megabyte, but it can be changed from the
command line (the CAMLRUNPARAM variable) or even from within the
program or the interactive system:

        Gc.set {(Gc.get()) with Gc.stack_limit = 4 * 1024 * 1024}

The above bumps the limit to 4 mega-words (16 mega-bytes), and is
enough to run the Queens example with size 12.

Hope this helps,
