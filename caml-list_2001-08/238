For operating systems with POSIX signals, it should work. You need an
(empty) SIGCHLD signal handler.

For other operating systems, things may be different. Historically, the BSD
systems automatically restarted system calls instead of reporting EINTR, and
you needed to set a flag to avoid that. However, current BSD systems base on
POSIX signals, too, and restarting does not happen.

The caml runtime tries to find out whether POSIX signals are available, and
uses them if possible. If not, it falls back to ANSI-C signals which don't
specify what to do.

So your problem depends on the OS, and on whether the caml runtime thinks that
POSIX signals are available or not. You can check the latter by looking into
config/s.h (after calling "configure" on the caml sources) and
checking whether POSIX_SIGNALS is defined.
