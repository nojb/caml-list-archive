Character number, actually.

Right.  OCaml has a peculiar way of treating positions in source code:
on parsing, it remembers minimal information (absolute character
numbers in the input, regardless of # lineno "filename" directives),
and it's only when an error is detected that it re-scans the input to
convert the character numbers into file name + line number.

This works well for error reporting, but causes problems with
"assert", the compiler-generated "Match_failure" exceptions, and
certain uses of Camlp4.

All this will have to be addressed at some point, although it's rather
painful to do right.
