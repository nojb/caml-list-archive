No, wrong way.  I want to publish a control implemented in caml to the outside world.  Parsing C is not involved.  Printing a bunch
of C is.

Note that this is easier than the reverse: C header files are underspecified and need a markup language (MIDL, SWIG) to make stub
generation well defined.  mli files on the other hand have everything you need to interface to C or something else.
