[Ohad is referring to Unix.getsockopt and Unix.setsockopt, which don't
work in the Windows version of OCaml 3.02.]

Generally speaking, packaging a distribution of OCaml takes a lot of
my time, so I'd rather not do that too often.  Besides, we've already
started the development of 3.03, meaning that there is some new code
that needs to stabilize before the next release.  Hence, no, there
will not be a bug fix release for 3.02 in the near future.

I'd recommend you just stick with 3.01 for Ensemble.  We always keep
available on the Web and FTP servers a number of earlier releases.
Unless, of course, there is also a show-stopper bug for Ensemble in
3.01; in this case, please write me directly and we'll see what we can
do.

Best wishes,

- Xavier Leroy
