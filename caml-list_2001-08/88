No, that is not true, i have uploaded a ocaml 3.02 to unstable, and i hope the 
camlp4 maintainer will do so also soon (if not, just submit a bug report against
it, and if that don't help, i will do a NMU of it).

I have also planned to package ledit, but a disk crash came in the way, and was
rather busy since then. I don't think the licence problem is unsolvable, if there
is any (don't remember, will check again).

That said, debian has not yet freezed the boot floppies nor the policy, and
until the policy is not finalized, there cannot be a package freeze. Next will come,
if i am right, the base and essential package freeze, and planned for begin of
september the package freeze. But since the boot floppy freeze had some delay, the
package freeze will more probably be around october, in anyway this is far enough
time for an update to all the ocaml stuff.

Friendly,

Sven Luther
