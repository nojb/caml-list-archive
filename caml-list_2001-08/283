Well, but the debian packager of the perl stuff, altough i didn't looked at it
in detail, will have to do the stuff needed to disable those dependencies in
the build system, and implement the debian one instead. Same goes for rpms and
others. 

So what i, as a debian packager of various ocaml stuff, was asking, was to
also have an _easy_ way of disabling the builtin dependency stuff, and use the
OSes dependencies in place, and maybe a compatible dependencies format, in
order to just be able to copy it to the packages control file. 

That said, i don't know what kind of dependencies you are speaking about, if
it will be only between ocaml stuff, or also outside libraries needed by your
packages (like gtk+ for lablgtk/mlgtk for example), and if you want to
maintain versionned dependencies on these.

Well, but don't forget about apt-get source -b package_name, which, if your
apt is new enough will hapilly download the source package from the debian
repository as well as all the needed source dependencies, and rebuild the
package on your system. This, altough debian specific, is something akin to
what you want, isn't it ?
