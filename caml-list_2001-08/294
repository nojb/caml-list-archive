Subject: [Caml-list] lexer disambiguation?
Message-ID: <20010831140925.U2959@ip178.usw22.rb1.bel.nwlink.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0

Sender: owner-caml-list@pauillac.inria.fr
Precedence: bulk

since the lexer looks like an ordinary ocaml function (more or less), does
the disambiguation boil down to:

1. the longest series of bytes that matches a single rule
2. match the first rule in the function that matches #1

and mechanically, if the input looks like:

some series of bytes ¥99¢  @#%#@$   with newlines

does it do a pattern match on (assuming whitespace is a token):

s(* match some rule *)
so(* match some rule *)
som(* match some rule *)
some(* match some rule *)
some (* match some rule, and also the whitespace rule, so do the some rule,
then repeat matching starting with the concatenation of the leftover ' '
and the next byte *)
