     RELEASE_NOTES for Ensemble version 1.10

Author: Ohad Rodeh
Last updated: 31/07/2001

CHANGES

1. The socket library was rewritten so as to be compatible with
   the OCaml Unix library. This allows ML programs to freely
   intermix code and data structures from the Ensemble Socket library
   with code written for the Unix library.

2. Final touches for the security code. The diamond rekey protocol, and
   the key-tree rekey protocol are complete. All known security holes have
   been plugged. The system should now be completly secure, please send us
   any possible attack scenarios.

3. Port to WIN2000 is complete. In fact, the code works better on WIN2000
   than on NT.

4. Revised all the makefiles.

5. Various bug fixes:
   - Thread race conditions in maestro were fixed.
   - 15 second delays while merging.
   - And many others ...
