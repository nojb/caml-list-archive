No, its a side-effect of side-effects.
It is due to the so-called value restriction, which for some
reason beyond my momentary comprehension is needed to be able to
type programs with side-effects. Section 5.1.1 of the introduction
by Hickey (linked to from the Ocaml homepage under "On-line Tutorials"
explains exactly your problem.

# let id2 x = (id id) x;;
val id2 : 'a -> 'a = <fun>

should work.

Yours, Florian.
