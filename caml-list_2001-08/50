	Yes you can: it works for non-negative arguments.
And you can always roll your own function that works as you desire
for negative ones:

	let mymod x y = 
		if ((x mod y) as r) < 0 
		then r + y 
		else r

which works for negative x provided the result is in the range

	 y .. -1

This way, YOU choose whether you want a deterministic result
for non-negative values (use mod, its fast), or are willing
to pay extra for determinism for negative values.

But I agree with you anyhow. :-)
