These would all be very nice, I agree, but I also think we need something better
than str and sooner than all these things could be implemented.  Maybe some kind

While were on the subject of beginner usability, it seems to me that if dynamic
loading of c-libraries is still a ways off, it might be nice to build the unix
module into the toplevel at install time.
