The makefiles work fine for me on vanilla NT cmd.exe.  To get them to build on Win95 (no &) I had to change them to use a secondary batch file, but that also works fine.  Here's an example line:

        for %i in ($(OTHERLIBRARIES)) do docdmake "otherlibs\%i" "..\.." $(MAKEREC) installopt

And docdmake.bat looks like this:

cd %1
%3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
cd %2

But, if you only care about building on NT, then it works fine with cmd.exe.
