I am the implementor of the streams. Actually, I have never been interested
in the streams themselves, but more in parsing. I would have preferred that
streams were just a couple of functions: (unit -> 'a) * (unit -> unit) where
the first function returns the first element of the stream and the second
function throws the first element away.

I am not sure that streams built with [< >] are so interesting, especially
if they are destinated to a real parser.
