John, David, and everyone else on this list,

Please don't post this kind of message ("my OCaml program crashed,
what's happening?") to caml-list.  You're just annoying 500
subscribers who can't do anything about it.  And even the Caml
developers who are on the list can't do anything about it either as
long as you don't provide a complete program that reproduces the
crash.

Here's how to proceed in this case:

0- Make sure that your program doesn't use unsafe features of OCaml:
   unchecked array and string accesses, Obj and Marshal functions,
   external C functions.  If it does, look hard at those parts of your
   code and convince yourself that the bug is not there.

1- Package a program that reproduces the crash.  It doesn't have to
   be small -- it's often hard to reduce a crash to a one-page fragment,
   and it's often not necessary.  But make sure you include test inputs
   and commands that reproduce the crash.

2- Send a bug report to caml-bugs@inria.fr.  If your package is large,
   better include a URL than attach it to your bug report, as our
   bug tracking system truncates large messages and doesn't handle
   attachments gracefully.  Or, e-mail caml@inria.fr with your code
   attached.

If you follow those three easy steps, you can rest assured that the
Caml developers will investigate the issue quickly, and if it turns out
to be a bug in OCaml, they'll fix it.  

If you don't, there is essentially nothing we can do to help you...

Thanks for your attention,

- Xavier Leroy
