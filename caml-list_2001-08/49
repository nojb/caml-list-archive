	But be warned! As a professional programmer ..
I am no longer employable. I just can't deal with
working in a C++ environment where Ocaml would do the job
so much better. I'm a 3 year -- hard core -- addict.
After learning Ocaml, you may need to sacrifice your
time -- and ethics, if you actually care about productivity --
to continue to work in industry.

	Perhaps in 5 years, you will be a highly sought after
specialist who can implement complex tasks in half the time
a team of 10 C++ programmers can. And perhaps you will
be lucky, and have the freedom to design your own (Ocaml)
solutions to problems, without being constrained by the
ignorance of others. I have been lucky twice, to write
Ocaml and get paid for it, so it isn't impossible ..

	Just be warned. Ocaml is dangerous.
Its just too good.
