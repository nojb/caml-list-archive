The CPAN module does it; see perldoc CPAN.

For O'Caml the corresponding functionality would be much harder because
of possible version conflicts. Say you have packages A and B already installed,
and A depends on B. Furthermore, you want to install package C, but package C
requires the new version B'. For Perl, this is less dramatic than it seems to
be because everything is dynamic, and the packages can themselves cope with
version conflicts. For Caml, a clever automatic installer must decide:

- Does the already installed package A work with the new version B'? If yes, 
  is it necessary to recompile package A?

- If package A must be renewed, too: Is there a version A' that works with B'?

- If there are other packages that depend on A: Is it necessary to
  recompile/relink them?

Because these questions are difficult, findlib does not include versioned
dependencies (but it includes versions as such, and dependencies as such). So
it requires still an intelligent operator that helps finding the right versions.

One feature that should be added is automatic recompilation of dependent
packages (from known sources).
