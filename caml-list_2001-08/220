One danger in developing such a system is that you'll wind up duplicating the
rather extensive functionality of existing package management systems.  RPM and
DEB both handle these kinds of dependencies and are fairly complex systems for
it.  CPAN has its shortcomings, but it also works suprisingly well most of the
time.  I think you should at least consider taking a "worse-is-better" approach
and build something that works and leave the delicate dependency management to
the distribution packagers.
