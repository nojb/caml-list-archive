I have downloaded the examples from 

	http://caml.inria.fr/Examples/oc.tar.gz

These look very nice and informative for a beginner, thanks very much,
but ...

Running the queens and queens_lazy basic examples in OCamlWin gives 
a stack overflow with board size of 12 x 12.   The queens_lazy 
example is set-up to do 12 x 12, so it crashes right out of the box.

Does OCaml often produce such errors?  Is there a trick to preventing
these errors that was overlooked in writing these examples?

My computer is WinNT 4.0, SP6 with 128MB of ram.  I am running the
from the binary distribution pcaml-3.02-win.exe.
