Taking into account Neel Krishnaswami's advice that it would be actually
helpful to mail my questions to the list, I'm sending some.

I hope I don't end up irritating people!=20

Hi,

Thanks!

Well, here's a few things I don't understand right now.

try=20
 let chan =3D open_in "foobar"
with Sys_error ->
 print_string "error opening file\n";;

This doesn't work. I think it might be because the stuff in the first
part doesn't evaluate to the same type as the stuff in the second part.
I also wonder if it might have something to do with how in the
documentation, lots of exceptions are described as, for example
	exception Stack_overflow
but for Sys_error it says
	exception Sys_error of string

Why does it say, when I type into the toplevel,
	Sys_error;;
that the constructor expects an argument?

Collin

Howdy,

I can try to answer some of your questions, but I won't guarantee that I
know a terrible amount. ;)  I'm also using linux, so any non-linux
OS-specific stuff I won't be able to answer.
