This could also be construed as an instance of "function" being a bad
idea, or at least, a little confusing to beginners. It's confusing because 
it takes an implicit argument. If match had been used, I don't think 
this would have happened. In the Revised syntax of CamlP4 function is 
omitted (for other reasons I think). While I stumbled a bit at first with
function, I use it a bit now.
