A new release of FORT (Framework for Ocaml Regression Testing) has been
made available at:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/fort

FORT provides an environment for testing programs and Objective Caml
modules.  It contains a module that oversees the testing process as
well as a front-end for executing tests.  Individual test cases are
written as Objective Caml functions that return the result of
executing the test.

Check it out, and let me know how you think it can be improved!
