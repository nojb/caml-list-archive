The good thing about CPAN the module, and really the whole Perl build
and install scheme, when it works, is precisely that it eases
installation of tarballs [1] _which are not (yet) available_ in the
native OS binary form; and it does this in a way that doesn't conflict
with the OS installation.  That is, the distinction it makes between
INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLSITELIB.

I believe this point is really fudamental to the Perl scheme, and is
really what people mean when they use the term "CPAN" in this thread.
To behave like that, yes we do need formal dependencies in the
tarballs, completely independent of the dependencies an OS packager
might add at the time of creating a binary package, and exploited in a
uniform way by the tarball installation process (even if it is only
for a check target, as Perl does it).

I think the present findlib already does this, when configured
properly; let's keep this functionality whichever way Ocaml
build/install is eventually implemented.


[1] I intentionally use the term "tarball" here to emphasise the
distinction from "packages" which are things the OS maintainer (not
the software author) makes.
