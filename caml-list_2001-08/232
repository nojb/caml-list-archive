For the CDK, we are currently looking for a standard way of packaging
libraries in the CDK, so that contributors will be able to easily
submit new libraries and upgrade them in the CDK. For that, we are
waiting for the adoption of a common documentation tool for all ocaml
software (this might happen soon with the ocamldoc system of Maxence
Guesdon), that will provide at least all formats already provided by
cdkdoc (HTML, man, info, ps).

Moreover, contributors can already add and upgrade their library to
the CDK, by downloading either the sources or the CVS version, and
compiling their package inside the sources.
