At the risk of making a fool of myself in public, is there such a thing as
insertion in a list at all in Ocaml? From what I have seen there is only
concatenation of a single element and a list (::), and operations would have
to be defined with this by means recursion/iteration. If this is the case, I
assume insertion at some point in a list would have O(n) complexity in the
general case? If not, what am I missing (@ being something other than I
think?)

Lars Nilsson
