Yes, I'm just beginning too, but between the two of us we can probably do a couple good examples.  I'm working on transforming an array of 3D vectors, since it's a trivial thing to measure performance- and readability-wise.  It's also kind of non-functional by nature, but there are ways of making it functional (map, etc.).  I'm also comparing the performance to C code, so I'll have a nice set of examples and transformations on the initial codes to make them faster and/or more functional.
