The developers of the Teyjus-implementation of LambdaProlog have tried
very hard to develop better ways of handling bindings, especially what
concerns higher-order unification - this is a highly performance-critical
aspect of LambdaProlog, which allows reasoning about higher-order abstract
syntax. They could surely contribute valuable input on their experience.
Some interesting papers on this topic can be found on their sites.

The main architects of Teyjus and LambdaProlog (Gopalan Nadathur and
Dale Miller):
