Thank you for the precision, but I took it for ganted that the type
(scheme) assigned by the type-checker to the new identifier was
compatible with the (rebound) identifier's type scheme (more precisely
if x has type scheme sigma and you redefine x with type scheme sigma',
then sigma' must be more general than sigma). Otherwise the idea of
redefinition is pointless since any thing can occur after a
redefinition and the language becomes unsafe.
