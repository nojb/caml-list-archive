As a member of the SML Basis Library committee, my answer is quite simple.
The SML Basis Library is a specification, and does not specify that
mathematical functions should be implemented in ML.  For the most part, the
specification puts as few constraints as possible on implementations.  I'm
pretty certain that MLWorks implemented these functions in C.
