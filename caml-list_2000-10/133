I looked at that, but I really wanted to do the actual operations in caml code, not in a library (if possible).  So, I'd like to write an LU decomposition routine in caml that's as fast as C code (or close enough), for example.  Going out to another language is inconvenient at best, compared to just writing down the code you want (like you would in C).
