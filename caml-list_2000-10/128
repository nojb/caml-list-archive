Not sure yet, since I haven't written a large program yet.  It looks like the Gc module gives you some control over this?  How bad does it get in real-sized apps?  A short pause is not bad if I can control when it happens (level load time, etc.).

Oops, sorry, that was (Sys.max_array_length / 2) / 3 for 3D vectors, I forgot that I'd divided by 3.  Anyway, what's the nature of the limitation?  That is, why can't I have an array the size of memory?  I assume you're using bits in the index or the pointer or something?

Any ideas as to how hard it would be to recompile the compiler to generate 32bit floats?
