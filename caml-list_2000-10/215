Indeed, this discussion started because of an uncaught "Not_found".
Most likely, this is raised by Hashtbl.find, List.assoc, or
String.index (there are a few other).  Knowing exactly which one is
unlikely to help very much.

I don't like the idea of adding run-time information just for the case
when you cannot run the debugger, especially if it incurs a lot of
overhead.  IMO, it would be more interesting to make the debugger work
for embedded code.

In the short term, static analysis seems to be the way to go.
