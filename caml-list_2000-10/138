Thanks for the README.
 Pierre mentioned he is going to port the examples to Ocaml.

They also may not be a good entry point for total newcomers.
The examples from the CamlLight distribution seem like the right
type. Simple yet complete enough to see a combination of
different topics (loops, input from user, etc..).

Need for more volunteers?
It is a cycle. The easier we make it for new people to join, the
more people we have to help with the documentation.

Yes. Much of the documentation would make much more sense if one
had a few examples to read. This is particularly the case for
the syntax of functions on the Standard Library (Chaper 19 of
the Ocaml Manual)
