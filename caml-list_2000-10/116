Uh, speaking for myself, I think this comment is a really good way to turn off people interested in exploring ocaml.  There's a difference between "my mind is reeling" and "I'm trying to figure out where I need to put a damn semicolon".

The fact of the matter is that there is a certain amount of logistical stuff one has to do to get a program to compile in any new language.  We're (or I am) asking for examples of that in the main docs.  I had to go download a bunch of sample programs from unrelated sites to see how to do it.

You can take that as constructive criticism or you can decide my mind is reeling and write it off.  Your choice.

Chris
