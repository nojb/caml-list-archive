People seem to be confusing "language" and "implementation".  MLWorks (a now
defunct implementation of SML) implemented "pop" semantics by "pushing" a
handler onto the stack, which enabled debugging of the stack from the
debugger.  (Then again, MLWorks code couldn't be called from C, so Ohad's
case couldn't arise).  Other implementations of SML may well report the line
number where the exception occurred: this is definitely a useful feature.

List, 
  I'd like to point out, that my application (LARGE OCaml project) is
embedded in C code, so one cannot use the OCaml debugger to replay and
find the exception.  I'd be happy if a feature would be added to the
language to point out which line in the code the exception came from (I
understand this was added to SML ?).

	Ohad.
