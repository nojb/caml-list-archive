>I would want single floats for space, not speed!

On today's architectures, size == speed.  

Single precision is also still faster for things like divides, sqrts, and whatnot.  And, as someone mentioned, the SIMD instruction sets are single precision only (at least until Wilamette).  But yes, size is the biggest issue.  

I'm going to check out the Bigarray package and see how it performs, though.
