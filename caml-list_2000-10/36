This sounds interesting! - May I ask what optimisations are considered?
Will there be documentation for the (new) intermediate representation on
which optimisations operate? It would be really important to have
information about side effects there, too.

I could imagine playing around with such representations in LambdaProlog
(extremely convenient for prototyping transformation systems). I don't know
whether anything useful will come out, but it may be fun - for others as
well.

Best regards,
