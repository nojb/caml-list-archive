| At the end of the day, I'm not that big a fan of *either* deBruijn or
| named presentations of terms... both are pretty ugly to work with, in
| different ways.  In fact, I find both distressing and fascinating that,

| such an unsatisfactory state wrt. binding.

Absolutely!  I'm not a big fan of either technique, but in fact
GHC uses the named presentation.  I did find a pretty nice
way of dealing with name capture.  The story is in 
   http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/inline.ps.gz
Nothing very radical, but these things are mostly folk lore.
If there are other similar writeups I'd be interested to hear
of them
