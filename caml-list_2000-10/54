Hope you will not get the dark sides of both worlds!

You're right.

Still, I fooled a supposed ``perfectly debugged'' partial evaluator
with my first higher-order example (admittedly not a simple but a
rather subttle program, that forces you to recursively insert
lambda-terms and beta-reduce them, and could exercise your De Bruijn
indices lifter in a non standard way ...).
