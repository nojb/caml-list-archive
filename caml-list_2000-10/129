I guess I'd really like to be able to do as much in Caml as possible.  I could definitely write libraries in C for this, but it'd be really cool if Caml itself performed well enough that I didn't need to do that except in the most extreme cases.  I'm doing some simple performance tests now relative to C and I'll post the results when I'm done.
