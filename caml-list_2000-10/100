You could try something like:

let build_transformer f x =
    List.concat (List.map f x)

let (>>) t1 t2 x =
    t1 (t2 x)

let mirror = build_transformer (fun x -> [x;x])
let plus1  = build_transformer (fun x -> [x+1])
let none   = build_transformer (fun x -> [])


(mirror and none are not generalized since their definition
is expansive)
