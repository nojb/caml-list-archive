	What does the '&' mean? Do you mean '@' ??
Assuming [] @ b, then this is a 'x list for some 'x,
and thus can be compared with [] which has type 'y list
for some 'y, and we can set 'x = 'y.

That one is easy: the type of a is 'x list, and that of b is 'x list
list.
You cannot compare a 'x list with a 'x list list.
