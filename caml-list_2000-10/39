Right, I actually tried that, but the "even point" was too high -- as
I wrote in our web page, my translator produced too complex Caml
programs, and ocaml{c,opt}{,.opt} often aborted after several minutes,
saying "out of registers" or "out of memory" or something like that...
I should probably have modified the translator to produce simpler
programs, but I didn't have the time to do that.
