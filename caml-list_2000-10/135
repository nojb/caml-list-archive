So, I'd like to write an LU decomposition routine in caml that's as fast as C code (or close enough), for example.  Going out to another language is inconvenient at best, compared to just writing down the code you want (like you would in C).

But even 32 bit floats cannot be represented as an unboxed ML value, since
you need at least 1 other bit to tell you that it's not a pointer. (Otherwise
the precise GC will get confused.) This could of course be remedied if
Caml switched to a conservative GC, but then GC performance would
go down the drain.
