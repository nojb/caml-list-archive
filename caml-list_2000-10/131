Problem is that the parsing of the language becomes highly context
dependant, since interpretation of expression depends on the infix
declaration context. This is rather unfortunate when you want to have
separate compilation.

Now we may have decided to remove all the infix alphanumeric
identifiers, but we failed to find good infix symbols for all the
operations.
