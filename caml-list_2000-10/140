Yeah, I downloaded these a while back, but haven't taken a look yet.  I was happy to find them.  I will mostly be using the OpenGL bindings in my experiments.

Oh, I didn't know about the alternate syntax!  Is that hacked directly into the compiler?  It's not possible to define that sort of thing in the language, is it (it's not in bigarray.mli)?  I also didn't know the functions were inlined from the library...that's key.  I thought bigarray was just a normal library, not a special case.  

Just curious, are any of the other libraries similarly special cased?  In other words, if I wanted to write the library myself without touching the compiler, which libraries in the standard set would I not be able to write?
