Exactly.

I think if we create them it would be much easier for us to ask
someone to include a link and then everyone will be happy. :-)

Of course I am just getting into undertanding Ocaml, so I may
provide some semi-trivial to start and then as I advance I can
produce better examples.

Also a lot of the examples are school/math theory oriented
(factorial, fibonaci, etc...) instead of simple examples which
anyone could understand even if they have little/no mathematical
background.
