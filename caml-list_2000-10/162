> Ah, thanks!  Is there any way to do it without the "and"?  In other words, what if I want to do this but the types are defined "far away" from each other in the source.  The "and" solution works, but I'm looking for something like forward declarations from C++:

There is no good solution. But may be the following can help you:

type 'bar foo = B of 'bar
...
type bar = F of bar foo
