I think this can be done now. Here is the method: to have a type t
and a class c mutually dependent, for example:

	class type c = object x : t end
	and type  t = C c | Null

write

	class type c' ['t] = object x : 't end
	type t = C t c' | Null
	class type c = t c'

and you have it. In other words, abstract out the types from
the classes by making them type parameters, declare the types,
using appropriately instantiated class types, and then name the
required class instances.

As far as I can see, this always works, and thus shows
(constructively) that mutual recursion between classes and types
can be supported.
