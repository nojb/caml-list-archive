Substituting single floats for double float would be a chore (I tried
and gave up).  But on machines where doubles are 64 bits and a packed
pair of singles is 64 bits, how hard would it be to generalize float
to allow any of the 64 bit arithmetric types (ie double floats,
pairs of single floats, pairs of 32 bit longs, quads of 16 bit shorts,
etc)?

Machines with multimedia instruction sets do compute over single floats 
faster than double floats when the single floats are packed into a 64 bit 
pair of singles or a 128 bit quad of singles.

They dont do conversion for packed floats and twice as many singles 
fit into a cache as do doubles.
