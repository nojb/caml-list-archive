About that specific point, I would say that the reference manual is not
very clear on how to use this replay feature. More precisely, how to go
to the point where the exception is raised? I was once trapped in this
unknown origin exception issue, and I did not succeed in using replay.

Maybe a little example in the Ref. Manual or the FAQ would be useful, as
I'm not the first one to be caught by this problem?

Best regards,
