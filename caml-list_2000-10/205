I'm not the OP, but this can of course be implemented by having an
additional (hidden) field in the exception which contains the source
co-ordinate.

I'm not sure how expensive this would be. But it would be useful to have,
at least as a compiler option. I suppose raising of an exception is
expected to be slow anyway, as opposed to installing an exception
handler.
