Subject: toplevel listing of modules?

Hello list,

I have a question: is there a way to get a list of all
(types|values|modules|...) that are currently available in the toplevel?
Is there a way to get a list of all the stuff in a module?

One of the things I like in Python is that if you have a module `os', then
`dir(os)' will get you a list of all stuff that is in `os'.  
This is great for interactive experiments with a new module.
Is there something similar in O'Caml?

Greetings,

Stephan
