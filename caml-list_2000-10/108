I think the ocaml docs are good, but I must agree with the original poster about one thing: there is a lack of small example programs that are meant to be _compiled_.  That is, most of the examples use interactive mode.  A few examples in particular would be good:

1.  a single file ocaml program, and exactly how it's compiled with ocamlc and ocamlopt
2.  a two file example, and how it's compiled (the .mli thing confused me for a while)
3.  an example that uses an external C function

Since I wrote exactly these things, perhaps I should contribute them?  I just found a lot of subtle things that were different between the interactive sessions and trying to write real code.

PS.  Should the reply-to header on list messages be set to the list so threads don't accidently go private if somebody doesn't reply-all?
