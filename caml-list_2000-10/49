I don't actually use De Bruijn indices so often (because I usually use
higher-order abstract syntax whenever appropriate), but anyway...

this inconvenience can be mitigated by including _both_ a name (for
human use) and an index (for machine use) in each variable, and

such errors in lifting, shifting, etc. of De Bruijn indices are much
easier to find than those in alpha-conversion, because they lead to
immediate problems (which occurs in simple programs) rather than
subtle ones (which occurs in only programs that "shadow" variables in
particular ways).
