Looks very nice! Do you think this would be a good route towards getting
ocamlbuild working seamlessly on windows?

Hello,<br>
<br>
I&#39;d like to announce the first release of bos:<br>
<br>
```<br>
Bos provides support for basic and robust interaction with the operating sy=
stem in OCaml. It has functions to access the process environment, parse co=
mmand line arguments, interact with the file system and run command line pr=
ograms.<br>
<br>
Bos works equally well on POSIX and Windows operating systems.<br>
<br>
Bos depends on Rresult, Astring, Fmt, Fpath, Logs and the OCaml Unix librar=
y.<br>
It is distributed under the ISC license.<br>
```<br>

<br>
Bos can be seen as improved Sys module for programs and scripts that have l=
ight OS interaction requirements. Inspired by the excellent work of scsh [0=
], it seems this path has been pursued more than once in OCaml for example =
with cash [1] or shcaml [2].<br>
<br>
Bos however has a slightly different take on this. It does not try to recov=
er the shell&#39;s terseness or processing model but rather tries to overco=
me the shell&#39;s brittleness in face of errors, error reporting and insan=
e quoting conventions. The difference between a script and a program is an =
artificial one and bos tries to encourage you to write programs that do not=
 fail obscurely and evolve gracefully from a quick, small one (a.k.a &quot;=
script&quot;) to a complex one (a.k.a. &quot;program&quot;) while keeping g=
ood usability for the end user who is the one who eventually gets processin=
g failures in the face.<br>
<br>
This first version number is intentionally low, as I don&#39;t see bos as f=
ully finished at the moment. Some interfaces could be tweaked and other add=
ed in the future (feedback and discussion on the issue tracker is welcome).=
 I did however already write a few programs/scripts that make use of most o=
f the features provided by the library, so the low number should not be int=
erpreted as &quot;alpha&quot; quality software. What is provided here shoul=
d work as described and if it doesn&#39;t, scream on the issue tracker.<br>
