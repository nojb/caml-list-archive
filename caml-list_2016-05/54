=========================
Vampire 2016: The 3rd Vampire Workshop
July 2, 2016, part of IJCAR 2016
Coimbra, Portugal

http://easychair.org/smart-program/Vampire2016/Overview.html

=========================


CALL FOR PAPERS
=========================

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission deadline: May 27, 2016
Notification of acceptance: May 31, 2016
Final paper submission: June 15, 2016
Workshop day: July 2, 2016

WORKSHOP AIM:
The workshop aims at discussing the development and use of the first-order
theorem prover Vampire. The workshop will address the newest trends in
implementing first-order theorem provers, and focus on new challenges and
application areas.

Workshop participants will include both Vampire developers and users and
provides a convenient opportunity for interesting discussions between tool
developers and users. The users can learn more about Vampire and its recent
developments. The developers can learn more about the use of Vampire, its
efficiency in various application areas and needs of the users.

The workshop is going to to shed the light on on problems such as

- what is essential for substantial progress in theorem proving tools;
- what are the best implementation principles to be used;
- what are the best heuristics and strategies, depending on application areas;
- both successful and unsuccessful case studies;
- missing features in modern theorem provers.

The workshop will also overview the most recent advances made in Vampire.

PAPER SUBMISSION:
We seek submissions reporting on theory, application, case studies,
experiments and work-in-progress using Vampire and other theorem provers
in various applications. Submissions can be in any form, ranging from work
in progress to completed work. For example, the users can submit:
- extended abstracts or full papers;
- theoretical papers;
- experimental papers and case studies
- or in general any papers that can benefit tool developers and users.

Papers can be of any length, ranging from 2-page abstracts to full papers
up to 20 pages in length. The papers should use the EasyChair LaTeX,
Microsoft Word, or ODT templates, which can be found at: 

    http://www.easychair.org/publications/epic-templates.

Submissions should be made using EasyChair, via the link : 
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vampire2016

The workshop proceedings will be published in the EasyChair EPiC series.
