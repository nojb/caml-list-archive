RV 2016
16th International Conference on Runtime Verification
September 23-30, Madrid, Spain

http://rv2016.imag.fr


Scope

Runtime verification is concerned with monitoring and analysis of software =
and hardware system executions. Runtime verification techniques are crucial=
 for system correctness, reliability, and robustness; they are significantl=
y more powerful and versatile than conventional testing, and more practical=
 than exhaustive formal verification. Runtime verification can be used prio=
r to deployment, for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and aft=
er deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security and for provid=
ing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair. Topics =
of interest to the conference include:

- specification languages
- specification mining
- program instrumentation
- monitor construction techniques
- logging, recording, and replay
- runtime enforcement, fault detection, localization, containment, recovery=
 and repair
- program steering and adaptation
- metrics and statistical information gathering
- combination of static and dynamic analyses
- program execution visualization
- monitoring techniques for safety/mission-critical systems
- monitoring distributed systems, cloud services, and big data applications
- monitoring security and privacy policies

Application areas of runtime verification include cyber-physical systems, s=
afety/mission-critical systems, enterprise and systems software, autonomous=
 and reactive control systems, health management and diagnosis systems, and=
 system security and privacy.


Invited Speakers

The program of RV 2016 will feature invited talks from:

Gul Agha (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA)
Oded Maler (CNRS and University of Grenoble-Alpes, France)
Fred B. Schneider (Cornell University, USA)


Overview

RV 2016 will be held September 23-30 in Madrid, Spain. RV 2016 will feature=
 the first summer school on Runtime Verification (September 23-25), two wor=
kshop days (September 26-25), and three conference days (September 28-30).


General Information on Submissions

All papers and tutorials will appear in the conference proceedings in an LN=
CS volume. Submitted papers and tutorials must use the LNCS/Springer style.=
 At least one author of each accepted paper and tutorial must attend RV 201=
6 to present the paper. Papers must be written in English and submitted ele=
ctronically (in PDF format) using the EasyChair system. The below page limi=
tations include all text and figures, but exclude references. Additional de=
tails omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked =
appendix that will be reviewed at the discretion of reviewers.

Research Papers Track

Research papers can be submitted in two categories: regular and short paper=
s. Papers in both categories will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the =
Program Committee.=20

Regular Papers (up to 15 pages) should present original unpublished results=
. Theoretical papers, system and application papers as well as case studies=
 on runtime verification are all welcome.=20
The Program Committee of RV 2016 will give a best paper award. A selection =
of accepted regular papers will be invited to appear in a special issue of =
the Springer Journal on Formal Methods in System Design.

Short Papers (up to 6 pages) may present novel but not necessarily thorough=
ly worked out ideas, for example emerging runtime verification techniques a=
nd applications, or techniques and applications that establish relationship=
s between runtime verification and other domains. Accepted short papers wil=
l be presented in special talk (15 minutes) and poster sessions.

Tool Papers Track

The aim of the RV 2016 tool track is to provide an opportunity for research=
ers and practitioners to show and to discuss the latest advances, experienc=
es and challenges in devising and developing reliable software tools for ru=
ntime verification. All tool papers will be reviewed by at least 3 members =
of the Tool Committee. An author of each accepted tool paper should give a =
15-20 minutes demonstration during the conference.

All tool papers must include information on tool availability, maturity, se=
lected experimental results and it should provide a link to a website conta=
ining the theoretical background and user guide. Furthermore, we strongly e=
ncourage authors to make their tools and benchmarks available with their su=
bmission.
We encourage tool papers to include a script in an appendix (not included i=
n the page count) describing how the demo will be conducted during the conf=
erence presentation with screenshots presenting step-by-step the tool=E2=80=
=99s capabilities, highlighting the main characteristics and the usage.

Tool papers can be submitted into two categories:=20

Regular Tool Papers (up to 8 pages). A tool paper in this category should p=
resent a new tool, a new tool component or significant and novel extensions=
 to existing tools supporting runtime verification. Each submission should =
be original and not published previously in a tool paper form.
Tool Exhibition Papers (up to 4 pages). A tool paper in this category can h=
ave been previously published. A tool paper in this category should be orie=
nted towards the tool usage and is an opportunity for the developers to pre=
sent them at RV 2016.


Tutorial Track

Tutorials are two-to-three-hour presentations on a selected topic. Addition=
ally, tutorial presenters will be offered to publish a paper of up to 20 pa=
ges in the LNCS conference proceedings.

A proposal for a tutorial must contain the subject of the tutorial, a propo=
sed timeline, a note on previous similar tutorials (if applicable) and the =
differences to this incarnation, and a biography of the presenter. The prop=
osal must not exceed 2 pages. Tutorial proposals will be reviewed by the Pr=
ogram Committee.
