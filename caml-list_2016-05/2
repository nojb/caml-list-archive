                     ======== TFP 2016 ===========

           17th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
                            June 8-10, 2016
                  University of Maryland, College Park
                          Near Washington, DC
                          http://tfp2016.org/


The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
presenting the latest research results, and other contributions (see
below). Authors of draft papers will be invited to submit revised
papers based on the feedback receive at the symposium.  A
post-symposium refereeing process will then select a subset of these
articles for formal publication.

TFP 2016 will be the main event of a pair of functional programming
events. TFP 2016 will be accompanied by the International Workshop on
Trends in Functional Programming in Education (TFPIE), which will take
place on June 7nd.


== INVITED SPEAKERS ==

TFP 2016 is pleased to announce keynote talks by the following two
invited speakers:

* Ronald Garcia, University of British Columbia: "Static and Dynamic
   Type Checking: A Synopsis"

* Steve Zdancewic, University of Pennsylvania: "Type- and
   Example-Driven Program Synthesis"


== HISTORY ==

The TFP symposium is the heir of the successful series of Scottish
Functional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in
    * Edinburgh (Scotland) in 2003;
    * Munich (Germany) in 2004;
    * Tallinn (Estonia) in 2005;
    * Nottingham (UK) in 2006;
    * New York (USA) in 2007;
    * Nijmegen (The Netherlands) in 2008;
    * Komarno (Slovakia) in 2009;
    * Oklahoma (USA) in 2010;
    * Madrid (Spain) in 2011;
    * St. Andrews (UK) in 2012;
    * Provo (Utah, USA) in 2013;
    * Soesterberg (The Netherlands) in 2014;
    * and Inria Sophia-Antipolis (France) in 2015.
For further general information about TFP please see the TFP homepage.
(http://www.tifp.org/).


== SCOPE ==

The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various
routes.  As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore
identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles
are solicited in any of these categories:

Research Articles: leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
Position Articles: on what new trends should or should not be
Project Articles: descriptions of recently started new projects
Evaluation Articles: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project
Overview Articles: summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject

Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for
publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of
functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or
experience-oriented.  Applications of functional programming
techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the
symposium.

Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:

      Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
      Functional programming in the cloud
      High performance functional computing
      Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
      Dependently typed functional programming
      Validation and verification of functional programs
      Debugging and profiling for functional languages
      Functional programming in different application areas:
        security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
        systems, global computing, grids, etc.
      Interoperability with imperative programming languages
      Novel memory management techniques
      Program analysis and transformation techniques
      Empirical performance studies
      Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
      (Embedded) domain specific languages
      New implementation strategies
      Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of
TFP, please contact the TFP 2016 program chair, David Van Horn.


== BEST PAPER AWARDS ==

To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper
accepted for the formal proceedings.

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new
subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state
that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed
as first authors, and a student would present the paper. A prize for
the best student paper is awarded each year.

In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the
best paper happens to be a student paper, that paper will then receive
both prizes.


== SPONSORS ==

TFP is financially supported by CyberPoint, Galois, Trail of Bits, and
the University of Maryland Computer Science Department.


== PAPER SUBMISSIONS ==

Acceptance of articles for presentation at the symposium is based on a
lightweight peer review process of extended abstracts (4 to 10 pages
in length) or full papers (20 pages). The submission must clearly
indicate which category it belongs to: research, position, project,
evaluation, or overview paper. It should also indicate which authors
are research students, and whether the main author(s) are students.  A
draft paper for which ALL authors are students will receive additional
feedback by one of the PC members shortly after the symposium has
taken place.

We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. Papers must be submitted at:

    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2016

Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS
style. For more information about formatting please consult the
Springer LNCS web site:
