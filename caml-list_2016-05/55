Scope

The main goal of this 13th edition of the CIBB international conference is =
to provide a multi-disciplinary forum open to researchers interested in the=
 application of computational intelligence, in a broad sense, to open probl=
ems in bioinformatics, biostatistics, systems and synthetic biology and med=
ical informatics. Cutting edge methodologies capable of accelerating life s=
cience discoveries will be discussed. Following its tradition and roots, th=
is year's meeting will bring together researchers from the international sc=
ientific community interested in advancements and future perspectives in bi=
oinformatics and biostatistics. Also, looking at current trends and future =
opportunities at the edge of computer and life sciences, the application of=
 computational intelligence to system and synthetic biology, and the conseq=
uent impact on innovative medicine will be of great for the conference. The=
oretical and experimental biologists are also invited to participate in ord=
er to present novel challenges and foster multidisciplinary collaboration.

The scientific program of CIBB 2016 will include Keynote Speakers, tutorial=
s and special sessions. Contributed papers will be presented in plenary ora=
l sessions, special sessions, or poster sessions.

Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference (at least one author is=
 expected to register), and will be published on proceedings for conference=
 distribution. Extended and revised versions of the papers presented at CIB=
B 2016 will be invited for a post-conference monograph. This is traditional=
ly published in the Springer series of Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNB=
I), (arrangements undergoing). Continuing the tradition of CIBB, we are pla=
nning to publish best papers in one (or more, as appropriate) special issue=
 of an international scientific journal (such as BMC Bioinformatics, in the=
 latest editions).

=20

Paper Submission

Papers must be prepared following the guidelines illustrated on the CIBB we=
b site and should be long between 4 and 6 pages.

Papers should be submitted in PDF format on the Easy Chair conference syste=
m (link available on the web site).
