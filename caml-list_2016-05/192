Subject: [Caml-list] [ANN] Topkg 0.7.0

Hello (last one today, promised),

I'd like to announce the first release of topkg. For those who know topkg, =
it is no longer an embedded script but a library that you add as a build de=
pendency to your package. It now also comes with an optional tool that help=
s you to manage your package and make swift and correct releases.

Bla bla bla:
```
Topkg is a packager for distributing OCaml software. It provides an API to =
describe the files a package installs in a given build configuration and to=
 specify information about the package's distribution creation and publicat=
ion procedures.

The optional topkg-care package provides the `topkg` command line tool whic=
h helps with various aspects of a package's life cycle: creating and lintin=
g a distribution, releasing it on the WWW, publish its documentation, add i=
t to the OCaml OPAM repository, etc.

Topkg is distributed under the ISC license and has **no** dependencies. Thi=
s is what your packages will need as a *build* dependency.

Topkg-care is distributed under the ISC license and depends on fmt, logs, b=
os, cmdliner and opam-lib.
```

Install: opam install topkg topkg-care
Homepage: http://erratique.ch/software/topkg
API docs & manual: http://erratique.ch/software/topkg/doc/Topkg.html#basics
See also `topkg help release` and `topkg help`

A few things worth noting:

* Topkg pretends to work on Windows (provided your build system does) but e=
arly users may need to give a hand, please do report issues if things go wr=
ong.

* Topkg pretends to be able to work with hg source repositories, the same a=
s for Windows applies.

* Topkg should be able to work with other build systems than ocamlbuild. Bu=
t a few things (e.g. documentation support or dependency linting) do at the=
 moment rely on ocamlbuild being used. It's not my priority but I'm not aga=
inst improving it to make it easier to use with other build systems.

* Topkg only supports OCaml from 4.01 on and hence will also impose this li=
mit on your packages.

* Topkg has toy, proof of concept, support to publish documentation and dis=
tributions via GitHub's pages and release system. I'm personally not using =
this so do not hesitate to report broken or suboptimal behaviour. Better su=
pport =E2=80=94 especially gh issue interaction for 'topkg issue' and bette=
r authentication would be nice, but is left in the hands of a motivated git=
hub user. Someone should develop and distribute a good github topkg delegat=
e (e.g. using ocaml-github) that github users can install; see 'toy-github-=
topkg-delegate --help' and 'topkg help delegate'; the source of the toy del=
egate [1] can be used as a blueprint. Do not hesitate to get in touch for m=
ore information and/or design discussion.=20=20

Topkg may not be the final word in OCaml building & packaging, however, dep=
ending on your needs, topkg's release workflow (see 'topkg help release') m=
ay come as a significant improvement over the current status quo.=20=20

I have been using a similar but more ad-hoc system with my packages for a f=
ew years now since I realized that oasis was getting in my way to scale mod=
ularity. Except for the maintainability problem of having an embedded scrip=
t which is now gone with this new incarnation of topkg, it has already been=
 shown to work quite well in practice for me and a limited number of other =
persons, in a large range of software install scenarios, YMMV.

Best,

Daniel

P.S. If you are on github and start to use `topkg` you can mention me (@dbu=
enzli) in the inaugural PR or commit, I'm interested to see how it is used =
and misused.
