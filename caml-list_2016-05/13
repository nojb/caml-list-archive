Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Programmer Needed - Machine Learning Startup

Hi Charles,

Could you please stop sending your job applications to the caml-list?
This is your eigth email in less than a year total; the list
membership does not change that quickly, so everyone got your email by
now. No more than one email a year would be a more reasonable
schedule.

We discussed already, last September, the fact that advertising to the
caml-list with a description that mentions OCaml programming is rather
disingenuous, given that none of the job descriptions available on
your website, such as https://voleon.simplicant.com/jobs/18439/detail,
mention the OCaml language at all. It would be polite to restrict
caml-list job posting to jobs that involve significant programming in
OCaml or at least a strongly related language that could be of
interest to a large part of the community.
