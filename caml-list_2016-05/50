CRV 2016
The 3rd International Competition on Runtime Verification
In Association with COST Action =E2=80=9CRuntime Verification beyond Monito=
ring=E2=80=9D
held with RV 2016, September 23-30 2016, Madrid, Spain

https://rv2016.imag.fr/?page_id=3D188


CRV 2016 is the 3rd International Competition on Runtime Verification and w=
ill be held as part of the 16th International Conference on Runtime Verific=
ation. The event will be held in September 2016, in Madrid, Spain. CRV-2016=
 will draw attention to the invaluable effort of software developers and re=
searchers who contribute in this field by providing the community with new =
or updated tools, libraries and frameworks for the instrumentation and runt=
ime verification of software. The competition is a product of COST Action =
=E2=80=9CRuntime Verification beyond Monitoring=E2=80=9D, see https://www.c=
ost-arvi.eu/ for more information.

Runtime Verification is a verification technique for the analysis of softwa=
re at execution-time based on extracting information from a running system =
and checking if the observed behaviors satisfy or violate the properties of=
 interest. During the last decade, many important tools and techniques have=
 been developed and successfully employed. However, there is a pressing nee=
d to compare such tools and techniques, since we currently lack a common be=
nchmark suite as well as scientific evaluation methods to validate and test=
 new prototype runtime verification tools.=20

The main aims of CRV 2016 are to:

	=E2=80=A2 Stimulate the development of new efficient and practical runtime=
 verification tools and the maintenance and improvement of the already deve=
loped ones.
	=E2=80=A2 Produce a benchmark suite for runtime verification tools, by sha=
ring case studies and programs that researchers and developers can use in t=
he future to test and to validate their prototypes.
	=E2=80=A2 Discuss the metrics employed for comparing the tools.
	=E2=80=A2 Provide a comparison of the tools on different benchmarks and ev=
aluate them using different criteria.
	=E2=80=A2 Enhance the visibility of presented tools among the different co=
mmunities (verification, software engineering, cloud computing and security=
) involved in software monitoring.


Please direct any enquiries to the competition co-organizers (crv2016@crv.l=
iflab.ca):

	=E2=80=A2 Yli=C3=A8s Falcone (Univ. Grenoble Alpes, Inria, France),
	=E2=80=A2 Sylvain Hall=C3=A9 (Universit=C3=A9 du Qu=C3=A9bec =C3=A0 Chicou=
timi, Canada),
	=E2=80=A2 Giles Reger (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK).

CRV 2016 Jury

The CSRV Jury will include a representative for each participating team and=
 the competition chairs. The Jury will be consulted at each stage of the co=
mpetition to ensure that the rules set by the competition chairs are fair a=
nd reasonable.

Call for Participation

The main goal of CRV 2016 is to compare tools for runtime verification. We =
invite and encourage the participation with benchmarks and tools for the co=
mpetition. The competition will consist of three main tracks based on what =
is being monitored:

	=E2=80=A2 Track on monitoring Java programs (online monitoring)
	=E2=80=A2 Track on monitoring C programs (online monitoring)
		=E2=80=A2 Subtrack on Generic Specifications (e.g. in LTL)
		=E2=80=A2 Subtrack on Implicit Specifications (e.g. memory safety)
	=E2=80=A2 Track on monitoring of traces (offline monitoring)

The general organisation of the competition is described in the rules docum=
ent found at

http://crv.liflab.ca/CRV2016.pdf.
