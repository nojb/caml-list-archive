I would like to announce the latest version of Camlmix, since it provides 
a few features that make it useful in a broader range of applications 
than before. It now includes applications that serve web pages with 
dynamic contents.

Camlmix is a template processor, which converts text containing 
embedded OCaml into an OCaml program with embedded text.

Example:
   This is ocaml version ## print Sys.ocaml_version ##
   This is ocaml version ##= Sys.ocaml_version ##
becomes after execution:
   This is ocaml version 3.09.1
   This is ocaml version 3.09.1

The main novelty is that a template can now be converted into a 
regular OCaml source file which provides a "render" function instead of 
simply executing toplevel expressions when the module is initialized.
The resulting module can be compiled and included into any OCaml program, 
and can take advantage of the numerous libraries that are now available 
for OCaml, including syntax extensions.

Camlmix 1.3.0 can be installed from GODI or downloaded from its home at

Have fun!
