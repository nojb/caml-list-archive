In the first (newer) post linked above Xavier says:

"""
Feature 3- (dynamic code loading) is already available in bytecode
through the Dynlink API.  I understand there's a demand for having it
in native-code as well, and that might be possible without too much fuss,
at least on selected operating systems.
"""

This seems to conflict with Xavier's statements earlier in this thread.  I
hope dynamic loading is still being considered, as I can't see using
OCaml for medium-to-large scale applications programming without it.
Who wants to write an app without plugins these days?
