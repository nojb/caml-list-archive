The 8th IFIP International Conference on Formal Methods for Open Object-bas=
ed
Distributed Systems (FMOODS) is part of the federated conferences DisCoTec
(Distributed Computing Techniques), together with the 8th International
Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION) and the 6th
IFIP International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable
Systems (DAIS). It will be organised by the Department of Computer Science
of the University of Bologna.


OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE:

Established in 1996, the FMOODS series of conferences aims to provide an
integrated forum for research on formal aspects of Open Object-based
Distributed Systems. The conference will especially welcome novel
contributions reflecting recent developments in the area, in particular
component- and model-based design, service-oriented computing and=20
software quality. Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
  - Semantics and implementation of object-oriented  programming and
    (visual) modelling languages
  - Formal techniques for specification, design, analysis, verification,
    validation and testing
  - Model checking, theorem proving and deductive verification
  - Type systems and behavioural typing
  - Formal methods for service-oriented computing
  - Formal techniques for security and trust in global computing
  - Multiple viewpoint modelling and consistency between different views
  - Model transformations and refactorings
  - Software architectures
  - Integration of quality of service requirements into formal models
  - Component-based design
  - Applications (e.g.\ web services, multimedia, telecommunications)
  - Experience report on best practices and tools
