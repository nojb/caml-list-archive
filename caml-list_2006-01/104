Perhaps my analysis is naive. But consider a simpler case
of products and sums. They're dual concepts, are they not?

In Ocaml we have representations of both, each can be used
with reasonable utility -- there is a degree of symmetry,
associated with the duality. It feels good!

Contrast to C, which has products, but the union construction
isn't a sum. And the many other 'popular' languages with 
this weakness.

Sometimes it seems looking in the mirror is good. 
It's what we want. We don't want something new!

I often do try.. but seemed like a good idea to read Adameck first:

http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/8/14-08abs.html

Still this is quite heavy going for me.

Incidentally .. if you look in Wikipedia for 'coalgebra' you may
be a bit disappointed.
