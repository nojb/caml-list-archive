Even more clearly, see the Scanf module documentation.  From page 349 of 
the 3.09 manual:

*in addition to relevant digits, _ characters may appear inside numbers 
(this is reminiscent to the usual Caml conventions). If stricter scanning 
is desired, use the range conversion facility instead of the number 
conversions.

So, for example, this works:
# Scanf.sscanf "_a14_f2" "_a%[0-9]_f%[0-9]" (fun x y -> x,y);;
- : string * string = ("14", "2")

Though the return type is string, not int, so you'd need to convert them 
if you want ints...
