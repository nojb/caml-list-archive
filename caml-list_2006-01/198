Hasn't support for PIC/AMD64 been fixed in the latest release of OCaml
(3.09.1)? Or have you found a bug in 3.09.1? I've tried to (native)
compile a simple program on AMD64 as a shared library and it worked
fine.

Attached is a patch that makes ocaml able to compile proper PIC code on
amd64.
This allows shared libraries to be created from ocaml code.

This patch needs work - in addition to being rough around the edges,
there is
a fairly major issue where it will generate patters as such:

some_label:
     movq camlPcre@GOTPCREL(%rip), %r13
     movq 248(%r13), %r10
     call caml_apply8@PLT
...
caml_apply8:
    call (%r10) # should call camlPcre+248

This would be cool but %r10 is clobbered by the call in some
circumstances as
it's defined as a scratch register.  Ocaml's compiler seems to have
logic to
'spill' registers onto the stack but I haven't studied it hard enough to
put
it to use; maybe someone else is more familiar and will be able to mark
registers as live when they are used in this way?  :)

- Erik
