Hello,

I gave it a quick look and  it seems that your problem comes from some
lack  of flushing  when writing  strings  into files.  I rewrite  your
File_utils.write function into

======================================================================
let write: file -> string -> unit = 
  let f s text =  
    let c = open_out (Filename.concat !name s) in
    output_string c text;
    close_out c
  in
  ...
======================================================================

and it now works fine apparently.

Hope this helps,
