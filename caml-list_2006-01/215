				TFP 2006
	 Seventh Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
		  Nottingham, UK, 19 - 21 April, 2006

			    CALL FOR PAPERS



The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming languages, focusing on providing a broad view of
current and future trends in Functional Programming. It aspires to be a
lively environment for presenting the latest research results through
acceptance by extended abstracts. A formal post-symposium refereeing
process then selects the best papers presented at the symposium for
publication in a high-profile volume.

TFP 2006 is going to be held in Nottingham, UK, 19 - 21 April. Note that
this is significantly earlier in the year than past TFPs that generally
were held in August - September. TFP 2006 is co-located with Types 2006
(18 - 21 April).

The TFP symposium is the successor to the successful series of Scottish
Functional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in
Edinburgh, Scotland in 2003, in Munich, Germany in 2004, and in Tallinn,
Estonia in 2005 (co-located with ICFP and GPCE). For further general
information about TFP, see http://www.tifp.org/.


SCOPE OF THE SYMPOSIUM

The Symposium recognises that new trends may arise through various
routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify
the following five categories of paper. High-quality papers are
solicited in any of these categories:

    Research Papers:   leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
    Position Papers:   on what new trends should or should not be
    Project Papers:    descriptions of recently started new projects
    Evaluation Papers: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project
    Overview Papers:   summarising work with respect to a trendy subject

Papers must be original, and not submitted for simultaneous publication
in any other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional
programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or more
experience-oriented. Also applications of functional programming
techniques to other languages may be considered.

Papers on the following subject areas are particularly welcome:

    o dependently typed functional programming
    o validation and verification of functional programs
    o debugging for functional languages
    o functional programming and security
    o functional programming and mobility
    o functional programming and formally motivated computing
    o functional languages for telecommunications applications=20
    o functional languages for embedded systems
    o functional programming applied to global computing
    o functional GRIDs
    o functional languages for reasoning about imperative/object-
      oriented programs
    o interoperability with imperative programming languages
    o any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP,
please contact the TFP 2006 programme chair, Henrik Nilsson,
nhn@cs.nott.ac.uk.


BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students,
acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new subject
trends. To acknowledge this, a prize for the best student paper is
awarded each year.


CO-LOCATION WITH TYPES 2006 AND DATATYPE-GENERIC PROGRAMMING 2006

TFP 2006 is co-located with Types 2006 (to be held 18 - 21 April). To
take advantage of the synergies offered by these two complementary
events, we will invite a number of joint keynote speakers, hold joint
sessions on topics of mutual interest, such as dependently typed
functional programming, and run common social events. The schedule will
be arranged so that participants may freely move between parallel
sessions of the two events. See http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/types06/ for
further details.

TFP 2006 and Types 2006 are immediately followed by the Spring School on
Datatype-Generic Programming 2006 (24 - 27 April), which should be of
direct interest to many of the TFP and Types Participants. See
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/ssdgp2006/ for further details.


SUBMISSION AND LOCAL PROCEEDINGS

Acceptance to the symposium is by extended abstracts of between 6 and 10
pages. Accepted abstracts are to be completed to full papers before the
symposium for publication in the local symposium proceedings and
on-line.

Important dates:

    Deadline for abstract submission:	17 February, 2006
    Notification of acceptance:		27 February, 2006
    Registration deadline:		17 March, 2006
    Camera-ready copy of full paper:	24 March, 2006

The submission must clearly indicate to which category it belongs:
research, position, project, evaluation or overview paper. It should
also indicate whether the main author or authors are research students.

Abstracts and full papers must be written in English. Papers for the
symposium proceedings must adhere to the formatting instructions
provided on the TFP 2006 site. Papers must not exceed 16 pages; papers
in some categories may comprise considerably fewer pages.

The papers of the local proceedings will also be made available on-line
under the following conditions, with which all authors are asked to
agree:

    The documents distributed by this server have been provided by the
    contributing authors as a means to ensure timely dissemination of
    scholarly and technical work on a noncommercial basis. Copyright and
    all rights therein are maintained by the authors or by other
    copyright holders, notwithstanding that they have offered their
    works here electronically. It is understood that all persons copying
    this information will adhere to the terms and constraints invoked by
    each author's copyright. These works may not be reposted without the
    explicit permission of the copyright holder.

See the TFP 2006 website for further instructions to authors and details
on how to submit.


POST SYMPOSIUM REFEREEING AND PUBLICATION

In addition to the local symposium proceedings, we intend to continue
the TFP tradition of publishing a high-quality subset of contributions
in the Intellect series on Trends in Functional Programming (see
http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/series.php?series=3D1). All TFP authors
will be invited to submit revised papers after the symposium. These will
will be refereed to normal conference standards, and a subset of the
best papers over all categories will be selected for publication. Papers
will be judged on their contribution to the research area, with
appropriate criteria applied to each category of paper.

Papers submitted for publication by Intellect must follow formatting and
any other instructions provided by the Programme Chair.

For TFP 2005, in order to enhance the quality of student submissions, a
process where student papers were given extra feedback was tried out. A
similar process might be put in place for this TFP, contingent on the
outcome of that trial.
