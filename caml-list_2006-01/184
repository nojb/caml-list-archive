As part of our work on Moby, John Reppy and I are collecting
experiences people have had using the object-oriented features of
Ocaml, as it has been available long enough for people to use it "for
real."

We are interested in understanding what people use the object- 
oriented features for.  What works really well?  What doesn't work so  
smoothly?  How do you decide when to use the object-oriented  
features?  Do you have other observations you'd like to share?

I'm happy to summarize responses sent directly to me for the list.

Thanks in advance!
Kathleen Fisher
