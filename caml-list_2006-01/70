This is good to know, but I'm talking about situations where I need more
structured output.  For example, I wrote a scheduling program for an
organization I belonged to, and found it convenient to output the
results as a LaTeX table.  So there was pre-matter boiler plate, then
the table, and finally post-matter boiler plate.  The results of the
scheduler were produced as a list of lists, where each member list had
an item for each column of the table.  A single (format...) form
consumed the results and wrote out the table.  All I had to do was run
the program, then run latex, and finally pipe the output of dvips to my
printer.  Of course, a major part of the convenience was that *I didn't
have to write the formatter*.
