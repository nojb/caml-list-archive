                  CALL FOR TECHNICAL PAPERS
               Fifth International Conference on
      Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE'06)
                   http://www.gpce.org/06/

                     October 22-26, 2006
                      Portland, Oregon
                 (co-located with OOPSLA'06)

      Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN, in cooperation with ACM SIGSOFT.
            Proceedings to be published by ACM Press.

IMPORTANT DATES
*  Pre-submission: April 30, 2006
*  Submission: May 5, 2006, 23:59, Apia time (firm deadline, no =20
extensions)
*  Notification: June 28, 2005


SCOPE

Generative and component approaches are revolutionizing software
development similar to how automation and components revolutionized
manufacturing. Generative Programming (developing programs that
synthesize other programs), Component Engineering (raising the level
of modularization and analysis in application design), and
Domain-Specific Languages (elevating program specifications to compact
domain-specific notations that are easier to write, maintain, and
analyze) are key technologies for automating program development.

GPCE provides a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in
foundational techniques for enhancing the productivity, quality, and
time-to-market in software development that stems from deploying
standard componentry and automating program generation. In addition to
exploring cutting-edge techniques for developing generative and
component-based software, our goal is to foster further
cross-fertilization between the software engineering research
community and the programming languages community.

SUBMISSIONS

10 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls) reporting
research results and/or experience related to the topics above (PC
co-chairs can advise on appropriateness). We particularly encourage
original high-quality reports on applying GPCE technologies to
real-world problems, relating ideas and concepts from several topics,
or bridging the gap between theory and practice.

TOPICS

GPCE seeks contributions in software engineering and in programming
languages related (but not limited) to:

   * Generative programming
      Reuse, meta-programming, partial evaluation, multi-stage and
      multi-level languages, and step-wise refinement

      Semantics, type systems, symbolic computation, linking and =20
explicit
      substitution, in-lining and macros, templates, and program
      transformation

      Runtime code generation, compilation, active libraries, synthesis
      from specifications, development methods, generation of non-code
      artifacts, formal methods, and reflection

   * Generative techniques for
      Product-line architectures
      Distributed, real-time and embedded systems
      Model-driven development and architecture

   * Component-based software engineering
      Reuse, distributed platforms and middleware, distributed systems,
      evolution,
      patterns, development methods, deployment and configuration
      techniques, and formal methods

   * Integration of generative and component-based approaches

   * Domain engineering and domain analysis
      Domain-specific languages (DSLs) including visual and UML-based =20=

DSLs

   * Separation of concerns
      Aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming,
      Intentional programming and multi-dimensional separation of =20
concerns

   * Industrial applications
      Reports on applications of these techniques to real-world
      problems are especially encouraged, as are submissions that
      relate ideas and concepts from several of these topics, or bridge
      the gap between theory and practice. The program committee is
      happy to advise on the appropriateness of a particular subject.

GPCE Tutorials and Workshops

GPCE Tutorials, extending over a half or full day, give a deeper or
broader insight than conventional lectures.

GPCE Workshops provide intensive collaborative environments, where
generative and component technologists meet to discuss and resolve
challenging problems in the field.

Tutorial and workshop proposals are due Mar 18, 2006.
