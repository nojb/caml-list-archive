As Matthieu Dubuget, I would like to thank you too for your book.
I find it of great quality, and all is explained with a huge clarity!

What I appriciate in particular is that one doesn't need to have
pre-requisites knowledge to understand it, unlike the official manual which
requisites that the reader is a programer yet to understand some parts.


Just a detail, I have noticed that on page 238 you make reference to the
chapter 12 to develop the subject about C, but there is no chapter 12.
Did you projected to write this chapter but finally you did not?
But perhaps it's a vast subject so it will be developed in your next book? :)
