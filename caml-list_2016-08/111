Second Call for Papers for
19th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages
(PADL 2017)

http://bit.ly/PADL-2017

Paris, France

16th and 17th January 2017

Co-located with ACM POPL 2017 (http://conf.researchr.org/home/POPL-2017)

The two best papers accepted for publication at PADL
will be invited to submit an extended version for rapid publication
in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming.

Conference Description
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Declarative languages build on sound theoretical bases to provide
attractive frameworks for application development. These languages
have been successfully applied to many different real-world
situations, ranging from data base management to active networks to
software engineering to decision support systems.

New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new
application areas. At the same time, applications of declarative
languages to novel problems raise numerous interesting research
issues. Well-known questions include designing for scalability,
language extensions for application deployment, and programming
environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and
implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress
as well.

PADL is a forum for researchers and practitioners to present
original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation
techniques for all forms of declarative concepts, including,
functional, logic, constraints, etc. Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to:

* Innovative applications of declarative languages
* Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
* Practical applications of theoretical results
* New language developments and their impact on applications
* Declarative languages and software engineering
* Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
* Practical experiences and industrial applications
* Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
* Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and
   reactive languages.

PADL 2017 welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to
applications and implementation of declarative languages. PADL 2017 will
be co-located with the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages
(POPL 2017), in Paris, France.

Abstract submission: September 12, 2016
Paper submission: September 19, 2016
Notification: October 18, 2016
Camera-ready: November 1, 2016
Symposium: January 16-17, 2017

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF
using the Springer LNCS format. The submission will be done through
EasyChair conference system:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dpadl17

All submissions must be original work written in English. Submissions
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work
that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops
proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program
chair about the place on which it has previously appeared.
PADL 2017 will accept both technical and application papers:

* Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished
research results. Technical papers must not exceed 15 pages (plus
one page of references) in Springer LNCS format.

* Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical
applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or
in areas of research other than Computer Science.
Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or
real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of
declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering
solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative)
are solicited. The limit for application papers is 8 pages in
Springer LNCS format but such papers can also point to sites with
supplemental information about the application or the system that
they describe.

The proceedings of PADL 2017 will appear in the LNCS series of Springer
Verlag ( www.springer.com/lncs<http://www.springer.com/lncs> ).

Two papers accepted for publication at PADL'17 will be nominated for the Mo=
st
Practical Paper award (one of them as the Student Best Paper), each in cash
amount of 250 Euro. These two papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their contribution to the journal "Theory and Practice of Logic
Programming" for rapid publication.  The extended version should contain at
least 30% new content compared to the published conference paper.

The extended paper will undergo an additional review process.

All submissions must be original work written in English. Submissions<br>
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work<br>
that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops<br>
proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program<br>
chair about the place on which it has previously appeared.<br>
PADL 2017 will accept both technical and application papers:<br>
<br>
* Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished<br>
research results. Technical papers must not exceed 15 pages (plus<br>
one page of references) in Springer LNCS format.<br>
<br>
* Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical<br>
applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or<br>
in areas of research other than Computer Science.<br>
Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or<br>
real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of<br>
declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering<br>
solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative)<br>
are solicited. The limit for application papers is 8 pages in<br>
Springer LNCS format but such papers can also point to sites with<br>
supplemental information about the application or the system that<br>
they describe.<br>
<br>
The proceedings of PADL 2017 will appear in the LNCS series of Springer<br>
Verlag ( <a href=3D"http://www.springer.com/lncs">www.springer.com/lncs</a>=
 ).<br>
<br>
Two papers accepted for publication at PADL'17 will be nominated for the Mo=
st <br>
Practical Paper award (one of them as the Student Best Paper), each in cash=
 <br>
amount of 250 Euro. These two papers will be invited to submit an extended =
<br>
version of their contribution to the journal &quot;Theory and Practice of L=
ogic <br>
Programming&quot; for rapid publication.&nbsp; The extended version should =
contain at <br>
least 30% new content compared to the published conference paper.<br>
<br>
The extended paper will undergo an additional review process.<br>
