I suggest you open a bug here:

https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/issues

Your exotic Linux distro isn't supported by this package
(and, I guess, by any opam package):
---
# opam info --raw conf-ncurses
[...]
depexts: [
  [["alpine"] ["ncurses-dev"]]
  [["centos"] ["ncurses-devel"]]
  [["debian"] ["ncurses-dev"]]
  [["fedora"] ["ncurses-devel"]]
  [["nixpkgs"] ["ncurses"]]
  [["oraclelinux"] ["ncurses-devel"]]
  [["rhel"] ["ncurses-devel"]]
  [["ubuntu"] ["ncurses-dev"]]
]
[...]
---

There is always a price to pay when using exotic things.
