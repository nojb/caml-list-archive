The research group of Software Technology is part of the Software
Systems division of in the department of Information and Computer
Science at the Utrecht University. We focus our research on functional
programming, compiler construction, program analysis, validation, and
verification.

We are currently advertising a PhD position, together with the
Interaction Technology group, to explore the use of functional
programming -- and data type generic programming in particular -- to
describe and analyze musical structure. This project continues the
line of research initiated by Bas de Haas and Jos=C3=A9 Pedro Magalh=C3=A3e=
s,
that has lead to several successful publications and a flourishing
start-up, Chordify.

Besides research, the successful candidate will be expected to help
supervise MSc students and assist teaching courses.

Candidates must be willing to start before January 2017.

---------------------------------
What we are looking for
---------------------------------

The ideal candidate should have an MSc in Computer Science, be highly
motivated, speak and write English well, and be proficient in
producing scientific reports. Furthermore, candidates should be able
to demonstrate

 * experience with functional programming languages, such as Haskell,
   OCaml, ML, Agda, Idris, or Coq;
 * an interest in music and musical theory.

---------------------------------
What we offer
---------------------------------

The candidate is offered a full-time position for four years. A
part-time of at least 0.8 fte may also be possible. The salary is
supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and an end-of-year bonus of
