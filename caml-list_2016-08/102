Subject: [Caml-list] CfP: ACM SAC'17 PAPP Track - Practical Aspects of
 High-Level Parallel Programming

====================== Call for Papers ======================
SAC'17 - ACM 2017 Symposium on Applied Computing
Technical Track
PAPP - Practical Aspects of High-Level Parallel Programming
Marrakech, Morocco
March 27 - 31, 2017
http://frederic.loulergue.eu/PAPP2017
=============================================================

AIMS & SCOPE

Nowadays parallel architectures are everywhere. However parallel
programming is still reserved to experienced programmers. The trend is
towards the increase of cores in processors and the number of
processors in multiprocessor machines: The need for scalable computing
is everywhere. But parallel and distributed programming is still
dominated by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing
and POSIX threads. Thus high-level approaches should play a key role
in the shift to scalable computing in every computer.

Algorithmic skeletons (Google's MapReduce being the most well-known
skeletal parallelism approach), parallel extensions of functional
languages such as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint
programming, parallel execution of declarative programs such as SQL
queries, genericity and meta-programming in object-oriented languages,
etc. have produced methods and tools that improve the
price/performance ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of
target applications. Also, high level languages offer a high degree of
abstraction which ease the development of complex systems. Moreover,
being based on formal semantics, it is possible to certify the
correctness of critical parts of the applications. The aim of all
these languages and tools is to improve and ease the development of
applications (safety, expressivity, efficiency, etc.).

The PAPP track is aimed both at researchers involved in the
development of high level approaches for parallel computing and
engineers and researchers who are potential users of these languages
and tools.

PAPP is no longer a workshop but is a track of ACM Symposium on
Applied Computing, the flagship conference of ACM Special Interest
Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP). ACM SAC is ranked A1 in the
Qualis ranking. The acceptance rate of recent SAC is around 25%.

TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

- design, implementation and optimisation of high-level programming
languages,

- algorithms and high-level models (CGM, BSP, LogP, MapReduce,...),

- artificial intelligence, software engineering and formal methods
applied to high-level parallel programming,

- middleware and tools: performance predictors, visualisations of
abstract behaviour, automatic hot-spot detectors, high-level
resource managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.,

- applications of high-level approaches, benchmarks and experiments.

The PAPP track focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming but it welcomes topics of mostly theoretical nature,
provided there is clear practical potential in applying the results of
such work.

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Paper submissions must be original, unpublished work. Submissions
should be in electronic format, via the link provided at SAC web page
(http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2017).

Author(s) name(s) and address(es) must not appear in the body of the
paper, and self-reference should be avoided and made in the third
person. Submitted papers will undergo a blind review process. Authors
of accepted papers should submit an editorial revision of their papers
that fits within six two-column pages (an extra two pages, to a total
of eight pages, may be available at a charge). Please comply with this
page limitation already at submission time.

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the
paper/poster in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy
attending SAC MUST present the paper: This is a requirement for the
paper/poster to be included in the ACM/IEEE digital library. No-show
of scheduled papers and posters will result in excluding them from the
ACM/IEEE digital library.

After the conference, selected accepted papers will be invited to a
special issue of an international journal (pending).

SAC 2017 will also hold a Student Research Competition (SRC). To enter
this in the area of PAPP, please submit via the link at SAC web page.
