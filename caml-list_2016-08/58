Yes, I get that - this is starting to feel mutually recursive. As it concer=
ns you hugely, looking again at your original message:

a) Yes, the compiler does expect the .ml and .mli files to be in the same d=
irectory
b) Yes, this behaviour is specified in the manual, possibly too mathematica=
lly for your tastes, and perhaps benefitting from a cross-reference/extra s=
entence in section 2.5 to the compiler driver's documentation.
c) No, the compiler does not force you to put .mli files with the .ml files=
 in your use case - it has existing tools which can just about facilitate t=
he layout you're after (see below). They could be improved, though.
d) Lifting the "restriction", for example by allowing -I to search for .mli=
 files, poses a large backwards-compatibility risk.

Of the options I'd already specified, were any of:

a) Add a new command line parameter to make ocamlc/ocamlopt pretend that it=
 found a .mli file with the .ml file (and so use the -I directories to find=
 the .cmi)
b) Abuse the -intf-suffix parameter to achieve the same effect as option a=
=20
c) Put a dummy/empty .mli (not the actual one) in each directory to achieve=
 the same thing

fundamentally unsuitable? You did eliminate the fourth option, which was ju=
st to delete the auto-generated .cmi file as with -o you can make it overwr=
ite the actual .cmi file. I'm still puzzled as to why none of those other o=
ptions yields a solution and the only way to you is a breaking change to th=
e compiler driver or very pedantic updates to the documentation?
