CONFERENCE SCOPE AND PUBLICATION

FMCAD 2017 is the seventeenth in a series of conferences on the theory and
applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD
provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for
presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical
results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD
covers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including verification,
specification, synthesis, and testing.

FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process. Accepted papers are distributed
through both ACM and IEEE digital libraries. In addition, published articles
are made available freely on the conference page; the authors retain the
copyright. There are no publication fees. At least one of the authors is
required to register for the conference and present the accepted paper. A
small number of outstanding FMCAD submissions will be considered for
inclusion in a Special Issue of the journal on Formal Methods in System
Design (FMSD).


TOPICS OF INTEREST

FMCAD welcomes submission of papers reporting original research on advances
in all aspects of formal methods and their applications to computer-
aided design. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

-- Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and
   reduction, compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and
   word-level, probabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods and
   decision procedures.

-- Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,
   specification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of
   languages and their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and
   transformation, correct-by-construction methods.

-- Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and
   non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,
   including timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems
   on all levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for
   embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and
   other safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and
   verification, and transaction-level verification.

-- Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to
   industrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification
   enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation
   of formal methods.

-- Application of formal methods to verifying safety, correctness,
   connectivity, and security properties of networks and distributed
   systems.


SUBMISSIONS

Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via EasyChair:

      https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad17

Two categories of papers are invited: Regular papers, and Tool & Case Study
papers. Regular papers are expected to offer novel foundational ideas,
theoretical results, or algorithmic improvements to existing methods,
along with experimental impact validation where applicable. Tool & Case
Study papers are expected to report on the design, implementation or use of
verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant context
(which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.

Both Regular and Tool & Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions
format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Regular papers can be
up to 8 pages in length and tool papers up to 4 pages, although there
is no requirement to fill all pages in either category. Authors will be
required to select the appropriate paper category at abstract submission
time. Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear
in the final version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess
the quality and the relevance of the results in the paper without reading
the appendix.

Submissions in both categories must contain original research that has not
been previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication.
Any partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be
clearly indicated. If experimental results are reported, authors are
strongly encouraged to provide the reviewers access to their data at
submission time, so that results can be independently verified.
