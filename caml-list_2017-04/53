Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml jobs at genomics company in New York City

--f4030435c97ccda7bc054d117ac5
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Solvuu is a startup developing software for the life sciences industry. Our
core technology is based on ideas from type theory and functional
programming, and our software is implemented almost entirely in OCaml. We
develop software across the full stack: cloud infrastructure management,
job scheduling, data management and security, clients and servers for many
APIs, rich websites, and much more.

We are currently hiring 2 full-time OCaml programmers in New York City. We
are open to a spectrum of qualifications, but basically the more OCaml you
know the better. Ideal candidates will have at least 5 years of experience
developing production OCaml software, whether in industry or as an academic
active in the open source community. We are offering great compensation
packages that include salary, equity, and the usual things like health care
and a ping pong table. Most importantly, you will build great technology to
advance society in areas as important as cancer treatment, drug discovery,
and agriculture. And you get to do all of that in Manhattan, one of the
most vibrant and beautiful cities in the world.

To apply, please contact me directly (ashish@solvuu.com) with your
resume/CV. International applicants are welcome, but the reality is getting
a visa will be challenging. We are willing to try and may explore options
for exceptional candidates.

About Genomics: Our primary focus is on genomics, an industry driven by a
dramatic decrease in the cost of DNA sequencing. Fifteen years ago it cost
$100,000,000 to sequence a single human genome, today it costs $1000, and
in a couple of years it is expected to cost $100. This has spawned multiple
new industries that face serious computational challenges due to the size
and complexity of the data and associated algorithms. Solvuu addresses the
full spectrum of computational needs of this important market. We have
great investors and partnerships, and are now building a great engineering
team. Please join us. Solvuu is headquartered in New York City and also has
an office in Silicon Valley.
