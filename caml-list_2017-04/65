I will point out that reading Java documentation suggests to me that it
solves the "locale-appropriate digits" problem.  See, for example, the
bottom of the following page, where Thai digits are being used to print out
a number:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/locale/create.html#constants.
The relevance of Java is that most of JDK is under an open source license
(though I cannot comment on whether the license would allow lifting that
portion of implementation into OCaml).  The important point here is that
this is a problem that has been solved in at least one largely open-source
technology.

I deliberately am choosing not to comment on your other points, because I
view them as only tangentially related to the issue at hand, which is how
to handle translation of OCaml error messages.

Best,
Zhenya
