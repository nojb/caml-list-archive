Subject: Re: [Caml-list] PPX is harmful to our community in the long term

My 2 cents: I personally think we did PPX wrong. PPX should have used
the syntax as its starting point for full backwards compatibility.
Currently, the PPX cycle is

OCaml: { syntax -> AST -> serialized AST } -> PPX: {serialized AST ->
AST -> PPX modification -> serialized AST} -> OCaml: {serialized AST
-> AST -> ... }

Exposing the AST is the cause of the problem you mention. If instead,
every PPX extension had a particular OCaml compiler's syntax parser
and syntax printer integrated into it, and the PPX cycle was:

PPX: { syntax -> AST -> PPX modification -> syntax } -> compiler: {
syntax -> AST -> ...}

We would have far fewer issues with PPX plugins, since they would be
as backwards-compatible as the syntax.

I think this mistake happened because everyone was trying to move away
from camlp4's complexity, and we didn't notice that the problem with
camlp4 wasn't the approach, but rather the fact that it wasn't making
use of the same code as the compiler and therefore required its own
heavy learning-curve and parallel maintenance to keep up with the
compiler. To be fair though, camlp4 came before the age of OCaml on
github, opam, and the associated easy code/library sharing.

The only issue I can see with this idea of improving PPX is that the
PPX-generated syntax wouldn't have the original source locations. We'd
need an annotation that indicated the original source locations
(perhaps row and column offsets) when a PPX translated to modified
syntax and printed it out, so that the compiler's errors would have
proper locations relative to the original source.
