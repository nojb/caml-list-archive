Jane Street has no special immunity. We use external PPXs, and we in fact
had a bunch of pain around versioning of PPXs, which is precisely why we've
spent real effort on making versioning easier.

Syntactic abstraction is amazingly useful for many different kinds of
programming, open source and industrial alike. Again, I the emphasis should
be on identifying and fixing the problems with PPX, not pushing to avoid it.

Did you read Jeremie's post? That solution was considered, but it turns out
to have a lot of issues.

But as OCaml users know, more expressive languages really do help. I'm not
in favor of adding expressiveness at all costs, but the upside of PPX is
massive, and the problems are eminently manageable, as the emergence of
tools like migrate-parsetree has demonstrated.

Not only PPX has not been harmful for me, but it has been a life-saver<br>
tool that has enabled significant progress towards more productive<br>
research.<br>

</span>Personally, I fully subscribe Yaron&#39;s message and I see nothing<=

disrespectful in suggesting that abandoning syntactic abstractions is a<br>
very bad idea.<br><br>
You wrote:<br><br>

but if you meant:<br><br>
