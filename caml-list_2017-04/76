Subject: [Caml-list] New release of Menhir (20170418)


Dear OCaml users,

It is my pleasure to announce a new release of Menhir,
which is available as of now via opam.

   opam update && opam install menhir

The main changes are as follows:

- Changed Menhir's license from QPL to GPLv2. MenhirLib remains under 
LGPLv2,
   with a linking exception.

- Moved the repository to gitlab.inria.fr, where it is public.

- Many additions to the incremental API, suggested by Frédéric Bour.

- A new library, MenhirSdk, allows external tools to get access to a
   description of the grammar and automaton. This was also proposed
   by Frédéric Bour. This change and the previous one, together, allow
   error recovery strategies to be precomputed and implemented.

For more details, see the change log:

Enjoy,
