I very much agree with this sentiment. Restraint in the use of PPXs is
important. We've added a fairly modest set of PPXs that mostly act as
language extensions, turned on nearly everywhere in our codebase.

We consider the addition of a PPX to be expensive, and especially a
project-specific one. We only do it if it makes for a really large
improvement. I totally agree that you don't want different subsets of your
codebase to feel as if they were written in different languages.
