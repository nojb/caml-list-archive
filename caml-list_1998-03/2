Subject: small solved problem linking caml with Fortran
X-Mailer: VM 6.34 under 20.3 "Vatican City" XEmacs  Lucid
Sender: weis


This is mainly for ocaml developers but perhaps some users might have
an insight. 

Caml (ocaml-1.07 bytecode compiler &interpreter) is used here as an
embedding langage for numerical applications programmed in Fortran.

Plateform is a Linux/Intel Pentium II. Kernel is 2.0.33, distribution
is (patched) Redhat-5.0, libc is libc-2.0.6.so, binutils is 2.8.1.0.1
(not .0.15!), egcs-1.0.1 compiler suite (including f77 & libf2c)

The problem is that both fortran's /usr/lib/libf2c.a and caml's
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/libcamlrun.a  defines a main function (in amain.o 
member)

The custom top level is built with 

ocamlmktop -custom  -o toplevel  fthebase.cmo  fthebasec.o  F*.o -cclib /usr/lib/libf2c.a 


fthebasec.o is built from fthebasec.c. it is a C wrapper calling
fortran routines and prividing ocaml C custom primitives

fthebase.cmo is customer's Caml code

F*.o is built from fortran77 F*.f sources

The problem is that ocaml first links in the provided
(Fortran's) /usr/lib/libf2c.a and then the caml's
/usr/local/lib/ocaml/libcamlrun.a  

So Fortran's main.o is being loaded, and caml's main.o is not loaded.

The solving hack is to 

extract the main.o from /usr/local/lib/ocaml/libcamlrun.a and rename
it as camlmain.o

build the top level with
ocamlmktop -custom  -o toplevel camlmain.o fthebase.cmo  fthebasec.o  F*.o -cclib /usr/lib/libf2c.a 

My suggestion is either to document it in the manual, or better to
explicitly provide in /usr/local/lib/ocaml/ the camlmain.o object
file.

I also believe that the caml's /usr/local/lib/libcamlrun.a should be
linked by ocaml before additional -cclib-ed libraries.

I also would like an undocumented -dkeep option which would keep all
temporary files that ocaml creates (gcc has a similar flag
-save-temps). Having such an option would satisfy my curiosity :-) and
probably help debug such problems. 

Thanks for all.
