In Ocaml 1.05, the equality operator did not work reliably for
objects. Indeed, objects was not treated specially. So, the operator
structurally compared the structures of the two objects and in some
cases tried to compare two methods and as a consequence failed.

In Ocaml 1.07, two objects are equals iff they are physically equals.
