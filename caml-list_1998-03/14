Hello, All!  My name is Melissa Barkan and I'm the Recruiting Manager at
a TMN company in New Jersey (USA).  We have an urgent need for a
compiler and until recently I was told to look for someone with
experience in lex/yacc.  Now I'm told that yacc is too limiting and they
are using O'CAML.  The only problem is that I can't find anyone with
this knowledge/experience.  The manager is working night and day
teaching himself this, but he needs help (even if it's just for
short-term consulting).  Any ideas???  I'd be FOREVER in your debt.

Respectfully yours,
Melissa Barkan
