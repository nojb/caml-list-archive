As they described in their paper[1], there is an extended version
of Caml-light for "extensional polymorphism". But I don't know it is
FTP or HTTP-available.

I am now tring to implement ad-hoc polymorphism / overloading on
O'Caml. It will be partially based on the system described in the
paper, but somewhat improved hopefully. I will be able to release a
prototype this summer or at least at the end of this year. But of
course I don't know it will be integrated in the official O'Caml
release...
