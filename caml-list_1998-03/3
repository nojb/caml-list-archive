[ No, I'm not going to embarrass myself by trying to stutter
  French.  I should have paid more attention in class :-(.  ]

Has anybody looked into pretty printing O'Caml to TeX and/or LaTeX?
It should be possible with camlp4, but it doesn't appear to be a
simple rainy afternoon's hack.  Or is simple textual substitution
my best bet?  Is it worth the effort or is legibility not improved?

Curious,
