I'm accustomed to ML compilers which automatically bind the result
of the last successful toplevel expression evaluation to a variable
"it". This makes interactive use of the toplevel loop much more
convenient. Is there something similar available in CAML Light, or
is there an easy way to introduce it?

John.
