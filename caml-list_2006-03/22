But you see, in this case a member of my team was reading the latest
documentation, and using the latest version. So everything looked
correct to him, but he didn't realize that he was making our code
incompatible with the last ~10 years of OCaml.

In any case, we have worked around it by testing Sys.ocaml_version.
Thanks to everyone who replied for their suggestions.

Is there any reason why Sys.ocaml_version is a string, by the way?
Shouldn't it be some kind of numerical representation to make it easy to
do ordered comparisons?

Thanks all,
Ezra
