Sounds like you should be the professor, and he the student :)

Category theory. It's full of pictures :)
But doesn't fit well with applicative languages
(CT is compositional).

Hmm..


	'a list ----- filter ----> 'a list

you can draw some pictures of functions and join
up the domains and codomains, and, instantiate
type variables:

	'a list
	   ||
	   ||
	   V
	int list

I guess you'll eventually get enough ink on paper to make
it look pretty.
