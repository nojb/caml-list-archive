ABOUT TFP

The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
functional programming languages, focusing on providing a broad view of
current and future trends in Functional Programming. It aspires to be a
lively environment for presenting the latest research results through
acceptance by extended abstracts. A formal post-symposium refereeing
process then selects the best papers presented at the symposium for
publication in a high-profile volume.

The TFP symposium is the successor to the successful series of Scottish
Functional Programming Workshops. Previous TFP symposia were held in
Edinburgh, Scotland in 2003, in Munich, Germany in 2004, and in Tallinn,
Estonia in 2005 (co-located with ICFP and GPCE). For further general
information about TFP, see http://www.tifp.org/.


PROGRAMME

The list of papers accepted for presentation at TFP 2006 is available
via the TFP 2006 website:

    http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/TFP2006/TFP2006-TalkList.html


REGISTRATION

TFP 2006 takes place Nottingham, UK, 19 - 21 April. It is co-located
with Types 2006 (18 - 21 April) and and the Spring School on
Datatype-Generic Programming 2006.

Registration is open. Deadline: 17 March, 2006


CO-LOCATION WITH TYPES 2006 AND DATATYPE-GENERIC PROGRAMMING 2006

TFP 2006 is co-located with Types 2006 (to be held 18 - 21 April). To
take advantage of the synergies offered by these two complementary
events, there are joint keynote speakers, joint sessions on topics of
mutual interest, such as dependently typed functional programming, and
common social events. The schedule will be arranged so that
participants may freely move between parallel sessions of the two
events. See http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/types06/ for further details.

TFP 2006 and Types 2006 are immediately followed by the Spring School on
Datatype-Generic Programming 2006 (24 - 27 April), which should be of
direct interest to many of the TFP and Types Participants. See
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/ssdgp2006/ for further details.
