HI all,

I posted this to the lablgtk list but received no reply. I'm hoping
someone here might be able to answer this.

I have a pair of view objects and I'd like to connect a GData.adjustment
to them. I think this has something to do with this method:

  method set_scroll_adjustments :
    callback:(GData.adjustment option -> GData.adjustment option -> unit)
    -> GtkSignal.id

but I can't figure out how to use it. Anyone have a clue how to do
this?

TIA,
Erik
