Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD) addresses all aspects of 
(embedded) digital and mixed hardware/software system engineering. 

It is a discussion forum for researchers and engineers working on state-of-the 
art investigations, development, and applications. 

It focuses on advanced system, design, and design automation concepts, 
paradigms, methods and tools, as well as, modern implementation technologies 
that enable effective and efficient development of high-quality (embedded) 
systems for important and demanding applications in fields such as (wireless) 
communication and networking; measurement and instrumentation; health-care and 
medicine; military, space, avionic and automotive systems; security; multi-media 
and ambient intelligence. 

The main areas of interest are the following: 

T1: Systems-on-a-chip/in-a-package: generic system platforms and platform-based 
design; network on chip; multi-processors; system on re-configurable chip; 
system FPGAs and structured ASICs; rapid prototyping; asynchronous systems; 
power, energy, timing, predictability and other quality issues; intellectual 
property, virtual components and design reuse. 

T2: Programmable/re-configurable architectures: processor, communication, memory 
and software architectures with focus on application specific and/or embedded 
computing, co-processors; processing arrays; programmable fabrics; embedded 
software; arithmetic, logic and special-operator units. 

T3: System, hardware and embedded software specification, modeling and 
validation: design languages; functional, structural and parametric 
specification and modeling; simulation, emulation, prototyping, and testing at 
the system, register-transfer, logic and physical levels; co-simulation and co 
verification. 

T4: System, hardware and embedded software synthesis: system, hardware/software 
and embedded software synthesis; behavioral, register-transfer, logic and 
physical circuit synthesis; multi-objective optimization observing power, 
performance, communication, interconnections, layout, technology, reliability, 
robustness, security, testability and other issues; (dynamic) management of 
computational resources, power, energy etc.; design environments for embedded 
systems and re-configurable computing. 

T5: Emerging technologies, system paradigms and design methodologies: optical, 
bio, nano and quantum technologies and computing; self-organizing and self 
adapting (wireless) systems; wireless sensor networks; ambient intelligence and 
augmented reality; ubiquitous, wearable and implanted systems; deep sub-micron 
design issues. 

T6: Applications of (embedded) digital systems with emphasis on demanding and 
new applications in fields such as: (wireless) communication and networking; 
measurement and instrumentation; health-care and medicine; military, space, 
avionic and automotive systems; security; multi-media, instrumentation and 
ambient intelligence; health-care and medicine; military, space, avionic and 
automotive systems; security; multi-media and ambient intelligence.

Special Topics and Sessions: 

ST1 (keynote): Design Methodology for Integrated Digital RF, Texsas Instruments 

TITLE: "Reinventing Design Methodology for Integrated 'Digital RF'". 
Dr. Roman Staszewski 
Design Manager, DRP Design, WTBU 
Texas Instruments 

SUMMARY: 
Both digital and RF/analog designers can claim they have proven and sufficient 
design methodologies. The luxury of isolation let them perfect their own world 
without any concern for the other. But, the world demands efficiency, the latest 
technology for pennies. While tight integration of RF and digital in SOC is the 
cost effective answer, it opens a design methodology Pandora Box. What 
previously could be ignored, has to be considered. What was proven and 
sufficient, may not work anymore. The resulting paradigm change affects all 
aspects of the design process from system architecture to circuit design to 
validation to test. 

SS1: Resource-Aware Sensor Network Systems 

SCOPE: The special session on “Resource-Aware Sensor Network Systems” addresses 
concepts, implementations and applications of sensor network systems, as well 
as, new architectural models and hardware solutions in the sensor network 
domain. Papers on any of the following and re-lated topics will be considered 
for the special session: 

• Sensor network concepts and architectures 
• Sensing, processing and communicating on a chip 
• Low-power and low-energy computation and communication 
• Communication-computation trade-offs 
• Resource-aware SW/HW Co-design 
• Position determination and synchronization in sensor networks 
• Fault-tolerance, dependability and robustness 
• Prototypes and applications 

SESSION ORGANIZER: 
M. Handy, University of Rostock (DE)- matthias.handy@uni-rostock.de

Special Session SS2: Low-Power and High-Performance Networks-on-Chip 

SCOPE 
Although this special session addresses all aspects related to concepts, 
implementations and applications of networks-on-chip and related EDA tools, its 
focus is on low-power and high-performance aspects. Papers on any of the 
following and related topics will be considered for the special session: 

• Network-on-Chip concepts and architectures 
• Application-specific communication on a chip and network topology 
• Routing schemes, switch concepts, layouts, and signal transmission 
• Low-power, low-energy and high-performance computation and communication 
• Communication/computation and energy/performance trade-offs 
• Static power minimization and dynamic power management 
• Data coding, error detection, fault-tolerance and robustness 
• Prototypes and applications

Panel Sessions and Embedded Tutorials: 

Proposals for panel sessions and embedded tutorials are especially welcome. 
Please contact Program Chair (venki@dsdconf.org). 

Submission of papers: 

Regular Papers: Submissions can be made that describe innovative work in the 
scope of the Conference, and especially, in any of the above main areas of 
interest (please indicate the topic area). If you are submitting to a track 
please indicate the track area on the paper as: SS1 or SS2. Prospective authors 
are encouraged to submit their manuscripts for review electronically trough the 
following web page (http://www.dsdconf.org/) or by sending the paper to the 
Program Chair via email venki@dsdconf.org (only in the case of the web 
access problem) before the deadline for submission. Each manuscript should 
include the complete paper text, all illustrations, and references. The 
manuscript should conform to the required format single-spaced, double column, 
A4/US letter page size, 10-point size Times Roman font, up to 8 pages. In order 
to conduct a blind review, no indication of the authors' names should appear in 
the submitted manuscript. 

Case Study and Application Papers: Submissions can be made which report on 
state-of-the-art digital systems, design methods and/or tools, and (embedded) 
applications. Papers discussing lessons learned from practical experience, 
demanding or new applications, and experimental research are particularly 
encouraged. Manuscripts may be submitted in the same way as regular papers. 

The Program Committee will decide if papers will be accepted for a long 
presentation (30 minutes), short presentation (15 minutes), or as a poster. 
For long and short presentations, 8 pages will be assigned in the published 
proceedings. A poster presentation will be assigned 4 pages. Papers 
exceeding the page limit will be charged 50 Euro per page in excess. If the 
paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must pre-register and pay the 
conference fee before the deadline for submitting the camera-ready paper. 
Otherwise the paper will not be published in the proceedings. 

Check List: 
Prospective authors should check that the following information are included 
while submitting the paper(s) for refereeing purpose.
