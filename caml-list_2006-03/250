The extreme slowdown observed between 3.08.4 and 3.09.1 seems to be
fixed now.  The example "slow.ml" in the bugtracker now runs approx.
two times slower without thread support with the CVS-release in
comparison to 3.08.4 (due to now correct signal handling), and I don't
see any mentionable slowdown anymore if thread support is compiled in.

The version compiled with thread support is about 30 times slower than
the one compiled without, but there is does not seem to be any way
around this considering the need for locking mutexes, signaling
condition variables, etc.

I'm very happy to report that I haven't seen any instance of this
nasty problem in the effected application since the patch was
available in CVS, and we would quite likely have seen it already, as
it has been under fairly heavy load since then (for about a week).

All of the above has been tried with OCaml 3.09.2+dev6 (2006-03-22),
and I have proofread both patches, because we run our production
systems with them.  There are only a few additional patches in RC1,
which we will skip until the final release, so we do not expect any
unwanted surprises.

I haven't investigated any of the other fixes that have already made
it into the CVS-release we are running, but we haven't seen any
problems so far.

Thanks for all the hard work making OCaml even better!

Best regards,
Markus
