My apologies if this is not appropriate for this list.  I'm posting it
here because it's likely to be done in everyone's favorite language,
and because occasionally we get people making unsolicited applications
for jobs and internships at Merjis, and this may be of interest to
them.

Lastly, please don't apply to me - follow the instructions at the end
of the announcement.

Rich.

NEW RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES AT CRANFIELD UNIVERSITY

Two Masters by Research Studentships in
Computational Intelligence for Next Generation Web Design

Industrial Collaborator: Merjis – Web Marketing Technology and Services

Duration: 12 Months

Start Date: As Soon As Possible


Cranfield University is now advertising for TWO FULLY FUNDED MASTERS
BY RESEARCH STUDENTSHIPS in ‘Computational Intelligence for Next
Generation Web Design’. Cranfield University is a leading centre in
the application of Soft Computing for engineering decisions. Soft
Computing is a paradigm that offers a consortium of techniques for
handling real-life complexities such as imprecision and
uncertainty. Leveraging on Cranfield’s expertise in these areas, this
project will expand the boundary of Soft Computing research to the
domain of Web Design.

The focus of the two inter-linked Masters by Research projects will be
as follows:

(i) Intelligent Keyword Discovery: This project will analyse known
keywords and web server log files to find combinations of keywords to
bring in more customers. Computational intelligence techniques such as
Genetic Programming will be applied to yield fast results. This
project will explore natural language research (synonyms and
conceptual meanings) to increase the range of keywords represented
faster than web server log trawls.

(ii) Automated Evolution of Text Adverts: The aim of this project is
to apply classical engineering design support tools to develop more
successful adverts. This will be achieved by ‘intelligently’ combining
a catalogue of product related phrases and applying the
learnings. This project will explore a number of research avenues,
such as graphical advert evolution and the learnings required to
differentiate adverts for different networks and sites.

These studentships are available to UK and EU students
only. Applicants should have a First or Upper Second Class Honours
degree (or its equivalent) in Computer Science / IT or Engineering
disciplines. Interested Graduate students with Computer Science / IT
or Engineering background are invited to submit their detailed CV and
application form.

Stipend between £9,000 to £15,000 per year (tax free) is available to
suitably qualified UK and EU students only. In addition, tuition fees
will be paid by the project.

Application form is available at:
