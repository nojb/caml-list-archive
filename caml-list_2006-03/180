everyone--

Please, consider the following test case:

> (* test.ml *)
> class alfa =3D object(_:'self)
>   method x: 'a. ('a, out_channel, unit) format -> 'a =3D Printf.printf
> end
>
> class bravo a =3D object
>   val y: alfa =3D (a :> alfa)
>   initializer y#x "bravo initialized"
> end
>
> class charlie a =3D object
>   inherit bravo a
>   initializer y#x "charlie initialized"
> end

$ ocamlc -principal -o test test.ml
File "test.ml", line 13, characters 14-17:
Warning X: this use of a polymorphic method is not principal.

It warns about the use of the polymorphic method on the object in the =20=

membership of the base class, but only when it's invoked from the =20
derived class.  This confuses me.  Is this a bug in my code?  =20
(Perhaps, the word "principal" in this context doesn't mean what I =20
think it means.)

Or is it a bug in the compiler?  If it isn't a bug in the compiler, =20
could someone please explain to me why my program produced this =20
warning?  Thank you very much.
