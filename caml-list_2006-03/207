At the risk of being "irrelevant", I wanted to nail down exactly what 
assertion is being made here: are we talking about directly executing 
in assembly code the relevant x86[-64]/ppc/whatever instructions for 
"read-and-clear", or going through OS-dependent access routines like 
Windows' InterlockedExchange()?

Or: is the source of the dog slow behavior because of OS overhead, or 
is it a low-level issue like memory barriers/cache lines getting 
flushed/something else?
