Hi,

I'd like to know whether the current CVS-release of OCaml with tag
release309, which contains two recent bug fixes that are important to us
(I/O and signals related), is considered safe by INRIA for production use.
The patches for the two bug fixes seem correct to me, but there are a coupl=
e
of other changes (e.g. in code generation, etc.) about which I don't know
much about.  Are these other patches still going to see more testing before
official release?

 If not, we could as well use the current state of CVS rather than having t=
o
extract the two mentioned patches, especially if most of the other patches
were mostly bug fixes, too.

Regards,
Markus
