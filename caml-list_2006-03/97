In Atomcaml, the question whether there is a mutex or not simply does
not matter. They have their own scheduler (for bytecode), so there is no
need to have additional mutexes to protect the data structures Atomcaml
needs for itself, e.g. the log buffer. Being the scheduler is better
than any mutual exclusion...

If you ported Atomcaml to a kernel-level scheduler, you would surely
need mutexes (even in the uniprocessor case), simply because you need to
synchronize the kernel scheduler with user-level atomicity management.
So yes, for any real-world implementation, there are "mutexes under the
hood".

Anyway, I think this question is misleading. The point is not to
establish locking schemes that use the hardware better (i.e. that are
faster), but to help programmers writing correct code.
