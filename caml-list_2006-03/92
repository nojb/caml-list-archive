Interestingly, DragonflyBSD seems to be moving toward a slightly weaker
(relative to mutex) form of synchronisation which seems somewhat similar
to STMs:

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializing_tokens

I haven't look at it in detail, but it might be possible to use these to
implement STM in a mutex-free (cheap) way. (Though you might need some
level of hardware support unless you're content with page granularity
'exclusion').

Just thought I'd throw that in there. :)
