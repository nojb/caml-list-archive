Hello!

Hmm, I have written code to test this interesting application. Alas,
when I run it and was writing the captured continuation, I got a
problem:

Fatal error: exception Invalid_argument("output_value: abstract value
(Custom)")

I guess the marshalling function isn't happy about abstract values. I
really don't know which particular value it is complaining about: the
values used by the low-level C code are actually tuples and
integers. But there are a lot of abstract values in the delimcc OCaml
code, introduced to hide the representation.
