A stale NFS file handle normally means that the file disappeared on the
NFS server. (The server does not keep files open while clients have them
open in order to support proper POSIX semantics; it just re-opens them
whenever clients access the files.) As you are grepping the file, this
cannot be the case here.

Stale handles may also result if the NFS server is rebooted and
something goes wrong. Normally, the server keeps file handles across
reboots, but there are many reports that this does not work for some
users. Maybe these NFS servers are just buggy. (For example, some OS do
not guarantee stable device numbers, so every time the system is booting
the disks get new numbers, and all file handles become stale.)

You should also ensure that you are hard-mounting (option "o=hard" in
the mount command). Use NFS version 3 if possible.

In general, I would advise not to use NFS for long-running processes.
Write the file to /var/tmp and move it to its final location when it is
fully written.
