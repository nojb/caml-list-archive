Thanks for the public praise, I do need those, especially in the morning.
But you can send me private mails of appreciation, too.  Just not too often=
,
I might get used to it ;-)

Anyway, to be fair, it should be noted that Chris Hecker came up with the
idea for this patch and implemented a first proof of concept...
