Actually, MetaOcaml has most of the machinery needed to do this. I have recently 
released to the MetaOcaml hackers list a patch which actually enables native 
linking of ocamlopt generated code on Linux/x86. I have no clue as to the level 
of support for any other operating system/architecture. I must add that, 
although Natdynlink exists in MetaOcaml, it is definitely not a mature 
implementation. I had to solve several issues myself before I could get my 
AS/Xcaml to run any bit of a web application in native dynamic mode. Yet, after 
all the bugfixing, I only have a proof-of-concept implementation, which is not 
stable enough for production use. A lot more testing and feedback is needed the 
by the MetaOcamlers to get this feature to work right.

And, by the way, MetaOcaml is really much more stable than its official "alpha" 
status implies. As far as I seen while experimenting with building the AS/Xcaml, 
is that Natdynlink needs more work. The rest seems fairly robust.
