Wow.  I think I follow most of that, but ATM I do wish I spoke more than
about 2 words of French.  Some of the later examples I'm a little lost
on, but I've only given it a cursory glance so far.

While this is great for the modules, it doesn't seem as though there is
a way to indicate much other than the module/functor system (although it
is possible that this is due to my shortcomings in the French
language :).  Anything on the use of partial application, lexical
scoping, HOFs, etc. as design elements?
