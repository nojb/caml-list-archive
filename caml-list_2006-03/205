Thanks for the explanation.  I'd never have guessed that atomic instruction=

could be responsible for such a deterioration of performance.

So, it's time to go back to the drawing board.  Fortunately, it

Great!  Btw., since we are at it, you could also make us really happy by
fixing issue 3906 in the next release, too.  Now that the reason is clear
this should be very straightforward, and would save people who write certai=
n
kinds of threaded code a lot of headaches, because this bug can cause all
sorts of weird problems in long-running applications (freezes, crashes,
execution of random code, etc.), and was extremely hard to trigger and trac=
k
down.

Best regards,
Markus
