This would be a very interesting approach to explore.  Basile presented
pretty convincing numbers on ocamljit a couple of years ago.  Another
advantage of this approach is that if you also want to compile at run time
(with MetaOCaml), the bytecode compiler is much faster to compile than the
native code one.
