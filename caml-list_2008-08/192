********************************************************************************

UPDATED DEADLINES:

    * Submission for draft proceedings: NOW 1. Sept
    * Early Registration: NOW 2. Sept

Please note, that the draft proceedings do NOT require full papers; extended
abstracts will be considered too.

********************************************************************************

The aim of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. They provide an open forum for researchers who wish
to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, preliminary
results, etc. related primarily but not exclusively to the implementation and
application of functional languages. Formal proceedings are produced after
the symposium, so that authors can incorporate the feedback from discussions
at the symposium in their published papers.

Topics
======

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

    * language concepts
    * type checking
    * compilation techniques
    * (abstract) interpretation
    * generic programming techniques
    * automatic program generation
    * array processing
    * concurrent/parallel programming
    * concurrent/parallel program execution
    * functional programming on embedded systems
    * functional programming on multi-cores/ many-cores
    * heap management
    * runtime profiling
    * performance measurements
    * debugging and tracing
    * (abstract) machine architectures
    * verification
    * formal aspects
    * tools and programming techniques

Papers on applications or tools demonstrating the suitability of novel ideas
in any of the above areas and contributions on related theoretical work are
also welcomed. The change of the symposium name adding the term application,
introduced in 2004, is to reflect the broader scope IFL has gained over
the years.

Paper Submissions
=================

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers to be published in the
draft proceedings and to present them at the symposium. All contributions
must be written in English, conform to the Springer-Verlag LNCS series format
and not exceed 16 pages. The draft proceedings will appear as a Technical
Report of the School of Computer Science of the University of Hertfordshire.

Attendees of IFL 2008 will have the opportunity to submit a revised version
of their paper for post-symposium reviewing. As in previous years, we hope
that selected papers will be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series.

The Peter Landin Prize
======================

Since 2002 every year the Peter Landin Prize of 150 GBP is awarded to the
best paper presented at the symposium, as selected by the program committee.


Important Dates
===============

    * Submission for draft proceedings: NOW 1. Sept.
    * Early Registration: NOW 2. Sept.
    * Symposium: 10-12. September
    * Submission for post-refereeing: 14. November
    * Notification of acceptance / rejection: 23. January 2009
    * Submission of a camera ready version: 20. February 2009
