Hello Everyone,

I am getting every now and then a user having troubles compiling my  
applications because the file camlp4fulllib.cmxa is missing in their  
OCaml install. It seems like the ocaml distro's Makefile only build  
and install the camlp4 native  tools and libraries if make opt.opt is  
run. Unfortunately the compilation instructions say that make opt.opt  
is optional (many sysadmins don't do the optional step).

Shouldn't I expect that library to be part of the make opt  build? Or  
is it a bug in the Makfile? I couldn't find anything about it in the  
bug tracking system.

best,

Andres
