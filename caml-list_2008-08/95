You seem to have missed my point that I wrote the above *in error* so "Just
name the variables to be different!" is a clairvoyant response in this
case... I'm aware that that's what has to change :o)

That said, I do see your point that my proposed warning would mean that you
could never match a list tail with the same name as the whole list - a
definite weakness of my suggestion that I hadn't spotted before.

Personally, I'd be happy to live with always using two names in this context
- but perhaps this should therefore be the job of a home-grown postprocessor
on .annot files, rather than a compiler feature request?
