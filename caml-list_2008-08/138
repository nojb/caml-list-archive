Only if the choice of algorithm was independent of the language, which is 
rarely the case.

For example, Fortran programmers use arrays when they are unsuitable and their 
programs can be slower than scripting languages as a consequence. That is 
Fortran's fault.

Does the Darcs implementation overuse singly linked lists because they are 
more accessible? Are the reported stack overflows indicative of this? I don't 
know but I certainly wouldn't rule it out as a possibility.
