              LaSh08 - WORKSHOP ON LOGIC AND SEARCH
     Computation of structures from declarative descriptions
             Leuven, Belgium, November 6-7, 2008

IMPORTANT DATES:

Submission: August 25, 2008
Notification: September 15, 2008
Workshop: November 6-7, 2008

SCOPE:


LaSh is the first workshop that aims to bring together researchers
from the areas of Propositional Satisfiability (SAT), Constraint
Programming (CP), and Answer Set Programming (ASP). While so far SAT,
ASP and CP have developed as three independent disciplines, the past
years have shown a trend in which the application domains of SAT, CP
and ASP are more and more overlapping and the languages developed in
these areas tend to converge.  There is a growing awareness of the
potential of combining techniques and algorithms from the different
areas.

Objectives
==========

LaSh08 aims to offer a discussion forum for research in SAT, ASP and
CP.  We invite contributions on modeling languages,
methodologies, theoretical analysis, techniques, algorithms and
systems. The forum is an occasion to exchange ideas on the
state-of-the-art; to discuss specific technical problems; to formulate
challenges and opportunities ahead; to analyse differences and
simularities between the different areas; to study opportunities for
synergy and integration.

In particular, we would like to foster exchange at least on the
following topics:

 -- integrations of  SAT, ASP and/or CP technologies
 -- comparisons of modeling languages 
 -- criteria for choice of modeling languages 
	 (for modeling convenience or efficiency) 
 -- new algorithm directions
 -- efficient modeling  strategies 
 -- new  applications 
 -- complexity results, tractable subsets  
 -- completeness results (e.g. capturing complexity classes)
 -- methods for taking advantage of tractability results
 -- SAT modulo theories
 -- solver implementation techniques,
 -- algorithms for grounding 
 -- modeling languages and constructs 
	(aggregates, global constraints,..)
 -- search control and heuristics in the context of model generation
 -- symmetry breaking in model construction
 -- optimisation problems in model construction: 
     	-- languages for optimality criteria; 
     	-- algorithms for computing optimal models

LaSh08 will also provide an opportunity for presentation of implemented
systems and tools at a demo session. Thus, we invite submissions of
systems and tools that reflect the above ideas, and aim at facilitating
declarative problem solving, and making it practical and used.


Workshop format:
================

The workshops objective is to create an informal, stimulating
atmosphere for exchange of ideas. 


The invited speakers are well-known experts:
    * Pascal Van Hentenryck, Brown University, 
      "Constraint Programming at Work ".
    * Robert Nieuwenhuis, Technical University of Catalonia, 
      "The Barcelogic approach to search: fast and robust but expressive".

A panel with experts of the different fields will be organized to
discuss differences and similarities between the different areas,
opportunities for integration, etc.

Paper Format
============= 

Technical papers and application papers must be in the Springer LNCS
format and must not exceed 15 pages.

Experimental and tool papers are intended to describe implementations
of systems, to report experiments with implemented systems, or to
compare implemented systems. They can be at most 8 pages long in the
LNCS style.

The workshop has no formal proceedings; copies of the contributions
will be available.

Venue 
======

The workshop will take place in the Beguinage of Leuven,
Belgium. Leuven is an old flemish town, hosting the oldest university
of the lower countries. The Beguinage is a medieval city in the city,
where the beguines lived together to form a religious community. The
Beguinage is recognized as a Unesco World Heritage site.
