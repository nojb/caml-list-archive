     ACM SIGPLAN 2008 Developer Tracks on Functional Programming
		http://www.deinprogramm.de/defun-2008/
	     Victoria, BC, Canada, 25, 27 September, 2008
                 Held in conjunction with ICFP 2008:
	       http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2008/

DEFUN 2008 is the event for developers using functional languages:
Recognized experts on functional programming technologies share their
knowledge and professional skills in talks and tutorials in 10 exciting
tracks.  Find out how to best make functional programming work in your
development project!  Acquire new development skills!  Learn about other
functional languages!

The DEFUN program (attached) has tracks with the following types of
presentations:

- Half-day general language tutorials for specific functional languages,
  given by recognized experts for the respective languages.

- Half-day tutorials on specific techniques or the use of specific
  technologies in functional programming.

- 45-minute "how-to" talks that provide specific information on how to
  solve specific problems using functional programming. These talks
  focus on concrete examples, but provide useful information for
  developers working on different projects or in different contexts.

The developer tracks are complementary to ICFP itself (which is for
researchers). They are anchored by CUFP, the Haskell Symposium, and the
Erlang workshop.
