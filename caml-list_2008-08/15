I think you've interpreted me correctly.  I want a function that,  
given a hashtable, returns any element of the hashtable (assuming  
it's not empty).  This is the same as the function "choose" in the  
Set module.

A hashtable is not a poor choice of a data structure, because this  
"choose" functionality is not the only requirement for my data  
structure: I also want constant time search.  OCaml's Set data  
structure has O(log n)-time search.

Thanks,
