We're pleased to announce the latest release of bitstring, the project
which adds Erlang-style bitstrings and matching over bitstrings as a
syntax extension and library for OCaml.

  http://code.google.com/p/bitstring/
  http://bitstring.googlecode.com/files/ocaml-bitstring-1.9.9.tar.gz

This version is a release candidate (hopefully the last one) for 2.0.
So it needs testing to make sure it builds on other platforms and to
work out any final bugs.

We've spent a lot of time recently optimizing bitmatches.  For common
cases like destructuring byte-aligned integers and strings, small
functions are inlined into the generated code and/or we use fastpath
calls written in C.  Bitmatches are as much as 6 times faster.

We've also extended the test suite so that it covers as much of the
library as possible.  Now 82% of the library is covered by 'make test'
(http://et.redhat.com/~rjones/bitstring/coverage-report/)

Rich.
