I asked about 3.11 and when it would be released, and the answer at
that time was in late August:

http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/tree/browse_frm/thread/15126f960406e056/531fda06c1da700e

Obviously August (2008?) is slipping away.  Do we have any updates on
the status of 3.11?

The reason I ask is that the Fedora 10 beta deadline has slipped
because of the security intrusion two weeks ago, which means there is
a slim possibility of getting 3.11 into Fedora 10, if the release
happens real soon.

Rich.
