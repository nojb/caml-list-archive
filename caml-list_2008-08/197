As you may have seen in Pervasives.ml, format6 and string are actually
the same thing. Which means that you can Obj.magic your way around the
problem (gasp!) -- provided you have already checked manually that the
string actually represents the format you're interested in.

Of course, that's a tad risky. If I were you, I'd rather re-implement a
small unparsing language with a format comparable to printf's and a tiny
parser to go with it.

Does this help?

Cheers,
 David

P.S.:
 If you're interested, I've put together a little bit of documentation
on format* which I think can't be found in OCaml's doc [1]. Look for
"{7 Format4}" in the comments.
