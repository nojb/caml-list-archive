You should really avoid linking two modules with the same name. This can 
lead to all kind of errors and the compiler will not always catch you if 
they have the same signature. You can even break type safety by linking 
two modules with the same name and signature but with different 
implementations:

- without Dynlink: http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4231
(quite simple with ocaml; more difficult with ocamlopt, but still 
possible with -pack)

- with Dynlink: http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=4229
