Intellisense-style completion would be incredibly productive, particularly in 
the context of GUI programming but note that doing this for LablGTK2 would 
require the system to have used type inference and type annotations on the 
structurally-typed objects in the source code to determine the type of the 
start of an expression in order to propose completions for it.

I have found -dtypes to be very slow on large code bases and I assume this is 
because it generates such huge dump files. Perhaps this could be optimized 
somehow?

These are really exciting projects... :-)
