(Somewhat tangentially)

I often reuse variable names *in order to avoid errors*, e.g., I prefer
  let l = foo l in
to
  let l' = foo l in
when I have no need for the original l in subsequent code and both l and l'
have the same type. This prevents a potential bug (using l instead of l'
later).

Shadowing is useful when you could code in point-free style but decide to name
the intermediate values for clarity.
