This is a problem I faced myself. My advice is to make sure some module
is not linked twice in an executable. For this, I build a .cma with the
same objects as the executable (basically, add -a to the final linking
stage), and run ocamlobjinfo on the .cma.

Sometimes, it is not up to you. See for example:

I've also noticed this and submitted a patch upstream for this.
