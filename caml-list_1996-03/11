I am using CSL 1.12 (the native code compiler) and I have the problem
that my command line gets too long for my shell to handle.  I see no
solution to the problem other than trying to shorten the command line
but this undesirable.  Is there a way to partially link several modules
to do the compile in stages?  Also it would be nice if CSL could support
response files (files with the command line parameters) to allow for
unlimited argument lengths.

Thanks,

Kevin
