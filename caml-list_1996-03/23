Caml Special Light 1.15 has just been released. The main novelties are:

* Caml Special Light now runs under Windows NT and 95. Many thanks to
Kevin Gallo (Microsoft Research) who contributed his initial port.
In addition to the command-line compilers, there is also a graphical
user interface for the toplevel derived from Jean-Marie Geffroy's GUI
for Caml Light.

* csllex now generates tables for a table-driven automaton.
The resulting lexers are smaller and run faster.

* Completely automatic configuration script.

* Typing: more stringent checking of module type definitions against
manifest module type specifications.

* Toplevel: recursive definitions of values now working.

* Native-code compiler, all platforms:
        toplevel "let"s with refutable patterns now working;
        fixed bug in assignment to float record fields;
        direct support for floating-point negation and absolute value.

* Native-code compiler, x86: fixed bug with tail calls (with more than
4 arguments) from a function with a one-word stack frame.

* Native-code compiler, Sparc: problem with -compact fixed.

* Thread library: support for non-blocking writes; scheduler revised.

* Unix library: bug in gethostbyaddr fixed; bounds checking for read,
write, etc.

This release is distributed in source format, diffs from earlier
releases, and binaries for Windows, all at the usual place
