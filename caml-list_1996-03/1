Bonjour,

I need to explicitly manipulate modem/rs-232 control lines on a 32 bit
sun-0s4.1 system.  I was going to invoke ioctl_ptr to do the job.

The first argument to ioctl_ptr is an int.  The bits which determine a
modem control line request are 30 and 31.  Is there a trick I can use
to set only bit 30 and not 31 and vice-versa?

If no trick is available I will write my own
	ioctlx_ptr: file_descr -> string -> string -> int

-cheers
