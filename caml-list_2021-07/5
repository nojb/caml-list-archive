Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2021 will be a venue for researchers to present
and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe
results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.


Industrial track and topics of interest

This year's edition of IFL explicitly solicits original work concerning
*applications*
of functional programming in industry and academia. These contributions
will be reviewed by experts with an industrial background.

Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:

* language concepts
* type systems, type checking, type inferencing
* compilation techniques
* staged compilation
* run-time function specialisation
* run-time code generation
* partial evaluation
* (abstract) interpretation
* meta-programming
* generic programming
* automatic program generation
* array processing
* concurrent/parallel programming
* concurrent/parallel program execution
* embedded systems
* web applications
* (embedded) domain-specific languages
* security
* novel memory management techniques
* run-time profiling performance measurements
* debugging and tracing
* testing and proofing
* virtual/abstract machine architectures
* validation, verification of functional programs
* tools and programming techniques
* applications of functional programming in the industry, including
** functional programming techniques for large applications
** successes of the application functional programming
** challenges for functional programming encountered
** any topic related to the application of functional programming that is
interesting for the IFL community


Post-symposium peer-review

Following IFL tradition, IFL 2021 will use a post-symposium review process
to
produce the formal proceedings.

Before the symposium authors submit draft papers. These draft papers will b=
e
screened by the program chairs to make sure that they are within the scope
of
IFL. The draft papers will be made available to all participants at the
symposium.
Each draft paper is presented by one of the authors at the symposium.

After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a full paper,
incorporating feedback from discussions at the symposium. Work submitted to
IFL
may not be simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must
adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy. The program committee will
evaluate these submissions according to their correctness, novelty,
originality,
relevance, significance, and clarity, and will thereby determine whether th=
e
paper is accepted or rejected for the formal proceedings. We plan to publis=
h
these proceedings in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the
ACM Digital Library, as in previous years. Moreover, the proceedings will
also
be made publicly available as open access.

Peter Landin Prize

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the
symposium every year. The honoured article is selected by the program
committee
based on the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize
carries a cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.

ring together researchers actively engaged<br>in the implementation and app=
lication of functional and function-based<br>programming languages. IFL 202=
1 will be a venue for researchers to present and<br>discuss new ideas and c=
oncepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results<br>related to the i=
mplementation and application of functional languages and<br>function-based=
 programming.<br><br><br>Industrial track and topics of interest<br><br>Thi=
s year&#39;s edition of IFL explicitly solicits original work concerning *a=
pplications*<br>of functional programming in industry and academia. These c=
ontributions will be reviewed by experts with an industrial background.<br>=
<br>Topics of interest to IFL include, but are not limited to:<br><br>* lan=
guage concepts<br>* type systems, type checking, type inferencing<br>* comp=
ilation techniques<br>* staged compilation<br>* run-time function specialis=

measurements<br>* debugging and tracing<br>* testing and proofing<br>* virt=
ual/abstract machine architectures<br>* validation, verification of functio=

ctional programming in the industry, including<br>** functional programming=
 techniques for large applications<br>** successes of the application funct=
ional programming<br>** challenges for functional programming encountered<b=
r>** any topic related to the application of functional programming that is=
 interesting for the IFL community<br><br><br>Post-symposium peer-review<br=
><br>Following IFL tradition, IFL 2021 will use a post-symposium review pro=
cess to<br>produce the formal proceedings.<br><br>Before the symposium auth=
ors submit draft papers. These draft papers will be<br>screened by the prog=
ram chairs to make sure that they are within the scope of<br>IFL. The draft=
 papers will be made available to all participants at the symposium.=C2=A0<=
/div><div>Each draft paper is presented by one of the authors at the sympos=
ium.<br><br>After the symposium every presenter is invited to submit a full=
 paper,<br>incorporating feedback from discussions at the symposium. Work s=
ubmitted to IFL<br>may not be simultaneously submitted to other venues; sub=
missions must<br>adhere to ACM SIGPLAN&#39;s republication policy. The prog=
ram committee will<br>evaluate these submissions according to their correct=
ness, novelty, originality,<br>relevance, significance, and clarity, and wi=
ll thereby determine whether the<br>paper is accepted or rejected for the f=
ormal proceedings. We plan to publish<br>these proceedings in the Internati=
onal Conference Proceedings Series of the<br>ACM Digital Library, as in pre=
vious years. Moreover, the proceedings will also<br>be made publicly availa=
ble as open access.<br><br><br>Important dates<br><br>Submission deadline o=
