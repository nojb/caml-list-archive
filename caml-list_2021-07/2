INTRODUCTION

Reactive programming and event-based programming are two closely related =
programming styles that are becoming more important with the ever =
increasing requirement for applications to run on the web or on mobile =
devices, and the advent of advanced High-Performance Computing (HPC) =
technology.

A number of publications on middleware and language design -- so-called =
reactive and event-based languages and systems (REBLS) -- have already =
seen the light, but the field still raises several questions. For =
example, the interaction with mainstream language concepts is poorly =
understood, implementation technology is still lacking, and modularity =
mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Moreover, large applications are =
still to be developed, and, consequently, patterns and tools for =
developing large reactive applications are still in their infancy.

This workshop will gather researchers in reactive and event-based =
languages and systems. The goal of the workshop is to exchange new =
technical research results and to better define the field by developing =
taxonomies and discussing overviews of the existing work.

We welcome all submissions on reactive programming, functional reactive =
programming, and event- and aspect- oriented systems, including but not =
limited to:

* Language design, implementation, runtime systems, program analysis, =
software metrics, patterns and benchmarks.

* Formal models for reactive and event-based programming.

* Study of the paradigm: interaction of reactive and event-based =
programming with existing language features such as object-oriented =
programming, pure functional programming, mutable state, concurrency.

* Modularity and abstraction mechanisms in large systems.

* Advanced event systems, event quantification, event composition, =
aspect-oriented programming for reactive applications.

* Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), self-adjusting computation and =
incremental computing.

* Synchronous languages, modeling and verification of real-time systems, =
safety-critical reactive and embedded systems.

* Applications, case studies that show the efficacy of reactive =
programming.

* Empirical studies that motivate further research in the field.

* Patterns and best-practices.

* Related fields, such as complex event processing, reactive data =
structures, view maintenance, constraint-based languages, and their =
integration with reactive programming.

* Implementation technology, language runtimes, virtual machine support, =
compilers.

* IDEs, Tools.

The format of the workshop is that of a mini-conference where =
participants present their work. Because of the declarative nature of =
reactive programs, it is often hard to understand their semantics just =
by looking at the code. We therefore also encourage authors to use their =
slots for presenting their work based on live demos.


SUBMISSIONS

REBLS encourages submissions of two types of papers:

* Full papers: papers that describe complete research results. These =
papers will be published in the ACM digital library.

* In-progress papers: papers that have the potential of triggering an =
interesting discussion at the workshop or present new ideas that require =
further systematic investigation. These papers will not be published in =
the ACM digital library.

Format:

* Submissions should use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format with =
the two-column, sigplan Subformat, 10 point font, using Biolinum as =
sans-serif font and Libertine as serif font. All submissions should be =
in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the ACM SIGPLAN =
acmart Templates.

  The page http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format =
contains instructions for authors, and a package that includes an =
example file acmart-sigplan.tex.

* Authors are required to explicitly specify the type of paper in the =
submission (i.e., full paper, in-progress paper).

* Full papers can be up to 12 pages in length, excluding references. =
In-progress papers can be up to 6 pages, excluding references.

Instructions for the Authors:

* Papers should be submitted through: https://rebls21.hotcrp.com/

* For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the =
formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions =
will be summarily rejected.

* Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their =
papers will be held to a higher standard.

* All submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for =
Authorship that are detailed at =
https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors.

* Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN=E2=80=99s republication policy, =
as explained on the web at =
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication.
