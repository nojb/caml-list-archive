Subject: [Caml-list] Last call for Proposals for Workshops at FM2015 (20th
 Intl. Symposium on Formal Methods); 22.-26. June, 2015, Oslo

News: extra support for workshops offered by FME board

Deadline for proposals: November 14, 2014

CALL FOR PROPOSALS FOR WORKSHOPS

The 20th International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2015) will take 
place in Oslo, Norway, June 22-26, 2015. For this major event, we are 
inviting people to submit proposals for workshops.

The purpose of the workshops is to provide an informal setting for 
workshop participants to discuss technical issues, exchange research 
ideas, and to discuss and/or demonstrate applications. These workshops 
may be driven by fundamental academic interests or by needs from 
specific application domains. We encourage a diversity of workshops 
relating to different varieties of formal models. We also explicitly 
welcome satellite events in a non-traditional format, such as formal 
methods-related competitions.

To give an extra impulse to the success of workshops, the FME board 
offers the possibility to apply for an extra support of 500 euro to 
workshops and tutorials. This can be used e.g. to waive the fee of an 
invited speaker, the organizer(s) of a tutorial, partial coverage of a 
workshop dinner, making manual or books available to tutorial 
participants, or any specific things that may contribute to the 
scientific quality and/or social interaction within the workshop. Exact 
details on how to apply for this support will be provided when the 
workshop proposal is accepted.

All workshop proposals must be written in English.

Proposals for workshops should be no more than 3 pages in length and 
submitted to the Workshops chair before November 14, 2014 (see below).

A workshop proposal should include a draft call-for-papers containing at 
least the following information:

     Title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying 
the goals and the technical issues that will be its focus.
     The names and contact information (web page, email address) of the 
Programme Committee (PC) chairs, i.e., the workshop organisers. 
Moreover, a tentative list of workshop PC members should be given. We 
suggest one or two PC chairs and at least 10 PC members coming from 
different countries.

Moreover, the following additional information is requested:

     If the workshop has taken place before:
         How often has the workshop taken place so far?
         Which conference(s) has the workshop been colocated with so far?
         Number of participants in the last installment.
     A discussion of the proposed format and agenda.
     The proposed duration (half, one or two days).
     Procedures for selecting participants and papers.
     Potential invited speakers.
     Expected number of participants.

Each workshop programme chair will be responsible for the following:

     Producing a web page and a "Call for Papers/Participation" for 
their workshop.
     Providing a brief description of the workshop for the conference 
web page and programme, and providing a workshop web page the conference 
can refer to for details.
     Selecting the papers for the workshop proceedings and providing the 
camera ready copies ready for publication.
     All advertising of the workshop beyond web page advertising.
     Appointing session chairs, etc.

The local organisation of the conference will take care of the 
production of informal or electronic workshop proceedings, assuming that 
the proceedings are camera ready.

Submission of Workshop Proposals

Proposals should be submitted as a PDF file. Please send your proposals 
and any inquiries by electronic mail to the Workshop chairs:

Marieke Huisman <M.Huisman@utwente.nl> and Volker Stolz <stolz@ifi.uio.no>.

Dates

     Deadline for workshop proposals: November 14, 2014
     Notification of decision on workshops: November 28, 2014
