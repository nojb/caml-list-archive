Subject: [Caml-list] RDP 2015 Last Call for Workshops

[apologies for cross posting]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
RDP 2015 Last Call for Workshops
(Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming, June-July 2015, Warsaw, Poland)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


RDP 2015 is the eighth edition of the International Conference on
Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming, consisting of two main
conferences

* RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications)
* TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications)

Previous RDPs were held in 2003 in Valencia (Spain), 2004 in Aachen
(Germany), 2005 in Nara (Japan), 2007 in Paris (France), 2009 in
Brasilia (Brasil), 2011 in Novi Sad (Serbia), 2013 in Eindhoven (The
Netherlands).

We solicit proposals for satellite workshops of RDP 2015 that are
related in topics to one or both of the RDP conferences.

We plan the workshops to proceed for up to 2 days (possibilities of
longer workshops should be discussed with the organisers). It is
tradition at RDP that attendance to workshops is open to participants
of parallel events, similar to the way FLoC workshops are run. There
will be one day (Sunday, June 28, 2015) reserved for workshops only,
however, it will also be possible to run workshops on the other days
in parallel to one of the main conferences.

RDP will provide the possibility to print workshop proceedings,
details of the procedure will be posted later by the local organising
committee. RDP will not be able to reimburse invited workshop speakers
for travel or living expenses, though it may be possible to waive part
of the registration fees for invited speakers. The priority of RDP
will be to keep registration fees for the conferences and workshops
low.

If you want to organise a workshop, please send the following
information to rdp15@mimuw.edu.pl:

* Workshop title and description of the topic
* Names and affiliations of the organisers
* Pointers to descriptions of previous editions of the workshop, if any
* Proposed workshop duration (from one day to two days)
* Proposed format and agenda (for example, paper presentations,
   tutorials, demo sessions, etc.)
* Plans for invited speakers or special sessions (round-table
   discussion, tutorials, etc.)
* Estimate of the audience size
* Procedures for selecting papers and participants
* Plans for the publication of proceedings (informal proceedings
   distributed to participants, electronic journal, proceedings with
   separate selection process, etc.)
* Other potential organisational issues
