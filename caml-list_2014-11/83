*** Call for Tutorials, Demos and Workshops ***

5th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics

WIMS 2015

July 13-15, 2015, St. Raphael Resort, Limassol, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/wims2015/


The 5th International Conference on Web Intelligence, Mining and Semantics
(WIMS 2015) organization committee invites proposals for tutorials,
demonstrations (on new applications) and workshops providing in-depth
background on subjects that are of broad interest to the Web Mining and Web
Semantics community. The overall purpose of tutorials and workshops is to
provide participants with the opportunity to present and discuss novel
research ideas in areas of Web intelligence, Web mining and Web semantics,
with a particular emphasis on the fundamental interaction between these
vibrant fields of research and development. The purpose of demonstrations
is=A0to provide developers with a place to showcase new practical and innov=
ative
implementations of state-of-the-art systems in the areas of interest to the
Web Intelligence and Semantics community.

Tutorials and workshops provide a forum for an intensive and focused
scientific exchange amongst researchers and practitioners interested in a
particular topic and a meeting venue for the community. Organizers may
structure tutorials/workshops as they see fit, possibly including invited t=
alks,
panel discussions, presentations of work in progress, peer-reviewed papers,
demonstrations or some combination. A tutorial/workshop could be
scheduled for a half a day or a full day, depending on potential interest a=
nd
organizers preference.

The proposals should address topics that satisfy the following criteria:

* The topic falls in the general scope of WIMS 2015
    (http://Cyprusconferences.org/wims2015).
* There is a clear focus on a specific theme, technology, problem, or
    application.
* There is a sufficiently large audience interested in the topic.

The organizers of successful workshops will be responsible for their own
reviewing process, website, arranging invited speakers and coordinate the
collection and delivery of camera ready material. There is an opportunity f=
or
papers accepted in workshops to be published in the WIMS 2015 proceedings
and disseminated through the ACM Digital Library, provided they follow the
ACM submission guidelines and template and adhere to camera-ready
submission and registration deadlines as those set for the main conference.
Selected extended papers will be invited to appear in a special issue of a
reputed journal in the field.
