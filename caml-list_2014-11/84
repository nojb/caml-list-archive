Work environment
----------------
Software Technology is a core field of research within Computing 
Science. It addresses the study and analysis of approaches to the 
specification, design, development and evolution of software. With a 
focus on program construction, it designs programming and language 
formalisms and methodologies, constructs tools to support these, and 
develops techniques for automated program analysis (e.g., type systems) 
and software generation. The research methods used in t field range from 
mathematical proofs to the development of practical development 
platforms and the empirical evaluation of such platforms. Research 
developments in the field of Software Technology are guided to a large 
extent by emerging technologies and information needs in society, which 
require that reliable software be developed quickly and effectively.

According to the Information Society Technologies Advisory Group (ISTAG) 
of the Commission of the European Communities, Information Society & 
Media, software is instrumental in propagating innovative ideas from a 
scientific research laboratory to profitable application, and hence, the 
software has become the basis for innovation and the prime industrial 
differentiator.
