Subject: [Caml-list] ICFP 2015: Call for Papers

=====================================================================

 20th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming

 ICFP 2015

 Vancouver, Canada, August 31 - September 2, 2015

 http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2015

=====================================================================

Important Dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Submissions due:  Friday, February 27 2015, 23:59 UTC-11
   Author response:  Tuesday, April 21, 2015
                     through Thursday, 23 April, 2015
      Notification:  Friday, May 1, 2015
    Final copy due:  Friday, June 12, 2015

Scope
~~~~~

ICFP 2015 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional
programming.  Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to
practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to
application.  The scope includes all languages that encourage
functional programming, including both purely applicative and
imperative languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency,
or parallelism.  Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Language Design: concurrency, parallelism, and distribution; modules;
  components and composition; metaprogramming; type systems;
  interoperability; domain-specific languages; and relations to
  imperative, object-oriented, or logic programming.

* Implementation: abstract machines; virtual machines; interpretation;
  compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; garbage
  collection and memory management; multi-threading; exploiting
  parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services,
  components, or low-level machine resources.

* Software-Development Techniques: algorithms and data structures;
  design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof
  assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling.

* Foundations: formal semantics; lambda calculus; rewriting; type
  theory; monads; continuations; control; state; effects; program
  verification; dependent types.

* Analysis and Transformation: control-flow; data-flow; abstract
  interpretation; partial evaluation; program calculation.

* Applications: symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial
  intelligence; systems programming; distributed-systems and web
  programming; hardware design; databases; XML processing;
  scientific and numerical computing; graphical user interfaces;
  multimedia and 3D graphics programming; scripting; system
  administration; security.

* Education: teaching introductory programming; parallel programming;
  mathematical proof; algebra.

* Functional Pearls: elegant, instructive, and fun essays on
  functional programming.

* Experience Reports: short papers that provide evidence that
  functional programming really works or describe obstacles that have
  kept it from working.

If you are concerned about the appropriateness of some topic, do not
hesitate to contact the program chair.

Abbreviated instructions for authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* By Friday, 27 February 2015, 23:59 UTC-11 (anywhere in the world),
  submit a full paper of at most 12 pages (6 pages for an Experience
  Report) in standard ACM conference format, including bibliography,
  figures, and appendices.

The deadlines will be strictly enforced and papers exceeding the page
limits will be summarily rejected.

* Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a submission,
  on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at it.

* Each submission must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy, as
  explained on the web at

      http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

* Authors of resubmitted (but previously rejected) papers have the
  option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous
  submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these previous
  reviews in the present submission.  If a reviewer identifies
  him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and wishes to
  see how his/her comments have been addressed, the program chair will
  communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous
  review.  Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of
  the previous reviews.

Overall, a submission will be evaluated according to its relevance,
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity.  It should
explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly
identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work.  The technical
content should be accessible to a broad audience.  Functional Pearls
and Experience Reports are separate categories of papers that need not
report original research results and must be marked as such at the
time of submission.  Detailed guidelines on both categories are on the
conference web site.

Proceedings will be published by ACM Press.  Authors of accepted
submissions will have a choice of one of three ways to manage their
publication rights.  These choices are described at

    http://authors.acm.org/main.html

Presentations will be videotaped and released online if the presenter
consents.  The proceedings will be freely available for download from
the ACM Digital Library from one week before the start of the
conference until two weeks after the conference.

Formatting: Submissions must be in PDF format printable in black and
white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by
Ghostscript. Papers must adhere to the standard ACM conference format:
two columns, nine-point font on a ten-point baseline, with columns
20pc (3.33in) wide and 54pc (9in) tall, with a column gutter of 2pc
(0.33in).  A suitable document template for LaTeX is available at

    http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm

Submission: Submissions will be accepted on the web using a link
that will be posted at

    http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/

Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before
the submission deadline using the same web interface.

Author response: Authors will have a 72-hour period, starting at 0:00
UTC on Tuesday, 21 April 2015, to read reviews and respond to them.

ACM Author-Izer is a unique service that enables ACM authors to
generate and post links on either their home page or institutional
repository for visitors to download the definitive version of their
articles from the ACM Digital Library at no charge. Downloads through
Author-Izer links are captured in official ACM statistics, improving
the accuracy of usage and impact measurements. Consistently linking
the definitive version of ACM article should reduce user confusion
over article versioning. After your article has been published and
assigned to your ACM Author Profile page, please visit

    http://www.acm.org/publications/acm-author-izer-service

to learn how to create your links for free downloads from the ACM DL.

Publication date: The official publication date of accepted papers
is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital
Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day
of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline
for any patent filings related to published work.
