*** Preliminary Call for Papers and Call for Workshop Proposals ***

The 9th International and Interdisciplinary Conference on Modeling
and Using Context (CONTEXT 2015)

2-6 November 2015, Golden Bay Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

http://cyprusconferences.org/context2015


The CONTEXT conferences are the world's prime forum for presentation and
exchange of insights and=A0cutting-edge results from the wide range of
disciplines concerned with context.

The main theme of CONTEXT 2015 is "Back to the roots", focusing on the
importance of interdisciplinary cooperations and studies of the phenomenon.
Context, context modeling and context comprehension are central topics in
linguistics, philosophy, sociology, artificial intelligence, computer=A0sci=
ence,
art,=A0law, organizational sciences, cognitive science, psychology, etc. an=
d are
also essential for the effectiveness=A0of modern, complex and distributed
software systems.

CONTEXT 2015 invites high-quality contributions from researchers and
practitioners in foundational=A0studies, applications and evaluations of
modeling and use of context in all relevant fields. Areas of interest=A0inc=
lude,
but are not limited to, the role of context seen from different perspective=
s in:

=B7=A0Agent-based architectures
=B7=A0Ambient intelligence
=B7=A0Cognition and perception by humans and artifacts
=B7=A0Context-aware and situated systems
=B7=A0Context modeling tools
=B7=A0Communication and dialogue
=B7=A0Data analysis and visualization
=B7=A0Decision making
=B7=A0Discourse comprehension and representation
=B7=A0Engineering, e.g., in transport networks, industrial plants etc.
=B7=A0Experimental philosophy and=A0experimental pragmatics

=B7=A0Machine learning
=B7=A0Ontology/ies
=B7=A0Semantics and Pragmatics
=B7=A0Smart and interactive spaces

Proceedings

Accepted papers and poster abstracts will be published in a volume of the
Springer LNAI series.

Submission format

Submissions may be either full papers of up to 14 pages (in Springer LNCS
format) or poster abstracts of=A04-6 pages. Full papers may be accepted as =
such
with oral presentation, or their authors may be invited to=A0prepare a post=
er
abstract. Detailed formatting and submissions instructions will be provided.

Conference events

CONTEXT 2015 will include paper presentation sessions, a poster and
demonstration session, two days=A0of workshops, and a doctoral consortium as
well as keynote talks and a panel discussion. Workshops=A0and the doctoral
consortium will circulate separate calls for papers and participation, which
will=A0also be=A0available at the conference web site. All accepted authors=
 will have
the option of presenting a system=A0demonstration at the poster session.

Important dates

Full papers and posters:
=B7=A0Submission deadline: June 1, 2015
=B7=A0Notification: July 13, 2015
=B7=A0Final version: August 17, 2015

Workshops

CONTEXT 2015 workshops will provide a platform for presenting novel and
emerging ideas in the use and the modelling of context in a less formal and
possibly more focused way than the conference itself. The format of each
workshop is to be determined by the organisers, but it is expected that
workshops will contain ample time for general discussion and engagement by
all participants - not just those presenting papers. Workshops that foster
collaboration, discussion, group problem-solving and community-building
initiatives are particularly encouraged. Researchers and practitioners from
all relevant fields are invited to submit proposals for review.

Proposals for workshops should contain:

1. A title and brief (2-page max) description of the workshop topic and
content.
2. The desired workshop length (one day, two days or a half day) and an
estimate of the number of attendees.
3. The names, postal addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses of
the organisers, with one-paragraph statements of their research interests
and areas of expertise.
4. A list of potential members of the program committee, with an
indication of which members have already signed up.
5. A description of any shared tasks associated with the workshop.
6. A description of special requirements for technical needs.
7. An indication of whether posters are likely to be included in the
workshop program.

Please submit proposals in plain text in the body of an email to the
workshop organiser Samia Oussena (samia.oussena@uwl.ac.uk)
no later than March 20, 2015.

Notification of acceptance of workshop proposals will occur no later
than April 1, 2015.

Organisers of accepted workshops will be responsible for publicising and
running the workshop, including reviewing submissions and producing the
camera-ready workshop proceedings and a possibly printed version; the
conference website may link to online workshop proceedings. It is crucial
that organisers commit to all deadlines.

Workshop organisers cannot accept for publication papers that will be (or
have been) published elsewhere, although they are free to set their own
policies on simultaneous submission and review. At least one organiser of an
accepted workshop is expected attend and lead the workshop; any participant
and speaker must register for the conference. The CONTEXT 2015 organisers
will set the workshop fees, provide rooms, equipment, technical support,
coffee and lunch breaks.
