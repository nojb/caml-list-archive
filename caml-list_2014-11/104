Subject: Re: [Caml-list] teaching OCaml

There are custom toplevels for js_of_ocaml where you can experiment with 
reactive and interactive features, a bit like Elm's "IDE".

See https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml#toplevel and 
http://ocsigen.github.io/js_of_ocaml/#version=4.02.0
The source code is [here][1] and should be quite easy to modify if you 
want to add a library (or modify the UI to make the drawing area bigger).
