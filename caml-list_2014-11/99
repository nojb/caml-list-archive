Ah, sorry for the typo, I meant to say: "the patch is not guaranteed to 
report appropriate error messages for code that would not type-check 
with the -principal flag activated".

In other words, "the patch works as long as the the type-checking of the 
code does not depend on the order in which unifications are performed".

The reason is that the patch performs unification in a different order 
than the standard algorithm (precisely to avoid left-right bias).

Then, the question of whether "-new-type-error" should systematically 
compile all the code (including the one that does not contain type 
errors) using "-principal" is another question, I'm not sure what is the 
best choice.
