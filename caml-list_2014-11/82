TAMC 2015 aims at bringing together a wide range of researchers with
interests in computational theory and applications. For more than 10
years, the conference series "Theory and Applications of Models of
Computing" has fostered interactions and collaborations between both
theoretical and applied researchers working on all aspects of
computations and the ways to model it.

Lance Fortnow (Georgia Institute of Technology),
Miklos Santha (CNRS, Univ. Paris Diderot and CQT, Nat. Univ. of Singapore),
Alexandra Shlapentokh (East Carolina University).

Conference Chair: Sanjay Jain.
