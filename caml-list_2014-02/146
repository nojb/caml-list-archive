Subject: [Caml-list] First Call for Papers: 8th Verification Workshop
 (VERIFY 2014), Focus Theme: Verification Beyond IT Systems

[Apologies for cross posting]

                        FIRST CALL FOR PAPERS
                        
         8th International Verification Workshop (VERIFY’14)
              in connection with IJCAR 2014 at FLoC 2014
                  July 23–24, 2014, Vienna, Austria

                       http://vsl2014.at/verify


The formal  verification of  critical information  systems has  a long
tradition  as one  of  the  main areas  of  application for  automated
theorem proving. Nevertheless, the area is of still growing importance
as the number of computers  affecting everyday life and the complexity
of  these systems  are  both  increasing. The  purpose  of the  VERIFY
workshop  series is  to  discuss problems  arising  during the  formal
modeling and  verification of  information systems and  to investigate
suitable solutions.  Possible perspectives include those  of automated
theorem proving, tool support, system engineering, and applications.

The VERIFY  workshop series aims  at bringing together people  who are
interested in the development of safety and security critical systems,
in formal  methods, in  the development  of automated  theorem proving
techniques,  and  in  the   development  of  tool  support.  Practical
experiences gained in  realistic verifications are of  interest to the
automated theorem proving community and new theorem proving techniques
should  be transferred  into practice.  The overall  objective of  the
VERIFY workshops is to identify  open problems and to discuss possible
solutions under the theme

What are the verification problems? What are the deduction techniques?

The 2014 edition of VERIFY aims for extending the verification methods
for processes implemented in hard-  and software to processes that may
well include computer-assistance, but have  a large part or a frequent
interaction  with non-computer-based  process  steps.  Hence the  2014
edition will run under the focus theme

                    Verification Beyond IT Systems

A  non-exclusive list of application areas  with these characteristics
are

       * Ambient assisted living
       * Intelligent home systems and processes
       * Business systems and processes
       * Production logistics systems and processes
       * Transportation logistics
       * Clinical processes
       * Social systems and processes (e.g., voting systems)

The scope of VERIFY includes topics such as

       * ATP techniques in verification
       * Case studies (specification & verification)
       * Combination of verification systems
       * Integration of ATPs and CASE-tools
       * Compositional & modular reasoning
       * Experience reports on using formal methods
       * Gaps between problems & techniques
       * Formal methods for fault tolerance
       * Information flow control security
       * Refinement & decomposition
       * Reliability of mobile computing
       * Reuse of specifications & proofs
       * Management of change
       * Safety-critical systems
       * Security models
       * Tool support for formal methods

Submissions are encouraged in one of the following two categories:

A. Regular  paper:  Submissions  in  this  category  should   describe
   previously unpublished  work (completed or in  progress), including
   descriptions of research, tools,  and applications.  Papers must be
   5-14  pages  long (in  EasyChair  style)  or  6-15 pages  long  (in
   Springer LNCS style).

B. Discussion  papers: Submissions  in this  category are  intended to
   initiate discussions and hence should address controversial issues,
   and may include  provocative statements. Papers must  be 3-14 pages
   long  (in EasyChair  style) or  3-15 pages  long (in  Springer LNCS
   style).
