This would actually be quite useful for Mirage compilation, since we've
had quite a few (~10) reports of people attempting to compile up OCaml
kernels intended for Xen (x86_64) using x86_32 host machines, with one
brave chap even trying on an ARM32 Chromebook.  The output kernels are
spun up on a remote cloud service like Amazon or Rackspace, and so being
flexible about the host machine is helpful.

(This scenario is certainly less important than the 32-bit target for
a 64-bit host, but I just thought I'd point it out)
