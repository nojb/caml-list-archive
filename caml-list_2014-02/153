Quite a while back I hacked the OCaml compiler to enable cross-
compilation.  It kinda-sorta worked, but it was obvious [at that time,
2008 apparently] that it would take a lot of work upstream to make the
compiler friendly to cross-compilation.

I haven't look at cross-compilation of OCaml since, although of course
I'm still working on Fedora packaging, Aarch64 porting &c so I am
still fairly familiar with the compiler build system & internals.

Anyway, not sure what you were hoping I could do, except wish you good luck!

Rich.
