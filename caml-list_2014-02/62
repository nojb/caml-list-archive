*3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in 
Education (TFPIE 2014)*
May 25, 2014
Utrecht University
Soesterberg, The Netherlands
(http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/tfpie14/ 
<http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/%7Ejlc/tfpie14/>)


The 3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in 
Education, TFPIE 2014, will be co-located with the Symposium on Trends 
in Functional Programming (TFP 2014) <http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/TFP2014/> 
at Soesterberg, at the "Kontakt der Kontinenten" 
<http://www.kontaktderkontinenten.nl/conferentiehotel/home.aspx?lang=en-US> 
hotel in the Netherlands on Sunday, May 25th.  TFP will follow from May 
26-28.


The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, teachers and professionals 
that use, or are interested in the use of, functional programming in 
education. TFPIE aims to be a venue where novel ideas, classroom-tested 
ideas and work-in-progress on the use of functional programming in 
education are discussed. The one-day workshop will foster a spirit of 
open discussion by having a review process for publication after the 
workshop. The program chair of TFPIE 2014 will screen submissions to 
ensure that all presentations are within scope and are of interest to 
participants. Potential presenters are invited to submit an extended 
abstract (4-6 pages) or a draft paper (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. 
The authors of accepted presentations will have their preprints and 
their slides made available on the workshop's website/wiki. Visitors to 
the TFPIE 2014 website/wiki will be able to add comments. This includes 
presenters who may respond to comments and questions as well as provide 
pointers to improvements and follow-up work.  After the workshop, 
presenters will be invited to submit (a revised version of) their 
article for review. The PC will select the best articles for publication 
in the journalElectronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science 
(EPTCS) <http://published.eptcs.org/>. Articles not selected for 
presentation and extended abstracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC.

TFPIE workshops have previously been held in St Andrews, Scotland (2012) 
and in Provo Utah, USA (2013).

*Program Committee*

James Caldwell, (Program Chair) University of Wyoming
Peter Achten, Radboud University, Nijmgen
Edwin Brady, University of St Andrews, St Andrews
Jurriaan Hage, Universiteit Utrecht
Philip Holzenspies, University of Twente
Daniel R. Licata, Wesleyan University
Marco T Morazan, Seton Hall University
Christian Skalka, University of Vermont
David Van Horn, Northeastern University

*Submission Guidelines*

There will be two types of presentations at TFPIE 2014.  Regular papers 
and "best lecture" presentations.  The best lecture talks are intended 
to allow for presentations or short lectures of purely pedagogical 
material. Papers and abstracts can be submitted via easychair at the 
following link: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfpie2014

*Papers*

TFPIE 2014 welcomes submissions describing techniques used in the 
classroom, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any 
creative use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or 
outside Computer Science. Topics of interest include, but are not 
limited to:

* FP and beginning CS students
* FP and Computational Thinking
* FP and Artificial Intelligence
* FP in Robotics
* FP and Music
* Advanced FP for undergraduates
* FP in graduate education
* Engaging students in research using FP
* FP in Programming Languages
* FP in the high school curriculum
* FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics
* FP and Philosophy
*
*
*Best Lectures*

In addition to papers, this year we are requesting "best lecture" 
presentations.  What's your best lecture topic in an FP related course? 
  Do you have a fun way to present FP concepts to novices or perhaps an 
especially interesting presentation of a difficult topic?  In either 
case, please consider sharing it.  Best lecture topics will be selected 
for presentation based on a short abstract describing the lecture and 
its interest to TFPIE attendees.

*Important Dates*

* 1 February 2014: TFPIE submissions open on easychair.
* 7 April 2014: TFP and TFPIE registration opens
* 21 April 2014: Submission deadline for draft TFPIE papers and abstracts
* 27  April 2014: Notification of acceptance for presentation
* 25 May 2014: Presentations in Soesterberg, Netherlands
* 29 June 2014: Full papers for EPTCS proceedings due.
* 16 August 2014: Notification of acceptance for proceedings
*  8 September 2014: Camera ready copy due for EPTCS

Submission of an abstract implies no obligation to submit a full paper; 
abstracts with no corresponding full versions by the full paper deadline 
will be considered as withdrawn.  At least one author from each accepted 
presentation must attend the workshop.
