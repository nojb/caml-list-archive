* Paper notification:      July 7, 2014


SCOPE

Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are=20
revolutionizing software development just as automation and componentizatio=
n=20
revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of abstraction in software=
=20
specification has been a fundamental goal of the computing community for=20
several decades. Key technologies for automating program development and=20
lifting the abstraction level closer to the problem domain are=20
*Generative Programming* for program synthesis, *Domain-Specific Languages*=
=20
(DSLs) for compact problem-oriented programming notations, and correspondin=
g=20
*Implementation Technologies* aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and=
=20
evolution. As the field matures *Applications* and *Empirical Results* are=
=20
of increasing importance.

The International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experien=
ces=20
(GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in technique=
s=20
that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component=20
deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality,=20
and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to explori=
ng=20
cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to foster furth=
er=20
cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the programming=20
languages research communities.



SUBMISSIONS

We seek research papers of up to 10 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style=20
(sigplanconf.cls, see
http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm) reporting original and
unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, or
experimental research that contribute to scientific knowledge in the
areas listed below (the PC chair can advise on appropriateness).

4-page short papers and tool demonstrations are also accepted (see website).


TOPICS

GPCE seeks contributions on all topics related to generative software and=20
its properties. As technology is maturing, this year, we are particularly
looking for empirical evaluations in this context. Key topics include=20
(but are certainly not limited too):

* Generative software
    Domain-specific languages
    Product lines
    Metaprogramming
    Program synthesis
    Implementation techniques and tool support
* Properties of generative software
    Correctness of generators and generated code
    Reuse and evolution
    Modularity, separation of concerns, understandability, and maintainabil=
ity
    Performance engineering, nonfunctional properties
    Application areas and engineering practice
* Empirical evaluations of all topics above

A more detailed list of topics can be found on the website.

Examples of key challenges in the field are
*   Synthesizing code from declarative specifications
*   Supporting extensible languages and language embedding
*   Ensuring correctness and other nonfunctional properties of generated co=
de;=20
    proving generators correct
*   Improving error reporting with domain-specific error messages
*   Reasoning about generators; handling variability-induced complexity in=
=20
    product lines
*   Providing efficient interpreters and execution languages
*   Human factors in developing and maintaining generators

Note on empirical evaluations: GPCE is committed to the empirical
evaluation of generative software. Publishing empirical papers at
programming-language venues can be challenging. We understand the
frustration of authors when, for example, reviews simply recommend
repeating entire experiments with human subjects with slight
deviations in execution. To alleviate such problems, we have recruited
forto program committee experts who routinely work with empirical
methods, and we will actively seek external reviews where
appropriate. During submissions, authors can optionally indicate that
a paper contains substantial empirical work, and we will endeavor have
to the paper reviewed by experts familiar with the empirical research
methods that are used in the paper. The program-committee discussions
will reflect on both technical contributions and research methods.

Policy: Incremental improvements over previously published work should
have been evaluated through systematic, comparative, empirical, or
experimental evaluation.  Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN's
republication policy (http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm).
Please contact the program chair if you have any questions about how
this policy applies to your paper (chairs@gpce.org).
