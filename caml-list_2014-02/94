Subject: [Caml-list] FSFMA: call for papers (FM satellite)

====================================================================
                           Call for papers

                              FSFMA 2014
  2nd French Singaporean Workshop in Formal Methods and Applications

              http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/fsfma2014/
====================================================================


The 2nd French Singaporean Workshop in Formal Methods and Applications 
(FSFMA 2014) aims at sharing research interests and launching 
collaborations in the area of formal methods and their applications.

The scientific subject of the workshop covers (but is not limited to) 
areas such as formal specification, model checking, verification, 
program analysis/transformation, software engineering, and applications 
in major areas of computer science, including aeronautics and aerospace.

The workshop will bring together researchers and industry R&D experts 
from all countries together to exchange their knowledge, discuss their 
research findings, and explore potential collaborations.

Round tables will focus on French-Singaporean funding and cooperation 
opportunities.

A PhD session will allow Master and PhD students to present their work.

The workshop will take place on 12th-13th May, 2014, in Singapore as a 
satellite event of FM 2014.

  TOPICS OF THE WORKSHOP
=================

The main theme of the workshop is to establish links between academic 
and industry scientists interested in methods and techniques for 
constructing reliable systems using formal methods. The scientific 
topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- concurrent and distributed systems
- formal specification and semantics
- infinite-state and parameterized systems
- model checking algorithms
- SAT and SMT solvers
- security and privacy
- software engineering and formal methods
- specification and verification (hardware and embedded systems, 
probabilistic and real-time systems, etc.)
- case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods
- tools and industrial applications
- applications in aeronautics and aerospace


=================
  SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
=================

Two kinds of papers are welcome:
- regular papers
- PhD papers (for the doctoral session).
The content of papers should be original and not submitted elsewhere. 
All papers will be assigned to at least three reviews.

The page limit is 12 pages (regular paper) and 6 pages (PhD paper) in 
the EPTCS format.
Accepted papers in both categories will be published by the Electronic 
Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS), a free open-access 
and online electronic proceedings series, referenced in major databases 
such as DBLP.
The proceedings are published under the Creative Commons CC-BY license.
Hereby, the authors retain their copyright.

Submission will be made in English in PDF format through Easychair:
