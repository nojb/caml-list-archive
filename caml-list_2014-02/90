I would suggest to replace by:
(A) Content is released under CC BY-SA version 4.0 or above

So that when the maintainers of the website want to upgrade the
CC-by-sa license to a newer version, they don't have to ask to all the
contributers.

I would suggest to replace the word "design" by "style guide" or
"style manual", because for French speaking people it's quite
ambiguous, and we don't know if "design" also include pieces of CSS
code that could be reused without any visual similarities.

Also what about people willing to just archive the website, like for
example every link on the French Wikipedia was a cached archive.

Another case, what about people willing to reuse the current "design"
of ocam.org far long time after ocaml.org doesn't use this current
visual style anymore? you know like all the fan website of nostalgics.
Currently copyright extends to 70 years, what don't just reduce it to
10 years after ocaml.org don't use this current visual style anymore?

> (E) OCaml logo is released under the UNLICENSE [3].

The UNLICENSE license is a licence for softwares.
A logo is not a software.
I would suggest to replace in the text of the UNLICENSE license the
word "software" by "piece of work" or something similar which would be
more relevant (the English language is not my born language, so please
correct this rewording if it should.)

It would be nice too if the rephrase "software" by "piece of work"
would also be made for licenses applying on the code, so that when
someone makes a piece of work that includes at the same time code,
graphics and music everything could be licensed under the same
conditions in an uniformly way which would not introduce
hierarchisation in the different kind of works.

Anyway very nice proposal,
good luck!
