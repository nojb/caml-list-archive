﻿   CICM 2014 - Conferences on Intelligent Computer Mathematics
        July 7-11, 2014 at University of Coimbra, Portugal

             http://www.cicm-conference.org/2014

                    Second Call for Papers

-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Co-located Workshops *
- CCA'14: Workshop on Compact Computer Algebra 
  (organiser: Elena Smirnova)
- MathUI'14: Workshop on Mathematical User Interfaces 
  (organisers: Andrea Kohlhase, Paul Libbrecht)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

As   computers   and   communications  technology   advance,   greater
opportunities  arise for  intelligent mathematical  computation. While
computer  algebra, automated  deduction,  mathematical publishing  and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we  are now seeing  increasing opportunities  for synergy  among these
areas.  The  Conferences on  Intelligent  Computer Mathematics  (CICM)
offer a venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.

CICM has been held annually  as a joint meeting since 2008, colocating
related conferences  and workshops to advance work  in these subjects.
Previous meetings have been held in Birmingham (U.K. 2008), Grand Bend
(Canada  2009), Paris  (France 2010),  Bertinoro (Italy  2011), Bremen
(Germany 2012) and Bath (U.K. 2013).

This is  a call for papers  for CICM 2014,  which will be held  at the
University   of  Coimbra,   7-11   July  2014,   following  the   10th
International Workshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry.

The principal tracks of the conference will be:

  Calculemus (Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning)
  Chair: James Davenport

  DML (Digital Mathematical Libraries)
  Chair: Petr Sojka

  MKM (Mathematical Knowledge Management)
  Chair: Josef Urban

  Systems and Projects
  Chair: Alan Sexton

The local  arrangements will be coordinated by  the Local Arrangements
Chair,   Pedro  Quaresma  (U.  Coimbra,  Portugal),  and  the  overall
programme will be organised by the General Program Chair, Stephen Watt
(U. Western Ontario, Canada).

The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer Verlag
as a volume in Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI).

As in  previous years, it is  anticipated that there will  be a number
co-located workshops, including one to mentor doctoral students giving
presentations.

                               Tracks
----------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================
Track Calculemus: Symbolic Computation and Mechanised Reasoning
================================================================

Calculemus   2014  invites   the  submission   of   original  research
contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the
conference.  Calculemus  is a series  of conferences dedicated  to the
integration  of  computer  algebra   systems  (CAS)  and  systems  for
mechanised  reasoning  like   interactive  proof  assistants  (PA)  or
automated theorem  provers (ATP).  Currently,  symbolic computation is
divided into several (more  or less) independent branches: traditional
ones  (e.g., computer  algebra and  mechanised reasoning)  as  well as
newly emerging ones (on  user interfaces, knowledge management, theory
exploration, etc.) The main concern  of the Calculemus community is to
bring these  developments together in order to  facilitate the theory,
design,  and  implementation   of  integrated  mathematical  assistant
systems  that  will  be  used routinely  by  mathematicians,  computer
scientists and  all others who need  computer-supported mathematics in
their every day business.

All  topics  in  the  intersection  of computer  algebra  systems  and
automated  reasoning systems  are  of interest  for Calculemus.  These
include but are not limited to:

* Automated theorem proving in computer algebra systems.
* Computer algebra in theorem proving systems.
* Adding reasoning capabilities to computer algebra systems.
* Adding computational capabilities to theorem proving systems.
* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary systems for
  computer mathematics.
* Case studies and applications that involve a mix of computation and
  reasoning.
* Case studies in formalization of mathematical theories.
* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra systems.
* Theory exploration techniques.
* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal deduction.
* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint languages,
  and modeling languages for mathematical assistant systems.
* Homotopy type theory.
* Infrastructure for mathematical services.

================================================================
Track DML: Digital Mathematical Libraries
================================================================

Mathematicians  dream of  a digital  archive containing  all validated
mathematical literature ever published, reviewed, properly linked, and
verified.   It is  estimated that  the entire  corpus  of mathematical
knowledge  published over  the centuries  does not  exceed 100,000,000
pages,   an   amount   easily   manageable  by   current   information
technologies.

The  track objective  is to  provide a  forum for  the  development of
math-aware  technologies, standards,  algorithms and  formats  for the
fulfillment  of the  dream of  a global  digital  mathematical library
(DML).  Computer scientists (D) and  librarians of the digital age (L)
are  especially welcome to  join mathematicians  (M) and  discuss many
aspects of DML preparation.

Track topics  are all topics of mathematical  knowledge management and
digital libraries applicable in the context of DML building, including
the  processing  of  mathematical  knowledge expressed  in  scientific
papers in natural languages:

* Math-aware text mining (math mining) and MSC classification
* Math-aware representations of mathematical knowledge
* Math-aware computational linguistics and corpora
* Math-aware tools for [meta]data and fulltext processing
* Math-aware OCR and document analysis
* Math-aware information retrieval
* Math-aware indexing and search
* Authoring languages and tools
* MathML, OpenMath, TeX and other mathematical content markup
  languages
* Web interfaces for DML content
* Mathematics on the web, math crawling and indexing
* Math-aware document processing workflows
* Archives of written mathematics
* DML management, business models
* DML rights handling, funding, sustainability
* DML content acquisition, validation and curation
* Reports and experience from running existing DMLs

================================================================
Track MKM: Mathematical Knowledge Management
================================================================

Mathematical  Knowledge Management  is an  interdisciplinary  field of
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop
new and better ways  of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,
based on innovative technology  of computer science, the Internet, and
intelligent   knowledge   processing.  MKM   is   expected  to   serve
mathematicians,  scientists,   and  engineers  who   produce  and  use
mathematical  knowledge; educators  and students  who teach  and learn
mathematics;   publishers  who   offer   mathematical  textbooks   and
disseminate   new    mathematical   results;   and    librarians   and
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.

The  track is  concerned with  all aspects  of  mathematical knowledge
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:

* Representations of mathematical knowledge
* Authoring languages and tools
* Repositories of formalized mathematics
* Deduction systems
* Mathematical digital libraries
* Diagrammatic representations
* Mathematical OCR
* Mathematical search and retrieval
* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
* Web presentation of mathematics
* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
* Computer algebra systems
* Collaboration tools for mathematics
* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows

================================================================
Track Systems and Projects
================================================================

The  Systems and  Projects  track of  the  Conferences on  Intelligent
Computer Mathematics  is a forum for presenting  available systems and
new and ongoing  projects in all areas and topics  related to the CICM
conferences:

* Deduction and Computer Algebra (Calculemus)
* Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)
* Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)

The track aims  to provide an overview of  the latest developments and
trends within the CICM community  as well as to exchange ideas between
developers and introduce systems to an audience of potential users.


----------------------------------------------------------------
                       Submission Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------

Electronic submission is done through Easychair

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2014

All papers should be prepared  in LaTeX and formatted according to the
requirements of Springer's LNCS  series (the corresponding style files
can be downloaded from http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).
By submitting  a paper  the authors  agree that if  it is  accepted at
least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.

Submissions  to the research  tracks (Calculemus,  DML, MKM)  must not
exceed 15 pages  in the LNCS style and will  be reviewed and evaluated
with respect to relevance,  clarity, quality, originality, and impact.
Shorter papers,  e.g., for  system descriptions, are  welcome. Authors
will have  an opportunity to  respond to their papers'  reviews before
the programme committee makes a decision.


System descriptions  and projects descriptions should be  2-4 pages in
the LNCS style and should present

* newly developed systems,
* systems not previously been presented to the CICM community, or
* significant updates to existing systems.

Systems must either be  available for download or currently executable
by the general public as a web application.

Project presentations should describe

* projects that are new or about to start,
* ongoing projects that have not yet been presented to the CICM community or
* significant new developments in ongoing previously presented projects.

Presentations of  new projects  should mention relevant  previous work
and  include  a roadmap  that  outlines  concrete  steps. All  project
submissions must have a live  project website and should contain links
to demos, videos, downloadable systems or downloadable datasets.

Accepted conference submissions from all tracks will be published as a
volume in  the series Lecture Notes in  Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)
by  Springer. In  addition to  these formal  proceedings,  authors are
permitted and encouraged to publish the final versions of their papers
on arXiv.org.

Work-in-progress submissions  are intended to provide a  forum for the
presentation of original  work that is not yet in  a suitable form for
submission as a full paper for a research track or system description.
This includes work in progress  and emerging trends. Their size is not
limited, but we recommend 5-10 pages.

The  programme   committee  may  offer  authors   of  rejected  formal
submissions  the   opportunity  to  publish   their  contributions  as
work-in-progress   papers  instead.   Depending  on   the   number  of
work-in-progress  papers  accepted,  they  will be  presented  at  the
conference either  as short talks or as  posters. The work-in-progress
proceedings will be published as a technical report, as well as online
with CEUR-WS.org.


----------------------------------------------------------------
			  Doctoral Programme
----------------------------------------------------------------

Chair: David Wilson (University of Bath, UK)

CICM  is  an  excellent  opportunity  for graduate  students  to  meet
established researchers from the  areas of computer algebra, automated
deduction, and mathematical publishing.

The Doctoral Programme provides a  dedicated forum for PhD students to
present  and discuss  their ideas,  ongoing or  planned  research, and
achieved  results   in  an  open   atmosphere.  It  will   consist  of
presentations  by  the  PhD  students to  get  constructive  feedback,
advice, and suggestions from the research advisory board, researchers,
and  other PhD  students.  Each PhD  student  will be  assigned to  an
experienced researcher  from the research advisory board  who will act
as a mentor and who will provide detailed feedback and advice on their
intended and ongoing research.


Students at  any stage of  their PhD can  apply and should  submit the
following documents through EasyChair:

* A  two-page  abstract  of   your  thesis  describing  your  research
  questions,  research   plans,  completed  and   remaining  research,
  evaluation plans and publication plans;

* A   two-page  CV   that  includes   background   information  (name,
  university,  supervisor), education  (degree sought,  year/status of
  degree, previous degrees), employments, relevant research experience
  (publications,  presentations,  attended  conferences or  workshops,
  etc.)

Submission Deadline: 28 April 2014.
