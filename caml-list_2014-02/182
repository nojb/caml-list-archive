Subject: [Caml-list] 2nd CFP,   Intersection Types and Related Systems 2014

*******************************************************************************
2nd call for papers:
INTERSECTION TYPES AND RELATED SYSTEMS (ITRS)
at the Vienna Summer of Logic 2014
http://vsl2014.at/itrs/

Submission is open at:
   https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itrs2014

Deadline: March 31st, 2014
*******************************************************************************

ITRS 2014 (the Seventh Workshop on Intersection Types and Related
Systems) will be affiliated with TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and 
Applications, to be held jointly with RTA) as part of FLoC 2014 (the 
Sixth Federated Logic Conference) and will take place in Vienna on July 
18th 2014.
FLoC 2014 will be part of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL), the largest 
logic event in history, with over 2000 expected participants. FLoC 2014 
will host eight conferences and many workshops.

ITRS 2014 workshop aims to bring together researchers working on both 
the theory and practical applications of systems based on intersection 
types and related approaches.
(More details at the workshop website http://vsl2014.at/itrs/).

SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Submission web site: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itrs2014

(1) Before the workshop, authors are invited to submit an extended 
abstract (max. 10 pages) in PDF format.
(2) Accepted papers will be included on the general VSL'14 Proceedings 
USB-stick
(3) After the workshop, authors of accepted papers will be invited to 
submit full versions (we foresee inclusion in EPTCS).

TOPICS

Possible topics for submitted papers include, but are not limited to:
- Formal properties of systems with intersection types.
- Results for related systems, such as union types, refinement types, or 
singleton types.
- Applications to lambda calculus and similar systems.
- Applications to pi-calculus and similar systems.
- Applications for programming languages.
- Applications for other areas, such as database query languages and 
program extraction from proofs.
- Related approaches using behavioural/intensional types to characterize 
computational properties.
