Ive merged a slightly updated release of this in OPAM stable (as iocaml 0.3=
.1).  I also have instructions for getting this up and running on MacOS+Hom=
ebrew here: https://gist.github.com/avsm/9041133

Thanks very much for releasing this Andy; I hadn't realized what an incredi=
ble tool IPython is for teaching until I played with the OCaml backend here=
.  I'm taking a shot a porting the Real World OCaml guided tour over to a n=
otebook as well...

cheers,
Anil

There was a recent discussion on the list about this (indeed reading about =
ZeroMQ led me to IPython) so hopefully this will happen before too long.

 Maybe it works anyway.
