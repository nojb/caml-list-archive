* Conference date:                       August 4-7, 2014


Complex computer systems are common in many sectors, such as
manufacturing, communications, defense, transportation, aerospace,
hazardous environments, energy, and health care. These systems are
frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks, and are driven by
many diverse requirements on performance, real-time behavior, fault
tolerance, security, adaptability, development time and cost, long
life concerns, and other areas. Such requirements frequently conflict,
and their satisfaction therefore requires managing the trade-off among
them during system development and throughout the entire system
life. The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial,
academic, and government experts, from a variety of user domains and
software disciplines, to determine how the disciplines' problems and
solution techniques interact within the whole system. Researchers,
practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transition
experts are all welcome. The scope of interest includes long-term
research issues, near-term complex system requirements and promising
tools, existing complex systems, and commercially available tools.

SCOPE AND TOPICS
---------------------------
Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, unpublished 
research
results, case studies and tools.
Papers are solicited in all areas related to complex computer-based systems,
including the causes of complexity and means of avoiding, controlling, or
coping with complexity. Topic areas include, but are not limited to:

* Requirement specification and analysis
* Verification and validation
* Security and privacy of complex systems
* Model-driven development
* Reverse engineering and refactoring
* Architecture software
* Big Data Management
* Ambient intelligence, pervasive computing
* Ubiquitous computing, context awareness, sensor networks
* Design by contract
* Agile methods
* Safety-critical & fault-tolerant architectures
* Adaptive, self-managing and multi-agent systems
* Real-time, hybrid and embedded systems
* Systems of systems
* Tools and tool integration
* Industrial case studies

SUBMISSION
---------------------------
Different kinds of contributions are sought, including novel research, 
lessons
learned, experience reports, and discussions of practical problems faced by
industry and user domains. The ultimate goal is to build a rich and
comprehensive conference program that can fit the interests and needs of
different classes of attendees: professionals, researchers, managers, and
students. A program goal is to organize several sessions that include both
academic and industrial papers on a given topic and culminate panels to 
discuss
relationships between industrial and academic research. Papers are 
divided into
two categories:
* Technical Papers and
* Experience Reports.
The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by program 
committee
members, and papers accepted in either category will be published in the
conference proceedings. Technical papers should describe original 
research, and
industrial experience reports should describe practical projects carried 
out in
industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them.

FULL PAPERS
Full papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and Experience
Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by program
committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be 
published in
the conference proceedings. Technical papers should describe original 
research,
and experience reports should present practical projects carried out in
industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them.

POSTER PAPERS
Poster paper submissions should specify in their abstract whether they 
describe
ongoing or PhD research. Both types of poster papers will be reviewed by 
program
committee members, and accepted posters will be published in the conference
proceedings.

PAPER SUBMISSION
Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of the
Conference Publishing Services (CPS) Proceedings Format. Papers should not
exceed 10 pages for full papers and 2 pages for poster papers, including
figures, references, and appendices. All submissions should be in PDF 
format.
Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected
without review.

All submissions should be made through the Easychair Website:
https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=iceccs2014
