Ashish, thanks for sending this!

To all, In the interests of keeping things manageable, I'd be grateful if w=
e could keep any discussions on the Infrastructure list (infrastructure@lis=
ts.ocaml.org).  It's public and archived [1] and we're happy to summarise t=
he main points for the caml-list in due course.

Best wishes,
Amir

 (except for code; see (C) below). We'd like others to be able to use these=
 materials but we don't want to create a situation where content that is fr=
eely given to the community (which amounts to a substantive volume of work)=
 is then taken and monetized without giving back.
>=20

ncluding for commercial gain, as long as that work is also released under t=
he same (or compatible) license. This means that commercial works could be =
produced but free versions would also have to be made available. Thus, the =
community wouldn't lose out on any derivative work.
>=20
> (B) Code that implements ocaml.org. We want the code implementing the sit=
e to be open source and available for others to use as they wish. Examples =
of this include the files found under the 'script' folder of the repository=
 [6]. The ISC licence [2] has already been chosen for OMD and MPP, two libr=
aries that OCaml.org relies on substantially. Additional scripts are not pa=
rticularly complex in nature, and we feel their use should not be restricte=
d.
>=20
> (C) Code examples within content. For example, you can see many of these =
on the 99 problems page [5]. These are typically small pieces of useful cod=
e and we want people to be able to use them however they see fit. We want t=
o do this without the burden of attribution that an open source license (e.=
g. ISC) would require, so placing them in the public domain seems like the =
sensible thing to do. The UNLICENSE [3] is one way of putting works in the =
public domain and is how code examples in Real World OCaml are released [4].
>=20
> (D) Design of the site. This is essentially the CSS, banner image, and cu=
stom logos (except the OCaml logo, see (E) below). The design uniquely iden=
tifies ocaml.org, and it would be awkward if another site looked similar. I=
t seems sensible to reserve all rights over the design and disallow copying=
 it in any form.
>=20
> (E) The new OCaml logo [7], which you see in the top-left of ocaml.org, s=
hould be encouraged. We hope this can be a unifying symbol of all things re=
lated to OCaml. Everyone should use this logo in their OCaml blogs, website=
s, documentation, presentations, T-shirts, stickers, etc. Thus, it should b=
e usable freely by all, which can be achieved by releasing it under the UNL=
ICENSE.
>=20

as the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop. Contributors should retain all =
rights over those works or be subject to whatever agreement they have with =
the respective meeting. They are not considered part of the Content as defi=
ned in (A).
