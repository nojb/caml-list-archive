[~~~~~~ Please disseminate widely within your teams & contacts ~~~~~~]

Dear Colleagues,

PERSYVAL-Lab and NASA-JPL are organizing the second edition of the CPS Summ=
er School. The broad objective of the CPS Summer School is to explore the m=
anifold relationship between networked embedded systems (=AB the internet o=
f things =BB) and humans as their creators, users, and subjects. The format=
 of the Summer School is a five days meeting, organized around different as=
pects of rigorous engineering of Cyber-Physical Systems.

This year, the objective of the school is to survey fundamental and applied=
 aspects of modelling, monitoring and learning of systems as well as to ide=
ntify novel opportunities and research directions in these areas through a =
series of lectures by international experts. Participants will also experie=
nce the relevant technologies during hands-on courses and be given a chance=
 to present their own work. The school will provide a great opportunity to =
know other people working in the field, to meet distinguished scholars, and=
 to establish contacts that may lead to research collaborations in the futu=
re.

The school will concentrate on the fields of system modelling, monitoring a=
nd learning. Over the last ten years we have seen a lot of growth in these =
areas, building on strong theoretical foundations to apply and extend techn=
iques to new application domains. Runtime verification is a growing field w=
ith more and more efffective applications in safety/mission-critical system=
s, enterprise and systems software, autonomous and reactive control systems=
, health management and diagnosis systems, and system security and privacy.=
 The field of specification mining (learning specifications from system beh=
aviour) has also seen a surge in research effort, with the establishment of=
 a number of competitions to drive forward the development of practical too=
ls. This research community is at an ideal stage to benefit from a school s=
uch as this, to inspire, motivate and instruct new researchers into the fie=
ld.

Students participating at this summer school will learn the current state o=
f the art in modeling, monitoring, and learning. Students will be able to a=
pply new techniques coming from various communities and backgrounds to thei=
r own domain. The CPS Summer School will be held at Grenoble University. Co=
urses will be given in English by experts from industry and academia workin=
g in various fields of CPS.

Topics:

	=95 System modeling.
	=95 Monitoring.
	=95 Learning.
	=95 Medical devices.
	=95 Sensor networks.

Confirmed Speakers:

	=95 Eric Bodden (TU Darmstadt and EC SPRIDE, Germany).

	=95 Mohamad Sawan (Ecole Polytechnique de Montr=E9al, Canada).
	=95 Bernhard Steffen (Technical University Dortmund, Germany).
	=95 Andreas Zeller (Saarland University, Germany).

Organization Committee:

	=95 Saddek Bensalem - University of Grenoble, France.
	=95 Yli=E8s Falcone - University of Grenoble, France.
	=95 Klaus Havelund - NASA JPL, USA.

Registration fee is =80250 for students, =80400 for non-students, which inc=
ludes lunches and coffee breaks from Monday 8th through Thursday 11th, and =
a party. The registration fee only partially covers the costs incurred. The=
 remaining costs are covered by PERSYVAL-Lab. The local organization commit=
tee has arranged university accommodations for students. Please refer to th=
e Website for more details.

Application Procedure and Important Dates (please refer to the Website for =
the full procedure):

	=95 Deadline for Application: April 14, 2014.
	=95 Response to Applicants: April 21, 2014.
	=95 Online Registration and Fee payment: May 10, 2014.
	=95 Summer school on CPS: July 7-11, 2014.

Since attendance is limited, priority will be given to Ph.D. students and c=
ompanies' staff.
