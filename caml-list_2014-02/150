I had been pointed to them a few months ago. From what I can tell, these
patches to the compiler cannot be integrated upstream; they require
"manual" steps like "make -C dir/ foo && mv bar baz && make -C dir2" and
a few changes which can only apply to windows targets.

By the way, the patches I've worked on were not started by me. However I
cannot trace their path properly; as far as I can tell, they were
started in Fedora, then went through debian and then mxe.cc.

Looking at these pages, I notice that I forgot one component for the
patches: ocamlfind and build system integration. IOW, how to cross-build
libraries. I'll add that to the RFC.

Actually, the patches I have make it possible to link bytecode with
-custom; it's simply that the test that would fail for cross-compilation
is skipped.
