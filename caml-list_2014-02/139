No, no public branch right now.
In the past, I have had to play catch up with the trunk.
I started with a set of patches, two months later I could start having
some integrated, meanwhile trunk had changed and most of the patches had
to be updated; by the time I could update the patches, trunk would have
moved again enough to require a new update and so on. Moreover, some
patches require a new approach and this is reason I sent this RFC.

I'm not yet sure how I will be pushing them. I think I will probably
push the WIP stuff on http://cgit.notk.org and mostly use github for the
code review stuff. That WIP stuff will also be pushed to and rebased
with no consideration for anyone: it will be a copy of my local repo, no
matter which state it is in.
(NB: rebases is very useful because bootstrapping creates new binaries
of several MBs)

In any case, I'll send a message to the list when the first code is
there and slightly usable.
