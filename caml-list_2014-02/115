*** SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS ***

4th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL & DATA ENGINEERING
(MEDI 2014)

Lordos Beach Hotel, Larnaca, Cyprus

24-26 September, 2014

http://medi2014.cs.ucy.ac.cy/

The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for the dissemin=
ation of
research accomplishments and to promote the interaction
and collaboration of research communities issued from modelling and system
modelling on the one hand and data and data modelling on the other hand.
MEDI 2014 provides an international infrastructure for the presentation of
research results and experimentations on models and data theory, developmen=
t of
advanced technologies related to models and data and their
advanced applications and case studies. This international scientific event,
initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at
promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and
faculty/student exchanges and of other parts of the world as well.


Aim and Scope

Specific areas of interest to MEDI'2014 include but are not limited to:

Modelling and Models Engineering:
- Design of General-purpose Modelling Languages and Related Standards
- Model Driven Engineering, Modelling Languages, Meta-modelling, Model

Transformation, Model Evolution:
- Formal Modelling, Verification and Validation, Analysis, Testing
- Ontology Based Modelling, Role of Ontologies in Modelling Activities
- Model Manipulation and models as first objects
- Heterogeneous modelling, model integration and interoperability
- Applications and case studies

Data Engineering:
- Heterogeneous data, data Integration and Interoperability
- Distributed, Parallel, Grid, Peer to Peer, Cloud Databases
- Data Warehouses and OLAP, Data Mining
- Database System Internals, Performance, Self-tuning Benchmarking
   and Testing
- Database Security, Personalization, Recommendation
- Web Databases, Ontology Based Databases, PDMS
- Applications and case studies

Modeling for Data Management:
- New Models and Architectures for Databases and Data Warehouses
- Modeling and Quality of Data
- Modeling for Enhancing Sharing Data
- Models for Explicit and Implicit Semantics based Data Optimization
- Model Reification, Model Repositories
- Modeling Non Functional Properties of Systems
- Data as models and Models as Data
- Service based data management and service oriented applications
- Models for data Monitoring
- Urbanization of Database Applications

Applications and tooling:
- Industry transfer, experiences
- Data and Model manipulation and tooling
- Modelling tools and experimentation

Submission Guidelines and Instructions

Authors are invited to submit research and application papers representing
original, previously unpublished work. Papers should be submitted in PDF or
Word format. Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS format and should
not exceed 12 pages (including all text, figures, references and appendices=
).
Authors who want to buy extra pages may submit a paper up to 15 pages with
the indication that the authors will purchase extra pages if the paper is
accepted. Submissions which do not conform to the LNCS format and/or which
do exceed 12 pages (or up to 15 pages with the extra page purchase
commitment) will be rejected without reviews. Submitted papers will be
carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness=
, and
clarity of exposition. All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Not=
es in
Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Duplicate submissions are not
allowed. A submission is considered to be a duplicate submission if it is
submitted to other conferences/workshops/journals or it has been already
accepted to be published in other conferences/workshops/journals. Duplicate
submissions thus will be automatically rejected without reviews. Submissions
require explicit consent from all listed authors.


Important Dates

Abstract submission: April 14, 2014
Full-paper submission: April 21, 2014
Acceptance notification: June 16, 2014
Camera Ready: July 7, 2014


Paper Publication

All accepted papers will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science
(LNCS) by Springer-Verlag. Best papers will be invited for submission in a
special issue of the Future Generation Computer Systems (Elsevier) and
Fundamenta Informaticae (IOS Press).
