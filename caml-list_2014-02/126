                             CALL FOR PAPERS

                                HLPP 2014

                     7th International Symposium on
             High-level Parallel Programming and Applications

                         Amsterdam, Netherlands
                             July 3-4, 2014

             https://sites.google.com/site/hlpp2014amsterdam/

===========================================================================

Aims and scope:

As processor and system manufacturers increase the amount of both inter-
and intra-chip parallelism it becomes crucial to provide the software
industry with high-level, clean and efficient tools for parallel
programming.
Parallel and distributed programming methodologies are currently dominated
by low-level techniques such as send/receive message passing, or
equivalently
unstructured shared memory mechanisms. Higher-level, structured approaches
offer many possible advantages and have a key role to play in the scalable
exploitation of ubiquitous parallelism.

Since 2001 the HLPP series of workshops/symposia has been a forum for
researchers developing state-of-the-art concepts, tools and applications
for high-level parallel programming. The general emphasis is on software
quality, programming productivity and high-level performance models. The
7th Symposium on High-Level Parallel Programming and Applications will be
held July 3-4 in the historic center of Amsterdam.

===========================================================================

Proceedings:

Accepted papers will be distributed as informal draft proceedings during
the
symposium. All accepted papers will be published by Springer in a special
issue of the International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP).

===========================================================================

Important dates:

Submission deadline:     April 4 (anywhere on earth)
Author notification:     May 1
Camera-ready paper due:  June 16

===========================================================================

Topics:

HLPP 2014 invites papers on all topics in high-level parallel programming,
its tools and applications including, but not limited to, the following
aspects:

  + High-level programming and performance models (BSP, CGM, LogP, MPM, etc.)
    and their tools
  + Declarative parallel programming methodologies
  + Algorithmic skeletons and constructive methods
  + Declarative parallel programming languages and libraries:
    semantics and implementation
  + Verification of declarative parallel and distributed programs
  + Software synthesis, automatic code generation for parallel programming
  + Model-driven software engineering with parallel programs
  + High-level programming models for heterogeneous/hierarchical platforms
  + High-level parallel methods for large datasets
  + Applications of parallel systems using high-level languages and tools
  + Teaching experience with high-level tools and methods

===========================================================================

Paper preparation and submission:

Papers submitted to HLPP2014 must describe original research results and
must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere else.
Manuscripts must be prepared with the Springer IJSS latex macro package
and submitted via the EasyChair Conference Management System.

Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews by members of the
international technical programme committee (see below). Papers will be
selected based on their originality, relevance, technical clarity and
quality of presentation. At least one author of each accepted paper must
register for the HLPP 2014 symposium and present the paper.
