FIRST Call For Papers

FLOPS 2020: 15th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming

23-25 April, 2020, Akita, Japan

https://www.ipl.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/FLOPS2020/

Writing down detailed computational steps is not the only way of
programming. An alternative, being used increasingly in practice, is
to start by writing down the desired properties of the result. The
computational steps are then (semi-)automatically derived from these
higher-level specifications. Examples of this declarative style of
programming include functional and logic programming, program
transformation and rewriting, and extracting programs from proofs of
their correctness.

FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and
implementors of the declarative programming paradigm, to discuss
mutually interesting results and common problems: theoretical
advances, their implementations in language systems and tools, and
applications of these systems in practice. The scope includes all
aspects of the design, semantics, theory, applications,
implementations, and teaching of declarative programming.  FLOPS
specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory and
practice and among different styles of declarative programming.

*** Scope ***

FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of the declarative
programming:

* functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems,
  formal methods and model checking, program transformations and
  program refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem
  provers or SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using
  declarative programming techniques;

* foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation
  techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications
  and case studies.

FLOPS promotes ross-fertilization among different styles of
declarative programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to
be understandable by the wide audience of declarative programmers and
researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its
contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying
what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its
area, and comparing it with previous work.  Submission of system
descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.

*** Submission ***

Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:

* Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will
  be judged on originality, correctness, and significance.

* System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will
  be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.

* Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or
  theories with illustrative applications.

System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked
as such in the title.

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted. See also ACM SIGPLAN
Republication Policy, as explained on the web at
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication.

Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages
excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are
typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer's
guidelines. Regular research papers should be supported by proofs
and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting
information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to
an anonymized Web page or an appendix, which does not count towards
the page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to
guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without
referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose
not to look at it when writing their review.

FLOPS 2020 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.
To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

 1. author names and institutions must be omitted, and
=20
 2. references to authors' own related work should be in the third
    person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work =E2=80=A6" but rather =
"We
    build on the work of =E2=80=A6").
=20
The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an
initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it
impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try.
Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the
submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult
(e.g., important background references should not be omitted or
anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate
their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally
would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the
web or give talks on their research ideas.

Papers should be submitted electronically at EasyChair which will be
available soon from the Web Site of FLOPS 2020.

The proceedings will be published by Springer International Publishing
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.=20
