Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml 4.09.0+beta2

Dear OCaml users,

The release of OCaml 4.09.0 is approaching. We have created a second 
beta version
to help you adapt your softwares to the new features ahead of the release.

This new beta integrates in particular the fixes from 4.08.1 that were 
not yet
part of the first beta due to the overlap between the release of 4.08.1 
and the
first beta.

If you tried to test the first beta, and were stopped by the lack of 
working dune
and ocamlfind, those issues has been fixed.

The source code is available at these addresses:

  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/archive/4.09.0+beta2.tar.gz
  https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.09/ocaml-4.09.0+beta2.tar.gz

The compiler can also be installed as an OPAM switch with one of the
following commands.

opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.09.0+beta2 
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

or

opam switch create ocaml-variants.4.09.0+beta2+<VARIANT> 
--repositories=default,beta=git+https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-beta-repository.git

  where you replace <VARIANT> with one of these:
    afl
    default-unsafe-string
    flambda
    fp
    fp+flambda

We want to know about all bugs. Please report them here:
  https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

Happy hacking
— Florian "octachron" Angeletti, for the OCaml team
