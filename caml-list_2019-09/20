Subject: [Caml-list] OCaml release 4.09.0

Dear OCaml users,

We have the pleasure of celebrating the birth of James Waddell Alexander II
by announcing the release of OCaml version 4.09.0 .

Some of the highlights of this new 4.09 release are:

- New optimisations, in particular for affine functions in matches, for 
instance

     type t = A | B | C
     let affine = function
       | A -> 4
       | B -> 3
       | C -> 2

- The `graphics` library was moved out of the compiler distribution.
- The `vmthread` library was removed.
- Support for compiler plugins was removed.
- Many bug fixes.

The full list of change can be found in the changelog below.


It is  available as a set of OPAM switches, and as a source download here:

   https://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-4.09/

Happy hacking,

— Florian "octachron" Angeletti, for the OCaml team.
