Subject: [Caml-list] LOPSTR 2016 Call for Papers


======================================================================
                   LOPSTR 2016: 1st Call for Papers
======================================================================

                   26th International Symposium on
           Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                             LOPSTR 2016

               http://cliplab.org/Conferences/LOPSTR16/

                  Edinburgh, UK, September 6-8, 2016
               (co-located with PPDP 2016 and SAS 2016)
                                   
======================================================================
DEADLINES:
Abstract submission: June 7,  2016
Paper/Extended abstract submission: June 14, 2016
======================================================================

The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development.  LOPSTR
is  open to  contributions in logic-based  program development in  any
language  paradigm.   LOPSTR  has a  reputation for  being  a  lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors  can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 26th International Symposium  on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation  (LOPSTR  2016)  will  be held  at  the  University  of
Edinburgh,  Edinburgh,  UK;  previous  symposia were  held  in  Siena,
Canterbury,  Madrid,  Leuven,  Odense, Hagenberg,  Coimbra,  Valencia,
Lyngby,  Venice,  London,  Verona, Uppsala,  Madrid,  Paphos,  London,
Venice, Manchester, Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve,
and  Manchester.   LOPSTR  2016  will be  co-located  with  PPDP  2016
(International  Symposium on  Principles and  Practice of  Declarative
Programming) and SAS 2016 (Static Analysis Symposium).

Topics  of   interest  cover   all  aspects  of   logic-based  program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small   and  programming-in-the-large.   Both  full
papers and  extended abstracts describing applications  in these areas
are especially  welcome. Contributions are  welcome on all  aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

    * synthesis
    * transformation
    * specialization
    * composition
    * optimization
    * inversion
    * specification
    * analysis and verification
    * testing and certification
    * program and model manipulation
    * transformational techniques in SE
    * applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new
perspective,  and application  papers  that  describe experience  with
industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers  must  describe original  work,  be  written and  presented  in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published  or   that  are  simultaneously  submitted   to  a  journal,
conference, or  workshop with refereed proceedings.  Work that already
appeared in  unpublished or informally published  workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).


Important Dates

 Abstract submission:                            June 7, 2016
 Paper/Extended abstract submission:             June 14, 2016
 Notification:                                   August 3, 2016
 Camera-ready (for electronic pre-proceedings):  August 19, 2016
 Symposium:                                      September 6-8, 2016


Submission Guidelines

Authors  should submit  an electronic  copy of  the paper  (written in
English) in  PDF, formatted in  the Lecture Notes in  Computer Science
style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title;
authors and their affiliations;  contact author's email; abstract; and
three  to  four keywords  which  will  be used  to  assist  the PC  in
selecting appropriate reviewers  for the paper. Page  numbers (and, if
possible, line  numbers) should appear  on the manuscript to  help the
reviewers in writing their report.  Submissions cannot exceed 15 pages
including references but excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication.  Reviewers  are not required to  read the appendices,
and thus papers should be intelligible without them.  Papers should be
submitted via the Easychair submission  website for LOPSTR 2016: 
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2016
(can be accessed also through the LOPSTR 2016 web site).


Proceedings

The formal  post-conference proceedings will be  published by Springer
in the Lecture  Notes in Computer Science series.  Full  papers can be
directly  accepted  for  publication  in the  formal  proceedings,  or
accepted  only for  presentation  at the  symposium  and inclusion  in
informal  proceedings. After  the symposium,  all authors  of extended
abstracts  and full  papers  accepted only  for  presentation will  be
invited to revise and/or extend their  submissions in the light of the
feedback  solicited at  the symposium.  Then, after  another round  of
reviewing, these  revised papers may  also be published in  the formal
proceedings.
