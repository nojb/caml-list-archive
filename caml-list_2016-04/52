Subject: [Caml-list] APLAS 2016 Call for papers

*********************************************************************
APLAS 2016, Call for Papers
14th Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
Hanoi, Vietnam, November 21-23, 2016
http://soict.hust.edu.vn/~aplas2016/
*********************************************************************

*IMPORTANT DATES*
Abstract deadline:	June 12, 2016
Submission deadline:	June 17, 2016
Author notification:	August 15, 2016
Final version:		August 31, 2016
Conference:		November 21 - 23, 2016

*ABOUT*
APLAS aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a=20
forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of=20
ideas in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia,=20
but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming=20
language community.

APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software
(AAFS), founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many
researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were
successfully held in Pohang ('15), Singapore ('14), Melbourne ('13),
Kyoto ('12), Kenting ('11), Shanghai ('10), Seoul ('09), Bangalore
('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), Taipei ('04) and
Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops. Proceedings of the past
symposiums were published in Springer's LNCS.

*TOPICS*
The symposium is devoted to foundational and practical issues in=20
programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on topics=20
such as
* semantics, logics, foundational theory
* design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi
* domain-specific languages
* compilers, interpreters, abstract machines
* program derivation, synthesis and transformation
* program analysis, verification, model-checking
* logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming
* software security
* concurrency and parallelism
* tools and environments for programming and implementation
Topics are not limited to those discussed in previous symposiums.=20
Papers identifying future directions of programming and those=20
addressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms=20
are especially welcome. Demonstration of systems and tools in the=20
scope of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool demonstrations
category. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are=20
welcome to consult with program chair prior to submission.

*SUBMISSION*
We solicit submissions in two categories:
a) Regular research papers
 - describing original scientific research results, including system
   development and case studies. Regular research papers should not
   exceed 18 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography
   and figures.  This category encompasses both theoretical and
   implementation (also known as system descriptions) papers.  In
   either case, submissions should clearly identify what has been
   accomplished and why it is significant.  Submissions will be judged
   on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality,
   and clarity.  System descriptions papers should contain a link to a
   working system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and
   design.  In case of lack of space, proofs, experimental results, or
   any information supporting the technical results of the paper could
   be provided as an appendix or a link to a web page, but reviewers
   are not obliged to read them.

b) System and tool demonstrations
  - describing a demonstration of a tool or a system that support
    theory, program construction, reasoning, or program execution=20
    in the scope of APLAS. The main purpose of a tool paper is to=20
    display a completed, robust and well-documented tool --=20
    highlighting the overall functionality of the tool, the interfaces=20
    of the tool, interesting examples and applications of the tool,=20
    an assessment of the tool's strengths and weaknesses, and a
    summary of documentation/support available with the tool.
    Authors of tool demonstration proposals are expected to present a live
    demonstration of the tool at the conference.
    It is highly desirable that the tools are available on the web.
    System and Tool papers should not exceed 8 pages in the Springer=20
    LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. They may
    include an additional appendix of up to 6 extra pages giving
    the outline, screenshots, examples, etc. to indicate the content of
    the proposed live demo.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page=20
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daplas2016> using EasyChair.
Acceptable formats are PDF.=20

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for=20
publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English.=20
The proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer's=20
LNCS series. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.
