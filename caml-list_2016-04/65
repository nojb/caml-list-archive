   ware Engineering,  Natural  Language  Processing,  Web  and  Semantic  Web,
   Agents, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics, and Education.


In  addition  to  the  presentations of accepted papers, the technical program
will include invited talks, advanced tutorials, the doctoral  consortium,  and
several workshops.

Important Dates

Paper registration (abstract):       29 April, 2016  (extended deadline, firm)
Submission deadline:                 6 May, 2016     (extended deadline)
Notification to authors:             17 June, 2016

Final notification:                  22 July, 2016
Camera-ready copy due:               5 Aug, 2016
Conference:                          17-21 Oct, 2016

Submission Details

Submissions  of  regular papers must be made in the condensed TPLP format (see
http://software.imdea.org/Conferences/ICLP2016/TPLP-ICLP-2016.tar)  via  Easy-
Chair  (see  http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp2016).   A regular
paper must not exceed 14 pages including the bibliography, but the  paper  may
be  supplemented  with  appendices for proofs and details of datasets which do
not count towards this limit and which will be available as appendices to  the
published paper. We accept three kinds of papers:


 - Technical  papers  for technically sound, innovative ideas that can advance
   the state of logic programming;

 - Application papers that impact interesting application domains;

 - System and tool papers which emphasize  novelty,  practicality,  usability,
   and availability of the systems and tools described.


Application, system, and tool papers need to be clearly marked in their title.
All submissions must be written in English and describe  original,  previously
unpublished research, and must not simultaneously be submitted for publication
elsewhere.  Papers of the highest quality will be selected to be published  in
the journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), Cambridge Uni-
versity Press (CUP). In order to ensure the  quality  of  the  final  version,
papers  may  be subject to more than one round of refereeing (within the deci-
sion period).

The program committee may recommend some papers to be published  as  technical
communications.  Technical  communications (TCs) will be published by Dagstuhl
Publishing   in   the    OpenAccess    Series    in    Informatics    (OASIcs)
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/oasics/).   These  TC  papers should not
exceed 14 pages including bibliography.  Authors can  also  elect  to  convert
their  submissions  into extended abstracts, of 2 or 3 pages, for inclusion in
the TCs.  This should allow authors to submit a long version  elsewhere.   All
regular papers and regular TCs will be presented during the conference.

Doctoral  consortium position papers, of between 10 and 14 pages, will also be
published as TCs.

Authors of accepted papers will, by default, be automatically included in  the
list  of  ALP  members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic Pro-
gramming Newsletter at no cost.

Workshops

The ICLP 2016 program will include several workshops.  They  are  perhaps  the
best  places  for  the  presentation of preliminary work, underdeveloped novel
ideas, and new open problems to a wide and interested audience with opportuni-
ties for intensive discussions and project collaboration.

Autumn School on Computational Logic

A  school on computational logic is planned.  More up to date information will
be available at the conference Web page.

Doctoral Consortium

The Twelfth Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming  provides  research
students  with  the  opportunity  to present and discuss their research direc-
tions, and to obtain feedback from  both  peers  and  experts  in  the  field.
Accepted  participants  will  receive  partial financial support to attend the
event and the main conference. The best paper from the DC will  be  given  the
opportunity to present in a session of the main ICLP conference.

Conference Venue

The  venue  will  be  the  Sheraton LaGuardia East Hotel in Flushing, New York
City.  New York City is an international  tourist  destination,  receiving  56
million  tourists in 2014 alone. Several sources have ranked New York the most
photographed city in the world. Times square, known as the  city's  heart,  is
the  brightly  illuminated hub of the Broadway theatre district. The Statue of
Liberty greets new arrivals to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early
20th century, and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States. Flush-
ing is associated by many with the  National  Tennis  Centre,  since  Flushing
Meadows  has  been  the home of the US Open Grand Slam tennis tournament every
year since 1978.

New York is the most populous city in the United States and one  of  the  most
populous  urban  agglomerations  in  the world. Situated in one of the world's
largest natural harbours, New York City consists of  five  boroughs,  each  of
which is a separate county of New York State. The conference hotel is situated
in the Queens borough, just a two-minute walk from  the  Flushing-Main  Street
rail station.  Direct train lines take you directly from there to Times Square
in just over 45 minutes, which is fast for New York City. The Museum of Modern
Art  can  be  reached in under 40 mins, Grand Central Terminal in 40 mins, the
Empire State Building under 50 mins, and The High Line Park in 50 minutes.

The hotel is also close to LaGuardia Airports and JFK.  LaGuardia  is  just  3
miles  away  and  the  hotel  offers a complementary shuttle service.  John F.
Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is 10 miles away and can be reached within
30  minutes  by  taxi.  The hotel is situated in a vibrant Asian district that
offers a variety of Eastern cuisine, as well as many stores and shops.

Sponsor

The conference is sponsored by the Association for Logic Programming (ALP).

Financial Assistance

The Association for Logic Programming has funds to assist  financially  disad-
vantaged  participants  and, especially, students to enable them to attend the
conference.  Inquiries should be made to the general chairs.
