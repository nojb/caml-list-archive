AIM:

=C2=A0

WebST 2016 is a research training event addressed to graduates and postgrad=
uates in the first steps of their academic career. With a global scope, it =
aims at updating them about the most recent advances in the critical, multi=
disciplinary and fast developing area of web studies, which covers a large =
spectrum of current exciting research and industrial innovation from comput=
ing and technologies to social sciences and the humanities and has turned o=
ut to be the largest socio-technical infrastructure in human history. Renow=
ned academics and industry pioneers will lecture and share their views with=
 the audience.

=C2=A0

Most subareas of web science and technology will be displayed, namely: cont=
ent analysis and information extraction, information networks, search, data=
 and semantics, ontologies, user behavior and personalization, online commu=
nities, social networks, economic transactions, mobility, security and priv=
acy, graph analysis, web mining and applications. Main challenges and oppor=
tunities will be identified through 4 keynote lectures, 17 six-hour courses=
, and 1 round table, which will tackle the most active and promising topics=
 from various perspectives: philosophy, sociology, politics, digital humani=
ties, economics, computer science, engineering and mathematics. The organiz=
ers believe outstanding speakers will attract the brightest and most motiva=
ted students. Interaction will be a main component of the event. Moreover, =
an open session will give participants the opportunity to present their own=
 work in progress in 5 minutes.

=C2=A0
ADDRESSED TO:

=C2=A0

Graduates and postgraduates from around the world. There are no formal pre-=
requisites in terms of academic degrees. However, since there will be diffe=
rences in the course levels, specific knowledge background may be assumed f=
or some of them. WebST 2016 is also appropriate for more senior people who =
want to keep themselves updated on recent developments and future trends. A=
ll will surely find it fruitful to listen and discuss with major researcher=
s, scholars, industry leaders and innovators.

=C2=A0
REGIME:

=C2=A0
