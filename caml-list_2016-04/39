Subject: [Caml-list] Verification Mentoring Workshop - Travel Scholarships

Call for Applications for VMW (Verification Mentoring Workshop) 2016

Verification Mentoring Workshop 2016
Call for Applications for Student Travel Scholarships

We are organizing the second Verification Mentoring Workshop (VMW) 2016. 
It is co-located with the International Conference on Computer Aided 
Verification (CAV), to be held in Toronto, July 17-23, 2016. CAV is a 
premier conference in the area of verification, dedicated to the advancement 
of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for
hardware and software systems. The goal of VMW is to attract early-stage 
graduate students to pursue research careers in the area of computer-aided 
verification and formal methods.

Invited talks at the workshop will cover a broad overview of research topics 
in the area, the range of career options and perspectives (academia, industry, 
research labs, etc.), and insights into reviewing processes (for papers, 
grants, and job applications).

We will provide travel scholarships to student participants (graduates, and 
rising senior undergraduates), where the scholarships will cover registration 
for VMW and CAV, accommodations, plus travel expenses. Participation of women 
and under-represented minorities is especially encouraged.

The VMW workshop website http://i-cav.org/2016/vmw is now accepting 
applications.

Important Dates:
+ Deadline for submission of applications: Extended to April 20, 2016
+ Notification of travel scholarships awarded: May 1, 2016
+ VMW Workshop: July 18, 2016

VMW 2016 is partially supported by Microsoft Research and the NSF (National 
Science Foundation, USA).
