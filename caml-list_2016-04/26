********

4th International Workshop on Strategic Reasoning (SR2016)
To be held as Satellite Workshop of LICS 2016
9-10 July 2016, New York City, USA.
https://sites.google.com/site/sr2016homepage/home 
<https://sites.google.com/site/sr2016homepage/home>


Introduction

Strategic reasoning is a key topic in the multi-agent systems research
area. The literature in this field is extensive and includes a variety
of logics used for reasoning about the strategic abilities of the agents
in the system. Results stemming from this research have been used in a
wide range of applications, including robotic teams endowed with
adaptive strategies, and automatic players capable of beating expert
human adversaries. A common feature in all these domains is the
requirement for sound theoretical foundations and tools accounting for
the strategies that agents may adopt in the presence of adversaries.

The SR international workshop series aims to bring together researchers
working on different aspects of strategic reasoning in computer science,
both from a theoretical and a practical point of view.


Topics of interest

The topics covered by the workshop include, but are not limited to, the
following:

Logics for reasoning about strategic abilities;
Logics for multi-agent mechanism design, verification, and synthesis;
Logical foundations of decision theory for multi-agent systems;
Strategic reasoning in formal verification;
Automata theory for strategy synthesis;
Applications and tools for cooperative and adversarial reasoning;
Robust planning and optimization in multi-agent systems;
Risk and uncertainty in multi-agent systems;
Quantitative aspects in strategic reasoning.

http://www.strategicreasoning.net/ <http://www.strategicreasoning.net/>)


Submissions

Submitted contributions should not exceed 10 pages using the EPTCS
format. If necessary, submitted papers can be supplemented with a
clearly marked appendix, which will be consulted at the discretion of
the program committee. Submitted papers should be formatted in PDF and
uploaded to

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2016 
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sr2016>

Two types of submission will be considered:
articles reporting on novel research;
expository papers reporting on published work.
Each submission should be clearly identified as belonging to one
category or the other.

Novel research abstracts will be held to the usual high standards of
novel research publications. In particular, they will be expected to
contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify
the main contribution of the work, explain the significance of the work,
its novelty, and its practical or theoretical implications, and include
comparisons with and references to relevant literature.

Expository abstracts, which will be held to similarly high standards,
may survey an area or report on a more specific previously published
work. Submissions should make clear the relevance to the strategic
reasoning audience.

Authors of the contributions accepted for presentation (in both
categories) will be invited to publish their work as part of an EPTCS
volume to be published around the time of the workshop.

Submissions from PC members is allowed.

Important Dates

18 April 2016: Abstract submission deadline.
18 April 2016: Submission deadline (AoE).
5 May 2016: Acceptance notification.
18 May 2016: Camera-ready version deadline.
9-10 July 2016: SR 2016.


Proceedings

A volume in the EPTCS will be published as in previous years. Authors of
contributions presented at the workshop and previously unpublished will
be given an opportunity for the paper to be included. Inclusion in EPTCS
volume is not mandatory.

As in the past, extended and revised versions of the contributions
judged to be particularly significant will be published in a special
issue of the International Journal of Information and Computation.
