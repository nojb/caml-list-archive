Subject: Re: [Caml-list] [ANN] qtest 2.2, merged with qcheck

Hi Simon,
Just started to play with qtest and when trying out things from here
        https://github.com/vincent-hugot/iTeML
I got a an error saying that qcheck wasn't installed.

No prob, I installed qcheck and all was fine.

Question: Shouldn't  qtest 2.2 have a dependency for qcheck in the
opam package?
