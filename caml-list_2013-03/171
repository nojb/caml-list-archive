The honors CS intro sequence here at University of Chicago uses Haskell
for the first course (and then a mix of Python, C, shell-scripting, awk,
and sed for the second course).

No Java in the CS curriculum for majors here (a few courses geared
towards technically-minded non-majors).

The go-to language for a lot of 200-level courses because most of the
professors and grad students are comfortable with it (for
evaluation/grading purposes) and most students have had some contact
with it.

> - C

The other go-to language (obviously).

> - OCaml/SML

Until Dave MacQueen (one of the main SML researchers/developers,
http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/dbm) retired this past summer he
taught a functional programming class here that used SML and Haskell (half
and half). It's unclear what plans there are to teach a dedicated FP
class moving forward.

> - Scheme

The first course in the standard intro sequence is taught with Racket
(Scheme dialect(?)) with a particular focus on functional aspects.
