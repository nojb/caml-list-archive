The 1st French Singaporean Workshop in Formal Methods and Applications (FSF=
MA)
aims at sharing research interests and launching collaborations in the area=
 of
formal methods and their applications.

The scientific subject of the workshop covers (but does not limit to) areas
such as formal specification, model checking, verification, program analysis
and transformation, software engineering, and applications in major areas of
computer science, including aeronautics and aerospace.

The workshop will bring together researchers and industry R&D experts from =
all
countries together to exchange their knowledge, discuss their research=20=
=20
findings,
and explore potential collaborations.

Round tables will focus on French-Singaporean funding and cooperation=20=20
opportunities.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A PhD session will allow Master and PhD students to present their work.
| The workshop may offer travel grants to a selection of PhD students.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The workshop will take place on July 15th and 16th, 2013, in the National
University of Singapore as a satellite of ICECCS 2013.

  TOPICS OF THE WORKSHOP
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The main theme of the workshop is to establish links between academic and
industry scientists interested in methods and techniques for constructing
reliable systems using formal methods. The scientific topics of the workshop
include, but are not limited to:
- concurrent and distributed systems
- formal specification and semantics
- infinite-state and parameterized systems
- model checking algorithms
- SAT and SMT solvers
- security and privacy
- software engineering and formal methods
- specification and verification (hardware and embedded systems, probabilis=
tic
   and real-time systems, etc.)
- case studies and experience reports on the use of formal methods
- tools and industrial applications
- applications in aeronautics and aerospace
