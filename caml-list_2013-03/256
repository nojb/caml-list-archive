Hi Martin,
nproc meets exactly my needs: a simple lwt-friendly interface to dispatch
function calls on a pool of processes that run on the same machine. I have
only one concern, that should probably be discussed on the ocsigen list,
that is I wonder if it is okay to fork the process running the ocsigen
server. I think I remember warnings on having parent and children processes
sharing connections/channels but it's really not clear to me.
Thanks a lot for your answer!

[Off-topic] PS I understand your remark on the use of the word slave, be
assured that I did not mean to hurt anyone's feelings. However I'm affraid
replacing slave by worker does not make the whole expression sound better,
as it implies calling a worker's boss 'master'. This is also a bit creepy
to me. Maybe it's enough to recall that we are talking about processes. Or
go for a more peaceful context, music, and call this a conductor/performer
architecture :o)?

I wrote and used a library called Nproc about a year ago. It lets you creat=
e (Nproc.create) a pool of N processes, to which you can submit (Nproc.subm=
it) computations of any type quasi-magically - just make sure any big envir=
onment required for the computation is not copied with each closure that yo=
u send to the workers. The submodule Nproc.Full provides a more advanced in=
terface that lets each worker process have its own local environment.<br>
