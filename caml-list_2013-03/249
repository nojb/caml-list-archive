I wrote and used a library called Nproc about a year ago. It lets you 
create (Nproc.create) a pool of N processes, to which you can submit 
(Nproc.submit) computations of any type quasi-magically - just make sure 
any big environment required for the computation is not copied with each 
closure that you send to the workers. The submodule Nproc.Full provides 
a more advanced interface that lets each worker process have its own 
local environment.

I haven't used Nproc in a while but it was working fine and should still 
work.
