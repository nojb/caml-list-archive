Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Use of OCaml in universities and engineering
 schools

OPAM is just one component of the OCaml Platform we're working on
at the moment.  The Platform design and implementation currently underway
is looking at the build/test/documentation tool situation, as well as
making it easier to utilise third party standard libraries.

This is still a work-in-progress, but if you want to participate in
thrashing out the gory details, do feel free to join the mailing list at:
http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform

A very useful aspect of the current OCaml toolchain is how little
change is needed to build all of this.  OCaml-4+ exports the compiler
libraries, exports the typed AST via bin-annot, and OPAM generally makes
it easier to rebuild the toolchain in cases where patches to the core are
required.
