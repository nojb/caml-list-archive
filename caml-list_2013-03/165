Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Use of OCaml in universities and engineering
 schools

Wouldn't promoting the use of an extended standard library, like
Batteries or Core, in addition to a friendly toplevel such as utop help
making the language nicer to beginners? Opam makes it easier to use
them; the biggest source of complexity from there is imho how to build
programs (which build system to chose, how to have it use the libraries
with findlib, etc.).

All this is very easy and natural in python: the standard library is
big, you can write programs with networking, http, serialization,
databases very easily, there is no build system (nor 'annoying' typing
that prevents from writing `1 + 2.0 < 3L`). Ipython can also be used for
the 'nice toplevel' part. This is also partly true for universities that
use Java, since IDEs like eclipse provide autocompletion and hide the
build system away... Even `ghc --make` and ghci are much easier than
ocamlbuild and ocaml's toplevel (which doesn't even have readline).

So I think this explains the high threshold for starting with OCaml.
