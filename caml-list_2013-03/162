Actually I was making a serious point, namely, that Haskell forces you to
learn the whole FP deal even to write Hello World, whereas Ocaml lets you
chicken out into imperative programming at the first hurdle. Which is
better? Well I'd say the former because the latter risks building up a code
base that doesn't rhyme with itself and a population of programmers who
react to one half or the other of the code with either derision or
confusion.

The original question was about feedback on OCaml being used to teach<br>
programming, and I think it is good that is answered in detail if it<br>
can help in making informed curriculum decisions. Don&#39;t hesitate to<br>
keep providing data if you think it helps.<br>

On the other side, there is no &quot;competition&quot; going on here -- and=
 it&#39;s<br>
indeed an excellent thing that Haskell, being a beautiful language, is<br>
also taught at university (same for SML)! If only there were less Java<br>

I&#39;m sure there are interesting things to be said about &quot;Haskell an=
