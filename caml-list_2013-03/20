Subject: [Caml-list] Commercial Users of Functional Programming 2013

This year, CUFP 2013 will be in Boston (and it is still co-located with ICF=
P 2013).
 If you use OCaml (or any other functional language) for practical applicat=
ions, then you should consider applying!

COMMERCIAL USERS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING 2013
			      CUFP 2013
                       http://cufp.org/conference
			CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS
			 Boston, MA, United States
			      Sep 22-24
	    Talk Proposal Submission Deadline 29 June 2013
		      Co-located with ICFP 2013
			 Sponsored by SIGPLAN

The annual CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how others
are using functional programming to solve real world problems; where
practitioners meet and collaborate; where language designers and users
can share ideas about the future of their favorite language; and where
one can learn practical techniques and approaches for putting
functional programming to work.

Giving a CUFP Talk
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

If you have experience using functional languages in a practical
setting, we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the
workshop. We are looking for both experience reports and
in-depth technical talks.

Experience reports are typically 25 minutes long (but negotiable), and
aim to inform participants about how functional programming plays out
in real-world applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and
insights gained. Experience reports don't need to be highly technical;
reflections on the commercial, management, or software engineering
aspects are, if anything, more important.

Technical talks are also 25 minutes long (also negotiable), and should
focus on teaching the audience something about a particular technique
or methodology, from the point of view of someone who has seen it play
out in practice. These talks could cover anything from techniques for
building functional concurrent applications, to managing dynamic
reconfigurations, to design recipes for using types effectively in
large-scale applications. While these talks will often be based on a
particular language, they should be accessible to a broad range of
programmers.

If you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone to do
so, send an e-mail to marius(at)twitter(dot)com or
sperber(at)deinprogramm(dot)de or by 29 June 2013 with a short
description of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your
nominee should give a talk about. Such descriptions should be about
one page long.

There will be a short scribes report of the presentations and
discussions but not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting
is intended to be more a discussion forum than a technical
interchange. You do not need to submit a paper, just a proposal for
your talk! Note that we will need all presenters to register for the
CUFP workshop and travel to Boston at their own expense.

For more information on CUFP, including videos of presentations from
previous years, take a look at the CUFP website at
http://cufp.org. Note that presenters, like other attendees, will need
to register for the event. Presentations will be video taped and
presenters will be expected to sign an ACM copyright release
form. Acceptance and rejection letters will be sent out by July 16th.

Guidance on giving a great CUFP talk

Focus on the interesting bits: Think about what will distinguish your
talk, and what will engage the audience, and focus there. There are a
number of places to look for those interesting bits.

    Setting: FP is pretty well established in some areas, including
    formal verification, financial processing and server-side
    web-services. An unusual setting can be a source of interest. If
    you're deploying FP-based mobile UIs or building servers on oil
    rigs, then the challenges of that scenario are worth focusing
    on. Did FP help or hinder in adapting to the setting?

    Technology: The CUFP audience is hungry to learn about how FP
    techniques work in practice. What design patterns have you
    applied, and to what areas? Did you use functional reactive
    programming for user interfaces, or DSLs for playing chess, or
    fault-tolerant actors for large scale geological data processing?=20
    Teach us something about the techniques you used, and why we
    should consider using them ourselves.

    Getting things done: How did you deal with large software
    development in the absence of a myriad of pre-existing support
    that are often expected in larger commercial environments (IDEs,
    coverage tools, debuggers, profilers) and without larger, proven
    bodies of libraries? Did you hit any brick walls that required
    support from the community?

    Don't just be a cheerleader: It's easy to write a rah-rah talk
    about how well FP worked for you, but CUFP is more interesting
    when the talks also spend time on what doesn't work. Even when the
    results were all great, you should spend more time on the
    challenges along the way than on the parts that went smoothly.
