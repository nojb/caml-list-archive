Subject: [Caml-list] OPAM 1.0.0 released !

I nm *very* happy to announce the first official release of OPAM!

Many of you already know and use OPAM so I won't be long. Please read http:=
//www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/01/17/opam-beta.html for a longer description.

1.0.0 fixes many bugs and add few new features to the previously announced =
beta-release.

The most visible new feature, which should be useful for beginners with OCa=
ml and OPAM,  is an auto-configuration tool. This tool easily enables all t=
he features of OPAM (auto-completion, fix the loading of scripts for the to=
plevel, opam-switch-eval alias, etc). This tool runs interactively on each =
`opam init` invocation. If you don't like OPAM to change your configuration=
 files, use `opam init --no-setup`. If you trust the tool blindly,  use `op=
am init --auto-setup`. You can later review the setup by doing `opam config=
 setup --list` and call the tool again using `opam config setup` (and you c=
an of course manually edit your ~/.profile (or ~/.zshrc for zsh users), ~/.=
ocamlinit and ~/.opam/opam-init/*).

Please report:
- Bug reports and feature requests for the OPAM tool: http://github.com/OCa=
mlPro/opam/issues
- Packaging issues or requests for a new package: http://github.com/OCamlPr=
o/opam-repository/issues
- General queries to: http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform
- More specific queries about the internals of OPAM to: http://lists.ocaml.=
org/listinfo/opam-devel

On behalf on the OPAM team,
Thomas

=3D=3D=3D Install =3D=3D=3D

Packages for Debian and OSX (at least homebrew) should follow shortly and I=
'm looking for volunteers to create and maintain rpm packages. The binary i=
nstaller is up-to-date for Linux and Darwin 64-bit architectures, the 32-bi=
t version for Linux should arrive shortly.

If you want to build from sources, the full archive (including dependencies=
) is available here:
=20=20=20
   http://www.ocamlpro.com/pub/opam-full-latest.tar.gz

=3D=3D=3D Upgrade =3D=3D=3D

If you are upgrading from 0.9.* you won't  have anything special to do apar=
t installing the new binary. You can then update your package metadata by r=
unning `opam update`. If you want to use the auto-setup feature, remove the=
 "eval `opam config env` line you have previously added in your ~/.profile =
and run `opam config setup --all`.

So everything should be fine. But you never know ... so if something goes h=
orribly wrong in the upgrade process (of if your are upgrading from an old =
version of OPAM) you can still trash your ~/.opam, manually remove what OPA=
M added in  your ~/.profile (~/.zshrc for zsh users) and ~/.ocamlinit, and =
start again from scratch.=20
