L.S.,



Apologies for any duplicates you may receive.



Please find below the Second Call for Papers for the Second International W=
orkshop on Trends in Functional Programming In Education (TFPIE).



Since the first CfP, we have confirmed that the proceedings will be publish=
ed in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science. Moreover,=
 we've started short-listing candidates for a key-note. Your suggestions fo=
r keynote speakers are welcome. More information will become available on t=
he workshop's website [1].



Please forward this CfP to whatever forum you consider appropriate.



Regards,

Second Call for Papers the Second International Workshop on Trends in Funct=
ional Programming in Education



TFPIE

-----



The second International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Ed=
ucation, TFPIE 2013, is co-located with Trends in Functional Programming (T=
FP 2013) at Brigham Young University in Utah. The goal of TFPIE is to gathe=
r researchers, teachers and all professionals that use, or are interested i=
n the use of, functional programming in education. TFPIE aims to be a venue=
 were novel ideas, classroom-tested ideas and work-in-progress on the use o=
f funcitonal programming in education are discussed. The one-day workshop w=
ill foster a spirit of open discussion by having a review process for publi=
cation after the workshop.



The program chair of TFPIE 2013 will screen submissions to ensure that all =
presentations are within scope and are of interest to participants. Potenti=
al presenters are invited to submit an extended abstract (4-6 pages) or an =
article (up to 16 pages) in EPTCS style. The authors of all accepted presen=
tations will have their preprints and their slides made available on the wo=
rkshop's website/wiki. Any visitors to the TFPIE 2013 website/wiki will be =
able to add comments. This includes presenters who may respond to comments =
and questions as well as provide pointers to improvements and follow-up wor=
k. After the workshop, the presenters will be invited to submit (a revised =
version of) their article for review. The PC will select the best articles =
for publication in the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Scien=
ce journal (EPTCS). Articles rejected for presentation and all extended abs=
tracts will not be formally reviewed by the PC.



TFPIE 2013 welcomes submissions describing practical techniques used in the=
 classroom, tools used in and/or developed for the classroom and any creati=
ve use of functional programming (FP) to aid education in or outside Comput=
er Science. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



- Teaching FP to highschool, beginning CS, and graduate students

- FP as a teaching tool for other (CS) topics

- FP and Robotics, Music and Philosophy

- Advanced FP for undergraduates

- Engaging students in research using FP

- FP in Programming Languages

- FP as a stepping stone to other CS topics





Venue

-----



Brigham Young University (BYU) is the third-largest private university and =
the largest explicitly religious university in the United States of America=
. Although BYU is owned and operated by the LDS church, the workshop is ind=
ependent of this affiliation. By BYU's own pen:



"Brigham Young University seeks to develop students of faith, intellect and=
 character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to s=
erve others throughout their lives. Established in 1875, the university pro=
vides an outstanding education in an atmosphere consistent with the ideals =
and principles of its sponsor, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sai=
nts. Known for its academically minded and internationally experienced stud=
ent body, its world-class teaching and its beautiful mountain location, BYU=
 is also recognized for its extensive language programs, talented performin=
g arts ensembles, outstanding sports programs and devotion to combining sol=
id scholarship with the principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ."
