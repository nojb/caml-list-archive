Subject: Re: [Caml-list] If you distribute oasis' setup.ml with your
 software, please use a recent (>= 0.3.0) version of Oasis

Indeed. The recommendation is rather orthogonal to the choice of
maintainers to distribute setup.ml with they released tarball or not.
If they don't, fine, if they do, please distribute the setup.ml
generated from a recent OASIS.

As a downstream user, I would have a preference for people to generate
the setup.ml statically on their side (some less work and dependencies
for us users), but I understand that just tarballing the development
repository is a quick&easy way to push a release, made even easier by
github, so it's a reasonable choice -- and I understand that people
don't want to clutter their versioned repo with auto-generated files.

(The initial reason for my e-mail was benchmarking considerations:
we're considering using the OPAM compiler variant system to test
in-development branches of the OCaml compiler, which mean possibly
tight (edit, compile, opam install, benchmark) cycles. OPAM would be
used to install just what's needed for the benchmarks, so maybe one
library or two but mostly only the benchmarking library. In this
context, it's important to have as few dependencies as possible, and
I'm eager to remove the "oasis" dependency of "bench" and
"benchmark".)
