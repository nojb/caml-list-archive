Subject: [Caml-list] Master-slave architecture behind an ocsigen server.


--089e01493720e4c1aa04d8d4bfdd
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Dear all,

I'm developping an ocsigen website doing some scientific calculations. Up
to now, the calculations were done in the same process that runs the
server. In order to gain in scalability (and maybe stability too), I would
like to run those calculations in a separate (pool of) process(es). As this
is a pretty typical setup, I guess quite a few people have already done
that. So I'd like to hear some suggestions on what library to use in this
particular context. It seems to me that the release library [1] should do
the job and is lwt-friendly, but there are maybe other good options?

Thanks for any hint, cheers!

Philippe.
