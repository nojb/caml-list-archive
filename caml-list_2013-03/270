Subject: [Caml-list] CfP: Semantics for Big Data AAAI Fall Symposium 2013

Semantics for Big Data

AAAI 2013 Fall Symposium; Westin Arlington Gateway in Arlington, 
Virginia, November 15-17, 2013.

http://stko.geog.ucsb.edu/s4bd2013/

Description and Scope

One of the key challenges in making use of Big Data lies in finding ways 
of dealing with heterogeneity, diversity, and complexity of the data, 
while its volume and velocity forbid solutions available for smaller 
datasets as based, e.g., on manual curation or manual integration of 
data. Semantic Web Technologies are meant to deal with these issues, and 
indeed since the advent of Linked Data a few years ago, they have become 
central to mainstream Semantic Web research and development. We can 
easily understand Linked Data as being a part of the greater Big Data 
landscape, as many of the challenges are the same. The linking component 
of Linked Data, however, puts an additional focus on the integration and 
conflation of data across multiple sources.

Workshop Topics

In this symposium, we will explore the many opportunities and challenges 
arising from transferring and adapting Semantic Web Technologies to the 
Big Data quest. Topics of interest focus explicitly on the interplay of 
Semantics and Big Data, and include:

     the use of semantic metadata and ontologies for Big Data,
     the use of formal and informal semantics,
     the integration and interplay of deductive (semantic) and 
statistical methods,
     methods to establish semantic interoperability between data sources
     ways of dealing with semantic heterogeneity,
     scalability of Semantic Web methods and tools, and
     semantic approaches to the explication of requirements from 
eScience applications.

Workshop Format, Submissions, and Proceedings

The symposium will be highly interactive with spotlight presentations 
and small breakout groups interleaved with plenary sessions for reports 
on the breakout groups and for consolidation of results. To prime and 
channel discussions and group activities during the event, we call for 
the submission of position papers or extended abstracts of 2-4 pages, or 
of technical papers of 6-8 pages (in AAAI format). Please address 
questions to Pascal Hitzler at pascal.hitzler@wright.edu.

Submissions shall be made through easychair at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=s4bd13
by May 24th, 2013.
