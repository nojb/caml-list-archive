I certainly use OpenGL (mostly GLES2 subset)... but I'm not sure I would
have much to read or contribute. The OCaml-specific issues are essentially
bindings. And I've fallen down the path of using glcaml which I locally
change and add to. It's pretty much like using OpenGL from C except the
constants are lowercase.

However, it would be nice if there was an easy answer for a new user. I had
to flounder around with the existing bindings for a while. At the time,
shaders weren't well supported, which is why I chose glcaml. Also because
glcaml is a very minimal layer -- easy to change and add to. But I'd agree
it's probably the least tested (used) and least "OCaml".

I think there's merit for a means to discuss OpenGL bindings, maybe
ratifying them... starting from scratch, whatever. But when it comes to
users, there is plenty of OpenGL documentation and shouldn't really be
anything OCaml specific. Unless the bindings add/change a lot (in the
direction of LablGL).
