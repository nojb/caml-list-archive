*********************************************************************

2013 INTERNATIONAL SUMMER SCHOOL ON TRENDS IN COMPUTING

SSTiC 2013

Tarragona, Spain

July 22-26, 2013

Organized by
Rovira i Virgili University

http://grammars.grlmc.com/SSTiC2013/

*********************************************************************

AIM:

SSTiC 2013 will be an open forum for the convergence of top class well
recognized computer scientists and people at the beginning of their research
career (typically PhD students) as well as consolidated researchers.

SSTiC 2013 will cover the whole spectrum of computer science by means of
more than 75 six-hour courses dealing with hot topics at the frontiers of
the field. By actively participating, lecturers and attendees will share the
idea of scientific excellence as the main motto of their research work.

ADDRESSED TO:

Graduate students from around the world. There are no pre-requisites in
terms of the academic degree the attendee must hold. However, since there
will be several levels among the courses, in the description of some of them
reference may be made to specific knowledge background.

SSTiC 2013 is appropriate also for people more advanced in their career who
want to keep themselves updated on developments in the field.

Finally, senior researchers will find it fruitful to listen and discuss with
people who are main references of the diverse branches of computing
nowadays.

REGIME:

8 parallel sessions will be held during the whole event. Participants will
be able to freely choose the courses they will be willing to attend as well
as to move from one to another.

VENUE:

Palau Firal i de Congressos de Tarragona
Arquitecte Rovira, 2
43001 Tarragona
