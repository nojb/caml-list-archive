Benchmark measurements used for comparison between OCaml and F# were always=
 done on the same machine running Windows. I used two machines:

* 2-core 1.67GHz Intel Atom N570 based netbook.
* 8-core 2.0GHz Intel Xeon E5405 based workstation.

The client verified the relative performance on their own machines.

The performance comparison was done using native code. We did not benchmark=
 OCaml bytecode.

Only minor changes were made, no redesign. Some of those changes could be b=
ack-ported to the OCaml but there is no motivation to do so.

Cheers,
Jon.

Hello Jon,

thanks for your report.
Very interesting.

What is missing, is the information, how many cores / processors the machin=
e has, on which the F# code runs, and if the OCaml code runs on the same ma=
chine.
What about Ocaml Byteocde vs. Nativecode?

And what, if the re-designt program would be back-ported to OCaml?

Ciao,
