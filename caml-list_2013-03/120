Subject: [Caml-list] toplevel debugger?

Hello,

I'm teaching a class for caml beginners, and I was wondering if there
was a tool between using #trace and launching the debugger on a compiled
program.

More precisely, we are using emacs for the lab sessions, and I would
really like to be able to use the debugger without having to compile the
program being written. Is this possible?

Thanks,

Alan
