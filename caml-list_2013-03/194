I agree, I would not recommend basing a business on selling OCaml code
to programmers.

As I said, OCaml's performance is already excellent for our purposes,
and getting better.  The CLR and JVM also have their performance
warts, for sure.

I'd be careful about pointing at any single limitation and saying
"that won't get fixed".  There's an energetic and talented crew
attacking all sorts of problems, and I expect they'll go far.
