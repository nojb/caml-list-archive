Subject: Re: [Caml-list] OPAM mailing-lists ERRATUM

Hi Amir,
   just to sum up my feeling, let me say that a mailing
list, albeit old-fashioned, is still a good compromise
between cost and benefits, and has the great advantage
to keep all relevant content in one place, and not
depend on pagerank magic and google cache to summon it up
and make it persistent...

But I agree we should bring this off the list (and by the way,
my apologies for the OCaml list subscribers for wasting
bandwidth :-))...

When I have any kind of question or confusion about something, my first resort is to google it.  I'd typically look to see if others have had similar issues and would expect to find things on stack-overflow, blogs and other things on the web.  This is usually sufficient for most of my problems.

I think of a 'software community' as a series of concentric circles with creators/maintainers right in the middle and the random public in the outermost ring.  I'd argue that mailing lists only serve those nearer the centre (to varying degrees).  Information scattered around the web, and well-indexed by search engines, better serves those nearer the outer rings (where I'd put myself).

> While I completely and whole-heartedly agree with your point about needing a vibrant user community, I'm essentially (1) questioning what that actually looks like and (2) trying to decouple it from mailing-lists.  I'm basically arguing that the needs once served by user lists can largely be met by other means.

I merely wanted to present a counterpoint to what I felt could be taken as 'mailing list -> community'.  If you, or others, have more information or resources on community-building in open-source projects I'd be very keen to learn more (though perhaps we should do that off the main list).
