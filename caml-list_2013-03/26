I agree!

Ok, but is this a _necessary_ requirement to being successful? That's not q=
uite what you state but you seem to support that suggestion.  I completely =
understand the usefulness of a -devel list but less so the -users list (sin=
ce I'm not power user by any means).

I'm not against the idea of a -users list but I'm not one of the people who=
'd use it (though perhaps I'm misunderstanding the use-case).  When I have =
any kind of question or confusion about something, my first resort is to go=
ogle it.  I'd typically look to see if others have had similar issues and w=
ould expect to find things on stack-overflow, blogs and other things on the=
 web.  This is usually sufficient for most of my problems.=20=20

The following might help explain my viewpoint. I think of a 'software commu=
nity' as a series of concentric circles with creators/maintainers right in =
the middle and the random public in the outermost ring.  I'd argue that mai=
ling lists only serve those nearer the centre (to varying degrees).  Inform=
ation scattered around the web, and well-indexed by search engines, better =
serves those nearer the outer rings (where I'd put myself).=20=20

While I completely and whole-heartedly agree with your point about needing =
a vibrant user community, I'm essentially (1) questioning what that actuall=
y looks like and (2) trying to decouple it from mailing-lists.  I'm basical=
ly arguing that the needs once served by user lists can largely be met by o=
ther means.

I don't have particularly strong opinions on this (other than "<your-favour=
ite-search-engine> should be able to get you to the answer", wherever that =
is).  I merely wanted to present a counterpoint to what I felt could be tak=
en as 'mailing list -> community'.  If you, or others, have more informatio=
n or resources on community-building in open-source projects I'd be very ke=
en to learn more (though perhaps we should do that off the main list).

Best wishes,
Amir
