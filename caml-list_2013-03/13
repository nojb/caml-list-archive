Subject: [Caml-list] Research Assistantship at Oxford on Bidirectional
 Transformations

Postdoctoral Research Assistant=20
"A THEORY OF LEAST-CHANGE FOR BIDIRECTIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS"
Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford

Applications are invited for a Research Fellowship on an EPSRC-funded proje=
ct "A Theory of Least-Change for Bidirectional Transformations". The projec=
t is a collaboration between Professor Jeremy Gibbons in the Department of =
Computer Science, University of Oxford, and Dr Perdita Stevens and Dr James=
 Cheney in the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh.=20

The project concerns bidirectional transformations, which are a means of ma=
intaining consistency between multiple information sources: when one source=
 is edited, the others may need updating to restore consistency. There are =
applications in model-driven engineering, database design, and program deve=
lopment, among others.  A bidirectional transformation can be implemented i=
n terms of several unidirectional restoring functions, one per source; but =
this duplicates information, wasting effort and risking inconsistencies. Bi=
directional transformation languages allow one to describe the consistency =
relationship and the restoring functions with a single declarative specific=
ation.

Our aim in this project is to study the principle of least change: that a b=
idirectional transformation should not make unnecessary or unnecessarily la=
rge changes when it re-establishes consistency. The primary focus of the Ox=
ford contribution is the development of a theory of alignment for bidirecti=
onal transformations on structured data, especially in the case of non-free=
 datatypes such as associative lists and graphs. We conjecture that the mat=
hematics of container datatypes and combinatorial species will be particula=
rly relevant.

The Fellowship will be under the supervision of Professor Jeremy Gibbons at
Oxford, and is available for three years from 31st August 2013 (or any time
before that). The salary is on a standard scale, from =A329,541 to =A336,298
per annum. For further details, including a job description and information
on how to apply, please see the webpage (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/news/619-fu=
ll.html). If you have any questions, please write to me (jeremy.gibbons@cs.=
ox.ac.uk). Please pass this advert on to anyone you think may be interested.
