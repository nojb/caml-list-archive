Unless I'm mistaken, here around when we say 100% pure OCaml code, it means=
 code that uses the standard library, 100% pure OCaml modules and no C bind=
ings or unsafe features like Obj.=20=20

But maybe you are new around here...

> Why do you assume that I wrote my own OpenGL bindings? I used the pre-exi=
sting LablGL bindings that were not only the defacto-standard for OCaml+Ope=
nGL at the time (i.e. OCaml's most widely tested OpenGL bindings) but had b=
een written by Jacques Garrigue, one of the authors of OCaml itself.

AFAIK labgl is not part of the OCaml system. If that software layer was key=
 to your product you should have ensured that you had some understanding/co=
ntrol of it -- even if that meant writing your own. More than that you shou=
ld have realized that while lablgl is fine for hobby opengl programming, it=
 has obvious shortcomings that makes it ill suited to develop products on t=
op of it.

 in 100% OCaml and 0% of our customers when we write our software in 100% F=
#?

You know it's called hypotheses, I don't know what you did, we will never k=
now since you are never able to provide any details. I'm aware that's the w=
ay you like to discuss, by boasting unverifiable claims, but it became very=
 boring after all these years.=20=20

It seems you did something wrong in building your product, don't blame the =
system because you are making the wrong choices (it seems a pattern with yo=
u btw [1]). There's more than one OCaml industrial user out there, if the O=
Caml system had random segfaults, I'm pretty sure we would be aware of it.

Anyway, believe me I'm very glad you are successful in programming in F#, k=
eep going.

Best,

Daniel
