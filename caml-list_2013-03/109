 the features of OPAM (auto-completion, fix the loading of scripts for the =
toplevel, opam-switch-eval alias, etc). This tool runs interactively on eac=
h `opam init` invocation. If you don't like OPAM to change your configurati=
on files, use `opam init --no-setup`. If you trust the tool blindly,  use `=
opam init --auto-setup`. You can later review the setup by doing `opam conf=
ig setup --list` and call the tool again using `opam config setup` (and you=
 can of course manually edit your ~/.profile (or ~/.zshrc for zsh users), ~=
/.ocamlinit and ~/.opam/opam-init/*).
