Subject: [Caml-list] CiE 2013: Call for Informal Presentations

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   COMPUTABILITY IN EUROPE 2013: The Nature of Computation

                     July  1 - 5, 2013

 CALL FOR INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS

 There is a remarkable difference in conference style between computer
 science and mathematics conferences. Mathematics conferences allow for
 informal presentations that are prepared very shortly before the conference
 and inform the participants about current research and work in progress. T=
he
 format of computer science conferences with pre-conference proceedings is
 not able to accommodate this form of scientific communication.

 Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, this year's CiE conferen=
ce
 endeavours to get the best of both worlds. In addition to the formal
 presentations based on our LNCS proceedings volume, we invite researchers =
to
 present informal presentations. For this, please send us a brief descripti=
on
 of your talk (between one paragraph and one page) by the DEADLINE:

 MAY 31, 2013

 Please submit your abstract electronically, via EasyChair
 <https://www.easychair.org/login.cgi?conf=3Dcie2013>, selecting the catego=
ry
 "Informal Presentation".

 You will be notified whether your talk has been accepted for informal
 presentation usually within a week after your submission.

 If you intend to apply for the ASL Student Travel Award, you might need us
 to confirm that your are going to give a presentation at CiE 2013
 (applications of students who are presenting get higher priority).
 Therefore, we would like to ask you to submit your informal presentations =
by
 26 March so that we can send you the notification before the ASL deadline =
of
 1 April 2013.


 GRANTS:

 Grants for students, members of the ASL:

 The Association for Symbolic Logic <http://www.aslonline.org  has decided
 to sponsor some students that are ASL members and willing to attend CiE201=
3.
 The eligible students may apply for ASL travel funds that are available for
 sponsored meetings, see http://www.aslonline.org/studenttravelawards.html
 for detailed instructions on the application process. Applications should =
be
 received at least three months prior to the conference.

 Elsevier

 Under the name Elsevier Women in Computability (WiC), the publisher Elsevi=
er
 (more precisely, the journals =82=C4=FAAnnals of Pure and Applied Logic=82=
=C4=F9 and
 =82=C4=FATheoretical Computer Science=82=C4=F9) is continuing the programm=
e =82=C4=FAIncreasing
 representation of female researchers in the computability community=82=C4=
=F9
 originally funded by the Elsevier Foundation (2008-2010).

 This programme will fund the WiC workshop at CiE 2013, with the traditional
 WiC dinner for workshop participants afterwards, and offer up to four gran=
ts
 with modest support (up to 200 EUR) for junior female researchers to attend
 CiE 2013. Every registered junior female researcher is eligible to apply.
 Preference will be given to researchers who present a paper (contributed
 paper or informal talk).

 Applications should contain a short CV (max 1 page) and contact information
 for an academic reference. The application should be sent to Mariya Soskova
 <msoskova@gmail.com <http://msoskova@gmail.com > before the deadline of
 April 1, 2013.


 EACTS Students

 The European Association for Theoretical Computer Science has decided to
 sponsor all students that are EATCS members and willing to attend CiE2013.
 The early registration fee for EATCS students is 30=82=C7=A8 cheaper than =
the one
 for non-members.
