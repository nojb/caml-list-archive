Subject: [Caml-list] CFP - Intelligent Distributed Computing - IDC 2013, Sep
 4-6, Prague

7th International Symposium on Intelligent Distributed Computing
IDC 2013
September 4-6, 2013, Prague, Czech Republic
http://www.ksi.mff.cuni.cz/IDC2013/

Call for Papers

The emergent field of Intelligent Distributed Computing focuses on the
development of a new generation of intelligent distributed systems. It
faces the challenges of adapting and combining research in the fields
of Intelligent Computing and Distributed Computing. Intelligent
Computing develops methods and technology ranging from classical
artificial intelligence, computational intelligence and multi-agent
systems to game theory. The field of Distributed Computing develops
methods and technology to build systems that are composed of
collaborating components. The symposium welcomes submissions of
original papers on all aspects of intelligent distributed computing
ranging from concepts and theoretical developments to advanced
technologies and innovative applications.

Paper acceptance and publication will be judged on the basis of their
relevance to the symposium themes, clarity of presentation,
originality and accuracy of results and proposed solutions. Topics
include, but are not limited to:

Intelligent Distributed and High-Performance Architecture
- Hybrid systems involving software agents and human actors
- Intelligent cloud infrastructures
- Agent-based wireless sensor networks
- Distributed frameworks and middleware for the Internet of Things
- GPU, multicore, and many-core intelligent computing
- Intelligent grid
- Intelligent high-performance architectures
- Context-aware intelligent computing
- Virtualization infrastructures for intelligent computing

Organization and Management
- Autonomic and adaptive distributed computing
- Intelligent service composition and orchestration
- Self-organizing and adaptive distributed systems
- Emerging behaviors in complex distributed systems
- Intelligent integration of heterogeneous data and processes
- Methodologies for development of intelligent distributed systems and
applications

Intelligent Distributed Knowledge Representation and Processing
- Information extraction and retrieval in distributed environments
- Knowledge integration and fusion from distributed sources
- Data mining and knowledge discovery in distributed environments
- Semantic and knowledge grids
- Ontologies and meta-data for describing heterogeneous resources and services
- Distributed fusion of sensor data streams

Networked Intelligence
- E-service and web intelligence
- Intelligence in mobile and ubiquitous computing
- Intelligence in Peer-to-Peer systems
- Intelligence in distributed multimedia systems
- Security, privacy, trust and reputation

Intelligent Distributed Applications

- Intelligent applications in e-business/e-commerce, e-learning,
e-health, e-science, e-government, crisis management
- Modeling and simulation of intelligent distributed systems
- Simulations of groups and crowds
- Intelligent data processing
- Intelligent robots


Paper Submission and Publication

All accepted papers will be included in the Symposium Proceedings,
which will be published by Springer as part of their series Studies in
Computational Intelligence. Papers must be submitted before March 1,
2013, have at most 10 pages length and be formatted according to
Springer format (Latex) available at:
http://www.springer.com/series/7092
Submissions and reviews are automatically handled by EasyChair.

Extended versions of the best papers accepted and presented at this
symposium may be considered for publication in a Special Issue of an
internationally recognized journal.
