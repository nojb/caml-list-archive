If the ML would exist (at least I) would maybe post more things.
And maybe even things that are related to the "details" category, that
would for sure not fit the main ML.

I don't know which direction to take, trying to unify them, take one
and make it evolve, start something new from scratch, reuse something
from another programming language...
I would be pleased to get opinions from other people that care about
this topic without anoying the others.

Also, more important (IMO) about OpenGL version handling, this could
be done in several ways.

I don't know if such a discussion would grow or not. Maybe I would be
the only one in it, or maybe other people would have something to say.
In case it could grow this would not fit the main ML IMHO.
