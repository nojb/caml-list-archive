Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Use of OCaml in universities and engineering
 schools

Sup=E9lec has an introductory course to programming languages for first
year students (mandatory but not graded) and the section on functional
programming is taught with OCaml at least on the Metz campus
(http://www.metz.supelec.fr/metz/personnel/frezza/MLP/). I think that
Lisp is used instead on other campuses.

That's not much but maybe worth mentioning.
