"mutable, but shared, state of a class" sounds wrong.  How about
"mutable shared state of instances of a class" or "mutable state of 
a class"?  The latter is simply a slot of a class object.  The former
is a limited form of delegation.  What ever would be desired for
the commercial sector, please stick to the pedantic tradition of
ML and give extensions a coherent semantics.  -D
