In Objective-C, there is no language support for class variables,
only for class methods...
But since that is a kind of C anyway, you can achieve sort of the
same effect by declaring a static variable in the file containing  
the class
implementation, and access/modify it through class methods (that, again,
are supported) ...

(this is just to complete the C++/Objective-C/Java picture: by the way,
 Java is embarassingly similar to Objective C, and even the online  
documentation
 copies a lot on NeXT's one ... does anybody know for sure if  
Java's designer are really
 former NeXT's employees, as somebody told me?)

As for what Objective Caml should have... I do not have yet a clear  
idea...
It seems to me that some kind of support for "safe" dynamic typing would
be more urgent, maybe...
