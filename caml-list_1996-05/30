I have made new releases for the CamlTk library available by anonymous FT=
P on
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light/camltk


A brief reminder:
TK is a GUI library for the TCL language. Normally, TK is controlled
from TCL. The purpose of the CamlTk interface is to provide a Caml Light
library to control TK from Caml Light programs. Thus, TK can be used to
program graphical user-interfaces in Caml Light without knowledge of
the TCL language.

Since the last release (september 1995), CamlTk has been used extensively=

in the MMM brower. This new release benefits from this experience: numero=
us
bugs have been fixed; performance has been enhanced; more Tk feature are
supported. It is still for Tk 4.0 though.

The directory contains two versions:
  * cltk.tar.gz is the library for Caml Light 0.71 (not tested with previ=
ous
  releases). It should be unpacked in the contrib/ directory of your Caml=
 Light
  source distribution.

  * ocamltk.tar.gz is the library for Objective Caml. It should be unpack=
ed
  in the otherlibs/ directory of your Objective Caml distribution.

The versions are almost identical, except for syntax differences between
the two Caml systems.
The Caml Light version has also a demonstration program (source browser f=
or
Caml Light modules).
The Objective Caml version has bindings for BLT 1.8, support for
safe versions of the interface (used in Caml applets) and a file selectio=
n
dialog (contributed by Jun P. Furuse).

A printable documentation is also available in the same directory.
The on-line version of the documentation has not been updated yet.


REQUIREMENTS:
You must have  Caml Light 0.71 (not tested with previous releases) or =

Objective Caml.
You must have Tcl7.4/Tk4.0, preferably with patchlevel3. CamlTk will *not=
*
work with previous releases of Tcl/Tk (either 7.3/3.6 or beta versions of=

7.4/4.0). CamlTk has not been tested with 7.5/4.1, and probably does not =

work as is with these versions.

UPGRADING:
Because I wanted to keep the Caml Light and Objective Caml versions as
close as possible, I had to report changes from the Objective Caml versio=
n
into the Caml Light version. In particular, both versions use the =

capitalisation rules of OCaml. As a consequence, the new CamlTk for
Caml Light is not fully compatible with the previous release. Upgrading
should be essentially a matter of moving some type names to lowercase,
and replacing "new" by "create" in some places (textvariables).

LIMITATIONS:
Don't even think of using CamlTk with threads in Objective Caml.
Be patient. We're working on it.
