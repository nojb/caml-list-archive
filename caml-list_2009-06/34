                            CALL FOR DEMOS

                    2009 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on ML

               To be held in conjunction with ICFP 2009
                      on Sunday, August 30, 2009
                      in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK

               http://www.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/ml2009/


Have you written a fancy tool or library that may ease the life of
fellow ML programmers? Have you developed interesting software using
your favorite dialect of ML? Or have been producing some cool ML code
lately that you just want to show off in action?

Now is your chance to demonstrate it to the world. This year's ML
Workshop will feature a session for presenting running code written
in ML, or written for ML. We seek 10-15 minute live demos or tutorials
related to ML technology that show new developments, interesting
prototypes, or work in progress.

The 2009 Workshop on ML will be held in conjunction with the 14th ACM
SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2009)
in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.


IMPORTANT DATES

Demo Submission: Sunday, June 28, 2009
Notification:    Friday, July 10, 2009
Workshop:        Sunday, August 30, 2009


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Please submit an abstract, about half a page long, describing the demo
and its technical content. Be sure to include the demo's title, authors,
collaborators, references and acknowledgements. If you have a project
website we encourage you to also provide a link that we can put up on
the ML Workshop home page once your demo is accepted.

Your demonstration should take 10-15 minutes. The exact length per demo
will be decided based on the number of accepted submissions. Please notice
that you will have to bring all hardware and software required for your
demo yourself -- all the workshop organizers can provide is a projector.

Please send submissions (in PDF format) with your complete contact
information via email to ml2009@easychair.org by June 28, 2009. Please
feel free to also contact this address if you have further questions.
