Vincent and I (in the name of ocamlcore.org team), have discussed this
forge project. Just to be clear:
- OCsigen team is running for now Trac (http://trac.edgewall.org/)
- OCaml Forge is running GForge and will upgrade to fusion forge in the
  near future (http://fusionforge.org/)

Trac has some issue with speed and is not as good as gforge to integrate
many projects and users. GForge is a good tool for large forge projects
but is not eye candy at all and is too complicated for average user, you
need to learn a bit of mailman/GForge et al before mastering the forge.

Other interesting forge like project includes Redmine.

Vincent wish to create a forge like project in pure OCaml using ocsigen.
One instance of this project will be opened at ocamlcore.org, when it
will be mature enough (something like http://ocsforge.ocamlcore.org) 
and that all the ocamlcore.org team will agree on this.

Sylvain Le Gall
