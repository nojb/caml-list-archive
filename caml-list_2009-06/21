I used this, a _long_ time ago (2002? 2003?), to embed Mozilla into a
commercial application I wrote at the time.  It worked and was stable.

However I have no idea about the code now, whether it will still work
with newer versions of Mozilla, or what happened upstream.

I strongly suggest that you try to get it included in lablgtk2.
