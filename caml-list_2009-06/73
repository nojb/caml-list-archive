Hello,

I have just been trying to figure out what the state of the various ML
implementations  is.

1. Which implementations have native system threads with shared memory?

PolyML is the only one I know of, are there others? (OCaml does not have
this as I understand it... do correct me if I'm wrong)

2. The ability to have a saved state was a neat feature of earlier ML
systems, is PolyML also the only actively maintained system which
supports this?  Or does OCaml have something similar I'm not aware of?

3. Lastly, can you help me get a good picture of the state of support
for ML systems:

OCaml: is this still supported by INRIA? what is the level of support?

MLton: ?

PolyML: unofficial support

MLKit: ?

F#: Miscrosoft

SML.NET: ?

4. I'm also interested in interoperability: what systems can OCaml
easily interoperate with? What about the other systems?

Thanks,
lucas
