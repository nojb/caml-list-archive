Caml Consortium is INRIA. If I remember correctly the overall funding of
the consortium help INRIA to pay for a half time job. Most of the people
working on OCaml are INRIA Cristal/Gallium team or former team member
that do things when they are needed (TM). It includes bug fixes, new
release and implementation of very specific features that need to have a
language level support.

My company, OCamlCore is member of the consortium.

My company (OCamlCore) provide services around OCaml. It can include
"support over the phone" if some company need it.

I think that "support" in Caml Consortium term, is something not user
oriented (like "10 bugs corrected in a year" or "10 hour of hotline + 1
day of training"). This is mostly a place where company can provide
financial "support" to the INRIA team developing the language and in
exchange receive special licensing option for OCaml.
