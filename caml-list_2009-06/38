I'm still unable to figure out what is the allocated memory, but I 
discovered few things:

* there is available (somewhat hidden) version of memprof patch that 
works with 3.10.0:
   http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~smimram/docs/ocaml-3.10.0-memprof.patch
* It seems that I can't use gprof with OCaml programs in Windows


I can roughly remember I had memory leaks some time ago if I allocated 
big arrays in expose event handler (with lablgtk2) - still have to 
verify this.
