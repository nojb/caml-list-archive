if you have a thread that never allocates any value in the memory heap, the=
n
the thread may prevent the GC from working properly...

<br>
Some time ago I had some problems with threads. I had to make a<br>
traffic lights simulation with cars as a academic project. I decided<br>
to write it using ocaml with graph module and threads for timing<br>
(since thread pausing didn&#39;t work in the same thread that the graph<br>
module worked). If I remember correctly there was a loop in graph<br>
module thread that was drawing some objects. Another looped thread was<br>
changing objects positions and then was paused for some amount of time<br>
using (I think) Unix module. I know that wasn&#39;t a good and optimal way<=
br>
to do it, but I had only few days for it.<br>
<br>
Now the problem was that one of those thread never worked. It looked<br>
like a graph thread was using whole cpu time, and there was no context<br>
switching. Don&#39;t ask me to paste any code, because I dont have it. It<b=
r>
was quite long time ago and I had to do my project without timing. :-)<br>
It was ocaml 10.*. So how threads are actually implemented in caml?<br>
Using some kind of timing or atomic operations?<br>
<br>
regards<br>
M<br>
