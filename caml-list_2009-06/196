Philippe Wang kindly told me that this isn't accurately measuring the
potential problem as it is not allocating any memory and thus not
triggering thread switching.  I have therefore modified it to use
Int64's and also to allocate an array of 32 ints in each iteration of
the loop.  The resulting program runs at equivalent speed both
sequentially and in parallel with both cores enabled (perhaps slightly
slower in parallel, but not significantly at all).  Running the
parallelized version with one core disabled does result in a noticeable
slowdown (runtime goes from 8.86s to 9.63s, but still not on the scale
reported for Python.  So it does seem that, unless I am still not doing
sufficient tests to detect a problem, OCaml has avoided Python's
problem.
