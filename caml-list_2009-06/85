Xavier Leroy gave a talk about this in the OCaml Users Meeting back in
Feb.  I don't recall the exact numbers, but yes there are resources
donated by INRIA towards updating the compiler and documentation, and
yes there are companies in the Consortium, and the number of companies
has grown year on year.

No one I know offers support over the phone, and who'd want to when
you can get better support on a mailing list?

Only to a very limited extent.  I think that camlpdf is the only major
piece of code that is supposed to compile on both OCaml and F# - see:
http://coherentpdf.com/blog/?p=25

Anyway, you want to link everything together from multiple languages?
With OCaml the way to go would probably be either to make shared
libraries (Red Hat are, I think, supposed to be sponsoring a GSoC
project to make this easier), or to go with something like ocamljava
and use the JVM.
