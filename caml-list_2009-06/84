Thanks, I just found an old post:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2002/11/64c14acb90cb14bedb2cacb73338fb15.en.html

So PolyML is the only version of ML that supports SMP? (although it 
locks all threads on a major collection - it does support parallelism on 
shared-memory multiprocessors - so you really can max out 4 processor 
machines - but the speedup tails off only 5 times faster for 8 core 
machines)

I was wondering who pays for the documentation to be kept up to date,
bug fixes, and implements new features.I saw that there is an OCaml 
Consortium: http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/index.en.html
Is this INRIA or something else? Is this the source of funding that 
supports OCaml? or is there INRIA backing also? Does anyone know how 
many people are employed? I'm interested in how to support functional 
programming environments. What level of financial support is needed?

Are there organisations that offer OCaml support over the phone? Or
would that be consultancy rates for academics who specialise in OCaml?
The OCaml Consortium offers: 3000 Euros for a minimal support to Caml, 
10000 Euros or higher for more. But doesn't give much details - has 
anyone ever purchased this?

no idea :)
I just saw that there is a MSDN F# Developer Center, and assume
Microsoft field the responsibility to fix bugs etc. Any experience with 
this?

Sorry, I will try to clarify:
I was taking for granted the ability to open sockets, have pipes, and 
read files. Web-services, links to databases, parsers, and anything else 
at that level are not what I meant.

I meant things at the level of linking compiled code/modules. F# website 
says it has "a cross-compiling core shared with the popular OCaml 
language", so I presume that modules written in one can be used in the 
other. This is the level of interoperability I was wondering about. Is 
there similar things for libraries writtin in Haskell, or MLton, or 
MLKit, or something similar for OCaml with SML/NJ?

I know the HLVM project is hoping to provide some of these features. I 
was wondering what the current situation is.

For other systems, was thinking of things like C interfaces, as describe 
here:
http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual032.html

So perhaps I've half answered my own question :)

cheers,
lucas
