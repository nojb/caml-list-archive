                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are you sure Dynlink is not used at all in the circumstances of the bug?

If Jake is right, a call to Unix.read might not be catchable even in the
same module.

The exception is registered when the module is evaluated. This can
happen at program startup, or during a call to Dynlink.load_file. Note
that if Unix is linked in a cmxs file and you dynload it, you will face
trouble.
