Yes, the library can be used with 3.10.1 and even 3.09. I think I know
what problem you have encountered. Ideally, to compile delimcc you
need the configured OCaml sources, because delimcc needs a few header
files that are not normally installed. Since one could install OCaml
from a binary distribution, the sources are not necessarily
available. Therefore, delimcc includes the needed header files as part
of its distribution, for the most common platform: ia32 and
Linux/BSD. Alas, these files differ slightly among OCaml versions
(e.g., because of renaming). Therefore, delimcc distribution includes
two sets of files, in the directories ocaml-byterun-3.09 and
ocaml-byterun-3.10. With OCaml 3.10.1, one has to use
ocaml-byterun-3.09 files rather than ocaml-byterun-3.10. Sorry, this
is indeed confusing.

Thus, you may want to edit the Makefile in delimcc, comment out the
line
	OCAMLINCLUDES=./ocaml-byterun-3.10
and uncomment the line above that contains 3.09. I think it would
build delimcc library (please `make testd0' to make sure).
