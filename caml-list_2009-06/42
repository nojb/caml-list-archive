Dear all,

According to you, how could an HTML document best be represented in
OCaml ?
In particular: would you rather use classes or records, polymorphic
variants or normal constructors ?

There are attributes which can occur in several elements, such as id,
class... How shold these be represented ?
Should the types reflect the differences between inline elements and
other types of elements ?

Many thanks in advance for your suggestions,
Sébastien.
