            Formal Aspects of Component Software (FACS 2009)

                                         Call for Papers

 6th International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Component Software

                                 November 2-3, 2009
                          Eindhoven, the Netherlands

                      http://www.iist.unu.edu/facs09/

                    Submission deadline June 26, 2009

Scope & Topics:

   Component-based software has emerged as a promising paradigm to deal
   with the ever increasing need for mastering systems' complexity,
   for enabling evolution and reuse, and for bringing sound production
   and engineering standards into software engineering. However, many
   issues in component-based software development remain open and
   pose challenging research questions.

   Formal methods consist of mathematically-based
   techniques for the specification, development and verification of
   software and hardware systems. They have shown their great utility
   for setting up the formal foundations of component software and working
   out challenging issues such as mathematical models for components,
   their composition and adaptation, or rigorous approaches to
   verification, deployment, testing and certification.

   The objective of FACS'09 is to bring together researchers in the
   areas of component software and formal methods to promote a deep
   understanding of this paradigm and its applications. The workshop
   will also be interested in defining the common aspects of
   components and component-based development. It is expected that
   formal paper presentations will be followed by lively
   discussions. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

   - formal models for software components and component interaction
   - design and verification methods for component software
   - component composition and deployment: models, calculi, languages
   - component testing, re-engineering and reuse
   - specification of extra-functional properties in component
     software
   - certification of components and software architectures
   - component software vs. object orientation, multi-agent systems,
     and aspect oriented development
   - components for real-time, safety-critical, secure and/or embedded
     systems
   - standard models for software components (e.g. Fractal, GCM, etc.)
   - industrial or experience reports, and case studies in
     component software
   - partial behavior models for software components
   - update and reconfiguration of component architectures
   - component systems evolution and maintenance
   - formal methods and modeling languages for components
   - trust models for components
   - autonomic components and self-managed applications
   - formal / rigorous approaches to software adaptation and
     self-adaptive systems
   - formal aspects of Web services and business processes
   - component-based Web services and service-oriented
     architectures
   - QoS issues in web services, multi-agent systems and
     component-based systems

   FACS'09 is the 6th event in a series of workshops, founded by
   the International Institute for Software Technology of the United
   Nations University (UNU-IIST). The first FACS workshop was
   co-located with FM'03 (Pisa, Italy, September 2003). The
   following FACS workshops were organised as standalone events,
   respectively at UNU-IIST in Macau (October 2005), at Charles
   University in Prague (September 2006), at INRIA in
   Sophia-Antipolis (September 2007), and at University of Málaga in
   Spain (September 2008). FACS'09 is planned to be co-located with
   a number of events together under the heading of Formal Methods Week
   (Eindhoven, the Netherlands, October 2009).

Submission & proceedings:

   Submissions to the workshop must present original research
   that is unpublished and not submitted for publication
   elsewhere. Papers will be judged on the basis of originality,
   relevance, technical soundness and presentation quality.  Papers
   must be written in English and not exceed 15 pages in the ENTCS
   format. Note that to encourage submission of work still in
   progress, we may also accept promising papers to be presented at
   the workshop. The presenters of these papers will be entitled to
   submit a revised version for full review for inclusion in the formal
   (post-)proceedings to be published in ENTCS. Extended versions of all
   accepted papers will be eligible for selection for a journal special
   issue.  The final version of the papers must be prepared in LaTeX,
   adhering to the ENTCS format (see http://www.entcs.org/final.html).

   Papers/abstracts can be submitted via the following link:
        http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=facs09

   A special issue consisting of extended versions of selected papers from
   FACS 2009 will be published in Science of Computer Programming. Selected
   participants will be invited to submit an extended version of their 
papers
   after the workshop. These extended versions will be reviewed by the
   international program committee of FACS'09, which will decide on their
   suitability for final publication in the special issue.
