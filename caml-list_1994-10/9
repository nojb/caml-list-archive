this kind of comparison would not be  appropriate in some cases.
for example when you want to use it for sorting strings 

    c "ace" "af";;

gives

- : bool = false


by convention, we intend to have this relation "ace" <= "af" since the comparison is defined
by comparing the substrings "ac" "af"
