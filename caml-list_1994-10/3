The problems were discovered and fixed in connection with the
development of Moscow SML, which is implemented in Caml Light and uses
its runtime system.  Hence it will suffice to obtain the version of
camlrun distributed with Moscow SML.  It is safest to use that of the
old version (1.03), which is available for ftp from

	dina.kvl.dk:/pub/Peter.Sestoft/mosml/old/1.03/mos1bin.zip
