Dear Tarmo (and lists),

I am worried by the choice of Springer Gold OA proceedings. Does this mean
that authors will have to pay author fees (Author Processing Charge, APC)?
I would not submit to conference(s) with mandatory APC, as I believe that
they make the situation of scientific publishing in our field worse than
its current state (currently, for many papers that are made available on
author webpages or on arXiv, no one needs to pay).

Cheers

-- SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS --<br>
<br>
ETAPS conferences accept two types of contributions: research papers<br>
and tool demonstration papers. Both types will appear in the<br>
proceedings and have presentations during the conference.<br>
<br>
ESOP and FoSSaCS accept only research papers.<br>
<br>
A condition of submission is that, if the submission is accepted, one<br>
of the authors attends the conference to give the presentation.<br>
<br>
Submitted papers must be in English presenting original research. They<br>
must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere (this<br>
does not apply to abstracts). In particular, simultaneous submission<br>
of the same contribution to multiple ETAPS conferences is<br>
forbidden.<br>
<br>
Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer&#39;s<br>
Lecture Notes in Computer Science and be submitted electronically in<br>
pdf through the EasyChair author interface of the respective<br>
conference.<br>
<br>
Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be<br>
rejected immediately.<br>
<br>
FASE and POST will use a double-blind review process.<br>
<br>
The proceedings of ETAPS 2018 will be published in *gold open<br>
access*. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors. It<br>
is most likely that the proceedings will be published in the Advanced<br>
Research in Computing and Software Science (ARCoSS) subline of<br>
Springer&#39;s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Research papers<br>
<br>
FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS have a page limit of 15 pp (excluding<br>
bibliography of max 2 pp) for research papers, whereas POST allows at<br>
most 20 pp (excluding bibliography of max 2 pp) and ESOP 25 pp<br>
(excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).<br>
<br>
Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication<br>
in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed<br>
in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page<br>
limit. ETAPS referees are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers<br>
must be understandable without them.<br>
<br>
In addition to regular research papers, TACAS solicits also *case study<br>
papers* (at most 15 pp, excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).<br>
<br>
Both TACAS and FASE solicit also *regular tool papers* (at most 15 pp,<br>
excluding bibliography of max 2 pp).<br>
<br>
<br>
- Tool demonstration papers<br>
<br>

<br>
* The first part, at most 6 pages, should describe the tool<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0presented. Please include the URL of the tool (if available) a=

=C2=A0 =C2=A0provide information that illustrates the maturity and robustne=
ss of<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0the tool. (This part will be included in the proceedings.)<br>
<br>
* The second part, at most 6 pages, should explain how the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0demonstration will be carried out and what it will show, inclu=
ding<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0screen dumps and examples. (This part will be not be included =
in the<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0proceedings, but will be evaluated.<br>
<br>
ESOP and FoSSaCS do not accept tool demonstration papers.<br>
