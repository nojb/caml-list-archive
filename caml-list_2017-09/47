For what it's worth, the main blocker for us turning Flambda on by default
in classic mode is getting build artifact size and compilation speed down
basically to the same level as closure-compilation. We're getting pretty
close to that goal, though it will take a bit more time to get the
improvements in question upstreamed.

So getting Flambda enabled by default isn't that far away (though most of
the real benefits will require -O3, which will still lengthen compilation
by quite a bit.)
