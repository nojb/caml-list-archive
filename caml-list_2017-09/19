I found the reason why ld is ignoring it. Specifying the archive file as a
library dependency under _oasis causes the linker to skip the target for
some reason. Oasis and opam do not give any warning, but somehow expect you
to know that you can only put .a files at executable targets in oasis. I
had no idea, and this isn't documented to my knowledge, so I thought it
would be best if, when the user went to specify my opam package as a
dependency they only had to give one name. So far, what has worked was to
specify the C++ library archive as an extra dependency in the CCLib of the
executable targets.

Things tend to work the way you want them to when you are linking against a
shared object.

I'll release this package soon, and when I do I'll also create an issue
with oasis documenting these edge cases that could have some more helpful
warnings.
