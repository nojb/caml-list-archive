Highlights
----------

PEPM 2018 welcomes submissions on

  * semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program
    optimisation, and

  * modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and
    concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types,
    and contract specifications,

in addition to traditional PEPM topics.

Do submit a short paper if you want to get feedback for your work in progre=

If requested, short papers can be left out of the proceedings so that the
results can be published elsewhere.


New in this call
----------------

Invited talks by Alex Aiken, Conal Elliott, and Jan Midtgaard.

Short papers should include the words =E2=80=9Cshort paper=E2=80=9D somewhe=
re in their title,
and will be evaluated primarily on the basis of their ideas rather than
finished execution.

  * Website : http://popl18.sigplan.org/track/PEPM-2018
  * Time    : 8th =E2=80=93 9th January 2018
  * Place   : Los Angeles, CA, US (co-located with POPL 2018)

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PE=
PM),
which has a history going back to 1991 and has co-located with POPL every y=
ear
since 2006, originates in the discoveries of practically useful automated
techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input.  Over the years,
the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centr=
ed
around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation =E2=80=94 the syst=
ematic
exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box executio=
n,
but also as data structures that can be generated, analysed, and transformed
while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.


Scope
-----

In addition to the traditional PEPM topics (see below), PEPM 2018 welcomes
submissions in new domains, in particular:

  * Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program
    optimisation.

  * Modelling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and
    concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types,=
 and
    contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2018 include, but are not limit=
ed
to:

  * Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
    partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active
    libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring,
    decompilation, and obfuscation.

  * Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
    languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, st=
aged
    computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.

  * Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
    binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated test=
ing
    and test case generation.

  * Application of the above techniques including case studies of program
    manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and softw=
are
    development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectiv=
ely
    handling realistic applications, benchmarking.  Examples of application
    domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL
    implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific
    computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distribu=
ted
    and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, =
and
    security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions
describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program
manipulation in general.  If you have a question as to whether a potential
submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the programme
co-chairs, Fritz Henglein (http://www.diku.dk/~henglein/) and Josh Ko
(https://josh-hs-ko.github.io).


Submission categories and guidelines
------------------------------------

Two kinds of submissions will be accepted: Regular Research Papers and Short
Papers.

  * Regular Research Papers should describe new results, and will be judged=
 on
    originality, correctness, significance, and clarity.  Regular research
    papers must not exceed 12 pages (excluding bibliography).

  * Short Papers may include tool demonstrations and presentations of excit=
ing
    if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial,
    and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar; they will be
    evaluated primarily on the basis of their ideas rather than finished
    execution.  Short papers must not exceed 6 pages (excluding bibliograph=
y),
    and should include the words =E2=80=9Cshort paper=E2=80=9D somewhere in=
 their title.

Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column =E2=80=98s=
igplan=E2=80=99
sub-format of the new =E2=80=98acmart=E2=80=99 format available at:

  http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/

and submitted electronically via HotCRP:

  https://pepm18.hotcrp.com/

PEPM 2018 will employ lightweight double-blind reviewing according to the r=
ules
of POPL 2018.  Quoting from POPL 2018=E2=80=99s call for papers:

  =E2=80=9Csubmitted papers must adhere to two rules:

    1. author names and institutions must be omitted, and

    2. references to authors=E2=80=99 own related work should be in the thi=
rd person
       (e.g., not =E2=80=9CWe build on our previous work ...=E2=80=9D but r=
ather =E2=80=9CWe build on
       the work of ...=E2=80=9D).

  The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come=
 to
  an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossib=
le
  for them to discover the authors if they were to try.  Nothing should be =
done
  in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of
  reviewing the paper more difficult.  In particular, important background
  references should not be omitted or anonymized.  In addition, authors sho=
uld
  feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as =
they
  normally would.  For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on=
 the
  web or give talks on their research ideas.=E2=80=9D

See POPL 2018=E2=80=99s Submission and Reviewing FAQ page for more informat=
ion:

  http://popl18.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2018-papers#Submission-and-Reviewing=
-FAQ

Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs) provided
that there are non-PC co-authors.

Accepted papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be
included in the ACM Digital Library.  Authors of short papers, however, can=
 ask
for their papers to be left out of the formal proceedings.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop =
and
present the work.  In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live
demonstration of the described tool is expected.

Student participants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant=
 to
help cover travel expenses and other support.  PAC also offers other suppor=
t,
such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for tr=
avel
from locations outside of North America and Europe.  For details on the PAC
programme, see its web page.


Important dates
---------------

  * Paper submission deadline : Friday 6th October 2017 (AoE) (firm)
  * Author notification       : Saturday 4th November 2017
  * Workshop                  : Monday 8th =E2=80=93 Tuesday 9th January 20=
18

The proceedings will be published 2 weeks pre-conference.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:  The official publication date is the date the proceedin=
gs
are made available in the ACM Digital Library.  This date may be up to two
weeks prior to the first day of your conference.  The official publication =
date
affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  (For
those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital
Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains=
 the
first day of the conference.)


Best paper award
----------------

PEPM 2018 continues the tradition of a Best Paper award.  The winner will be
