- Language design:
     concurrency, reactive programming, multitier programming,
     domain-specific languages, security & privacy, database programming, ...
- Implementation:
     interpretation, compilation, JIT, AOT, server implementations, virtual
     machines, empirical evaluation, ...
- Static, dynamic, and hybrid analyses for languages and programs: semantics,
    logics, type systems, foundational calculi, program verification,
    abstract interpretation, security & privacy, ...
- Distributed web programming: data consistency, client-server interaction
    protocols, ...
- Programming environments:
     applications deployment, visual programming, testing, debugging, ...
- Applications: multimedia programming, scripting, ...

Submissions  will   be  evaluated  according  to   their  originality,
