Call for Papers
===============
20th International Symposium on
Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2018)
http://popl18.sigplan.org/track/PADL-2018-papers

Los Angeles, CA, USA, 8 - 9 January, 2018

Co-located with ACM POPL 2018 (http://popl18.sigplan.org/home)

The two best papers accepted for publication at PADL will be invited to
submit an extended version for rapid publication in the journal Theory and
Practice of Logic Programming.


Conference Description
======================
Declarative languages build on sound theoretical bases to provide
attractive frameworks for application development. These languages have
been successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging
from data base management to active networks to software engineering to
decision support systems.

New developments in theory and implementation have opened up new
application areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages
to novel problems raise numerous interesting research issues. Well-known
questions include designing for scalability, language extensions for
application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications
drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative
systems, and benefit from this progress
as well.

PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to
present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation
techniques for all forms of declarative concepts, including, functional,
logic, constraints, etc.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Innovative applications of declarative languages
* Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
* Practical applications of theoretical results
* New language developments and their impact on applications
* Declarative languages and software engineering
* Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
* Practical experiences and industrial applications
* Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
* Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and
  reactive languages.

PADL 2018 welcomes new ideas and approaches pertaining to applications and
implementation of declarative languages, and is not limited to the scope
of the past PADL symposia. It will be co-located with the Symposium on
Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2018), in Los Angeles, CA, USA.


Important Dates and Submission Guidelines
=========================================
Abstract submission: September 3, 2017
Paper submission: September 10, 2017
Notification: October 9, 2017
Camera-ready: October 23, 2017
Symposium: January 8-9, 2018

Authors should submit an electronic copy of the full paper in PDF using
the Springer LNCS format. The submission will be done through EasyChair
conference system:

    https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=padl2018

All submissions must be original work written in English. Submissions must
be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that
already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops
proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program
chair about the place on which it has previously appeared.

PADL 2018 will accept both technical and application papers:
* Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished research
results. Technical papers must not exceed 15 pages (plus one page of
references) in Springer LNCS format.
* Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical  
applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or in areas
of research other than Computer Science. Application papers are expected
to describe complex and/or real-world applications that rely on an
innovative use of declarative languages. Application descriptions,
engineering solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and
negative) are solicited. The limit for application papers is 8 pages in
Springer LNCS format but such papers can also point to sites with
supplemental information about the application or the system that they
describe.

The proceedings of PADL 2018 will appear in the LNCS series of Springer
Verlag (www.springer.com/lncs).

Two papers accepted for publication at PADL'18 will be nominated for the
Most Practical Paper award (one of them as the Student Best Paper), each
in cash amount of 250 Euro. These two papers will be invited to submit an
extended version of their contribution to the journal "Theory and Practice
of Logic Programming" for rapid publication. The extended version should
contain at least 30% new content compared to the published conference
paper. The extended paper will undergo an additional review process.
