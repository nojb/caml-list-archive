- SAC 2018

For the past thirty two years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC)
has been a
primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer
engineers, software
engineers, and application developers from around the world.

SAC 2018 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied
Computing (SIGAPP) and
is hosted by hosted by Universit=C3=A9 de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour (UPPA),
Pau, France.

- Call For Student Research Abstracts

Graduate students seeking feedback from the scientific community on their
research ideas
are invited to submit original abstracts of their research work in areas of
experimental
computing and application development related to SAC 2018 Tracks. The
Student Research
Competition (SRC) Program is designed to provide graduate students the
opportunity to meet
and exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners in their areas of
interest.

- OOPS Track: Aims and Topics

Object-oriented programming (OOP) has become the mainstream programming
paradigm for
developing complex software systems in most application domains.

However, existing OO languages and platforms need to evolve to meet the
continuous demand
for new abstractions, features, and tools able to reduce the time, effort,
and cost of
creating object-oriented software systems, and improving their performance,
quality and
usability.

To this aim, OOPS is seeking for research advances bringing benefits in all
those typical
aspects of software development, such as modeling, prototyping, design,
implementation,
concurrency and distribution, code generation, analysis, verification,
testing, debugging,
evaluation, deployment, maintenance, reuse, and software evolution and
adaptation.

The specific topics of interest for the OOPS track include, but are not
limited to, the
following:

*    Aspects and components
*    Code generation, and optimization, just-in-time compilation
*    Context-oriented programming
*    Databases and persistence
*    Distribution and concurrency
*    Dynamic and scripting languages
*    Evaluation
*    Feature Oriented Software Development and Programming
*    Formal verification
*    Internet of Things technology and programming
*    Integration with other paradigms
*    Interoperability, versioning and software evolution and adaptation
*    Language design and implementation
*    Modular and generic programming
*    Reflection, meta-programming
*    Runtime verification and monitoring
*    Safe, secure and dependable software
*    Static analysis
*    Testing and debugging
*    Type systems and type inference
*    Virtual machines

OOPS offers a great opportunity to the OOP community to gain visibility,
and to
exploit the inter-disciplinary nature of SAC.

- Submission Instructions

Prospective papers should be submitted to the track in pdf format using the
START
submission system for regular and SRC papers available through the SAC 2018
home page.

Submission of the same paper to multiple tracks is not allowed; all papers
should
represent original and previously unpublished works that are currently not
under review in
any conference or journal. Both basic and applied research papers are
welcome.

SAC 2018 will use double-blind reviewing; to facilitate this, author
name(s) and
institution(s) must be omitted, and references to authors' own related work
should be in
the third person.

The format of the paper must adhere to the sig-alternate style
(http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates).

Full papers are limited to 8 pages, in camera-ready format, included in the
registration
fee. Authors have the option to include up to two (2) extra pages at
additional fee of
US$80 per page.

Papers accepted as posters are limited to 3 pages, in camera-ready format,
included in the
registration fee. Authors have the option to include only one (1) extra
page at additional
fee of US$80.

SRC abstracts are limited to 2 pages, in camera-ready format, included in
the registration
fee. No extra pages are allowed.

Papers that fall short the above requirements are subjected to rejection.
All papers must
be submitted by September 15, 2017. For more information please visit the
SAC 2018 home
page.

- Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published by ACM in the annual conference
proceedings. Accepted
posters will be published as extended abstracts in the same proceedings.

Paper registration is required, allowing the inclusion of the papers and
posters in the
conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the
paper. This is
a requirement for all accepted papers, posters, and invited SRC submissions
to be included
in the ACM digital library. No-show of scheduled papers, posters, and
student research
abstracts will result in excluding them from the ACM digital library.
Student registration
is only intended to encourage student attendance and does not cover
inclusion of
papers/posters in the conference proceedings.

Finally, following the tradition of the past OOPS editions
(http://oops.disi.unige.it/special-issues), depending on the quality and
the overall
number of accepted papers, authors of selected papers will be invited to
submit an
extended version for a journal special issue (
http://oops.disi.unige.it/special-issues),
after the conference.
