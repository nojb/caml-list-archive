Subject: [Caml-list] CADE-27: Call for Papers, Workshops, Tutorials and
 System Competitions

The 27th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-27)
Natal, Brazil
25-30 August 2019
http://www.cade-27.info

CALL FOR PAPERS

CADE is the major international forum for presenting research on all 
aspects of automated deduction. High-quality submissions on the general 
topic of automated deduction, including foundations, applications, 
implementations, theoretical results, practical experiences and user 
studies are solicited.

Key dates:
  Abstract deadline:        15 February 2019
  Submission deadline:      22 February 2019

* Logics of interest include propositional, first-order, equational, 
  higher-order, classical, description, modal, temporal, many-valued, 
  constructive, other non-classical, meta-logics, logical frameworks, type 
  theory, set theory, as well as any combination thereof.

* Paradigms of interest include theorem proving, model building, 
  constraint solving, computer algebra, model checking, proof checking, 
  and their integration.

* Methods of interest include resolution, superposition, completion, 
  saturation, term rewriting, decision procedures, model elimination, 
  connection methods, tableaux, sequent calculi, natural deduction, as 
  well as their supporting algorithms and data structures, including 
  matching, unification, orderings, induction, indexing techniques, proof 
  presentation and explanation, proof planning.

* Applications of interest include program analysis, verification and 
  synthesis of software and hardware, formal methods, computational logic, 
  computer mathematics, natural language processing, computational 
  linguistics, knowledge representation, ontology reasoning, deductive 
  databases, declarative programming, robotics, planning, and other areas 
  of artificial intelligence.

Submissions can be made in two categories: regular papers and system 
descriptions. The page limit in Springer LNCS style is 15 pages 
excluding references for regular papers and 10 pages excluding 
references for system descriptions. Submissions must be unpublished and 
not submitted for publication elsewhere. They will be judged on 
relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. 
System descriptions must contain a link to a working system and will 
also be judged on usefulness and design. Proofs of theoretical results 
that do not fit in the page limit, executables of systems, and input 
data of experiments should be made available, via a reference to a 
website or in an appendix of the paper. For papers containing 
experimental evaluations, all data needed to rerun the experiments must 
be available. Reviewers will be encouraged to consider this additional 
material, but submissions must be self-contained within the respective 
page limit; considering the additional material should not be necessary 
to assess the merits of a submission. The review process will include a 
feedback/rebuttal period where authors will have the option to respond 
to reviewer comments. The PC chair may solicit further reviews after the 
rebuttal period.

The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer 
LNCS/LNAI series. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can 
be obtained at

http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html

At every CADE conference the Program Committee selects one of the 
accepted papers to receive the CADE Best Paper Award. The award 
recognizes a paper that the Program Committee collegially evaluates as 
the best in terms of originality and significance, having substantial 
confidence in its correctness. Overall technical quality, completeness, 
scholarly accuracy, and readability are also considered. Characteristics 
associated with a best paper include, for instance, introduction of a 
strong new technique or approach, solution of a long-standing open 
problem, introduction and solution of an interesting and important new 
problem, highly innovative application of known ideas or existing 
techniques, and presentation of a new system of outstanding power. Under 
exceptional circumstances, the Program Committee may give two awards (ex 
aequo) or give no award.

IMPORTANT DATES
  Abstract deadline:        15 February 2019
  Submission deadline:      22 February 2019
  Rebuttal phase:           2  April    2019
  Notification:             15 April    2019
  Final version:            27 May      2019

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

The 27th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-27)
Natal, Brazil

25-30 August 2019

http://www.cade-27.info

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

Workshop proposals for CADE-27 are solicited. The workshops will take 
place on August 25-26 2019, before the main conference. Both 
well-established workshops and newer ones are encouraged. Similarly, 
proposals for workshops with a tight focus on a core automated reasoning 
specialization, as well as those with a broader, more applied focus, are 
very welcome.

Please provide the following information in your application document:
+ Workshop title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days) and preferred day(s).
+ Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is 
  the workshop relevant for CADE?
+ Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case 
  information on previous meetings should be given (e.g., links to the 
  program, number of submissions, number of participants).
+ What are the plans for publication?

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Tutorial proposals for CADE-27 are solicited. Tutorials are expected to 
be either half-day or full-day events, with a theoretical or applied 
focus, on a topic of interest for CADE-27. Proposals should provide the 
following information:

+ Tutorial title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed tutorial duration (from half a day to one days) and the 
  preferred day.
+ Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.
+ Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously.

CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for tutorials 
that would like this service.

CALL FOR SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), which evaluates automated 
theorem proving systems for classical logics, has become an integral 
part of the CADE conferences.

Further system competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to 
foster the development of automated reasoning systems in all areas 
relevant for automated deduction in a broader sense. Proposals should 
include the following information:

+ Competition title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Duration and schedule of the competition.
+ Room/space requirements.
+ Description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.
+ Is the competition new or has it been organized before?  In the latter 
  case information on previous competitions should be given.
+ What computing resources are required and how will they be provided?

IMPORTANT DATES

Workshop/Tutorials/System Competitions:
  Submission deadline:       15 November 2018
  Notification:              15 December 2018
