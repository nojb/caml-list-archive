Subject: [Caml-list] Formal Methods 2019: First Call for Papers



==================================================================================================



FM 2019 - 23rd International Symposium on Formal Methods - 3rd World Congress on Formal Methods



Porto, Portugal, October 7-11, 2019



http://formalmethods2019.inesctec.pt/

==================================================================================================





FM 2019 is the 23rd international symposium in a series organised by Formal Methods Europe (FME), 

an independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods 

for software development. Every 10 years the symposium is organised as a World Congress. Twenty 

years after FM 1999 in Toulouse, and 10 years after FM 2009 in Eindhoven, FM 2019 is the 3rd World 

Congress on Formal Methods. This is reflected in a PC with members from over 40 countries. Thus, 

FM 2019 will be both an occasion to celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and 

practitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas and share their experience. 



FORMAL METHODS: THE NEXT 30 YEARS



It is now more than 30 years since the first VDM symposium in 1987 brought together researchers 

with the common goal of creating methods to produce high quality software based on rigour and 

reason. Since then the diversity and complexity of computer technology has changed enormously and 

the formal methods community has stepped up to the challenges those changes brought by adapting, 

generalising and improving the models and analysis techniques that were the focus of that first 

symposium. The theme for FM 2019 is a reflection on how far the community has come and the 

lessons we can learn for understanding and developing the best software for future technologies. 





Important Dates

================



Abstract submission: 28 March, 2019 

Full paper submission: 11 April, 2019, 23:59 AoE

Notification: 11 June, 2019       

Camera ready: 9 July, 2019

Conference: 7-11 October, 2019 





Topics of Interest

======================



FM 2019 encourages submissions on formal methods in a wide range of domains including software, 

computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, human-computer interaction, 

manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart cities, and healthcare. We particularly 

welcome papers on techniques, tools and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We also 

welcome papers on experiences of formal methods in industry, and on the design and validation of 

formal methods tools. The broad topics of interest for FM 2019 include, but are not limited to: 



- Interdisciplinary formal methods: Techniques, tools and experiences demonstrating the use of

formal methods in interdisciplinary settings.



- Formal methods in practice: Industrial applications of formal methods, experience with formal 

methods in industry, tool usage reports, experiments with challenge problems. The authors are 

encouraged to explain how formal methods overcame problems, led to improved designs, or provided 

new insights.



- Tools for formal methods: Advances in automated verification, model checking, and testing with 

formal methods, tools integration, environments for formal methods, and experimental validation 

of tools. The authors are encouraged to demonstrate empirically that the new tool or environment 

advances the state of the art.



- Formal methods in software and systems engineering: Development processes with formal methods, 

usage guidelines for formal methods, and method integration. The authors are encouraged to 

evaluate process innovations with respect to qualitative or quantitative improvements. Empirical 

studies and evaluations are also solicited.



- Theoretical foundations of formal methods: All aspects of theory related to specification, 

verification, refinement, and static and dynamic analysis. The authors are encouraged to explain 

how their results contribute to the solution of practical problems with formal methods or tools.





Submission Guidelines

=======================



Papers should be original work, not published or submitted elsewhere, in Springer LNCS format, 

written in English, submitted through EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fm2019



Each paper will be evaluated by at least three members of the Programme Committee. Authors of 

papers reporting experimental work are strongly encouraged to make their experimental results 

available for use by the reviewers. Similarly, case study papers should describe significant 

case studies, and the complete development should be made available at the time of review. The  

usual criteria for novelty, reproducibility, correctness and the ability for others to build upon  

the described work apply. Tool papers should explain enhancements made compared to previously 

published work. A tool paper need not present the theory behind the tool but should focus on 

the tool's features, how it is used, its evaluation, and examples and screen shots illustrating 

the tool's use. Authors of tool papers should make their tool available for use by the reviewers.



We solicit two categories of papers:



- Regular Papers should not exceed 15 pages, not counting references and appendices.



- Short papers, including tool papers, should not exceed 6 pages, not counting references and 

appendices. Besides tool papers, short papers are encouraged for any topic that can be described 

within the page limit, and in particular for novel ideas without an extensive experimental 

evaluation. Short papers will be accompanied by short presentations.



For regular and tool papers, an appendix can provide additional material such as details on 

proofs or experiments. The appendix is not part of the page count and not guaranteed to be read 

or taken into account by the reviewers. It should not contain information necessary to the 

understanding and the evaluation of the presented work. Papers will be accepted or rejected in 

the category in which they were submitted.



At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as 

a registered participant.





Best Paper Award

=================



At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors of the submission selected 

as the FM 2019 Best Paper.





Publication

============



Accepted papers will be published in the Symposium Proceedings to appear in Springer's Lecture 

Notes in Computer Science in the subline on Formal Methods. Traditionally, extended versions of 

selected papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of one or more journals.
