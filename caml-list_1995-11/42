Subject: Caml-Light with TK on the Macintosh
Sender: weis
Status: O


I am doing a project, with graphics, that needs to run on the
Macintosh, PC Windows, and Unix.  I am hesitating between TCL/Tk and
Caml-Light.  I vastly prefer the latter, due to the more regular
structure of the language.  However, I have downloaded the Caml-Light
implementation for the Macintosh, and it does not include the Tk
library.  Does anyone have any indication of whether Caml-Light will
support the Tk library on the Macintosh, or if not how difficult it
would be to port?

Thanks for any pointers.
