   THe problem is to port tcl and tk to the Mac ! as far as I know,
   tcl has been ported (it is used by the alpha editor) but not

   wrong could someone tell me ...

You are indeed incorrect; the latest version of TCL/Tk has been ported
to the Mac, and the binary and sources are available.  I wanted to
post the address; however, the Sun HTTP server is having problems and
I could not get through.

   You could also try to use camlwin, which is not yet ported to Mac
   but should be much easier to port ...

The main question for me is: how easy would it be to port camltk.c to
the Mac, and have it call the Mac Tk library?  Any ideas?
