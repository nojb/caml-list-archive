I'd say that the port should be easy. There is nothing really
Unix specific in CamlTk. Most of the code is generated automatically
from a description of Tk widgets and commands in a special language.
The port (be it for Mac or Windows) would consist essentially in
upgrading this description from Tk4.0 to Tk4.1

At this time, we simply don't have the manpower to do the port
ourselves, but volunteers are welcome. Of course I'll offer my
assistance !
