Subject: Foreign language in error messages
Sender: weis
Status: O


I have seen in the ref. manual that there is a possibility to say to the
compiler than one wishes others languages than english (e.g. french, german
or spanish) to be used for its messages.

But is there a possibility to use these languages for messages issued by
the toplevel loop ?
