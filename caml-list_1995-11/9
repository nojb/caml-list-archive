A new release of Caml Light for Windows is available on ftp.inria.fr,
directory lang/caml-light, file cl7windows-b1.zip.

This version of Caml Light offers a graphical user interface for the
interactive toplevel system, as well as the batch compilers.
It runs under Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows 3.1 with the help of
the Win32s extension.

This beta 1 release fixes all bugs reported with the previous alpha 1
release. The only features not yet implemented are the graphics
primitives and support for the batch compilers under Windows 3.1.

Please send the bug reports to caml-light@pauillac.inria.fr
