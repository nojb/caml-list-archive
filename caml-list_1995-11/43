THe problem is to port tcl and tk to the Mac ! as far as I know, tcl has been
ported (it is used by the alpha editor) but not tk. porting tk would be a
rather difficult job i think .... If I am wrong could someone tell me ...

You could also try to use camlwin, which is not yet ported to Mac but should
be much easier to port ...
