We plan to develop an interface between Omega-calculator 0.96 (C++) and Camllight. The kernel 
has been already done (via external fucntion) but programming with this library is strongly imperative.
In order to have a functionnal approach of programming it suffices that the generated objects 
are  free by the  garbage collector. 

 Is there some way to tell the garbage collector to free some objects ?
