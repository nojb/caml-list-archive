A few quick questions about CAML Light:

(1) Is there an interface to "tempnam" or something similar? (For creating
unique temporary filenames). I looked in the "unix" library but couldn't
find anything -- I think it'd be a convenient addition.

(2) I'm not really convinced that integrating signal and exception handling
is a good idea; it's neither pleasant nor efficient to always have to worry
about signal exceptions popping up. Is it possible to make SIGINT terminate
the evaluation of the current toplevel phrase, without passing a signal
exception to the currently executing function?

(3) Is there some hook to allow a user-defined function to be called after
the evaluation and printing of each toplevel phrase? This would be nice for
reporting run statistics etc.

Thanks,

John.
