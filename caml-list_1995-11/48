Announcing release 1.11 of the Caml Special Light system.

Main changes since 1.10:

* Streams and stream parsers a la Caml Light are back (thanks to
Daniel de Rauglaudre).

* User-level concurrent threads, with low-level shared memory primitives
  (locks and conditions) as well as channel-based communication primitives
  with first-class synchronous events, in the style of Reppy's CML.

* The native-code compiler has been ported to the HP PA-RISC processor
  running under NextStep (sorry, no HPUX, its linker keeps dumping
  core on me).

* References not captured in a function are optimized into variables.

* Fixed several bugs related to exceptions.

* Floats behave a little more as specified in the IEEE standard
  (believe it or not, but x < y is not the negation of x >= y).

* Lower memory consumption for the native-code compiler.

The complete sources as well as diffs from release 1.10
are available by anonymous FTP at the usual place
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light.
