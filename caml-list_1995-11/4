Caml Special Light version 1.10 has just been released.

This release fixes many small bugs with 1.07 (too many to list here),
and adds the following features:

* Module language: introduction of a "with module" notation over
signatures for concise sharing of all type components of a signature;
better support for concrete types in signatures.

* Native-code compiler: the Intel 386 version has been ported to
NextStep and FreeBSD, and generates better code (especially for
floats)

* Tools and libraries: the Caml Light profiler and library for
arbitrary-precision arithmetic have been ported (thanks to John
Malecki and Victor Manuel Gulias Fernandez); better docs for the Unix
and regexp libraries.

The complete sources are available by anonymous FTP at the usual place
ftp://ftp.inria.fr/lang/caml-light. Diffs are not available because
of bootstrapping problems.

General info about Caml Special Light can be found on the Web, at
