| It is a SMOP (Small Matter Of Programming). Here is the function I use:

Yes, I ended up doing something using the PID. But then most library
functions are a SMOP; it still seems reasonable to provide the ones that
users are going to need. At least you and I needed this one.

That's an all-too-accurate reading! Except that I could perfectly well have
a common exception "MYERR" and just use "try ... with MYERR(_) -> ...". I
wouldn't object to the extra typing, but I guess it would be significantly
less efficient. Is that true? I suppose I could try it and find out.

| No, there isn't.

Well, since you excel at reading between the lines, you can read my question
as "what a great idea it would be to add some hook... wouldn't it?" My guess
is that it would be easy for a CAML-Light expert to add, since the
interpreter's read-eval-print loop itself seems to be written in CAML.

Cheers,

John.
