UMLMON is a monitor for User Mode Linux (UML) that sets up a runtime
environment for UML and controls the execution of UML. UMLMON uses a
quite advanced client/server architecture, is rock-stable, and even has
a web interface.

The newest version of UMLMON, 1.0.1, has just been released. It is now
available under the terms of the GPL.

UMLMON is a feature-rich monitor:

- UMLMON creates and maintains a runtime environment for UML.
  This includes a chroot jail and the automatic setup of 
  needed resources.

- UMLMON is a daemon with an RPC interface. One can control 
  the daemon and the running UML instance by sending commands 
  over this interface. The RPC interface works locally and 
  over the network.

- Of course, one can start and stop the UML instance over the
  UMLMON daemon.

- UMLMON can establish bidirectional connections to the virtual
  consoles and the virtual serial lines. This means one can 
  directly have an interactive session on the virtual machine 
  without having to rely on networking.

- UMLMON can log the output of virtual consoles. Even log 
  rotation is supported.

- UMLMON has administrative functions to create and manipulate
  virtual disks.

- UMLMON eases the setup of virtual networking.

- UMLMON is a secure environment. Although the daemon runs as 
  root, it is written in a _safe_ programming language such 
  that it is impossible that buffer overflows or other flaws 
  of low-level languages allow attackers to break in.

- There is a command-line interface and a web interface.
  Due to restricted resources the latter is currently only
  available in German language. A multilingual version is
  planned, though.

I hope you see also the advantages of such a daemon. You can get rid of
all the hackish scripts that are typically used in a UML setup, and have
a clean and powerful solution that grows with your requirements.

The UMLMON homepage is at http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/umlmon.

There are binaries for LSB-2.0 (Linux Standard Base). See
http://www.gerd-stolpmann.de/buero/umlmon/umlmon-1.0.1-install.txt.en
for instructions where to get them and how to install them.

Source code:
http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/umlmon-1.0.1.tar.gz. It is
quite difficult to build UMLMON on a typical Linux distro because most
prerequisite libraries are missing, or are too old. The easiest way is
to go with GODI, http://godi.ocaml-programming.de, which includes a lot
of scripts to automate the build of programs written in O'Caml. Just
install the packages apps-umlmon and apps-umlmon-web.

Problems, questions, etc. are answered by me, please contact me
privately <gerd@gerd-stolpmann.de>.

UMLMON is an Open Source product by Informatikbuero Gerd Stolpmann.
Commercial support setting up the daemon and the whole UML system can be
bought, especially here in Germany.
