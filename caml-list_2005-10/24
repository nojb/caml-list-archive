I think it's a great idea, but I have a couple of questions:
- how do you specify more than one library (on my OS everything that 
follows #!/path/to/ocamlscript is treated as only one argument)?
- could packages be loaded with ocamlfind so that we don't have to worry 
about dependencies, -I flags and camlp4 libraries?

Personnally, I would really appreciate if could write a script is a style 
like this:

------------
#!/usr/bin/ocamlscript
# packs = micmatch_pcre lacaml lablgtk
(* my program starts here, the first line which doesn't start with a # *)
let _ = print_endline "Hello"
------------

or maybe more like that:

------------
#!/usr/bin/ocamlscript

(*! packs = micmatch_pcre lacaml lablgtk *)

(* only the first ocaml comment is parsed by ocamlscript, if there is no 
code before and starts with ! *)

let _ = print_endline "Hello"
------------
