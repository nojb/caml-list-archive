I have created a make file and compile my program with make tool in this
way:
make
I run this command in same path that the makefile is saved. But following
error message is shown:
No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.
I think that I should give makefile to make tool. I examined switches of
make tool but I could not find any appropriate switch.
How can I fix this problem?
Thanks,
Karimi.
