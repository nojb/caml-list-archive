Hello,

A way to compile source code under windows is to install Cygwin... But
even with cygwin I did'n manage to compile libraries under windows (if
anyone has som clues... I think it is related to some file headers)
Anyway, you can build your GTK interface without a GUI builder, it is
very very easy.
