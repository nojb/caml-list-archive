It's not a high priority at the moment, but I'm at least ready to fix
any reported bug.

It is not quite thread-safe, actually, as it uses a mutable
datastructures internally (a DFA is built lazily).  Still, you can use
it simultaneously in different threads as long as no compiled regular
expression is used simultaneoously by several threads.

You should package the CVS version of the library.  It has several bug
fixed compare to version 0.1.
