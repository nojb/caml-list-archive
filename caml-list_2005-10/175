				   TFP 2006
	    Seventh Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming
		     Nottingham, UK, 19 - 21 April, 2006

		    http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~nhn/TFP2006

			  Co-located with Types 2006

			       CALL FOR PAPERS



The Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international
forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of functional programmi=
ng
languages, focusing on providing a broad view of current and future trends =
in
Functional Programming. It aspires to be a lively environment for presenting
the latest research results through acceptance by extended abstracts. A for=
mal
post-symposium refereeing process then selects the best papers presented at
the symposium for publication in a high-profile volume.

TFP 2006 is going to be held in Nottingham, UK, 19 - 21 April. Note that th=
is
is significantly earlier in the year than past TFPs that generally were held
in August - September. TFP 2006 is co-located with Types 2006 (18 - 21 Apri=
l).=20

Previous TFP symposia were held in Scotland in 2002 and 2003, as successors=
 to
the successful series of Scottish Functional Programming Workshops, in Muni=
ch,
Germany in 2004, and in Tallinn, Estonia in 2005 (co-located with ICFP and
GPCE). For further general information about TFP, see http://www.tifp.org/.


SCOPE OF THE SYMPOSIUM

The Symposium recognises that new trends may arise through various routes. =
As
part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following
five categories of paper. High-quality papers are solicited in any of these
categories:

    Research Papers:   leading-edge, previously unpublished research work
    Position Papers:   on what new trends should or should not be
    Project Papers:    descriptions of recently started new projects
    Evaluation Papers: what lessons can be drawn from a finished project
    Overview Papers:   summarising work with respect to a trendy subject

Papers must be original, and not submitted for simultaneous publication in =
any
other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming:
theoretical, implementation-oriented, or more experience-oriented. Also
applications of functional programming techniques to other languages may be
considered.

Papers on the following subject areas are particularly welcome:

    o dependently typed functional programming
    o validation and verification of functional programs
    o debugging for functional languages
    o functional programming and security
    o functional programming and mobility
    o functional programming and formally motivated computing
    o functional languages for telecommunications applications=20
    o functional languages for embedded systems
    o functional programming applied to global computing
    o functional GRIDs
    o functional languages for reasoning about imperative/object-oriented
      programs
    o interoperability with imperative programming languages
    o any new emerging trend in the functional programming area

If you are in doubt on whether your paper is within the scope of TFP, please
contact the TFP 2006 program chair, Henrik Nilsson, nhn@cs.nott.ac.uk.


BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD

TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging
that students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. To
acknowledge this, a prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.


CO-LOCATION WITH TYPES 2006

TFP 2006 is co-located with Types 2006 (to be held 18 - 21 April). To take
advantage of the synergies offered by these two complementary events, we wi=
ll
invite a number of joint keynote speakers, hold joint sessions on topics of
mutual interest, such as dependently typed functional programming, and run
common social events. The schedule will be arranged so that participants may
freely move between parallel sessions of the two events.


SUBMISSION

Acceptance to the symposium will be based upon extended abstracts of betwee=
n 6
and 10 pages. Accepted abstracts are to be completed to full papers before =
the
symposium for publication in the local symposium proceedings.

Important dates:

    Deadline for abstract submission:	17 February, 2006
    Notification of acceptance:		27 February, 2006
    Registration deadline:		17 March, 2006
    Camera-ready copy of full paper:	24 March, 2006

The submission must clearly indicate to which category it belongs: research,
position, project, evaluation or overview paper. It should also indicate
whether the main author or authors are research students.

Abstracts and full papers must be written in English. Papers for the sympos=
ium
proceedings must adhere to the formatting instructions using the provided on
the TFP 2006 site. Papers must not exceed 16 pages; papers in some categori=
es
may comprise considerably fewer pages.


POST SYMPOSIUM REFEREEING AND PUBLICATION

In addition to the local symposium proceedings, we intend to continue the T=
FP
tradition of publishing a high-quality subset of contributions in the
Intellect series on Trends in Functional Programming. Revised papers will be
refereed after the symposium to the normal conference standards and a subset
of the best papers over all categories will be selected for publication.=20
Papers will be judged on their contribution to the research area, with
appropriate criteria applied to each category of paper.

Papers submitted for publication by Intellect must follow formatting and any
other instructions provided by the Programme Chair.

For TFP 2005, in order to enhance the quality of student submissions, a
process where student papers were given extra feedback was tried out. A
similar process might be put in place for this TFP, contingent on the outco=
me
of that trial.
