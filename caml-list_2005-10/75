This looks as though it is Lablgtk2, which is probably the bset
supported Ocaml GUI at the moment (although it may be the older
Lablgtk - the documentation of the program you're trying to compile
should make this clear).

Your first message suggests that you are compiling for Windows, which
means that you're in for a tough ride. Lablgtk2 is an Ocaml binding
for Gtk 2.x, which is a popular Linux/Unix widget set. There is a
Windows port, but it is quite painful to install (I should know, I did
it a couple of weeks back...)

Go to http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html and
download lablgtk-2.4.0.tar.gz. Note that you cannot use the Windows
binary package if you want to compile with ocamlopt.

Unzip and untar, and read README and (especially) README.win32 carefully.

Go to http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html and download
the required binary installer packages (there are a lot of them). You
will need both runtime and developer files.

Install these somewhere sensible. I would strongly recommend that you
ensure that you don't have any spaces in the directory path (I used
c:\libs\gtk2 - definitely avoid c:\Program Files\...), and ensure that
your path environment variable points to the installed Gtk+ library
components.

Now follow the build instructions for Lablgtk2 carefully.

I use the word carefully rather often as the install worked perfectly
for me, but only after several false starts where I tried to cut
corners.

If you are building on Linux or another Unix system, it is likely that
the Gtk+ libraries are already installed. If they are not, then they
should be much easier to get and iinstall than for Windows.

Good luck!

Jeremy
