You will have the best performance and maybe the best memory
usage, when writing all your programs in Assembler.

Well, I really like fast langauges, but performance is not all
(even if all is nothing when the performance is bad).


Is performance the only or the biggest thing you look for,
when deciding fo a programming langauge?
