I was not asking, what language is better for soimething, or best at all.
I asked for what programming style/paradigm is best used to solve
certain problems.

As OCaml provides more than one programming paradigm, for me
it's the best language I ever had programmed in (some
other features are also fine).

So the question goes in a different direction:
  How to solve problems best, if you have the possibility
  do do it in different ways.

Well, every programmer can choose it's own way, but if certain areas
are well known to do them in a certain way best, it  makes sense
to go that direction.

For example, I'm not really a fan of OO-programming, but when
programming GUI-software I think it would be the best choice,
and FP-programming lacks flexibility here (if not using
a DSL to create GUI-code, which then is separately compiled).

Ciao,
   Oliver
