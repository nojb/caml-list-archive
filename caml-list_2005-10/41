I received both the original and this duplicate.

Have you seen Isaac Trott's idlgl bindings, written using camlidl?

I have tried and failed to write bindings to the more complicated (read 
"hideous") parts of OpenGL and GLU, specifically the GLU tesselator.

There are also problems with typing, e.g. sets of related functions that 
handle polymorphic metadata of the same type between each of the functions. 
This could be implemented using functors, records of functions or objects. 
I'm not sure if it would be better to do more on the OCaml side using Obj or 
to use C.

I'm keen to see your results! :-)
