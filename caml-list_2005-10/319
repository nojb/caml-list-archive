Well, we are still waiting for some kind soul or souls to contribute 
more "*nix-like" sections and settings for the LablPCRE Makefile.  As 
distributed, the package is able to be built (as stated in the 
Makefile) with a Microsoft toolchain for Windows... :)

Not that it solves your problem, but there is a newer and much 
improved version of the package at

http://www.rftp.com/LablPCRE-0.9.tar.gz

I have been holding off release in the hope that some of the needed 
other build settings would come trickling in.
