I think we may attach different meanings to "position independent code."
For me PIC includes PIC suitable for dynamic linking. (This is what the
-fPIC option tells GCC to do.)

Not on current versions of Linux/x86_64. They only support 48 bit
code addresses (I think it is 48 bits), this is the so-called
'small model'.

This has nothing to do with making the *code* position independent.
It is to do with supporting elf/ld.so dynamic loading. This is
another issue entirely.=20

Clearly, to access a symbol of an 'unknown' address,
you put the address into a known table slot instead,
when the library is loaded, and access indirectly.

In any case, this doesn't solve the problem, but it does
identify it correctly: the problem is to emit instructions
to bind to load-time linked libraries on Linux/Elf/ld.so=20
platforms. You can be sure Windows -- for the same processor --
uses a different dynamic linkage model .. :)
