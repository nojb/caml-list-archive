I've been trying to figure out what the state of OCaml on Windows is,
and I'm wondering if anyone on the list can help me out.  I've been
trying to get godi, findlib and integration with MS excel going at the
same time.  The problem is that these approaches appear at first
glance to be incompatible.  Here are the dependencies that I know
about.

1. Godi works only on cygwin, and isn't supported even with mingw.
2. Findlib works with cygwin -or- mingw, but doesn't work with the native b=
uild
3. The real windows support (win32 libraries and ocamole, the latter
of which provides Excel integration), only work with the native build.

Does anyone have a sense of whether any of these issues can be
overcome?  How much work, for instance, would it take to get findlib
working on the native win32 build?  How about Godi?  How about getting
theings like ocamole working with the mingw build?

Thanks,
Yaron Minsky
