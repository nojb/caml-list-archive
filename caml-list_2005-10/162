A possible option (as suggested by someone else) would be to use glade
or gazpacho. But you would then need to use the lablgtk binding to
libglade (the runtime part to use a GUI description). It can be
compiled on windows, and it is included in the source distribution,
but not in the binary distribution. You might try to compile it
yourself.
