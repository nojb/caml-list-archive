Mottl et al. kindly wrote lacaml to interface to LAPACK. The lacaml page is 
linked to from the bottom of the page of my OCaml book:

  http://www.ffconsultancy.com/products/ocaml_for_scientists

Basic use (including compilation) is described on p173 and the "Eigen 
problems" example on p236-239 demonstrates the use of lacaml. The 33-line 
OCaml program is freely available on-line:
