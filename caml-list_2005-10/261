I'm having difficulty installing PCRE-OCaml in my Cygwin OCaml 
installation.  I have the packages OCaml 3.08.1-1, libpcre 6.3-1, and 
pcre 6.3-1 all from a default recent Cygwin installation, so it seems to 
me that I should be able to install PCRE-OCaml (I'm getting the most 
recent version, 5.10.1) straight away.  Here is what I get, though:

=====

/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1 $ make
[everything succeeds, though there is one warning:
pcre_stubs.c:1: warning: -fPIC ignored for target (all code is position 
independent)
]

/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1 $ make install
make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1/lib'

Installing library with ocamlfind
ocamlfind install  pcre META pcre.mli pcre.cmi pcre.cma pcre.cmxa pcre.a 
libpcre_stubs.a dllpcre_stubs.so
ocamlfind: Package pcre is already installed; please remove it first - 
(directory /usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/pcre already exists)
make[1]: *** [libinstall] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1/lib'
make: *** [install] Error 2

=====

If I try to uninstall, however, I get the following problem:

=====

/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1 $ make uninstall
make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1/lib'

Uninstalling library with ocamlfind
ocamlfind remove  pcre
ocamlfind: Package `pcre' not found
make[1]: *** [libuninstall] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1/lib'
make: *** [uninstall] Error 2

=====

Now, the directory /usr/lib/ocaml/site-lib/pcre is actually empty; if I 
delete it and try to install, the following happens:

=====

$ make install
make[1]: Entering directory `/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1/lib'

Installing library with ocamlfind
ocamlfind install  pcre META pcre.mli pcre.cmi pcre.cma pcre.cmxa pcre.a 
libpcre_stubs.a dllpcre_stubs.so
ocamlfind: dllpcre_stubs.so: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [libinstall] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/pcre-ocaml-5.10.1/lib'
make: *** [install] Error 2

=====

Any suggestions? I really hate using the str library for regular 
expressions, since it has global state.

I notice that Brian Donovan asked the same thing (though he was trying 
to install it using the MSVC and Win32 makefiles, both of which failed) 
about 18 months ago, and didn't seem to get a satisfactory reply!

Many thanks in advance for any help!

Best,

Roger
