                      PAPP 2006
           Third International Workshop on
   Practical Aspects of High-level Parallel Programming
   http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~abenoit/conf/papp2006.html

                        part of

		      ICCS 2006
    The International Conference on Computational Science
         May 28-31, 2006, University of Reading, UK
----------------------------------------------------------



AIMS AND SCOPE

Computational Science applications are more and more complex to
develop and require more and more computing power. Parallel and grid
computing are solutions to the increasing need for computing
power. High level languages offer a high degree of abstraction which
ease the development of complex systems. Moreover, being based on
formal semantics, it is possible to certify the correctness of
critical parts of the applications.

Algorithmic skeletons, parallel extensions of functional languages
such as Haskell and ML, parallel logic and constraint programming,
parallel execution of declarative programs such as SQL queries, etc.
have produced methods and tools that improve the price/performance
ratio of parallel software, and broaden the range of target
applications.

The PAPP workshop focuses on practical aspects of high-level parallel
programming: design, implementation and optimization of high-level
programming languages and tools (performance predictors working on
high-level parallel/grid source code, visualisations of abstract
behaviour, automatic hotspot detectors, high-level GRID resource
managers, compilers, automatic generators, etc.), applications in all
fields of computational science, benchmarks and experiments. Research
on high-level grid programming is particularly relevant.

The PAPP workshop is aimed both at researchers involved in the
development of high level approaches for parallel and grid computing
and computational science researchers who are potential users of these
languages and tools.


TOPICS

We welcome submission of original, unpublished papers in English on
topics including:

* high-level models (CGM, BSP, MPM, LogP, etc.) and tools for parallel
   and grid computing

* high-level parallel language design, implementation and
   optimisation

* functional, logic, constraint programming for parallel, distributed
   and grid computing systems

* algorithmic skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries

* generative (e.g. template-based) programming with algorithmic
   skeletons, patterns and high-level parallel libraries

* applications in all fields of high-performance computing (using
   high-level tools)

* benchmarks and experiments using such languages and tools


PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English
presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and
not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will go through a
rigorous reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by at least
three referees. The accepted papers will be published in the
Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as
part of the ICCS proceedings.

Submission must be done through the ICCS website:
http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2006/papers/upload.php
We invite you to submit a full paper of 8 pages formatted according to
the rules of LNCS, describing new and original results, no later than
December 2, 2005. Submission implies the willingness of at least one
of the authors to register and present the paper. An early email to
Anne.Benoit at ens-lyon.fr with your intention to submit a paper would
be greatly appreciated (especially if you have doubts about the
relevance of your paper).

Accepted papers should be presented at the workshop and extended and
revised versions will be published in a special issue of Parallel and
Distributed Computing Practices, provided revisions suggested by the
referees are made.
