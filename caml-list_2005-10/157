Dear Freinds,
I want to implement a GUI for my program. Provided for rapid development, I
need to a GUI builder. MLGlade and Zoggy are two popular GUI builders. Both
of them are intended for Linux OS but I develop my program in Windows OS. I
tried to compile source code of those tools but I could not do that. Becaus=
e
There is need to utilities such as ./configure and autoconfig that are not
in Windows OS.
Does any friend know a GUI builder for Windows OS.?
Thanks,
Mark.
