Porting Godi to mingw has become quite important. It is now
top-priority, but apparently not simple. A lot of preliminary work has
already been done, especially getting rid of all the C helper programs
(this is not yet released, though), so the port has only to deal with
O'Caml programs and shell scripts.

However, there is no solution in the short term. I expect the release of
the mingw port in summer 2006.

This should be doable. Findlib is a pure O'Caml program, and the system
side is very simple. Although I don't know what is going wrong, I
suspect the calling conventions of external programs are different.
Findlib executes ocamlc as subprocess.

I have actually no idea whether this can be ported to mingw, or whether
one can at least link mingw- and msvc-generated libraries together. The
mingw web site says this is possible.
