That's where I'm not really sure, except that it is observably
thrashing.  Since it's a simple iteration, I guess that would
implicate the GC?

Ah OK ... I'm interested though: why does binding a value to a name
cause problems?  Surely at this level (ocamlopt generated code) there
ought to be no difference between a named value and an unnamed one?
