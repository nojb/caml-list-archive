If you are using GNU make, you specify the name of the makefile like this:

  make -f <name_of_file>

But you shouldn't have to do that. By default, make will always find a
Makefile named 'Makefile' or 'makefile' (and I think there are 1 or 2
other acceptable spellings).

By the way, you will probably get better answers (to this question and
others) if you give some more information about what you are trying to
do. What platform are you working on? Do you have GNU make, or some
other implementation? What is the name of your makefile. And so on.
