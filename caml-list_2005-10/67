There is no reason that a particular error occurs with ocamlopt and
not ocamlc, especially as the syntax and typing phases are common to
both compilers (moreover, bugs in ocaml compilers are quite rare. Rule
of thumb: never suspect a bug in the compiler, always in your code).
So I would suspect an issue with your particular file or your
compiling environment. We cannot say much more without (1) having your
particular .ml and .mli file and (2) knowing in which environment your
are compiling.

Yours,
d.
