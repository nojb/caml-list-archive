Instructions to Authors

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract of at least 
4 pages or a full paper of at most 16 pages in LaTeX 11pt article 
size. This submitted article can be written in English, French 
or Spanish but must include in any case English versions of the 
title and abstract. LaTeX templates in each of the three languages 
are available at
http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/tc2006/site/submission/submission.html

Original research results and insightful analysis of current concerns 
are solicited for submission. Submissions must not substantially duplicate 
work published or submitted for publication elsewhere. Late submissions
will be rejected. Papers will be reviewed by the program committee 
and additional referees. Proceedings will be distributed at the
symposium.  Electronic submission is mandatory and the submission 
web page is
http://www.easychair.org/TC2006/submit/

Each submission should have an abstract as well as an introductory 
section that: describes the problem, motivates the study of the 
problem, states the main results and compares them to other work 
(including theoretical or empirical performance) and summarizes the 
original aspects of the contribution. Authors of accepted papers 
are expected to present their work at the symposium, or to make 
arrangements to have it presented.
