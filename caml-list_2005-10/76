Hi,
I don't think you can use SOCK_RAW in pure ocaml. I spent a few minutes 
on it, but never had time to get very far.
http://glek.net/subversion/packetml/
That contains a simple ocaml program(with a c function to setup the 
socket) that sends a packet out.

That has basic ocaml code needed to send a packet and contains functions 
for making packets too. Code comes from the basic network stack in dst, 
I just never factored out packet parsing functions properly.
