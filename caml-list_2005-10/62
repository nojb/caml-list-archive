>From my limited experience I see it this way:

Mathematical computations, algorithms, interfacing
(complicated data conversions), text translations,
parsing, anything which can be well represented by
dataflow diagrams and where there is no changing state
==> 
use FP

User interfaces, business systems, anything with
objects which have changing states and which react to
events and interact with each other ==> use OOP
