Hello Martin,

2005/10/3, Martin Jambon <martin_jambon@emailuser.net>:

Yes, I have the same behavior on my system (Linux). But multiple
arguments are correctly interpreted (I just checked it).

The multiple arguments are seen as a single argument by ocamlscript
(i.e. the behaviour you observed) but, as the compilation command is
done through a Unix.system call, the underlying shell re-interprets
arguments through space separations.

Well, this software is quite short (about 100 lines) and is more a
proof of concept than expected to solve all cases. In other words, I
don't plan to invest much time in it. But it is free software and
patches are welcome. ;-)

Yours,
d.
