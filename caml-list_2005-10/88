As you may have seen from my initial reply to that posting, I originally 
was quite sceptical. However, I had a somewhat lengthy PM conversation 
with Dr. Jon Harrop where he kindly and patiently explained to me his 
methodology and findings, and eventually, this inspired me to contribute 
another benchmark (which I did of my own) to this comparison. As this 
issue created a lot of traffic on comp.lang.functional, comp.lang.scheme, 
comp.lang.java.programmer, and some other newsgroups, this could even be 
of interest to a broader audience.
