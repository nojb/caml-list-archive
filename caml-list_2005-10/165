I'm currently working on one for an in-house project I'm doing.  I can
post the source if you would like.  Currently, request and response
handling are done, cookies are done, and sessions just need a little
tweak to get them working.  The persistance of sessions works (rather
nicely I might add, I just need to rewrite them to use cookies, that is
unless someone knows off hand if there is an attribute in the HTTP
headers to start a HTTP session within the web server.  There are also
URL en/de-code functions...

The library is in pure OCaml and is (almost) purely functional.  No
libraries external to the main OCaml distribution are required.
