Hi,

Has anyone done any work on this?  I'm in the process of attempting a
semi autogenerated binding to opengl using the mesa xml specifications
of the interface and lablgl.  This is very early days; so far all I've
done is map the flat (a portion of the) gl enumeration space to a set
of types and values, then auto generate tables mapping the ml variants
to gl enumeration values ala lablgl.

I have a good idea of what it will do and am just looking for advice
from anyone who has done this sort of thing before (if any).  The main
problems so far arise from the flat gl space and wanting to split that
up into a more friendly set of types and modules. In fact, I will only
be generating the mundane stuff as some of this mapping is quite
tricky and using that as a base.  Many of the opengl functions are
trivially mapped to OCaml but those that don't will be hand coded.

Any thoughts?


Regards,
Chris
