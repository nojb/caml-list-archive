I think I'm starting to understand some of how the toplevel & bytecode
interpreter work. Some of it, I don't understand why, so will continue
from there ;-)

In the toplevel, you can #load in an ocaml library, but you still need
all the .cmi files in order to open/use them. Why is that? Shouldn't
it be in the library?

Also, I presume loading libraries on the fly, and having access to
-all- symbols defined in .cmi files available does -not- use the
Dynlink module. Is this correct?

How can a bytecode program do the same things as the toplevel in terms
of #load-ing libraries and accessing any given value as specifed in
the compiled interface files?

Lastly, why is the Dynlink module unable to provide the ability to
access any given value in a compiled interface file when loading a
bytecode object? Or can it? The comments for the Dynlink module
specify that this -isn't- possible. However, it -can- access values
from the program the loads the .cmo -- is that correct?
