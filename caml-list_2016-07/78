Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

--94eb2c093d22e3315f053726fede
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

As John McCarthy said, as far as programming language adoption goes, it
doesn't matter what professional programmers think. What matters is what 19
year-olds think. I've been teaching OCaml in my CS101 course for two years
now. Students have to choose between my OCaml-based course and the standard
one using Python. Getting them to opt for OCaml over the more
resume-friendly Python is a bit of a slog. But the ones who go for it wind
up really liking the OCaml approach to software and more than a few sign up
as CS students because of it.
That said, OCaml needs to be much, much easier to use. ocamlfind seems to
be a white flag of surrender.  Of course the lack of support for pedagogy
in the libraries is an issue too.
Cheers,
Bob Muller
