Hello,

I've been using the zeromq bindings for the last six years or so.  zeromq
has been very nice in my experience - excellent documentation and a helpful
community.  The current and past maintainers of the zeromq bindings have
been very easy to work with.  I wrote the Lwt interface for zeromq -
feedback on that piece is welcome.

I started looking at nanomsg shortly before its original author/maintainer
quit the project.  I stopped seriously considering nanomsg for my projects
at that point.  I'm happy to hear that maintenance has been picked back up
though.  And to echo Simon Cruanes's comment, rgrinberg is also very easy
to work with!

Hez
