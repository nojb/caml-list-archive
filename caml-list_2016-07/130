I am beginning to think along those lines. Rather than just using 
top-modules and letting ocamldep guess dependencies, specifying them 
seems inherently more reliable and predictable.

Maybe with something like an import statement. If this is done in each 
file, it should scale easily.
Two things that might be related:
- putting more build information in ml files (I recall that Gabriel 
Scherer mentioned that once, is that right?)
- namespaces.

More generally, I identify the following problems when building OCaml code:
- under-specified dependencies, as discussed
- the compiler driver can produce multiple files on a single invocation. 
File level dependencies turn into an hypergraph rather than a graph 
(making a Makefile driven system hardly stable)
- an ML file alone is hard to understand out of context, because build 
specification are kept separate
- many names and partially overlapping concepts; top-modules, libraries, 
ocamlfind packages, opam packages.
