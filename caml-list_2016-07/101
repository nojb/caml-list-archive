I would take that study with a rather large grain of salt. The validity of
such studies depends enormously on the details of how the data was
gathered, and without digging into those details, I'm not sure it's much
more than noise, especially because the thing being measured (functional
programming jobs in industry) is quite small, and not a major part of the
survey. I don't know that one should trust this any more than one does the
TIOBE survey of programming language popularity.

My own experience points in the opposite direction of the data listed in
the study. It seems pretty clear from our experience in the hiring market
that people with OCaml in their background are in high demand, and that the
places that do hire people to program in OCaml itself need to pay good
money to be competitive. I know Jane Street pays quite well, and I suspect
that Bloomberg and Facebook are also compensating their OCaml-wielding
employees in a competitive fashion as well. Also, from what I know from the
banks that hire FP types (a lot of it in Haskell), the compensation their
is pretty solid as well.
