If there has to be something other than IRC and the mailing list, I personn=
ally
quite like the idea of a forum. The *BB things sure have an old-school
look&feel, but discourse [1] looks nice, for example, and I think the rust
people use it for their user forum [2] (and it is free software).

I personnaly would be happy to help newcomers on such a forum. I'm also not=
 so
fond of IRC-like mediums: the density of useful and actual content is usual=
ly
quite low (because of the informal aspect of the discussions), and not
structured or easily searchable. It's not because you have access to the 50=
0k+
lines of backlog that the informations there are actually usable.
