                                    ICLP DC 2016

                      Twelfth ICLP Doctoral Student Consortium
                     to be held in New York City, USA, 18 October 2016

                      http://dc-iclp16.cs.bath.ac.uk/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ICLP Doctoral Consortium (DC) is the twelfth doctoral consortium to
be held as part of the 32nd International Conference on Logic
Programming (ICLP 2016). The DC will take place during ICLP 2016 in
New York City, USA. It provides a forum for doctoral students working in
areas related to logic and constraint programming, with a particular
emphasis to students interested in pursuing a career in academia. The DC
gives students the opportunity to present and discuss their research and
to obtain feedback from peers as well as world-renowned experts.

** Target Audience **

The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program,
though we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a
Master's program and interested in doctoral studies). Students at any
stage in their doctoral studies are encouraged to apply for
participation in the DC. Applicants are expected to conduct research in
areas related to logic and constraint programming; topics of interest
include (but are not limited to):

- Theoretical Foundations of Logic and Constraint Logic Programming
- Sequential and Parallel Implementation Technology
- Static and Dynamic Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Compilation
Technology, Verification
- Logic-based Paradigms (e.g., Answer Set Programming, Concurrent Logic
   Programming, Inductive Logic Programming)
- Innovative Applications of Logic Programming
- Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning
- Logic Programming and Causality
- Logic Programming Systems

Submissions by students who have presented their work at previous ICLP
DC editions are allowed, but should occur only if there are substantial
changes or improvements to the student's work.

The DC allows participants to interact with established researchers and
fellow students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel
discussions, and invited presentations. The Doctoral Consortium will
provide the possibility to reflect - through short activities,
information sessions, and discussions - on the process and lessons of
research and life in academia. Each participant will give a short,
critiqued, research presentation.

** Application Process **

An application for participation in the ICLP DC 2016 consists of a cover
letter, a research summary, and a letter of recommendation (e.g., from
your supervisor). All applications must be in English and submitted
electronically via EasyChair by 17 July 2016. Detailed submission
instructions are provided at the ICLP DC 2016 website:
       http://dc-iclp16.cs.bath.ac.uk/ <http://dc-iclp15.cs.bath.ac.uk/>

The DC program committee will select participants based on their
anticipated contribution to the DC objectives. Students will be selected
based on clarity and completeness of their submission package, relevance
of their research area w.r.t. the focus of ICLP, stage of research,
recommendation letter, and evidence of promise towards a successful
career in research and academia, such as published papers or technical
reports.

The works accepted for presentation at the DC will be published in
conjunction with the ICLP proceedings. Updates follow as soon as we have
more information regarding this.

There will be some financial support available to students who attend the DC.
The details will be announced soon.
