Subject: [Caml-list] ZeroMQ vs Nanomsg

Hi,

I'm evaluating ZeroMQ and Nanomsg for the middleware of a distributed
application.  Now, I know both projects have had a fair share of drama
in the past, to the point that it's hard for an outside observer to be
up-to-date on the *current* strengths and weaknesses of each one.  
Still,
it's my understanding that though ZeroMQ is more established, Nanomsg 
was
developed later by one of the original authors of ZeroMQ, and supposedly
fixes some of the architectural mistakes of ZeroMQ.  To complicate 
matters,
Nanomsg's author quit the project a while ago, leaving it in limbo for
a while.  In the meantime, it seems development has picked up again, and
Nanomsg recently had its 1.0 release.

Anyway, I'm sure the picture I painted above is incomplete.  Therefore,
I would be much obliged to hear your opinions and experiences with 
either
project.  I will be using the OCaml bindings, obviously, so the maturity 
of
the bindings is also a factor.  (On first glance they seem quite 
complete
and both offer support for LWT, which is a must.)

Thanks in advance for your time!
Kind regards,
Dario Teixeira
