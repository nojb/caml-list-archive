I see another big difficulty with this mailing list: as a newcomer, it was =
essentially impossible for me to work back through the archives for this ma=
iling list to understand the main issues being discussed, the main leaders =
and participants in the community, and the main points of view. The archive=
 page (https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list) is intimidating. Once I =
got past that first impression, I still found the navigation very difficult.

Those were criticisms, and I have more below. But let me be clear: I *love*=
 OCaml. I am deeply, deeply impressed by the insight and technical excellen=
ce of the OCaml community and ecosystem. I am just hoping that by being fra=
nk about my experiences as a newcomer, I can contribute to making it even b=
etter.

My general experience so far, as I try to learn OCaml and become a construc=
tive member of the community, is that I encounter fragmented and conflictin=
g advice on most major topics. The good news toward unification is that oca=
ml.org is at the top of the Google results. (At least, for me it is.) But, =
because I began reading Real World OCaml (a wonderful book!) before I ever =
did that Google search, when I did focus on ocaml.org, I was knocked off ba=
lance by how different its world of OCaml seemed to be.

I=E2=80=99ll take a minute to be more specific: When I see ocaml.org as a b=
eginner, I personally gravitate toward Documentation/Manual. Each part of t=
hat manual (http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/) is in conflict wit=
h Real World OCaml. The most obvious example is that =E2=80=9CThe core libr=
ary=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CThe standard library" in the manual are very diff=
erent from "The Core Standard Library=E2=80=9D in Real World OCaml. But man=
y other things are also different. Even the language looks different: some =
capabilities like first class modules that are presented in Real World OCam=
l as simply part of the language (although advanced), are presented in the =
manual as =E2=80=9CLanguage extensions=E2=80=9D. But as I worked my way thr=
ough the language extensions in the manual, I saw lots of capabilities that=
 I don=E2=80=99t think are in Real World OCaml.

Which brings me back to the topic at hand: mailing lists, forums, etc. When=
 I encounter what seems like conflicting information, I start looking for t=
he community discussions that would help me understand what consensus exist=
s, plus the main dissenting viewpoints. Starting from ocaml.org, that takes=
 me to the archives for this mailing list. Which I personally found unhelpf=
ul.
