Thanks Andreas, I think those are valid points.

On the other hand, I suspect that a forum may be complementary with a
mailing-list instead of replacing it. Arma=C3=ABl wrote:

and I think we should recognize that the caml-beginners list is a failure.

  https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/ocaml_beginners/conversations/messages

Some people use it, but in numbers that are fairly small compared to the
number of people that discover OCaml on a given time period (there are like
3 to 10 questions a month). It is sensibly less active than, say,
StackOverflow

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ocaml

and its "yahoo group" interface is horrible (I don't know why people are
enthusiastic about Google Groups either, but well).

Any beginner-level discussion is ill-served by caml-list, and currently the
only choice I think are IRC and StackOverflow, the first being fairly
unstructured and the second being completely over the top in term of
rigidity and blind application of dubious policies.

I don't yet have a super-good idea of how to clearly delineate "beginner
questions" and "stuff that would be a good fit for caml-list", but I think
having a clear picture there could be an answer to your concern.
