Great comments from lots of people.

I am in the mobile app business, so I find myself thinking about this as a =
conversion funnel:

(1) Some number of people will hear enticing things about OCaml. So Gabriel=
 Scherer=E2=80=99s point is important:

> The best thing I can think of is to communicate more and better, talk abo=
ut the cool world that is being done in the OCaml communities, and importan=
tly talking about it outside it. Supporting software projects that have a p=
otential for impact outside the OCaml community is also key -- Coq, MLdonke=
y, Coccinelle, Flow, the SLAM static verifier toolkit, just to name a few.


(2) Once someone realizes OCaml is enticing, they will poke around the web =
to see what the community looks like. We want to maximize the percentage wh=
o decide the community looks solid enough for them to invest effort in lear=
ning OCaml. So Duane Johnson=E2=80=99s point, for example, is important:

> In summary, all of the signals that I usually depend on to evaluate the c=
ommunity around a technology are either weak or give me the impression of =
=E2=80=9Cold and barely stable".=20


(3) Once someone decides the community is solid enough for their purposes, =
they begin learning. We want to maximize the percentage who have sufficient=
 positive experiences that they decide to persevere. So, for example, Gabri=
el Scherer makes additional important points:

> Regarding usability, I think the tooling ecosystem is too complex today. =
If I wanted to bootstrap a beginner to do stuff I would have to tell them a=
bout the OCaml compiler tools (ocamlc, ocamlopt), ocamlfind, a build system=
 (make or ocamlbuild for example), oasis, Merlin, opam, and get them to lea=
rn either Vim or Emacs.


(4) Further along in the learning process, Hendrik Boom=E2=80=99s points on=
 an earlier thread (for example) are important:

> That's the hurdle I face whenever I program in OCaml =E2=80=94 figuring o=
ut which libraries are usable, and which are actually documented. Not docum=
ented in the sense that someone has written an API guide and a tutorial, bu=
t documented in the sense that it is actually possible to find them.
>=20
> There are often multiple packages to accomplish a single task. You don't =
know which one to use.

On the more encouraging side, we also have this from Gabriel Scherer on the=
 earlier thread:

> a large part of the problem is rather of the "death by thousand cuts" kin=
d: small things that add up to create an overall unpleasant experience. Thi=
s portion of the general problem is both too large for a single person to f=
ix (no one person can guess all use-cases), it is easily amenable to crowd-=
fixing: reporting and/or fixing issues one at a time as you discover them.

Is it possible we should be organizing ourselves to map the main flows of t=
he beginner experience, identify the most severe cuts along those flows, an=
d systematically address them? We could start with cheap solutions, like FA=
Qs, and work our way to engineering fixes.
