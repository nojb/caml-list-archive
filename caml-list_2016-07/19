OCaml's community size has advantages and disadvantages. I started taking
interest almost a year ago, after Haskell. One thing I didn't like about it's
community was that every other month there would be an reincarnation of an
implementation using the latest (immature or ill-conceived at times) conceptual
abstraction.

I'm not suggesting that we should enforce the size; I'm just sayin don't
overstimate the size of the community or volume of packages.

I agree with you, same findings. You should checkout the IRC channel if you
haven't already. I got a lot of help from the people there in terms of choosing
between options (Core / Batteries)  and explanation of the latest advancments
(camlp4).

My feeling is that most of the folk in the community are serious and to the
point.. like OCaml ;)

This is recognised in the community and others have already answered. One day,
hopefully we can have an effective merge of the parallel efforts.
I for one avoid both as much as I can until there is a merge :)
