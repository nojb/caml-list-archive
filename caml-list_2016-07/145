Subject: [Caml-list] ocamltest

Dear all,

I have just submitted the following PR:

https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/681

Roughly speaking, it introduces the ocamltest tool which intends to
replace OCaml testsuite's makefile-based infrastructure.

As said there, any contribution or comment will be warmly appreciated.

Also, OCaml's testsuite consists in about 600 tests, of which almost 60
have already been ported to use ocamltest. So a lot remains to be done
and for that, too, any help will be appreciated.

SÃ©bastien.
