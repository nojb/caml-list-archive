Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

1. If we can get google groups to synchronize with the list, we can
essentially get forum functionality out of the same source.

2. Regarding the concern that gitter.im is proprietary, there are
already tools to read the entire history out of it. I still think this
is the best, friendliest way to get everyone involved and
contributing/answering questions. Epecially if we can get the
gitter-irc bridge-bot up and running
(https://github.com/finnp/gitter-irc-bot), it means we'll have the
records in IRC but still get the user-friendliness of gitter.

PS. someone with access, please set up a gitter room -- OASIS has a
room, OPAM has an (unused) room on gitter:ocaml/opam, ocaml-http has
one -- it would be really nice to have a general ocaml/ocaml room.
