To paraphrase Dijkstra, IMHO email and mailing lists are an improvement ove=
r more =E2=80=9Cmodern=E2=80=9D forums in almost every way, once you get pa=
st the =E2=80=9Cflashiness=E2=80=9D thing:

- participation without having to constantly log into yet another account (=
with potential tracking),
- all communication through the same tool/UI (that actually works), easy cr=
oss-communication and cross-quoting, archiving in one place, etc
- offline reading & writing,
- proper threading (Discourse sees its lack as a =E2=80=9Cfeature"),
- no annoying gamification,
- open, standardised and guaranteed to still be around in 5 or 10 years fro=
m now.

Also, IME, email generally encourages a slower, more considerate and more c=
omprehensive discussion style.

Discourse has an email gateway, but last time I looked, it wasn=E2=80=99t d=
eemed very usable.

It would be sad to fragment the (not so huge) OCaml community just to hop o=
nto the latest train in forum fashion, be it Discourse or the next thing. I=
=E2=80=99m sure we would lose some people on the way (happened with Rust). =
I=E2=80=99m less sure about the people we gonna win over that way.
