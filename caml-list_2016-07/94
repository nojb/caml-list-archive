Yeah, mailing-lists and IRC channels are rather more established.

I hear very bad things about Slack for large communities -- it seems to be
intended for tight-knit teams inside a single organization:

ted-it-391bcc714c81#.2ow2y1lcb
  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3D9754626

The only feedback I could get from gitter.im is "it spams my mailbox
constantly", not exactly high praise. I'm sure it's a good tools for
people, but the fact that it is a proprietary tool built by a for-profit
company is giving me pause.

In general I support the idea of "meeting the users where they are" even
when that mean displeasing technological choices; this is why I have been
active answering OCaml questions on StackOverflow in the past. I would be
interested in making experiments with either:

- Discourse: I also heard bad things about it, but it's shiny, reactive and
open source

- Mattermost, as an open-source alternative to Slack -- but we would need
to find someone willing to host an instance.

&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As someone who just signed up to this mailing list, may I offer some<b=
r>
&gt; observations?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - my first impression of OCaml community was through <a href=3D"http:/=
/reddit.com/r/ocaml" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">reddit.com/r/ocam=
l</a>. As<br>
&gt; a reddit user, I would rank /r/ocaml as &quot;barely alive but stable&=
quot;--in other<br>
&gt; words, the upvotes-per-thread there are in the single digits and low<b=
r>
&gt; double-digits showing people exist there, but it is not a thriving<br>
&gt; community.<br>
&gt; - next, I tried to find a google group. It was hard to find any substa=
ntial<br>
&gt; and popular OCaml groups there. There was an OCaml aggregation list, b=
ut it<br>
&gt; wasn&#39;t clear that it was a discussion group. My first thought was,=
 Is there<br>
&gt; no mailing list? I searched around and found the <a href=3D"http://inf=
ria.fr" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">infria.fr</a> domain. To an<br>
&gt; outsider, this lends no credibility or brand-name familiarity. Not onl=
y is<br>
&gt; the web domain unfamiliar, but the website does not look welcoming--it=
<br>
&gt; appears to be out of the 90s.<br>
&gt; - signing up for a mailing list is slow and unrewarding. I&#39;d much =
rather<br>
&gt; sign up for a more modern community technology like reddit, facebook, =
slack,<br>
&gt; or google groups.<br>
&gt; - I clicked &quot;Info&quot; to get more info about the mailing list o=
n <a href=3D"http://infria.fr" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">infria.=
fr</a> and<br>
&gt; it says &quot;Private information&quot; inside a white bubble. Ok...<b=
r>
&gt; - I looked for a chat community, and IRC is the only option. This sign=
als<br>
&gt; &quot;old tech community&quot; to me. Slack or <a href=3D"http://gitte=
r.im" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">gitter.im</a> is a more inclusiv=
e, modern<br>
&gt; community. In order to participate in IRC, one must always be connecte=
d.<br>
&gt; This makes it more difficult for outsiders to come in and feel like th=
ey can<br>
&gt; &#39;catch up&#39; on the conversation (Yes, I know there are chat log=
s, but this<br>
&gt; feature is not an integrated part of IRC).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; In summary, all of the signals that I usually depend on to evaluate th=
e<br>
&gt; community around a technology are either weak or give me the impressio=
n of<br>
&gt; &quot;old and barely stable&quot;. New, exciting technologies that I&#=
39;ve seen tend to<br>
&gt; embrace and tap in to existing community platforms (slack, reddit, git=
hub,<br>
&gt; gitbook, google groups) in order to leverage the platform and amplify =
their<br>
&gt; advertising signal.<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I think &quot;adoption&quot; and &quot;usability&quot; are interli=
nked but separate issues.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Getting adoption distributes the number of people interesting in h=
elping<br>
&gt;&gt; on usability, so it tends to improve usability, but I tend to thin=
k that the<br>
&gt;&gt; second is actually the more interesting, important goal to aim at.=
<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Adoption is interesting but, as Tony Hoare put it, we are not fash=
ion<br>
&gt;&gt; designers. The best thing I can think of is to communicate more an=
d better,<br>
&gt;&gt; talk about the cool world that is being done in the OCaml communit=

y -- Coq,<br>
&gt;&gt; MLdonkey, Coccinelle, Flow, the SLAM static verifier toolkit, just=
 to name a<br>
&gt;&gt; few.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Regarding usability, I think the tooling ecosystem is too complex =
today.<br>
&gt;&gt; If I wanted to bootstrap a beginner to do stuff I would have to te=
ll them<br>
&gt;&gt; about the OCaml compiler tools (ocamlc, ocamlopt), ocamlfind, a bu=
ild system<br>
&gt;&gt; (omake or ocamlbuild for example), oasis, Merlin, opam, and get th=
em to<br>
&gt;&gt; learn either Vim or Emacs. That&#39;s a bit too much and even with=
 the plethora<br>
&gt;&gt; of tools there are problems we haven&#39;t really solved yet -- fo=
r example, how<br>
&gt;&gt; to avoid module name conflicts.<br>
&gt;&gt; I think a lot more work is required, both incremental improvements=
 and a<br>
&gt;&gt; few grand redesigns, before we reach a comfortable ecosystem where=
 starting<br>
&gt;&gt; an OCaml project feels like a breeze. That&#39;s what I would aim =
at.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who here is excited about making OCaml approachable to newcome=
rs? Where<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; is the main ongoing work on this? Who are the main leaders fro=
m this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; perspective?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; This is an interesting question. To my knowledge, no one is specif=
ically<br>
&gt;&gt; focused on this mightily important question. But it&#39;s fair to =
assume that we<br>
&gt;&gt; have no &quot;usability team&quot; today, it&#39;s more a distribu=
ted collection of<br>
&gt;&gt; efforts going in all directions from various people, for example:<=
br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - Gerd Stolpmann did a lot of work on the early language tooling, =
notably<br>
&gt;&gt; GODI (an earlier ocaml-specific package manager) and ocamlfind, an=
d also<br>
&gt;&gt; kept very high documentation standards that are an example to foll=
ow.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - Sylvain le Gall&#39;s work on OASIS helps a lot of developers do=
 their<br>
&gt;&gt; packaging by encapsulating, in particular, the knowledge of what t=
o install<br>
&gt;&gt; where (not a simple question).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; - The OPAM team as a whole, as well as the maintainers of the publ=
ic opam<br>
&gt;&gt; repository, have done tremendous work making OCaml software easy t=
o install<br>
&gt;&gt; and deploy. (Windows is still of a sore point, but there is progre=
ss in that<br>
&gt;&gt; area. It&#39;s a distinct possibility that the OCaml ecosystem wil=
l become nice<br>
&gt;&gt; to use on Windows before Windows disappears or gets a real Unix us=
erland.)<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I would personally be interested in helping someone with a holisti=
c<br>
&gt;&gt; approach to usability devote as much of their time as they can. (I=
 think<br>
&gt;&gt; there are some sources of funding that could be considered, but no=
thing very<br>
&gt;&gt; certain; from a crowd-funding perspective I would be glad to pay =
=E2=82=AC30 a month<br>
&gt;&gt; to fund such a position.) I think this is a difficult position bec=
ause there<br>
&gt;&gt; is a lot of thankless grunt work implied, and arguably it&#39;s no=
t a very<br>
&gt;&gt; career-advancing move.<br>
