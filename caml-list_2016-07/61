Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

Hi Duane,
   thanks for your message: I found it is a very interesting outsider's point of view.

I would just like to remark that what you point out is more along an "image"
dimension, than a "substance" one.

The world is full of exciting "modern" programming languages that change syntax
and semantics every couple of months, or that force you to write zillions of
"modern" unit tests just to make sure you did not mix integers with strings,
while in the ML (and OCaml world) we just keep writing safe and elegant code
since the 1980's.

If you scratch a bit the surface, it's easy to see that a lof of the "new"
exciting technology around is actually "has been", while the "old" technology
underlying OCaml is actually "revolutionary".

If you share this point of view, please come along and lend a hand, help
us become more fashionable, and help OCaml get an "image" that better
correspond to its great "substance"

Cheers

Roberto

P.S.: by the way, it's inria.fr, not infria.fr, or, in old technology
      terms, s/infria/inria/g :-)
