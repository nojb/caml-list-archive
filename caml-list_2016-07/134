When people can't be bothered or aren't allowed to update the ocaml compiler
what makes you think there would be any difference with updating stdlib? I
think the time is better spend of releasing ocaml more frequently than making
more work by splitting compiler and stdlib.

3) is a big reason for me. Or if not stable then at least testing.
There is also Ubuntu and others with long term releases where versions
can remain lower than would be good.

But then again there is opam. If you can't update the system but need
newer ocaml it's easy enough to build it locally. Half the time you
need opam just because the distribution doesn't even have everything
you use packaged.
