Hi there,

I guess you found inria.fr and not infria.fr :-). If it's the case, the 
first thing you should notice when visiting it is the message:

"This site is updated infrequently. For up-to-date information, please 
visit the new OCaml website at ocaml.org <http://ocaml.org>."

and on ocaml.org, you'll find a "modern website" with a "more 
conventional" extension. One click later (on the Community
item of the upper menu), you'll get the information you need about 
mailing lists.

Regards,

- Mohamed.

                  I can't speak for "adoption", but I think that you
                  have been very kind as far as user experience is
                  concerned, that it is probably worse than you suggest.<br>

                We discussed some of these issues a few month ago in a

              <div>I think "adoption" and "usability" are interlinked
                but separate issues. <br>
                <br>
                Getting adoption distributes the number of people
                interesting in helping on usability, so it tends to
                improve usability, but I tend to think that the second
                is actually the more interesting, important goal to aim
                at.<br>
                <br>
                Adoption is interesting but, as Tony Hoare put it, we
                are not fashion designers. The best thing I can think of
                is to communicate more and better, talk about the cool
                world that is being done in the OCaml communities, and
                importantly talking about it outside it. Supporting
                software projects that have a potential for impact
                outside the OCaml community is also key -- Coq,
                MLdonkey, Coccinelle, Flow, the SLAM static verifier
                toolkit, just to name a few.<br>
                <br>
              </div>
              <div>Regarding usability, I think the tooling ecosystem is
                too complex today. If I wanted to bootstrap a beginner
                to do stuff I would have to tell them about the OCaml
                compiler tools (ocamlc, ocamlopt), ocamlfind, a build
                system (omake or ocamlbuild for example), oasis, Merlin,
                opam, and get them to learn either Vim or Emacs. That's
                a bit too much and even with the plethora of tools there
                are problems we haven't really solved yet -- for
                example, how to avoid module name conflicts.<br>
                I think a lot more work is required, both incremental
                improvements and a few grand redesigns, before we reach
                a comfortable ecosystem where starting an OCaml project
                feels like a breeze. That's what I would aim at.<br>

                <div>This is an interesting question. To my knowledge,
                  no one is specifically focused on this mightily
                  important question. But it's fair to assume that we
                  have no "usability team" today, it's more a
                  distributed collection of efforts going in all
                  directions from various people, for example:<br>

                  - Gerd Stolpmann did a lot of work on the early
                  language tooling, notably GODI (an earlier
                  ocaml-specific package manager) and ocamlfind, and
                  also kept very high documentation standards that are
                  an example to follow.<br>
                  <br>
                </div>
                <div>- Sylvain le Gall's work on OASIS helps a lot of
                  developers do their packaging by encapsulating, in
                  particular, the knowledge of what to install where
                  (not a simple question).<br>
                </div>
                <div><br>
                  - The OPAM team as a whole, as well as the maintainers
                  of the public opam repository, have done tremendous
                  work making OCaml software easy to install and deploy.
                  (Windows is still of a sore point, but there is
                  progress in that area. It's a distinct possibility
                  that the OCaml ecosystem will become nice to use on
                  Windows before Windows disappears or gets a real Unix
                  userland.)<br>

                  I would personally be interested in helping someone
                  with a holistic approach to usability devote as much
                  of their time as they can. (I think there are some
                  sources of funding that could be considered, but
                  nothing very certain; from a crowd-funding perspective
                  I would be glad to pay â¬30 a month to fund such a
                  position.) I think this is a difficult position
                  because there is a lot of thankless grunt work
                  implied, and arguably it's not a very career-advancing
                  move.<br>

                      more thoughts about whether there is a roadmap

                      I see that many organizations are making immense
                      contributions to the community: from language and
                      ecosystem enhancements, to Real World OCaml, to
                      the OCaml Users and Developers Workshop. Technical
                      progress is rapid. But so far, to me, these
                      wonderful contributions feel more like giving back
                      to the community for us to make what we can of
                      them, rather than anyoneâs systematic effort to
