Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

gitter.im is easy to mute for a particular room, if it gets too high
volume. There's a mobile app and an OSX app, so it's easy to monitor
discussions from anywhere. You can also download the entire history
via user-made open source tools, so being closed-source isn't much of
a problem.

It's also worth thinking about some of the use-cases for communication chan=
nels:

1. New users who want to just learn about the language's ideas
2. New users actively learning OCaml and needing assistance
3. Experienced users who want to discuss OCaml knowledge, techniques, theor=
y etc
4. Users wanting to discuss improving the OCaml platform as a whole
(website, build tools, stdlib etc)
5. Questions about the OCaml compiler/language design
6. OCaml compiler devs discussing new language proposals and compiler featu=
res.

All of these use-cases (and especially 1 and 2) could benefit from a
high-frequency channel. This is what IRC is for, but it's simply
inadequate IMO compared to something like gitter: old tech, no easy
access, limited accessibility from workplaces.

Considering forums, I do think that mailing lists tend to have too
high a barrier of entry for use (sending questions into the void, fear
of harsh feedback etc), and they exclude visible, easily available
examples (unlike forums). At the same time, forums tend not to
advertise and forward every single thread that was created -- the user
must express interest in a specific thread before receiving
notifications about that thread, and even then, the notification
usually just reminds the user to check back on the thread itself at
the forum. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage, making forums
a good fit for anything but 6. A forum would contain deeper, more
long-lasting discussions than gitter/IRC about anything that shouldn't
be worth bothering every single member of the community about unless
they're specifically interested in it. This would have the added
advantage of reducing the volume of mailing list messages, allowing
more people to focus on what's truly important.

What would be really nice would be to have forums that automatically
collate the output of the mailing list under a specific section (the
mailing list being considered the essential topics of discussion). I
don't know if this is possible, but it would be the ideal forum IMO.
It would mean that to view any long-term discussion, one need only
check the forums, viewing both the less essential (general) topics and
the more essential (mailing-list) topics.

BTW reddit is a pretty vacuous place in my experience, brandishing the
blunt weapon of community upvotes or downvotes, and unable to focus on
anything other than the latest news item. Other than advertising and
presence, it presents almost no benefit whatsoever IMO.
