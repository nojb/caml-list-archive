Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

Roberto, you make a good point, but I'd like to make the counterpoint
that what you call 'image' is almost as important as, if not even more
important, than what you call 'substance'.

Many great programming languages never made it out of the labs in
which they were conceived. Other languages thrived and then died.
Creating a language involves much more than having good core ideas --
community and tooling determines whether the language will actually
succeed. The language itself is the DNA, but the environment
(community, ecosystem, tooling) determines all else.

Duane points out that the tooling that is visible to the outside world
is old, and he's right. Remember that people on this list expressed
great reluctance towards moving the OCaml codebase to github, even
though to those of us who experienced the order-of-magnitude
improvements of github over everything that preceded it, the
advantages were obvious. There's a tendency for programmers to get
'old fogey syndrome' with respect to technologies that came out later
than the ones they use in their day-to-day lives. This is similar, I
think, to people not liking music that came out after the music from
their own generation. The reality is that tooling improves
consistently, and generally speaking an old tool will not be as good
as a newer one that builds on experience from the older one. The main
exceptions to this rule that come to mind are when old tools took
unique approaches that were later deemed too revolutionary or niche to
be built upon (mainly vim and emacs, though I'm sure people can think
of others).

It would be really nice for the mailing list to use the new ocaml.org
domain, which should be the outward face of OCaml.
Additionally, I think an official gitter.im page should be considered.
Many people are afraid to express their every thought and question on
the mailing list for fear of backlash or that they will be thought to
be spamming (a very realistic assessment, I may add). Users are much
more likely to communicate in a realtime chat environment like gitter.
IRC is simply incompatible with today's world -- many people cannot
access IRC from work, the logs aren't easily available etc as stated
by Duane. As an additional idea, the neovim project was able to create
a bridge between its IRC channel and its gitter.im page
(https://gitter.im/neovim/neovim).

Of course, the deeper tooling issues are with things like the build
system. It's remarkable how easy it is in a language like Rust to
build a project and pull down its dependencies. Of course Rust is a
newcomer, which allowed it to avoid all the legacy issues we're
suffering from. It's extremely unfortunate that we ended up with so
many different build systems, not to mention multiple standard
libraries.
