Sure, but in which case, isn't encouraging (and eventually mandating)

open ReallyCoolLibraryPack.Util

considerably better than:

open ReallyCoolLibraryPack
(* myriad more open statements *)
open Util

and eventually solves considerably more problems.

Indeed, but rather than adding yet another piece of syntax, does it cause s=
o much pain to move in the direction of just making the open declaration al=
ways require a toplevel module path?
