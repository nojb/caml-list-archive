Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

Yes, OCaml is an old programming language... It was still using SVN until
last year :-)

Anyway, I am not fond of the multiplication of communication channels, they
tend to divide an already small community into smaller groups, and it
becomes hard to remain up-to-date with latest information. For example, a
lot of discussions are now happening on Github pull-requests, either in
ocaml/ocaml or ocaml/opam-repository, and if you don't keep an eye on them,
you might soon discover that important decisions have been taken without
most of the community knowing it.

For the mailing-list, I think that hosting it on ocaml.org would be better,
with a simple name like "ocaml-users@ocaml.org <list@ocaml.org>", that
would be an alias for "ocaml-users@lists.ocaml.org <ocaml@lists.ocaml.org>".
I have no time to go on IRC, so I don't really care about it, but I think
that we miss something in the middle between mailing-lists and IRC, which
is a forum that would be hosted on ocaml.org (ocaml.org/forum ?). I used to
go on some BB forums at some point, I am pretty sure we could use something
like that, or one of its more recent clones (but not a proprietary
website). Such forums are quite practical, as you can both monitor them to
answer questions immediately (=C3=A0 la IRC) without filling your inbox, and
still be able to come from time to time and look at former discussions.
