Subject: Re: [Caml-list] About contributions to the Standard Library

Le mardi, 21 juin 2016 =C3=A0 16:48, Gabriel Scherer a =C3=A9crit :
> (3) As Daniel pointed out, we need a better understanding of how to make =
code written using new stdlib functions compatible with older OCaml version=
s. So far we've used ad-hoc solutions on each situation, and it was barely =
manageable despite the small number of instances. (Bytes: in findlib; opaqu=
e_identity: clever hack; String ascii functions: no solution).


To sum up the current reality of the situation with respect to per compiler=
 version deprecations and gradual improvements for someone that tries to su=
pport more than one version of the compiler is to either:

1. Have to buy into disputable source surgery techniques (preprocessing ifd=
efs) or isolate differences in module implementations selected according to=
 the compiler version that is targeted. This complexifies your build system=
, puts a general maintenance burden on everyone and multiplies the paths fo=
r bugs.

2. Wait for two or three years to be able to use the new things (I'm person=
ally targeting 4.01 now), possibly having to cope with/silence deprecation =
warnings during that time (e.g. String.lowercase) which defeats the point o=
f these deprecations.

Given this, I'm wondering how feasible and beneficial, both from a technica=
l and bureaucratic burden point of view, it would be to actually distribute=
 and evolve the standard library separately from the compiler. I didn't giv=
e a hard thought about bootstrapping issues since I'm sure there are people=
 on this list that have a clearer answer to that than me.

The goal behind this move would not be to change the stdlib conservativenes=
s and minimalistic approach but make it possible to use improvement made to=
 stdlib in older OCaml versions.

Of course there are point in times where new versions of this exo-stdlib wo=
uld introduce lower bounds. But I expect these not to be that widespread. I=
 think they would only happen on significant language/runtime system change=
s for example because:=20=20

a) A language feature becomes used in the implementation of the stdlib (e.g=
. GADT for formatters)
b) A language feature becomes used in the interface of the stdlib (e.g. a h=
ypothetical implicits introduction)
c) A language/runtime system feature entails additions of new modules that =
can't be expressed in earlier version (e.g. a hypothetical introduction of =
effects).

Note that even in c) it should be possible to backport interfaces, stubbed =
with failing implementations.

Finally I would just like to say that the current situation also has its pl=
uses as it encourages people to upgrade and hence follow the general evolut=
ion the system.

Best,=20=20

Daniel
