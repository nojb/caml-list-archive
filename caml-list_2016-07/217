Hi,

>   several core members trying to voice concerns about the feature in one PR,
while other member PRs were simply merged into the tree

Could you be more specific ? I think I have taken the time to discuss all
these PRs (for 20 days for 2 of them, 13 days for the other one), I have
modified the PRs to follow the requests that were voiced (for example, by
removing the default -fPIC) and they were all reviewed by other core
developers. If you think some concerns have not been taken into account,
please, tell me.

>  yet I have not seen it or its costs vs benefits being discussed fully in
any particular place

Probably because the cost vs benefit is very hard to measure in most PR:
the benefit might be small for some users, and big for other ones; some
features might be hard to understand and to use, yet one developer can use
them to develop a tool that can be used by many users; some features might
look of little use at the beginning, yet, once they are present, other
users might find usages that were not foreseen in the PR discussion.
