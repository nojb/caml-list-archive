Technical progress is rapid. But so far, to me, these wonderful contributions feel more like giving back to the community for us to make what we can of them, rather than anyoneâ€™s systematic effort to streamline broader uptake of OCaml.

Just a personal viewpoint: I have a feeling that another functional 
language with strong static types has a much larger user community.

By larger, I mean it looks like they are way above the critical mass of 
a healthy open source community.
And I feel that for OCaml we are under this critical mass.

Just a few figures I could collect: on github there are 8018 
repositories using OCaml and 1875 users.
While there are 49872 repositories for Haskell and 6728 users !

PS: those are just _some_ figures out of all the ones we could collect,
     so please take them with a grain of salt.
