                         CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

                           SRC at ICFP 2016
                             Nara, Japan
                         18-24 September 2016

http://conf.researchr.org/info/icfp-2016/student-research-competition

                         Co-located with the
    International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2016)
======================================================================


Student Research Competition
----------------------------

This year ICFP will host a Student Research Competition where
undergraduate and postgraduate students can present posters. The SRC
at ICFP 2016 consists of three rounds:

* Extended abstract round. All students are encouraged to submit an
  extended abstract of up to 800 words outlining their research.

* Poster session. Based on the abstracts, a panel of judges will
  select the most promising entrants to participate in the poster
  session which will take place at ICFP. Students who make it to this
  round will be eligible for some travel support to attend the
  conference. In the poster session, students will have the
  opportunity to present their work to the judges, who will select
  three finalists in each category (graduate/undergraduate) to advance
  to the next round.

* ICFP presentation. The last round will consist of an oral
  presentation at ICFP to compete for the final award.


Prizes
------

* The top three graduate and the top three undergraduate winners will
  receive prizes of $500, $300, and $200, respectively.

* All six winners will receive award medals and a two-year
  complimentary ACM student membership, including a subscription to
  ACM's Digital Library.

* The names of the winners will be posted on the ACM SRC web site.

* The first-place winners will be invited to participate in the ACM
  SRC Grand Finals, an on-line round of competition among the winners
  of conference-hosted SRCs.

* Grand Finalists and their advisors will be invited to the Annual ACM
  Awards Banquet for an all-expenses-paid trip, where they will be
  recognized for their accomplishments along with other prestigious
  ACM award winners, including the winner of the Turing Award (also
  known as the Nobel Prize of Computing).

* The top three graduate Grand Finalists will receive an additional
  $500, $300, and $200. Likewise, the top three undergraduate Grand
  Finalists will receive an additional $500, $300, and $200. All six
  Grand Finalists will receive Grand Finalist certificates.

* The ACM, Microsoft Research, and our industrial partners provide
  financial support for students attending the SRC. You can find more
  information about this on the ACM website.


Eligibility
-----------

The SRC is open to both undergraduate (not in a PhD programme) and
graduate students (in a PhD programme). Upon submission, entrants must
be enrolled as a student at their universities, and are ACM student
members.

Furthermore, there are some constraints on what kind of work may be
submitted.

Previously published work:

Submissions should consist of original work (not yet accepted for
publication). If the work is a continuation of previously published
work, the submission should focus on the contribution over what has
already been published. We encourage students to see this as an
opportunity to get early feedback and exposure for the work they plan
to submit to the next ICFP or POPL.

Collaborative work:

Students are encouraged to submit work they have been conducting in
collaboration with others, including advisors, internship mentors, or
other students. However, submissions are individual, so they must
focus on the contributions of the student.

Submission Details
------------------

Each submission should include the student author's name,
institutional affiliation, e-mail address, and postal address;
research advisor's name; ACM student member number; category
(undergraduate or graduate); research title; and an extended abstract
addressing the following:


* Problem and Motivation: Clearly state the problem being addressed
  and explain the reasons for seeking a solution to this problem.

* Background and Related Work: Describe the specialized (but
  pertinent) background necessary to appreciate the work. Include
  references to the literature where appropriate, and briefly explain
  where your work departs from that done by others.

* Approach and Uniqueness: Describe your approach in attacking the
  problem and clearly state how your approach is novel.

* Results and Contributions: Clearly show how the results of your work
  contribute to computer science and explain the significance of those
  results.

The abstract must describe the student's individual research and must
be authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with
others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make
clear what the student's role was and should focus on that portion of
the work. The extended abstract must not exceed 800 words and must not
be longer than 2 pages. The reference list does not count towards
these limits. To submit an abstract, please register through the
submission page and follow the instructions. Abstracts submitted after
the deadline may be considered at the committee's discretion, but only
after decisions have been made on all abstracts submitted before the
deadline. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to contact the
competition chair.

Please submit your abstract at the EasyChair submission page:

* Notification of acceptance: 10 August
