Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

Thank you so much for starting this discussion, Dean. I started
reading this with my 'cynical glasses' on, and have disposed of them
along the way.

As one first step, it would be really nice to get more channels of
discussion going, with faster iteration of ideas. We need to increase
bandwidth so that even people who are not at the stage of commenting
on PRs can contribute, and the best way I can think of for that is
gitter.im channel(s).

The keys are in the hands of those people who have github permissions
to the OCaml organization. Could we please create an ocaml/ocaml
gitter.im room, and perhaps an ocaml/ocamlbuild room as well? If it
turns out to be an abject failure, we can always shut them down later.
