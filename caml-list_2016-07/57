The stdlib is somehow mechanically tied to the evolution of the runtime=20
system (new primitives being exposed) and the compiler (in particular=20
for the camlinternalXXX modules).   There would necessarily be a new=20
version of the stdlib to be shipped together with a new version of the=20
system.  If we stick to our new plan of making much more frequent=20
releases, there would probably be no need for intermediate releases of=20
the stdlib between versions of OCaml.  So the question is really whether=20
"the" stdlib shipped with OCaml version N should work with OCaml version=20
M < N.

Supporting in a single stdlib code base the current version of OCaml=20
(compiler+runtime system) and older ones would be as difficult as what=20
you describe in your point 1.  And we would have the same dilemma about=20
waiting to use new features or not.  (Even with the core team=20
conservatism, the stdlib is not so slow at adopting new language=20
features.  E.g. GADTS for formatters, which is exposed in the interface,=20
or the internal use of inline records for performance reasons.)  It=20
would be somehow a shame if the stdlib were the last one to benefit from=20
language improvements (at least in its implementation, but also in its=20
interface for new features).

Considering that progressing on the stdlib is already quite hard, adding=20
such extra constraints and work seems a good way to ensure it remains=20
completely stalled.  And who would decide until which version one should=20
maintain support?

Now, nothing prevent people from backporting some chosen parts and=20
distribute e.g. a "stdlib 4.04 for OCaml 4.01", indeed outside the core=20
distribution.  This might not be a complete coverage, but it could=20
provides some new goodies (e.g. String.split?) to people stuck with=20
older versions of OCaml.  This could certainly be done by motivated=20
contributors outside the core team.  In this context, I'm not so sure=20
about stubbing recent runtime features with failing implementations (if=20
a project depends on Ephemerons, it's unlikely to work with a failing=20
version of their API).

its pluses as it encourages people to upgrade and hence follow the=20
general evolution the system.

Good point.  I've to say that I'm always a bit puzzled by the amount of=20
energy hobbyists put into supporting old versions of OCaml (compared to=20
e.g. ensuring continuously that their packages are ready for the next=20
one).  Some industrial (or big academic) users being stuck with older=20
versions of OCaml (but many aren't) for good or bad reasons, but the=20
same ones are not likely to require the latest versions of third-party=20
libraries anyway, so this should not even be an incentive for library=20
authors to maintain such compatibility.

Could you share the reasons for you to target 4.01 (and not, say 3.04)=20
today?
