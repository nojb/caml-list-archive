This would be great! A mailing list at ocaml.org OR google groups would
have been quite inviting for me.

I actually came through a link that put me at
https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/info/caml-list. I don't recall how I arrived
there (it wasn't by typing inria.fr into the browser). The ocaml.org site
looks great, btw! I wish I'd seen it first :)

Ironically, I discovered OCaml a couple of weeks ago due to the Reason[1]
syntax that I'd heard about on news.ycombinator.com published about a month
ago. I decided to look again because it seemed to me that (a) someone was
actively "caring" about how a newcomer might experience the strange syntax
of OCaml, and trying to make it better, and (b) the Reason syntax actually
did look more understandable to me than what I'd superficially seen of
OCaml previously. Also, I discovered BuckleScript at around the same time,
and because I'm familiar with the Node (javascript) ecosystem, and because
BuckleScript produces readable javascript as output, my curiosity was
piqued.

I completely agree. I've been working on Ruby and Javascript systems for
over a decade and I'm very familiar with the problems that come with
untyped, procedural, or object-oriented languages. OCaml is very appealing
from that perspective.

You've pointed out precisely what has made adoption difficult for me--I
experience a lot of uncertainty right now while trying to "commit" to a
standard library that, by definition of being so new in the OCaml
ecosystem, I have no way of knowing how to judge what to commit to. I hope
that the Reason folks choose a build system and standard library path--and
mark it brightly--so that those who follow can experience more certainty in
knowing, as newcomers, that they are in good hands and that their effort
toward learning the language will be rewarded.
