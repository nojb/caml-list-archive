Subject: Re: [Caml-list] Recent hooks design and general github PR issues

See the comments at the bottom of
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/668 by avsm and gasche, which can
be seen as asking question about the whole feature (not just the PR).
See also Shinwell's concerns at the bottom of
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/647. And note that since they are
on separate PRs, they most likely did not see each others' comments,
which is a problem.

In general, I think the process has to be refined. As this is all part
of one feature, that feature should be discussed first before any
merging begins. And merging should not be done by the person
suggesting the feature.
