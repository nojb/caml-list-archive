I see, so it is for the ocaml repo, not the whole ocaml organization. Got
it. I suggest you send this request to the infrastructure@lists.ocaml.org
mailing list. One of the authorized owners of that repo is more likely to
see the request there, rather than in this long thread.

My opinion is that your request should be considered but not necessarily
approved. The developers of a project have the right to choose the
communication channels of the project they manage. Even if it is approved,
I doubt most of the ocaml developers will be interested in using this new
channel, so you might not have any of them following the discussions that
occur on gitter. To be clear, I'm expressing my own opinion and have no
authority on the ocaml repo.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; few.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; As someone who just signed up to this mailing list, may I off=
er some<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; observations?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - my first impression of OCaml community was through <a href=
=3D"http://reddit.com/r/ocaml" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">reddit.=
com/r/ocaml</a>.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; As<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; a reddit user, I would rank /r/ocaml as &quot;barely alive bu=
t stable&quot;--in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; other<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; words, the upvotes-per-thread there are in the single digits =
and low<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; double-digits showing people exist there, but it is not a thr=
iving<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; community.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - next, I tried to find a google group. It was hard to find a=
ny<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; substantial<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and popular OCaml groups there. There was an OCaml aggregatio=
n list, but<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t clear that it was a discussion group. My first tho=
ught was, Is<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; there<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; no mailing list? I searched around and found the <a href=3D"h=
ttp://infria.fr" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">infria.fr</a> domain.=
 To an<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; outsider, this lends no credibility or brand-name familiarity=
. Not only<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; is<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the web domain unfamiliar, but the website does not look welc=
oming--it<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; appears to be out of the 90s.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - signing up for a mailing list is slow and unrewarding. I&#3=
9;d much rather<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; sign up for a more modern community technology like reddit, f=
acebook,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; slack,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; or google groups.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - I clicked &quot;Info&quot; to get more info about the maili=
ng list on <a href=3D"http://infria.fr" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank=
">infria.fr</a><br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; it says &quot;Private information&quot; inside a white bubble=
. Ok...<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; - I looked for a chat community, and IRC is the only option. =
This<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; signals<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;old tech community&quot; to me. Slack or <a href=3D"htt=
p://gitter.im" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">gitter.im</a> is a more=
 inclusive,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; modern<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; community. In order to participate in IRC, one must always be=
 connected.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; This makes it more difficult for outsiders to come in and fee=
l like they<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; can<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;catch up&#39; on the conversation (Yes, I know there are=
 chat logs, but<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; this<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; feature is not an integrated part of IRC).<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; In summary, all of the signals that I usually depend on to ev=
aluate the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; community around a technology are either weak or give me the =
impression<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;old and barely stable&quot;. New, exciting technologies=
 that I&#39;ve seen tend<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; embrace and tap in to existing community platforms (slack, re=
ddit,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; github,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; gitbook, google groups) in order to leverage the platform and=
 amplify<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; their<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; advertising signal.<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I gave a few remarks on the evolution of the OCaml ecosys=

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; period<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know of that you may be interested in:<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think &quot;adoption&quot; and &quot;usability&quot; ar=
e interlinked but separate issues.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Getting adoption distributes the number of people interes=
ting in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; helping<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; on usability, so it tends to improve usability, but I ten=
d to think<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; second is actually the more interesting, important goal t=
o aim at.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Adoption is interesting but, as Tony Hoare put it, we are=
 not fashion<br>

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; name a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; few.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding usability, I think the tooling ecosystem is too=
 complex<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If I wanted to bootstrap a beginner to do stuff I would h=
ave to tell<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; them<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about the OCaml compiler tools (ocamlc, ocamlopt), ocamlf=
ind, a build<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; system<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (omake or ocamlbuild for example), oasis, Merlin, opam, a=
nd get them to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; learn either Vim or Emacs. That&#39;s a bit too much and =
even with the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; plethora<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of tools there are problems we haven&#39;t really solved =
yet -- for<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; example, how<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to avoid module name conflicts.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I think a lot more work is required, both incremental imp=
rovements and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; few grand redesigns, before we reach a comfortable ecosys=
tem where<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; starting<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an OCaml project feels like a breeze. That&#39;s what I w=
ould aim at.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Who here is excited about making OCaml approachable t=
o newcomers?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Where<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; is the main ongoing work on this? Who are the main le=
aders from this<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; perspective?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is an interesting question. To my knowledge, no one =
is<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; specifically<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; focused on this mightily important question. But it&#39;s=
 fair to assume<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that we<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have no &quot;usability team&quot; today, it&#39;s more a=
 distributed collection of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; efforts going in all directions from various people, for =
example:<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - Gerd Stolpmann did a lot of work on the early language =
tooling,<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; notably<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; GODI (an earlier ocaml-specific package manager) and ocam=
lfind, and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; also<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; kept very high documentation standards that are an exampl=
e to follow.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - Sylvain le Gall&#39;s work on OASIS helps a lot of deve=
lopers do their<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; packaging by encapsulating, in particular, the knowledge =
of what to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; install<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where (not a simple question).<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - The OPAM team as a whole, as well as the maintainers of=
 the public<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; opam<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; repository, have done tremendous work making OCaml softwa=
re easy to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; install<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and deploy. (Windows is still of a sore point, but there =
is progress in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; area. It&#39;s a distinct possibility that the OCaml ecos=
ystem will become<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nice<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to use on Windows before Windows disappears or gets a rea=
l Unix<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; userland.)<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I would personally be interested in helping someone with =
a holistic<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; approach to usability devote as much of their time as the=
y can. (I<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; think<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there are some sources of funding that could be considere=
d, but nothing<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; very<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; certain; from a crowd-funding perspective I would be glad=
 to pay =E2=82=AC30 a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; month<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to fund such a position.) I think this is a difficult pos=
ition because<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is a lot of thankless grunt work implied, and arguably it=
&#39;s not a very<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; career-advancing move.<br>
