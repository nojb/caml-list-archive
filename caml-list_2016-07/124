Subject: Re: [Caml-list] how to encourage adoption of OCaml?

Gabriel, I surveyed a few of the IRC lurkers. The sense I get from
their reactions is that they wouldn't want to leave IRC (which makes
sense) but would be open to a gitter room that connected to IRC via a
bridge.

This means that to establish the gitter room + bridge we need to:
1. Create the gitter room on the gitter site. This must be done by
someone with OCaml github credentials.
2. Follow the instructions on
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter using an OCaml
server. The bridge must have access to github credentials as well.
3. Add the new room to the ocaml.org community page. Involves a simple PR.
