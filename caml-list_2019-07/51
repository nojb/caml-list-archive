Subject: [Caml-list] Assistant Professor in Software Science at Radboud
 University Nijmegen

At Radboud University, we do research and teach programmes covering the 
full width of the academic spectrum. We do this on a green, modern 
campus with state-of-the-art facilities. The atmosphere on campus is 
open and personal, which stimulates colleagues to share their knowledge 
beyond the boundaries of their own discipline. It encourages all to look 
further, to see more. Thus, Radboud University contributes to the 
development of new perspectives. Within science and within society. This 
makes Radboud University successful and of international importance.

Assistant Professor in Software Science (0.8 - 1.0 FTE)

Faculty of Science
Vacancy number: 62.38.19
Maximum salary: € 4,978 gross/month
Application deadline: 1 September 2019

Responsibilities
================
To strengthen and expand the research of the Software Science (SWS) 
group, we seek a tenure-track assistant professor with experience and an 
interest in model-based techniques for design and analysis of software. 
You will have the opportunity to develop your own research line in the 
context of the group’s future activities. You will be expected to 
supervise a number of PhD students and to teach bachelor courses in 
Computer Science (and, depending on your expertise, in AI), and master 
courses in Software Science. You will also actively contribute to the 
supervision of Bachelor’s and Master’s projects and will be involved in 
organisational tasks within the institute.

Work environment
================
Radboud University's iCIS is an internationally recognised institute, 
consistently ranked among the top Computer Science departments in the 
Netherlands. The institute focuses its research on three themes: 
software science, digital security and data science. Each of these 
themes spans the full breadth from basic fundamental research to 
application-oriented research. We want to contribute scientifically at 
the highest levels in our areas of expertise and want to educate our PhD 
graduates to become independent leading researchers.

iCIS staff members are also responsible for the Computer Science 
bachelor and master programs, the Information Sciences master program, 
and for about 30% of the bachelor and master programs in Artificial 
Intelligence at Radboud University. In spite of the fast-growing student 
numbers, these programs are structurally evaluated as one of the best 
(see e.g., “Nationale Studenten Enquete”, 2018).

The Software Science group of iCIS studies models for the design and 
analysis of software. Our group has expertise covering a broad range of 
topics concerning software construction and analysis, e.g., foundations 
of software (type theory, proof assistants, concurrency, co-algebras, 
and term rewriting), model-based testing and model learning, combining 
formal verification and machine learning, and functional programming and 
domain specific languages. We bridge the gap between theory and practice 
through collaboration with stakeholders from industry and other 
application domains.

iCIS comprises an enthusiastic and devoted team of excellent scholars 
that closely collaborate in a flat organizational structure. Our 
institute is housed in the modern Mercator building at the green Radboud 
University Campus. iCIS employees have a high level of freedom to 
determine the way they structure the work they do at Radboud University. 
We work on the basis of trust and professional integrity. Focus on the 
individual means we take each employee's phase in life and career into 
consideration. Radboud University offers customized facilities to better 
align work and private life.

The science faculty has made a strong effort in the past few years to 
increase the diversity of its staff. Presently, more than half of our 
scientific staff has an international background. Especially, iCIS has 
been particularly active and successful in attracting female staff. This 
has also led to iCIS receiving the 2017 Minerva award for gender and 
diversity from Informatics Europe.

What we expect from you
=======================
*   You are an enthusiastic scientist (PhD) with a broad knowledge of 
computer science and model-based techniques for design and analysis of 
software, as underscored by high-quality publications, invitations to 
scientific conferences, and/or research grants.
*   Your expertise broadens the current expertise of the group. Example 
areas include system performance, system evolvability, system 
architecting, software analysis tools, software analytics, empirical 
software engineering, correctness/fairness/bias of machine learning 
applications, cyber-physical systems, and HPC/Exascale computing.
*   You have outstanding didactic skills and at least some teaching 
experience, a clear vision on teaching, and willingness to teach a broad 
variety of courses in the bachelor phase, as well as courses related to 
your research expertise in the software science master.
*   You are a team player who is eager to collaborate with other 
scientists, and build bridges between different research areas within 
and outside SWS and Radboud University, both nationally and 
internationally, and both within and outside academia.
*   You have excellent communication skills towards colleagues, 
students, and non- experts.
*   You contribute to, and preferably have experience in, the 
application of model-based techniques in industry and society.
*   You have the ability to set up an independent line of research, and 
successfully apply for external funding.

What we have to offer
=====================
*   employment: 0.8 - 1.0 FTE;
*   in addition to the salary: an 8% holiday allowance and an 8.3% 
end-of-year bonus;
*   You will be appointed as Assistant Professor 2 level and if 
successful will end with a permanent position at an Assistant Professor 
1 level;
*   The tenure track runs six years, with an interim evaluation after 
three years, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures of the 
Faculty of Science;
*   On campus day care facilities for all children of the age 0-4 years 
are available, next to our science faculty buildings. Parents are 
entitled to partly paid parental leave and Radboud University employees 
enjoy flexibility in the way they structure their work;
*   This flexibility extends to the conditions of employment and some 
aspects of the conditions of employment can be fine-tuned to the 
employee’s wishes. Options include (for instance) a tax-free 
reimbursement for a bicycle or a membership in a fitness club;
*   You will be able to make use of our Dual Career Service where our 
Dual Career Officer will assist with family related support, such as 
child care, and help your partner prepare for the local labour market 
and with finding an occupation.
