Subject: [Caml-list] FMCAD Student Forum: DEADLINE EXTENDED

CALL FOR PAPERS


International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD)
STUDENT FORUM
San Jose, California, USA, Oct 22 - 25, 2019 
https://fmcad.forsyte.at/FMCAD19/student-forum/

IMPORTANT DATES

Paper submission: August 1, 2019 (EXTENDED)
Notification: August 18, 2019

All deadlines are 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth)

FMCAD Tutorial Day: Oct 22, 2019
Regular Program: Oct 23 - 25, 2019

GOALS AND FORMAT

Student Forum provides a platform for students at any career stage 
(undergraduate or graduate) to introduce their research to the wider 
Formal Methods community and solicit feedback. The event will consist of 
short presentations by the student authors of each accepted submission 
and of a poster that will be on display throughout the duration of 
the conference. All participants of the conference are encouraged to 
attend the talks and approach the students during the poster presentation.

Accepted submissions will be listed in the description of Student Forum
in the conference proceedings. The authors will also have the option to 
upload their poster and presentation to the FMCAD web site. Submissions
will not appear in the FMCAD proceedings; thus, the presentation at 
Student Forum should not interfere with potential future submissions 
of this research (to FMCAD or elsewhere).

TRAVEL AWARDS

Most of the applicants will receive up to $1000 of travel reimbursement 
after the conference. The first author of each contribution will be given 
priority over other authors. Please make sure you hold on to all receipts 
for reimbursement. Further instructions on how to apply for travel grants 
will be on the website.

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions for the event must be short reports describing research ideas or
ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must be within the
scope of FMCAD. These reports will NOT be published, thus we welcome reports
based on already submitted/published papers. However, the novel aspects to 
be addressed in future work must be clearly described. All submissions will 
be reviewed by a subgroup of FMCAD program committee members.

Submissions should use the IEEE Transactions format on letter-size paper 
with a 10-point font size and be 2 pages long including all figures and 
references. Please submit using the EasyChair system: 

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmcad2019

Advice: Focus on the key idea and try to convey it to the reader in an 
intuitive way. Provide a clear motivation and emphasize novel concepts/
contributions. Avoid unnecessary notational clutter unless it is a widely 
used formalism and helps to make the paper more concise and clear. Only 
describe related work that is absolutely crucial to your contribution: the 
limited space available should be used to present your work.

CONFERENCE SCOPE

FMCAD 2019 is the nineteenth in a series of conferences on the theory and
applications of formal methods in hardware and system verification. FMCAD
provides a leading forum to researchers in academia and industry for
presenting and discussing groundbreaking methods, technologies, theoretical
results, and tools for reasoning formally about computing systems. FMCAD
covers formal aspects of computer-aided system design including verification,
specification, synthesis, and testing.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Model checking, theorem proving, equivalence checking, abstraction and
  reduction, compositional methods, decision procedures at the bit- and
  word-level, probabilistic methods, combinations of deductive methods
  and decision procedures.

- Synthesis and compilation for computer system descriptions, modeling,
  specification, and implementation languages, formal semantics of
  languages and their subsets, model-based design, design derivation and
  transformation, correct-by-construction methods.

- Application of formal and semi-formal methods to functional and
  non-functional specification and validation of hardware and software,
  including timing and power modeling, verification of computing systems
  on all levels of abstraction, system-level design and verification for
  embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, automotive systems and other
  safety-critical systems, hardware-software co-design and verification,
  and transaction-level verification.

- Experience with the application of formal and semi-formal methods to
  industrial-scale designs; tools that represent formal verification
  enablement, new features, or a substantial improvement in the automation
  of formal methods.

- Application of formal methods to verifying safety, connectivity and
  security properties of networks, distributed systems, smart contracts,
  blockchains, and IoT devices.
